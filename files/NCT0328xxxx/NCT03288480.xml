      Study PT-112-102, a multicenter, open-label dose-finding and pharmacokinetic study of PT-112&#xD;
      in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is designed as a two-part study. In the first part of the study, cohorts of three&#xD;
      patients (expanded to six patients in the event of a dose-limiting toxicity) will receive&#xD;
      escalating doses of PT-112 until the MTD is reached, based on tolerability observed during&#xD;
      the first 28 days of treatment. In the second part of the study, an expansion cohort of 14&#xD;
      patients will be treated at the recommended dose to confirm the tolerability of treatment and&#xD;
      evaluate evidence of treatment efficacy.&#xD;
