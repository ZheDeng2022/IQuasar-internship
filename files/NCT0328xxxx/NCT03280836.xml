  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators seek to conduct a home based exercise intervention in breast cancer&#xD;
      patients whom elect to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The primary aim of the study is to&#xD;
      determine whether breast cancer patients can be enrolled, randomized, retained, and comply&#xD;
      with exercise program; and, the feasibility of acquiring, managing and analyzing clinical&#xD;
      data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several national and international agencies recommend exercise participation for all persons&#xD;
      following a cancer diagnosis. The current evidence suggests that aerobic exercise training is&#xD;
      safe during primary adjuvant therapy and improves cardiopulmonary function and patient&#xD;
      related outcomes. Cardiopulmonary fitness is highly predictive of overall and cardiovascular&#xD;
      specific mortality in women. Specifically, an increase in cardiopulmonary fitness of&#xD;
      approximately 10% has been associated with a 19% reduction in risk for CV mortality. This is&#xD;
      important as breast cancer patients already present at diagnosis with 31% lower&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary fitness levels compared to healthy age-matched women. This enhanced risk for&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality in breast cancer patients is further compounded by cardiotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy, which causes permanent cardiac damage. Few studies have tested the efficacy of&#xD;
      exercise prescriptions that incorporate high intensity aerobic exercise training in cancer&#xD;
      patients, especially those receiving chemotherapy. Therefore, the investigators seek to&#xD;
      conduct an at home aerobic exercise training intervention in breast cancer patients whom&#xD;
      elect to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;

    <description>All participants randomized to the intervention group will be asked to keep an exercise log with the date, time, average heart rate obtained from a heart rate monitor, duration of workout and stretching, and any comments regarding the workout. Participants will be instructed to bring workout logs to infusion sessions for review. Participants will also wear a Polar Heart Rate monitor (US model RS400, Polar Electro Inc., Lake Success, NY) during exercise to monitor exercise intensity.&#xD;
The aerobic exercise intervention will work toward the target of 75 minutes physical activity per week at 60%-85% of baseline VO2max.</description>
