    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of ciraparantag administered to healthy volunteers anticoagulated with apixaban&#xD;
      measuring clotting times using Whole Blood Clotting Time (WBCT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled assessment of the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of ciraparantag administered to healthy volunteers measuring clotting times using WBCT as&#xD;
      determined by the manual testing method. All subjects will undergo screening up to 36 days&#xD;
      prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled subjects are to receive 10 mg apixaban orally for 3.5 days (every 12 hours on&#xD;
      Days 1-3 and once on the morning of Day 4). On Day 4, subjects who achieve sufficient&#xD;
      anticoagulation (WBCT ≥20% above baseline) are randomized and will receive a single dose of&#xD;
      study drug (ciraparantag or placebo) intravenously (IV) approximately 3 hours after the&#xD;
      apixaban dose, followed by serial testing of manual WBCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are enrolled sequentially into 3 ciraparantag dose cohorts. There will be a safety&#xD;
      review after completion of treatment in one cohort and prior to initiation of treatment in&#xD;
      the subsequent cohort.&#xD;
