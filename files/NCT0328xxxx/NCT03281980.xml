  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burden: In developing countries, an estimated 219 million children do not reach their maximum&#xD;
      potentiality because of poverty and associated risk factors. More than half of the&#xD;
      Bangladeshi children &lt;5 years are at risk for developmental delay due to poverty and&#xD;
      sub-optimal home stimulation. Sometimes poor people become poorer due to catastrophic&#xD;
      expenditure on health care and fall into the vicious cycle of poverty&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge gap: Although, there is evidence that conditional cash transfer helps develop poor&#xD;
      people' health and nutritional status, little is known about the effect of unconditional cash&#xD;
      transfer and health education (HE) programmes along with psychosocial stimulation on&#xD;
      children' cognition and behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: The study will bring an opportunity to evaluate the effect of transferring&#xD;
      unconditional cash and health education programme along with psychosocial stimulation to poor&#xD;
      families under safetynet programme of Bangladesh Govt. in rural areas. The study will also&#xD;
      document direct and indirect cost to measure cost effectiveness that will help in decision&#xD;
      making to implement the project if it shows benefits to children's development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis (if any):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unconditional cash transfer (UCT) and health education (HE) programme will improve&#xD;
           child's cognitive, motor and language development and behaviour compared to no&#xD;
           intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adding psychosocial stimulation to an unconditional cash transfer (UCT) and health&#xD;
           education (HE) programme will will have an additive effect on Childs's cognitive, motor&#xD;
           and language development and behaviour compared to the control groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally the intervention will&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  be cost effective,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduce mothers' depressive symptoms and improve their self esteem&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improve children's growth and household food security status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduce domestic violence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health seeking behaviour and health care expenditure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term goal: our ultimate goal is to find a suitable infrastructure to take to scale early&#xD;
      child development activities for the whole country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: It is a Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial with three-arms (i) UCT+HE+Psychosocial&#xD;
      stimulation (ii) UCT+HE and iii) Comparison group.&#xD;

      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of UCT and HE programme on children's cognitive, motor and language&#xD;

      UCT and HE program on cognitive development and behavior of young children&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure effect of the program on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      cost effectiveness of the intervention mothers'mental health (depression symptoms) and their&#xD;
      self esteem household food security status and children's growth and domestic violence health&#xD;
      care expenditure and health seeking behaviour of the families&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In developing countries, an estimated 250 million children younger than 5 years in low and&#xD;
      middle income countries do not reach their maximum potentiality because of poverty and&#xD;
      associated risk factors. More than half of the Bangladeshi children less than 5 years are at&#xD;
      risk for developmental delay due to poverty and sub-optimal home stimulation. Sometimes poor&#xD;
      people become poorer due to catastrophic expenditure on health care and fall into the vicious&#xD;
      cycle of poverty. Conditional and unconditional cash transfer to the poor mothers has proved&#xD;
      a way of reducing poverty and improving health outcomes for mothers and children worldwide.&#xD;
      Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MoWCA),Government of Bangladesh (GoB) introduced&#xD;
      maternity allowance in the fiscal year 2007-2008. This is an unconditional cash transfer&#xD;
      under safety net program for the poor mothers. The mothers also receive health education&#xD;
      awareness program. The overall objective of the cash and health education training program is&#xD;
      to ensure safety net in terms of morbidity, mortality and welfare during pregnancy and&#xD;
      lactation period for both mother and child. Adding psycho social stimulation to the program&#xD;
      will benefit children's cognition, behavior and nutritional status. On the other hand the&#xD;
      interventions together will address family's food security and mothers' physical and mental&#xD;
      health and self esteem because receiving extra cash as well as education on health and psycho&#xD;
      social stimulation will enhance mothers' capacity in many aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psycho social stimulation alone and along with other health and nutrition programs was found&#xD;
      to be effective for children's cognition and behavior [9-13]. Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT)&#xD;
      alone was also found significantly effective for child development in Mexico. On the other&#xD;
      hand, studies reported that UCT improved other health outcomes and nutrition, but little is&#xD;
      known about the effect of unconditional cash transfer (UCT) along with health education&#xD;
      program and psycho social stimulation on children's cognition and behavior. MoWCA is&#xD;
      transferring cash to poor pregnant mothers along with health education training program under&#xD;
      social safety net program. The present study group plan to conduct a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to document effect of adding psycho social stimulation to the present program on&#xD;
      children's cognition and behavior. 200 mother-child dyads in each arm will be enrolled when&#xD;
      their child is 6-16 months old. The participants of the intervention group will receive&#xD;
      psycho social stimulation fortnightly at home for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, UCT and HE program is a social safety net program under the ministry of Women and&#xD;
      Children Affairs of Bangladesh Government. The outcomes of this program are primarily&#xD;
      maternal and child health and does not directly focus on children's cognition and behavior.&#xD;
      However, social safety net programs may indirectly affect other outcomes like maternal&#xD;
      depressive symptom, violence against women, children's well being, cognition and behavior and&#xD;
      nutrition status for both mother and child. The researchers intend to add psycho social&#xD;
      stimulation in order to trigger the outcomes in terms of children's development. But the&#xD;
      program needs to be cost effective to be scale able in low resources settings. If the&#xD;
      intervention is cost effective, the package may be found attractive by respective policy&#xD;
      makers to improve development of poor children in those settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maternity allowance of taka 500 ($6.25) per month is distributed through commercial&#xD;
      banking system. Health education awareness program is conducted monthly by some Local Non&#xD;
      Government Organizations (LNGOs) and Community Based Organizations (CBOs) on a wide range of&#xD;
      health and social welfare issues. The NGO,/CBOs have their own curriculum approved by MoWCA&#xD;
      for the awareness program. The Local government and community leaders can play an important&#xD;
      role in encouraging the eligible women to participate in the program. Home based psycho&#xD;
      social stimulation will be provided by community female Play leaders having at least 12 years&#xD;
      of education. So the project will build capacity of the community including the Play Leaders&#xD;
      from the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cluster randomized controlled trial with 3 arms: i) Psychosocial stimulation+&#xD;
      Health education program + Unconditional cash transfer ii) Health education program +&#xD;
      Unconditional cash transfer and iii) Comparison arm. The comparison group will consist of&#xD;
      those who are eligible to receive UCT but do not receive it due to resource constraints of&#xD;
      the UCT programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      11 Unions have been selected randomly out of 14 Union at Ullapara, a sub district under&#xD;
      Sirajgonj district in Bangladesh.The old Ward of a Union would be considered as cluster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the Government is providing UCT to 79 mothers in each Union, the research team assume&#xD;
      to get approximately 26 participants in each Ward. 18 participants will be enrolled randomly&#xD;
      from each cluster. Restricted randomization process will be followed. There are three old&#xD;
      Wards in each Union. the each old ward (cluster) will be allocated for each arm randomly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For comparison arm, mother-child dyads will be enrolled from any part of the old Ward until&#xD;
      the required sample size are fulfilled.The eligibility criteria of participants for the&#xD;
      comparison arm would be the same as that for the UCT recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and Project Execution Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to integrate three distinct interventions: i) Maternity allowance ii) Health&#xD;
      education awareness program and iii) Psychosocial stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Maternity Allowance: MoWCA, GoB provides maternity allowance of taka 500 ($6.25) for each&#xD;
      poor pregnant mother up to two years through banking channel under safety net program of the&#xD;
      GoB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Health Education Awareness Program: All mothers receiving maternity allowance receive&#xD;
      various health education training by designated LNGOs/CBOs through MoWCA, GoB funding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Psychosocial stimulation: The participants will receive fortnightly sessions of&#xD;
      psychosocial stimulation at home by community female play leaders for one year. The&#xD;
      curriculum of stimulation is based on improving the mother-child interaction, and providing&#xD;
      developmentally appropriate activities for the child. The curriculum has already been used in&#xD;
      several projects in Bangladesh run by Child Development Unit of icddr,b and has shown&#xD;
      significant benefits to children's development[10-12, 22] and growth[11, 22].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the inter observer reliability coefficient will be more than 0.8 through data collection&#xD;
      training, will be considered that the trainee to be eligible to take part in the test&#xD;
      procedure. Quality of data collection will be checked at the field by supervisors/master&#xD;
      trainers on 10% of the assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be collected from all groups- Group I: UCT+HE Group II: (UCT+HE)+ Psychosocial&#xD;
      stimulation and group III: Comparison. Data will be collected at baseline, end line and some&#xD;
      others monthly to compare the outcome between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Storage Data will be stored in databases saved on icddr,b servers.The databases will be&#xD;
      password protected and only members of the study team and investigators will have access to&#xD;
      the password.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The study requires 200 mother-child dyads in each arm with 11 clusters of 18&#xD;
      participants in each cluster. So in total we will have 600 participants, 33 cluster, 18&#xD;
      participants in each cluster considering 90% power, 5% level of significance, an intraclass&#xD;
      correlation (ICC) of 0.05 and an effect size of previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be checked for normality. Appropriate measures will be taken if there are any&#xD;
      abnormal distributions. Differences between groups in socioeconomic and other background&#xD;
      characteristics will be analyzed using t-test for continuous variables for two groups and a&#xD;
      ANOVAforthree groups. Effect of the interventions will also be measured using&#xD;
      intention-to-treat analysis controlling for the clustering effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to estimate the resources used and costs associated with&#xD;
      interventions. The research team will measure direct and indirect cost of for all the groups.&#xD;
      Average costs per participants will be calculated by multiplying the cost of resource items&#xD;
      by their respective unit costs. The outcomes of the study will be measured. Then the&#xD;
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be used in cost-effectiveness analysis.&#xD;
