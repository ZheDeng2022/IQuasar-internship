    <textblock>
      The incidence of olecranon fractures is 12 per 100.000. Traditionally, isolated olecranon&#xD;
      fractures have been treated with tension band wiring (TBW). There is a trend towards&#xD;
      increased use of plate fixation, though TBW has yielded good and comparable patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes. The latter method is substantially cost-effective, but higher complication reports&#xD;
      have been reported. There are only two randomized controlled trials comparing TBW and plate&#xD;
      fixation, and the literature is inconclusive in which fixation method is preferable in the&#xD;
      treatment of olecranon fractures. In this multi-center trial, adult patients (18-75 years)&#xD;
      with isolated olecranon fractures will be randomized to either TBW or plate fixation.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of proximal ulna fractures is 12 per 100.000, and 10 % of all fractures in the&#xD;
      upper extremity involve the olecranon. There are several systems classifying olecranon&#xD;
      fractures. One of the most frequently used is the Mayo classification system as described by&#xD;
      Cabanela and Morrey. Tension band wiring (TBW) is the most common operative technique for the&#xD;
      treatment of olecranon fractures, and is said to be the gold standard in the treatment of&#xD;
      non-comminuted and minimally comminuted displaced olecranon fractures. Treatment with TBW has&#xD;
      shown good clinical results, but due to the thin layer of tissue overlying the proximal ulna,&#xD;
      hardware issues are common. The frequency of hardware removal following TBW has been reported&#xD;
      as high as 82 %. Only two randomized trials have compared TBW and plate fixation of olecranon&#xD;
      fractures. Hume and Wiss compared TBW with one-third tubular plate fixation. The authors&#xD;
      found no significant functional differences between the treatment methods, but the rate of&#xD;
      symptomatic hardware problems was higher in the group treated with TBW. The authors also&#xD;
      noted that loss of reduction was higher in the TBW group at final follow-up (12 months after&#xD;
      surgery). Duckworth found no difference in patient reported outcome after one year. The&#xD;
      sophistication in plate fixation has evolved since Hume and Wiss published their 25 years&#xD;
      ago. The use of locking stable plate fixation in the treatment of olecranon fractures is&#xD;
      preferred by many surgeons, especially when treating osteoporotic individuals and in cases&#xD;
      with severe fracture fragmentation. Though locking stable implants have shown to improve&#xD;
      fragment fixation in biomechanical and cadaveric studies, better patient reported outcome in&#xD;
      clinical studies has yet to be proven. It is still unclear if all comminuted fractures should&#xD;
      be treated with plate fixation, or if moderately comminuted fractures can be treated with&#xD;
      TBW. Hardware related issues following plate fixation have also been described as a frequent&#xD;
      problem, and rates of hardware removal up to 56 % have been reported. When approaching the&#xD;
      issue of symptomatic hardware problems following TBW and plate fixation, one must take into&#xD;
      consideration that the magnitude of secondary surgery is different. The removal of the two&#xD;
      K-wires is less extensive than removing an angular stable plate fixation. Removal of&#xD;
      symptomatic pin protrusion can be achieved in local anesthesia at the outpatient clinic,&#xD;
      whereas plate removal routinely is done in the operating theatre, and usually requires that&#xD;
      patient is in regional or general anesthesia. Of course, if the wire cerclage has to be&#xD;
      removed in addition to the K-wires, the scope of the procedure is more comparable. There are&#xD;
      strong indications that locking plate fixation yield better results when treating severely&#xD;
      comminuted olecranon fractures, but the investigators do not know if these modern implants&#xD;
      are superior in the treatment of moderately comminuted fractures. Even so, there is a trend&#xD;
      toward treating all comminuted olecranon fractures with plate fixation, but the clinical&#xD;
      evidence supporting this is limited. The investigators believe there is a need for a robust&#xD;
      investigation in the treatment of olecranon fractures to identify the fracture patterns that&#xD;
      adequately can be treated with TBW and the ones that should be treated with locking plate&#xD;
      fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to compare an angular stable plate fixation with TBW in a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled multi-center trial. Our hypothesis is that TBW is non-inferior in the treatment of&#xD;
      Mayo type IIA and IIB fractures compared with an angular stable implant. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure is the Quick Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand outcome measure (QuickDASH) at&#xD;
      12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized, controlled, multicenter trial. Adult patients (18-75 years)&#xD;
      admitted with a displaced olecranon fracture in need of surgery will be randomized to either&#xD;
      TBW or plate fixation. The design is semi-blinded. At follow-up, an independent investigator&#xD;
      will perform an interview and blinded functional examination, followed by an un-blinded&#xD;
      examination and interview. Patients will be recruited at the Oslo University Hospital, and&#xD;
      other hospitals in the region has been invited to participate in the trial. An experienced&#xD;
      trauma surgeon will verify that the fracture meets the inclusion criteria, and the patient&#xD;
      will be given thorough oral and written information. After signed consent, the randomization&#xD;
      allocation to treatment method will be performed by means of a web-solution made by NTNU&#xD;
      WebCRF system with the approval from the OUS Head of Patient Security. To secure an even&#xD;
      dispersion in regard to age of the patients and fracture pattern, the inclusion of study&#xD;
      patients will be stratified. This will achieve an equal randomization dispersion of patients&#xD;
      in in the age interval from 18 to 50 years, and 50 to 75 years. Comminuted and non-comminuted&#xD;
      fracture fractures will be randomized in the same fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis and sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the mean value of QuickDASH following olecranon fracture in a similar population, the&#xD;
      investigators found the standard deviation (SD) to equal 12 points. The minimal clinical&#xD;
      important difference (MCID) has been set to 8 points, and the non-inferiority limit is DASH&#xD;
      reduction of 10 points. Level of significance (Î±) equals 0.05. To prove non-inferiority, a&#xD;
      power of 0.90 and with non-inferiority limit at 10, the number required in each group is 39&#xD;
      patients. Taking into account a predicted loss of patients during follow-up, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to include at least 45 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study patients will be followed-up over a one year period (6 weeks, 12 weeks, 12 months).&#xD;
      The rate of hardware removal in both groups will be recorded, and the indication for removal&#xD;
      (pain, skin protrusion/wound problems, nerve irritation etc.) will be registered and&#xD;
      categorized. All other reoperations will be recorded as well.&#xD;
