      This study evaluates a multi-component communication intervention in the outpatient setting&#xD;
      to strengthen communication among patients being actively treated for breast cancer and their&#xD;
      support network of family members and friends. The intervention comprises: 1.) a&#xD;
      patient-family agenda-setting checklist completed immediately before a regularly scheduled&#xD;
      oncology visit, 2.) facilitated registration for the patient portal (for patient and family&#xD;
      member, as desired by the patient), and 3.) education (as relevant) on access to clinician&#xD;
      electronic visit notes. The study team will conduct a two-group randomized trial to examine&#xD;
      feasibility of the protocol and to compare quality of communication with oncology providers,&#xD;
      understanding of patient's cancer, confidence in managing patient's care and satisfaction&#xD;
      with cancer care between patient-companion dyads who are in the intervention group (n=60) and&#xD;
      patient-companion dyads who receive usual medical oncology care (n=60).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer among survivors in the US. Most patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer receive help from family in making complex decisions about treatment, handling&#xD;
      logistically demanding care coordination, and managing symptoms and side effects. Although&#xD;
      family members (as defined by each patient) play a vital role in cancer care, they are not&#xD;
      formally recognized or assessed in care delivery, and their need for information and support&#xD;
      is typically unmet. Lack of attention to family in care delivery is an important gap that too&#xD;
      often leaves families without adequate information about patient health and treatments. This&#xD;
      may prevent families and patients from engaging in open conversations, cause them unnecessary&#xD;
      anxiety, and negatively affect the quality of cancer care and delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Communication is particularly important in cancer care, as the optimal course of action is&#xD;
      determined through longitudinal discussion of prognosis, treatments, and patient goals,&#xD;
      preferences, and concerns. Strategies to improve communication for serious illnesses such as&#xD;
      cancer have been developed, but typically target a specific decision, conversation, or&#xD;
      setting, most often the inpatient hospital. There is growing agreement that communication&#xD;
      among patients, families, and providers should be initiated early and continue throughout the&#xD;
      disease trajectory. However, little is known about how to provide both patients and families&#xD;
      with access to timely information about patient health and mechanisms to communicate directly&#xD;
      with health care providers, as proposed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to test a multicomponent intervention to strengthen communication&#xD;
      and longitudinal partnerships among women with breast cancer and their family members. Recent&#xD;
      work by the study team has demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, and benefit of&#xD;
      intervention components which will be combined into a single model of care. The study team's&#xD;
      preliminary studies indicate that clarifying patient and family expectations regarding the&#xD;
      role of family and providing family with timely and comprehensive information about patient&#xD;
      health (as desired by the patient) leads to more effective family involvement, more frequent&#xD;
      patient-family-provider interactions, more patient-centered communication, and greater&#xD;
      preparedness to manage care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the feasibility of delivering a multicomponent communication&#xD;
      intervention in the outpatient setting comprising: 1.) a patient-family agenda-setting&#xD;
      checklist completed immediately before a regularly scheduled medical oncology visit with a&#xD;
      participating medical oncologist, 2.) facilitated registration for the patient portal (for&#xD;
      patient and family member, as desired by the patient), and 3.) education (as relevant) on&#xD;
      access to doctor's electronic visit notes. The study will focus on patients who typically&#xD;
      attend medical oncology visits with a family member or trusted friend who are already present&#xD;
      and involved in communication. This study will enroll up to 132 patients who are on active&#xD;
      treatment for breast cancer, up to 132 family member/friend &quot;companions&quot; and up to 14 medical&#xD;
      oncology providers. The study team will compare patients and companions who are in the&#xD;
      intervention group (n=60 dyads) with patients and companions who are in the control group and&#xD;
      receive usual medical oncology care (n=60 dyads). This study will compare quality of&#xD;
      communication with medical oncology providers, understanding of patient's cancer, confidence&#xD;
      in managing patient's care, satisfaction with cancer care, and symptoms of anxiety after 3&#xD;
      months, 9 months, and 12 months of follow-up.&#xD;

    <measure>Between-group Differences in Patient Complete Illness Understanding at 9-months</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Illness understanding was measured by 4 questions regarding knowledge that is considered to be essential to making informed treatment decisions in serious illness, including: 1.) understanding of illness, 2.) knowledge of disease status, 3.) awareness of disease state, and 4.) expectation of duration of life. We summed responses to each item (coded 1 or 0 to reflect the presence or absence of understanding), yielding a score ranging from 0 to 4. Participants with perfect scores reflecting complete illness understanding (4 of 4 correct responses) were compared to all others.</description>

    <measure>Between-group Differences in Mean Patient Satisfaction With Cancer Care at 9-months</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome was measured with the short-form 10-item version of the Family Satisfaction with Cancer Care (FAMCARE) questionnaire, a validated multi-item instrument that was developed to assess family perspective on cancer care. Respondents are asked to rate 10 items that relate to emotional support, personalization of care, support of decision-making, accessibility, and coordination. Response categories include &quot;very satisfied&quot; (2 points), &quot;satisfied&quot; (1 point), or &quot;not satisfied&quot; (0 points), and the 10-items may be summed to yield a total score (range: 0 to 20) with higher scores reflecting greater satisfaction.</description>

    <ipd_description>This research involves the collection of data and identifying information from approximately 278 diverse study participants including up to 14 medical oncology clinicians, 132 breast cancer patients, and 132 family member or friend companions. The final dataset will include self-reported demographic and health status measures, information from electronic health records, and information about participant experiences. Even though the final dataset will be stripped of identifying information prior to analysis, the study team believes that there remains a possibility of deductive disclosure of subjects. Upon written request from members of the research community, the following resources will be shared: documentation of the process for accessing the study data and constructing the analytic dataset; the codebook for the master analytic dataset; the analytic plan for each study aim; the algorithms used for measurement of outcome variables; surveys and questionnaires.</ipd_description>

        <title>Between-group Differences in Patient Complete Illness Understanding at 9-months</title>
        <description>Illness understanding was measured by 4 questions regarding knowledge that is considered to be essential to making informed treatment decisions in serious illness, including: 1.) understanding of illness, 2.) knowledge of disease status, 3.) awareness of disease state, and 4.) expectation of duration of life. We summed responses to each item (coded 1 or 0 to reflect the presence or absence of understanding), yielding a score ranging from 0 to 4. Participants with perfect scores reflecting complete illness understanding (4 of 4 correct responses) were compared to all others.</description>

        <description>Outcome was measured with the short-form 10-item version of the Family Satisfaction with Cancer Care (FAMCARE) questionnaire, a validated multi-item instrument that was developed to assess family perspective on cancer care. Respondents are asked to rate 10 items that relate to emotional support, personalization of care, support of decision-making, accessibility, and coordination. Response categories include &quot;very satisfied&quot; (2 points), &quot;satisfied&quot; (1 point), or &quot;not satisfied&quot; (0 points), and the 10-items may be summed to yield a total score (range: 0 to 20) with higher scores reflecting greater satisfaction.</description>

        <description>Illness understanding was measured by 4 questions regarding knowledge that is considered to be essential to making informed treatment decisions in serious illness, including: 1.) understanding of illness, 2.) knowledge of disease status, 3.) awareness of disease state, and 4.) expectation of duration of life. We summed responses to each item (coded 1 or 0 to reflect the presence or absence of understanding), yielding a score ranging from 0 to 4. Participants with perfect scores reflecting complete illness understanding (4 of 4 correct responses) were compared to all others.</description>
