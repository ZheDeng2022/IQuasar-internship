  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with locally advanced hormone receptor positive (HR+)/HER2- breast cancer,&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy produces a pathologic complete response rate (pCR) of only 9-15%,&#xD;
      and late recurrences often occur despite neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, there is an&#xD;
      unmet clinical need to improve the outcomes of these patients. Tumor-associated macrophages&#xD;
      (TAM) infiltration leads to poor outcomes in breast cancer patients by promoting&#xD;
      angiogenesis, activating epithelial-mesenchymal transition, degrading the extracellular&#xD;
      matrix, and suppressing the anti-tumor immune response. Pre-clinical studies, as summarized&#xD;
      above, have shown that the breast cancer immune microenvironment may be reprogrammed by&#xD;
      targeting colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) to decrease TAM infiltration and increase CD8+&#xD;
      TIL infiltration, in order to foster antitumor immunity and improve response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, the investigators propose a phase I dose-escalation study in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced HR+/HER2- breast cancer to determine the feasibility of adding MCS110, a CSF-1&#xD;
      inhibitor, to the standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen of dose-dense doxorubicin,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel. The investigators will also include a dose expansion&#xD;
      cohort for preliminary efficacy analysis and correlative studies. The investigators propose&#xD;
      that if they can decrease the TAM-induced immunosuppression and TAM-induced chemoresistance&#xD;
      observed in breast cancer patients, then the patients' own immune system could find and&#xD;
      destroy the dormant and resistant tumor cells, and combined with enhanced chemotherapy&#xD;
      efficacy, the investigators will see durable remissions and long term cures.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Completion of cycle 1 (28 days) for all patients</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level at which &lt;1 patients of a cohort (of 3 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first cycle.&#xD;
A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value of CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications that occurs within the first cycle of treatment with the combination treatment and meets any of the criteria outlined.</description>

    <measure>Pathologic complete response-rate (pCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of surgery (approximately 20 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>-Pathologic complete response (pCR) is defined as no histology evidence of invasive tumor cells in the surgical breast specimen and sentinel or axillary lymph nodes. All eligible patients who have completed neoadjuvant therapy and have subsequently undergone surgery are included in the analysis of pCR.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Residual invasive tumor size (RITS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of surgery (approximately 20 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>-Residual invasive tumor size (RITS) is histopathologically assessed by the largest dimension of the dominant invasive tumor focus from the surgical specimen. In cases in which there was no residual invasive tumor, the RITS will be 0 mm. In cases in which multifocal pathology is present, the largest dimension of the residual invasive tumor focus will be recorded.</description>
