  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A laproscopic imaging tecgnology that uses a synthetic agent to detect ovarian and pancreatic&#xD;
      cancers at an early stage so that patients can get treatment early and prevent the disease&#xD;
      from advancing to late stage leading to fatality or recurrence.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current methods of imaging techniques, CT, MRI and PET, fail to detect moderate volume of&#xD;
      diffuse intraperitoneal tumor and provide limited functional information. White light&#xD;
      laproscopy is capable of detecting small volume disease in only half of patients in clinical&#xD;
      remission, missing occult disease in 30% of this patient population. In this study, a&#xD;
      synthetic agent VM110 is to be tested for its ability to detect occult ovarian and pancreatic&#xD;
      cancers. The agent is cleaved by proteases, cathepsin B, L, and S and plasmin in cancer cells&#xD;
      and the fluorescent cleavage product is detected by near infra red imaging probe. High&#xD;
      sensitivity of visualizaion of cancer cells can help detect sub-clinical disease otherwise&#xD;
      unidentifiable by usual methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the safety and toxicity of escalating doses of VM110 administered IV&#xD;
           prior to laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To define the appropriate dose of VM110 for use in future trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To define the preliminary efficacy: the optimal dose of VM110 in detection of&#xD;
           microscopic peritoneal tumor at laparoscopy not visible with standard white light&#xD;
           laparoscopy. Areas visible with both standard white light and NIRF light, and areas&#xD;
           visible only with NIRF light will be biopsied. Data from pathologic evaluation of these&#xD;
           specimens will be used to determine the efficacy of VM110 with respect to its ability to&#xD;
           detect occult disease not visible with standard white light&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Estimate sensitivity and specificity of VM110 detection&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Perform correlative pharmacologic and histopathological analyses&#xD;

             radiologic evidence of disease&#xD;
