  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By doing this study, the investigator hopes to learn how the levels of important proteins&#xD;
      involved in inflammation change over time in patients with acute brain injury. The total&#xD;
      amount of time participants will be asked to volunteer for this study is approximately two&#xD;
      hours over a five day period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This pilot project is a prospective, observational study in 20 patients who are admitted to&#xD;
      University of Kentucky (UK) Chandler Medical Center with a diagnosis of severe,&#xD;
      non-penetrating traumatic brain injury (TBI) or aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adult participants with a primary diagnosis of severe, non-penetrating TBI or aSAH who&#xD;
      are admitted to the neuroscience or trauma intensive care units will be screened for&#xD;
      potential inclusion into this study. Once a potential participant is identified, the&#xD;
      legally-authorized representative will be approached for study consent and HIPAA&#xD;
      authorization. If the participant regains consent capacity before the end of the&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection period, assent will be obtained from the research&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, up to 5 small samples of CSF, will be carefully removed from the&#xD;
      device, already in place, that drains excess CSF from the participant's head. The samples&#xD;
      will be less than 1 teaspoon (&lt; 5 mL) each. These samples will be frozen and stored until&#xD;
      samples from approximately 20 participants have been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These samples will then be prepared and sent to a research laboratory to analyze the proteins&#xD;
      in the samples collected from each research participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the results of this study will not affect the treatment participants receive in or&#xD;
      outside of the hospital, the investigator will not share the results of this study with the&#xD;
      participant, their doctor or their family member(s).&#xD;
