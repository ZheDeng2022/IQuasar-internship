  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase Ib/II, open label, multi-center, randomized study designed to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of immunotherapy-based&#xD;
      treatment combinations in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic G/GEJ&#xD;
      cancer (hereafter referred to as gastric cancer) and esophageal cancer. Two cohorts of&#xD;
      patients with gastric cancer have been enrolled in parallel in this study: the second-line&#xD;
      (2L) Gastric Cancer Cohort consists of patients with gastric cancer who have progressed after&#xD;
      receiving a platinum-containing or fluoropyrimide-containing chemotherapy regimen in the&#xD;
      first-line setting, and the first-line (1L) Gastric Cancer Cohort consists of patients with&#xD;
      gastric cancer who have not received prior chemotherapy in this setting. In each cohort,&#xD;
      eligible patients will be assigned to one of several treatment arms. Additionally, a cohort&#xD;
      of patients with esophageal cancer who have not received prior systemic treatment for their&#xD;
      disease will be enrolled in this study. Eligible patients will be randomized to chemotherapy&#xD;
      or the combination of chemotherapy with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy.&#xD;
