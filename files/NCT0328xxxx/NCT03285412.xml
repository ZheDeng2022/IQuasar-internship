      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a study with endocrine therapy and CDK 4/6 inhibitor (ribociclib) for&#xD;
      early breast cancer. There is no placebo in this study. The study has two components -&#xD;
      pre-screening with ctDNA to detect minimal residual disease (pre-screening), and treatment&#xD;
      with ribociclib in combination with endocrine therapy (main portion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved ribociclib in combination with&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitors as a treatment option for advanced/metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating efficacy of ribociclib in patients&#xD;
      who have MRD based on ctDNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ribociclib is a drug designed to block certain proteins called cyclin-dependent protein&#xD;
      kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6). These proteins are needed for cells to divide and may also control&#xD;
      the ability of certain cancers to grow. The investigators believe that ribociclib may stop&#xD;
      the participant cancer cells from growing and dividing by blocking these CDK4/6 proteins.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known brain metastases, or any other metastases from cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers&#xD;
             of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing,&#xD;
             it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as&#xD;
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as&#xD;
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the&#xD;
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of&#xD;
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements. Patient has impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI&#xD;
             disease that may significantly alter the absorption of the study drugs (e.g.,&#xD;
             ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome,&#xD;
             or small bowel resection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or cardiac repolarization&#xD;
             abnormality including any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of angina pectoris, symptomatic pericarditis, coronary artery bypass&#xD;
                  graft (CABG) or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Documented cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) &lt;50% as determined by Multiple Gated&#xD;
                  acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO) detected during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of cardiac failure, significant/symptomatic bradycardia, Long QT&#xD;
                  syndrome, family history of idiopathic sudden death or congenital long QT&#xD;
                  syndrome or any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known risk to prolong the QT interval or induce Torsade's de Pointes.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncorrected hypomagnesemia or hypokalemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) &gt;160 mmHg or &lt;90 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bradycardia (heart rate &lt;50 at rest), by ECG or pulse.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  On screening, inability to determine the QTcF interval on the ECG (i.e.:&#xD;
                  unreadable or not interpretable) or QTcF &gt;450 screening ECG (based on a mean of 3&#xD;
                  ECGs).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity to ribociclib or any of its components.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible. These&#xD;
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the safety of ribociclib is not&#xD;
             established in pregnant women. For this reason and because CDK4/6 agents as well as&#xD;
             other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for&#xD;
             the duration of treatment, and for at least 3 months after the completion of&#xD;
             treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Prior&#xD;
             to study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy&#xD;
             during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional&#xD;
             pregnancy. In addition, men enrolled on this study should understand the risks to any&#xD;
             sexual partner of childbearing potential. All WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy&#xD;
             test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of the investigational&#xD;
             agent(s). Registration may occur prior to this pregnancy test. If the pregnancy test&#xD;
             is positive, the patient must not receive protocol treatment and must not be enrolled&#xD;
             in the study. WOCBP is defined as follows: Any female who has experienced menarche and&#xD;
             who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation, or a bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea&#xD;
             &gt; 12 consecutive months, or women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with documented&#xD;
             plasma follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt; 35 mIU/ml). Even women who are using&#xD;
             oral, implanted, or injectable contraceptive hormones or mechanical products&#xD;
             (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy or practicing abstinence or&#xD;
             where partner is sterile (e.g. vasectomy), should be considered to be a WOCBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception&#xD;
             throughout the study and for 8 weeks after study drug discontinuation. Women are&#xD;
             considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12&#xD;
             months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g.&#xD;
             age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.&#xD;
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child&#xD;
             bearing potential. Highly effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before&#xD;
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement&#xD;
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of&#xD;
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for&#xD;
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same&#xD;
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment. Note: While oral&#xD;
                  contraceptives are allowed, they should be used in conjunction with a barrier&#xD;
                  method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction&#xD;
