      Comparing the cardio-respiratory adaptation and differences to non invasive ventilation&#xD;
      techniques, nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) non synchronized vs&#xD;
      synchronized (SNIPPV) in preterm newborns (gestational age at birth &lt; 32 weeks) at their&#xD;
      first approach to non invasive ventilation as first intention (soon after birth) or after&#xD;
      extubation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory problems are one of the major issues to deal with in preterm newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the immaturity of respiratory mechanisms and structures, the use of supporting&#xD;
      devices is often necessary. These include both conventional mechanical ventilation (MV)&#xD;
      techniques, which require the use of an endotracheal tube, as well as non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation (NIV) techniques that use softer ventilator-patient interfaces. Increasing&#xD;
      attention is payed to the latter ones as less aggressive and associated with better outcomes&#xD;
      both in terms of mortality and short and long-term complications, such as bronchopulmonary&#xD;
      dysplasia (BPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is a NIV technique in which newborn&#xD;
      airways are kept open between two pressure levels: peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and&#xD;
      positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP). The frequency and duration of each phase are defined&#xD;
      by setting the inspiratory and expiratory times or the ventilation rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technique has already shown its superiority in terms of reduced duration of MV, reduced&#xD;
      necessity of intubation, decreased failure of extubating and reduced prevalence of BPD if&#xD;
      compared with non-invasive techniques based on continuous pressure support, such as&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Recent meta-analyses of studies where NIPPV has&#xD;
      been used as an alternative to CPAP following extubation show that it reduces need for&#xD;
      re-ventilation and air leaks but without any reduction in BPD: there is insufficient evidence&#xD;
      to recommend NIPPV as primary mode of respiratory support in the delivery room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be specified that the ventilation rate on NIPPV does not reflect the real&#xD;
      respiratory rate (RR) of the newborn, as the ventilator supplies the PIP regardless of&#xD;
      newborn respiratory efforts. To reproduce a more physiological and gentle ventilation new&#xD;
      devices able to detect newborn respiratory efforts and consequently supply a PIP have been&#xD;
      developed to synchronize the ventilation rate with RR of the newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The devices used for synchronization can identify newborn respiratory effort by detecting&#xD;
      variation in flow or pressure. While in MV the exact beginning of inspiration can be detected&#xD;
      through a continuous monitoring of pressure or through the precise interception of&#xD;
      inspiratory and expiratory flow some difficulties occur in NIV where, as a consequence of the&#xD;
      impossibility to detect expiratory flow, the moment of the exact beginning of spontaneous&#xD;
      inspiration is hard to identify.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a new type of NIV ventilator equipped with a pressure sensor has been put on the&#xD;
      market. The software of this ventilator is able to calculate the flow according to the&#xD;
      pressure variations of the circuit and to capture the flow variations induced by spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing allowing a synchronization of the flow with the patient's respiratory acts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a synchronized NIV technique would allow a more physiological respiratory support,&#xD;
      reducing respiratory fatigue and improving newborn compliance. Despite these premises, the&#xD;
      diffusion of synchronized NIPPV in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and works on its&#xD;
      efficacy are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some authors have already demonstrated the benefits of using a synchronized NIV technique in&#xD;
      terms of extubating success rate, BPD prevalence and mortality and neurocognitive&#xD;
      development. Synchronized NIPPV (SNIPPV) seems more effective than NIPPV and NCPAP in&#xD;
      reducing need for intubation in respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), in improving the success&#xD;
      of extubation and in treating apnea of prematurity, with a reassuring absence of relevant&#xD;
      side effects. Synchronised NIPPV delivered through a ventilator can reduce extubation failure&#xD;
      but may not confer long-term advantages such as reduction in BPD. Other reported advantageous&#xD;
      aspects of SNIPPV include improved thoraco-abdominal synchrony, reduced work of breathing&#xD;
      (WOB) and reduced need of intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has already been shown that SNIPPV is more effective than NIPPV and CPAP in reducing the&#xD;
      number of desaturations and apnoea in preterm infants undergoing CPAP treatment for&#xD;
      prematurity apnoea. However, the effectiveness of SNIPPV compared to NIPPV in preterm infants&#xD;
      with respiratory distress is still not completely clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study protocol was designed to evaluate the short-term effects of SNIPPV vs NIPPV on the&#xD;
      major cardio-respiratory variables, trying to identify the best ventilation modality for&#xD;
      preterm newborns at their first approach to NIV ventilation support, on the bases of&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory events reduction and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF PATIENTS The number of patients to be enrolled is calculated based on a predicted&#xD;
      difference of 30% in cardio-respiratory events between the two ventilation modalities.&#xD;
      Assuming a mean of 5 and a SD of 1.5 events/hour (based on available literature data), the&#xD;
      number of patients to be enrolled is 30, to obtain an 80% power and a significance threshold&#xD;
      of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN The decision to use a NIV support is based on clinical evaluation. At starting&#xD;
      of NIV, eligible patients will be allocated to one of the two arms (NIPPV or SNIPPV) by block&#xD;
      randomization. A custom software will be used to obtain a casual sequence to randomize&#xD;
      patients in both arms, creating a balance between patients needing NIV as first intention or&#xD;
      after extubating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 2 hours of stabilization (stabilization phase) in NIV, enrolled patients will be&#xD;
      alternatively ventilated with 2 different techniques for 2 time frame of 4 hours each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of needing surfactant, the stabilization phase will be 4 hours after its&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants will be kept supine throughout the study. During the whole study duration (including&#xD;
      stabilization phase) all patients will be continuously monitored with a multiparametric&#xD;
      monitor, recording also data from the ventilator. The first hour of each NIPPV/SNIPPV phase&#xD;
      will be considered as wash-out phase and named &quot;adaptation phase&quot;: data recorded during this&#xD;
      phase are excluded from the analysis. Milk meals will be administered during the adaptation&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain and compliance scales will be filled in by nurses every 60 minutes. EGA values will be&#xD;
      recorded at the end of the stabilization phase, at the end of Phase A (first NIV modality)&#xD;
      and Phase B (second NIV modality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will considered drop out of the study in case of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. NIV failure criteria: FiO2 &gt; 40%, pH &lt; 7.2, pCO2 &gt; 65mmHg, ≥ 3 episodes of desaturations&#xD;
           (transcutaneous O2 saturation (SatO2 TC) &lt; 80%) per hour, ≥ 3 episodes of apnea (&gt; 20 s)&#xD;
           and/or bradycardia (heart rate (HR) &lt; 80 beats per minute (bpm)) per hour, Silverman&#xD;
           score &gt;6. Necrotizing enterocolitis, bowel perforation, and hemodynamic instability as&#xD;
           indications of NIV failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Air leak syndrome (i.e. pneumothorax)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Needing of invasive procedures during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Needing of surfactant during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Development of hemodynamic instability or surgical problems during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Death Data obtained from dropouts (patients who drop out of the study) will be analyzed&#xD;
           separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 8 hours of study, each patient will be ventilated with the best NIV modality according&#xD;
      to clinical data and cardio-respiratory parameters observed during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MONITORING Nurse staff will continuously monitor patients to avoid biases due to device wrong&#xD;
      positioning&#xD;

&#xD;
      Tolerance to each of the two NIV modalities will be evaluated by evaluating the number of&#xD;
      failure episodes and of cardio-respiratory events and analysing the scores for individual&#xD;
      compliance and pain. The individual need for oxygen under the two modalities of NIV will be&#xD;
      evaluated as a known risk factor for premature retinopathy and various other complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANLYSES Descriptive variables will be analyzed in function of their distribution.&#xD;
      T student test or Mann Whitney U test in case of continuous variables (if normally or not&#xD;
      normally distributed respectively) and chi-squared or fisher test for qualitative ones. All&#xD;
      test will be two-sided with a significance threshold of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS Identifying the best NIV modality for preterm newborns at their first&#xD;
      approach to NIV ventilation support, on the bases of cardio-respiratory events reduction and&#xD;
      fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) request.&#xD;
