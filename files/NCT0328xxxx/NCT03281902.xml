      This research trial studies genetic profiles in blood and tumor samples from patients with&#xD;
      estrogen receptor positive and HER2 negative breast cancer that has spread to other places in&#xD;
      the body who are receiving palbociclib and endocrine therapy. Examining the genetic changes&#xD;
      associated with the cancer and comparing the genetic material from the cancer tissue with the&#xD;
      genetic material found in the blood may help doctors to develop customized treatment for&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify novel genomic variants and pathways associated with baseline, as well as the&#xD;
      change in serum thymidine kinase (TK1) levels (measured pre-registration, after two cycles,&#xD;
      and at disease progression) among women with advanced hormone receptor (HR) positive breast&#xD;
      cancer treated with palbociclib and endocrine therapy (ET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To generate patient derived xenograft (PDX)s and organoids from tumor biopsies obtained at&#xD;
      pre-registration, at 2 months, and at disease progression, to test novel endocrine therapy&#xD;
      combinations. (PDX Aim) II. To test whether PDX engraftment is associated with progression&#xD;
      free survival. (PDX Aim) Sequencing Aims III. to describe changes in the genomic landscape of&#xD;
      HR-positive HER2-negative advanced breast cancer by comparing sequencing data&#xD;
      (deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] and ribonucleic acid [RNA]) from preregistration archival breast&#xD;
      primary tumors (when available), with tumor biopsies obtained preregistration, after two&#xD;
      months on study, and at disease progression on palbociclib and ET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate whether genomic variants and pathways (measured using DNA and RNA sequencing&#xD;
      at pre-registration and after two months of treatment) are associated with 1) PFS; 2)&#xD;
      baseline and changes in serum TK1. (Sequencing Aim) V. To tabulate the number of patients who&#xD;
      have targetable mutations found in the preregistration tumor biopsy and to record their&#xD;
      subsequent treatment regimen following progression on palbociclib and ET. (Sequencing Aim)&#xD;
      VI. To compare and contrast the actionable genomic alterations found in cfDNA or CTC derived&#xD;
      DNA that are not found in tumor tissue. (Sequencing Aim) VII. To assess whether genetic&#xD;
      alterations known to be associated with endocrine monotherapy resistance are seen in&#xD;
      circulating tumor- DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cell (CTC) derived DNA. (Sequencing Aim)&#xD;
      VIII.To determine whether use of a 3D micro cancer model, combined with sequencing data from&#xD;
      tumor biopsies, ctDNA and PDXs collected at the time of disease progression, can be used to&#xD;
      personalize future treatment options for PROMISE participants. (Sequencing Aim) IX. To&#xD;
      compare the changes in Ki67 levels (by immunohistochemistry [IHC]) and serum TK1 levels after&#xD;
      2 months of treatment. (Proliferative biomarker aim) X. To assess whether the change in Ki67&#xD;
      and serum TK1 levels after 2 months of treatment with palbociclib and ET is associated with&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS) outcomes. (Proliferative biomarker aim) XI. To assess whether&#xD;
      high baseline serum TK1 levels (&gt; 200 Du/L) are associated with PFS outcomes. (Proliferative&#xD;
      biomarker aim) XII. To assess whether an increase in TK1 between 2 months and 12 months is&#xD;
      associated with PFS. (Proliferative biomarker aim) XIII. To assess the change in EMT marker&#xD;
      expression (e.g. Vimentin, SLUG and E-cadherin) and serum TK1 after two months of treatment&#xD;
      with palbociclib and ET. (EMT aim) XIV. To determine the association between the expression&#xD;
      of EMT markers and Ki67 levels after two months of treatment with palbociclib and ET. (EMT&#xD;

      there is a change in the level of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) observed in archival&#xD;
      tumor, at pre-registration, at 2 months, and at disease progression on palbociclib and ET.&#xD;
      (Immune aim) XVII. To assess the change in TILs (including CD8, PD-L1, and FOXP3) after 2&#xD;
      months of treatment with palbociclib and ET. (Immune aim) XVIII. To assess the association&#xD;

      on palbociclib and ET. (Immune aim) XIX. To characterize and evaluate changes in the immune&#xD;
      landscape of HR+ HER2 -MBC using serial biopsies obtained pre-registration, at 2 months, and&#xD;
      at disease progression (as well as archived primary tumor when available) using digital&#xD;
      spatial profiling (DSP) (NanoString GeoMx platform) . (Immune aim) XX. To assess, by use of&#xD;
      mass cytometry (CyTOF), whether i) peripheral blood immune markers obtained pretreatment are&#xD;
      associated with either TK1 or PFS and ii) whether the changes in peripheral blood immune&#xD;
      markers after 2 cycles of treatment are associated with changes in serum TK1 levels. (Immune&#xD;
      aim) XXI. To discover putative mechanistic connections underlying bacteria-drug interactions&#xD;
      in all patients. (Microbiome aim) XXII. To identify the biomolecular features within the gut&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patents undergo collection of blood and stool samples at baseline, 7 days after letrozole&#xD;
      monotherapy treatment, and at completion of each cycle, urine samples at baseline and&#xD;
      completion of each cycle, and saliva samples at baseline. Patients also undergo collection of&#xD;
