  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemodiafiltration (HDF) is a choice of treatment modalities for patients with end-stage renal&#xD;
      disease. Hemodiafiltration, combining diffusion and convection, may increase removal of large&#xD;
      and middle molecule uremic toxins comparing to conventional hemodialysis. The techniques of&#xD;
      hemodiafiltration include pre-dilution and post-dilution according to the infusion site of&#xD;
      substitution fluid. Post-dilution HDF is most widely used because of higher removal rate of&#xD;
      uremic toxins. However, hemoconcentration and clotting of membrane limit its further&#xD;
      clearance of toxins. Pre-dilution may preserve membrane permeability and maintain hemodynamic&#xD;
      status. Although lower clearance of small molecule uremic toxins, one study in Japan showed&#xD;
      survival benefits of pre-dilution HDF, comparing to post-dilution HDF. The aim of this study&#xD;
      was to compare pre-dilution and post-dilution HDF in terms of their clinical and biological&#xD;
      parameters and clearance of uremic toxins by using cross-over study design.&#xD;

      1. Study design: randomly assigned, cross-over study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient number: 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Inclusion criteria: stable patients end-stage renal disease who were older than 20 years&#xD;
           and received thrice-weekly standard hemodialysis for more than 3 months were recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Exclusion criteria: active systemic disease, liver cirrhosis, active malignancy,&#xD;
           receiving immunosuppressive treatment, dialysis with temporal non-tunneled catheter,&#xD;
           inadequate dialysis dose (single-pooled Kt/V&lt;1.2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prior to randomization, a Charlson Comorbidity Index score and baseline characteristics&#xD;
           are recorded for each patient. Each patient who received HDF prior to study will&#xD;
           received one-month high-flux hemodialysis with target single-pooled Kt/V&gt;1.2 for&#xD;
           washout. The baseline characteristics of each patient including dialyzer, dialysis time,&#xD;
           blood flow, dialysate flow, replacement volume, pre- and post-dialysis blood pressure&#xD;
           and body weight were recorded. The follow-up laboratory data will also be collected:&#xD;
           predialysis C-reactive protein, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, bicarbonate, sodium,&#xD;
           potassium, uric acid, albumin, calcium, phosphate, intact parathyroid hormone,&#xD;
           β2-microglobulin, prolactin, fibroblast growth factor 23, α1-microglobulin, indoxyl&#xD;
           sulfate, p-cresol sulfate, advance oxidation protein products, advance glycation&#xD;
           product, percentage of proinflammatory monocytes; interleukin-6, tumor necrosis&#xD;
           factor-α, hematocrit, transferrin saturation and ferritin. Urea kinetics including kt/V,&#xD;
           Urea reduction ratio and normalized protein catabolic rate are calculated. We also used&#xD;
           Physical Symptoms Distress Scale for life quality measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After randomization, two group received standard prescription of pre- and post-dilution&#xD;
           HDF. The prescribed convective volume per treatment of post-dilution mode is based on&#xD;
           blood flow, filtration fraction and hematocrit to achieved current recommendation of 23&#xD;
           liter/1.73m2. The convective volume of pre-dilution mode will be at least twice higher&#xD;
           than the desired dose in post-dilution mode for each patient. After 3-month stable&#xD;
           hemodiafiltration, parameters mentioned above will also be checked. Two group will be&#xD;
           switched for another 3-month course and then switch again. The total following time is&#xD;
           12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Outcome: The primary objective is to compare the removal of a wide spectrum of solutes&#xD;
           such as middle and protein-bound molecules. Secondary outcomes are intradialytic&#xD;
           tolerance, including intradialytic hypotension, cramps and arrhythmia, and life quality&#xD;
           measurements.&#xD;
