  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug that may help decrease the chances of relapse after&#xD;
      Allogeneic Stem Cell transplantation for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. The name of the study drug&#xD;
      involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Ruxolitinib&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ruxolitinib for this&#xD;
      specific disease but it has been approved for other blood diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, investigators are trying to discover if ruxolitinib will decrease&#xD;
      chances of relapse after having an allogeneic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ruxolitinib is a medication that blocks certain proteins called tyrosine kinases.&#xD;
      Specifically, it blocks tyrosine kinases called JAK2. Many cancers have over active &quot;cell&#xD;
      signaling.&quot; What this means is that certain functions in the cancer cells never turn off and&#xD;
      this makes them grow in an uncontrolled way. Ruxolitinib, shuts down the pathway that depends&#xD;
      on the JAK2 tyrosine kinases. The JAK2 pathway is over active with acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;
      Ruxolitinib has also been shown to lower the rates of graft versus host disease, a&#xD;
      complication of transplant. The exact way ruxolitinib does this is not yet clear but it may&#xD;
      have to do with its ability to block the JAK2 pathway since this pathway can also lead to&#xD;
      inflammation in the body.&#xD;
