    <measure>Number of Participants With Remission Based on Modified Mayo Score at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Remission as per modified mayo score was defined as an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1, stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1, and rectal bleeding subscore of 0 at Month 6. Modified mayo score consisted of 3 components: stool frequency subscore, rectal bleeding subscore and endoscopic subscore: higher scores for each score = more severe disease. These scores were summed up to give a total Modified mayo score ranges of 0 to 9; where higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

    <description>Rate was estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curve. Time to loss of remission (flare) (in days) was defined as time from first study drug administration until time of meeting loss of remission criteria based on modified Mayo score. Loss of remission was defined as meeting at least 1 of following 4 criteria: 1) increase from Baseline in rectal bleeding subscore by at least 1 point and increase in endoscopic subscore by at least 1 point; or 2) increase from Baseline in rectal bleeding subscore by at least 2 points and endoscopic subscore &gt;0; or 3) increase in stool frequency subscore by at least 2 points and increase in endoscopic subscore by at least 1 point; or 4) increase in endoscopic subscore by at least 2 points. Modified mayo score consisted of 3 components: stool frequency, rectal bleeding and endoscopic subscores: higher scores for each score=more severe disease.

        <title>Number of Participants With Remission Based on Modified Mayo Score at Month 6</title>
        <description>Remission as per modified mayo score was defined as an endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1, stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1, and rectal bleeding subscore of 0 at Month 6. Modified mayo score consisted of 3 components: stool frequency subscore, rectal bleeding subscore and endoscopic subscore: higher scores for each score = more severe disease. These scores were summed up to give a total Modified mayo score ranges of 0 to 9; where higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

        <description>Rate was estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curve. Time to loss of remission (flare) (in days) was defined as time from first study drug administration until time of meeting loss of remission criteria based on modified Mayo score. Loss of remission was defined as meeting at least 1 of following 4 criteria: 1) increase from Baseline in rectal bleeding subscore by at least 1 point and increase in endoscopic subscore by at least 1 point; or 2) increase from Baseline in rectal bleeding subscore by at least 2 points and endoscopic subscore &gt;0; or 3) increase in stool frequency subscore by at least 2 points and increase in endoscopic subscore by at least 1 point; or 4) increase in endoscopic subscore by at least 2 points. Modified mayo score consisted of 3 components: stool frequency, rectal bleeding and endoscopic subscores: higher scores for each score=more severe disease. All scores were summed up to give total modified mayo score ranges from 0 to 9; higher scores=more severe disease.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Remission Based on Partial Mayo Score at Months 1, 3 and 6</title>
        <description>Remission as per partial mayo score was defined as partial mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0. Partial mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC without endoscopy. It consisted of 3 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding and PGA with each subscore graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. Individual subscores were summed up to give a total partial mayo score ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>
