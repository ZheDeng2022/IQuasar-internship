  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study plants to create a patient registry of patients who present to the&#xD;
      emergency department with signs and symptoms of shock and evaluate the ability of a&#xD;
      multi-step cardiopulmonary ultrasound protocol to determine the need for fluid therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background &amp; Motivation: Non-traumatic shock accounts for millions of emergency department&#xD;
      visits every year and is a significant burden on the health care system making rapid&#xD;
      identification and treatment essential. For decades the Rapid Ultrasound in Shock and&#xD;
      Hypotension (RUSH) exam has been employed to help determine the etiology of non-traumatic&#xD;
      shock in the ED setting. The RUSH exam does not answer other critical questions such as the&#xD;
      need for additional fluid resuscitation. The current study hypothesizes that by include a&#xD;
      step-wise cardiopulmonary algorithm the RUSH exam can be extended (E-RUSH) to accurately&#xD;
      determine the need for additional fluid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Prospective Observational Study in two urban Emergency Departments with a&#xD;
      combined annual census of &gt;111,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: ED patients exhibiting signs of shock definied by a systolic blood pressure &lt; 100&#xD;
      mmhg, MAP &lt; 65, persistent tachycardia, mottled skin, or lactate &gt;2mmol either at&#xD;
      presentation or during ED stay will be included. Exclusion criteria will be inability to&#xD;
      consent, external factors preventing ultrasound examination, age less than 18, pregnancy,&#xD;
      incarceration, arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, or treating physician gestalt that the patient is&#xD;
      not in shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol: The E-RUSH protocol will include ultrasound exams of the IVC, heart and lungs as&#xD;
      described in the RUSH protocol but will also evaluate cardiac output, IVC collapsibility, and&#xD;
      presense of B-lines on lung ultrasound. At the time of ultrasound measuresments a&#xD;
      bioreactance device will be applied. Bioreactance measurements and ultrasound measurement of&#xD;
      cardiac output will be recorded pre and post a passive straight leg raise test. All charts&#xD;
      will be reviewed by two experts who are blinded to ultrasound and bioractance measurements.&#xD;
      When possible the protocol will be repeated 1-2 hours later or after initial interventions in&#xD;
      order to provide trend data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Volume responsivness as assessed by the E-RUSH will be defined a priori using&#xD;
      a step-wise flow diagram that combines IVC, lung and cardiac ejection fraction and output&#xD;
      measurements (see research plan for details). Determination of volume responsiveness by the&#xD;
      bioreactance device will be defined by manufacturer protocal. Determination of volume&#xD;
      responsiveness by expert review will be by a standard abstraction form with agreement of both&#xD;
      expert reviewers. Descriptive statistics will be performed to determine the test&#xD;
      characteristics of the ultrasound protocol to predict volume responsiveness. Given the lack&#xD;
      of a universally agreed upon gold standard for volume responsiveness, we will determine test&#xD;
      characteristics for E-RUSH using the bioreactance device as a reference standard and using&#xD;
      expert review as a second reference standard separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FACILITY RESOURCES The study facilities are in San Diego California, with a combined&#xD;
      emergency department census of over 111,000 patients per year. The emergency departments of&#xD;
      the facilities are equipped with portable bedside ultrasound machines, CT and MRI, 24 hour&#xD;
      laboratory testing and an integrated electronic medical record system. Emergency medicine and&#xD;
      family medicine residents rotate through both emergency departments. Both departments are&#xD;
      stroke receiving centers and level 3 trauma centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Databases An important aspect of the KPSC managed care environment is its integrated&#xD;
      approach to the delivery of medical care. This approach depends on, and therefore&#xD;
      facilitates, the development and maintenance of a large number of databases, linkable through&#xD;
      a unique identification key. These databases include those that track membership, encounters,&#xD;
      laboratory, claims, pharmaceutical dispensations and others. The address information is&#xD;
      annually geo-coded to the census block level, providing linkage to census-based group-level&#xD;
      information about socio-economic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the KPSC clinical operations systems are updated in real-time, facilitating our&#xD;
      ability to create near real-time research databases. Our Membership database captures&#xD;
      demographic (e.g., name, date of birth, gender, race/ethnicity, etc.) and benefit information&#xD;
      for over 12 million active and former members, and is updated on a weekly basis. The&#xD;
      utilization database captures outpatient and hospital encounters (e.g., diagnoses,&#xD;
      procedures, etc.), member claims submitted from outside hospitals (usually with up to 3-month&#xD;
      delay), and care provided at home, skilled nursing and hospice facilities. This database is&#xD;
      updated weekly. Outpatient and inpatient pharmacy databases track medication orders and&#xD;
      dispenses, and are updated either daily or monthly depending on the source system. Death&#xD;
      information is derived from multiple sources including KP hospital and membership data, as&#xD;
      well as two external sources from California State and Social Security Administration death&#xD;
      files. The state death records lag about one to two years for date and underlying cause of&#xD;
      death and between two and three years for all causes listed on the death certificate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCIENTIFIC ENVIRONMENT Biostatistical expertise is provided by a Biostatistics Unit that&#xD;
      consists of statisticians, programmers, natural language specialists, database developers and&#xD;
      administrators. The Unit provides services including statistical consultation, data analysis,&#xD;
      data extraction, disease identification based on free-texts and data management for research&#xD;
      projects. In addition, the Unit is responsible for creating many of the research data bases&#xD;
      used. All Unit employees have SAS programming skills and years of experience in conducting&#xD;
      broad and varied research. The Biostatistics Unit supports more than 300 research projects&#xD;
      annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oversight of Research at KPSC KPSC has an Institutional Review Board (IRB) under the Medical&#xD;
      Director of Operations for the Southern California Permanente Medical Group. The IRB is&#xD;
      charged with the protection of human subjects through the oversight of all investigators and&#xD;
      their research projects in Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Compliance with the minimum&#xD;
      Federal standards for the protection of human subjects in research is demonstrated by a&#xD;
      Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) held through the Kaiser Foundation Research Institute. The IRB&#xD;
      also acts as the KPSC HIPAA privacy board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Kaiser Permanente - Southern California (KPSC) shall obtain written evidence of review&#xD;
      and approval from our independent ethics committee (IRB) of the protocol, informed consent&#xD;
      forms, evidence of partial waiver, and all other documents requiring IRB review and approval&#xD;
      prior to the initiation of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. RISKS TO THE SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics Describe the proposed involvement of&#xD;
                human subjects in the work outlined in the Research Design and Methods section.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The study population are ED patients exhibiting signs of shock definied by a&#xD;
                systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 mmhg, MAP &lt; 65, persistent tachycardia, mottled skin,&#xD;
                or lactate &gt;2mmol either at presentation or during ED stay will be included.&#xD;
                Exclusion criteria will be inability to consent, external factors preventing&#xD;
                ultrasound examination, age less than 18, pregnancy, incarceration, traumatic&#xD;
                mechanism, arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, or treating physician gestalt that the&#xD;
                patient is not in shock. Our goal is to enroll a total of 50 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
                This study will not recruit subjects defined as vulnerable populations. Individuals&#xD;
                age less than 18 and pregnant women will be excluded as noted in the exclusion&#xD;
                criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Sources of Materials&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following data will be obtained from the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Consent Form&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ultrasound will be used to perform visual assessment of the patient's inferior vena&#xD;
                cava&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Variables including but not limited to: systolic blood pressure, MAP, persistent&#xD;
                tachycardia, mottled skin, or lactate status, age, pregnancy status, arrhythmia,&#xD;
                cardiac arrest,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  &quot;Electronic Health Data&quot; - All charts will be reviewed by two experts who are&#xD;
                blinded to ultrasound and bioractance measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bioreactance measurements and ultrasound measurement of cardiac output will be&#xD;
                recorded pre and post a passive straight leg raise test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data collected will be linked/coded using a study identification number (SID) and&#xD;
           only KPSC study team members and persons directly involved in recruitment will have&#xD;
           access to the key that identifies individual subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ADEQUACY OF PROTECTION AGAINST RISKS&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Recruitment and Informed Consent We will obtain a waiver to access and use the EHR&#xD;
                data for case/patient identification. The waiver will be used to identify patients&#xD;
                in order approach patients regarding the study and to obtain consent. Study&#xD;
                personnel will screen the ED tracking board and communicate with ED providers to&#xD;
                find patients meeting inclusion criteria. Upon identification study personnel, will&#xD;
                approach patient in the private exam room to obtain informed consent in person.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The study will not recruit anyone less than 18 or women who are pregnant. However,&#xD;
                due to the rich diversity of Kaiser Permanente's membership in Southern California,&#xD;
                Spanish speakers will be recruited. All materials and forms will be translated to&#xD;
                Spanish to include all Spanish speaking/reading potential participants. Consent&#xD;
                forms will be stored securely onsite and a study database will be maintained. All&#xD;
                patients will be provided a copy of the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Protection Against Risk Names and other identifying information on participants&#xD;
                will be obtained for record keeping purposes only and no participants will be&#xD;
                identified in any forms or reports from this study. Survey and clinical data will&#xD;
                only be shared internally among KPSC study team members and only persons directly&#xD;
                involved in recruitment will have access to the key that identifies individual&#xD;
                subjects. Transfer of data if needed will be via encrypted email.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH TO THE SUBJECTS AND OTHERS The immediate&#xD;
           benefit to the participant is none. However, If the E-RUSH protocol proves accurate and&#xD;
           useful, it has the potential to improve patient care and safety and a vulnerable and&#xD;
           high risk population. There are no high-risk aspects of the proposed work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. IMPORTANCE OF THE KNOWLEDGE TO BE GAINED There are no high-risk aspects of the proposed&#xD;
           work. The importance of the current study presents an innovative algorithm that my&#xD;
           further demonstrate the ability of ultrasound to be useful in the shock patient to&#xD;
           determine fluid needs. If an algorithmic approach using bedside ultrasound proves&#xD;
           accurate in titrating fluid resuscitation, it could reduce complications of under&#xD;
           resuscitation (organ failure) and over resuscitation (pulmonary edema, third spacing and&#xD;
           abdominal compartment syndrome). Avoidance of complications would have downstream&#xD;
           benefits such as reduced length of stay, reduced mortality, and reduced burden on the&#xD;
           healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN Our study will not be a clinical trial. All the&#xD;
           information and/or databases will be password protected to ensure security of the PHI&#xD;
           contained in the data systems. Study data access that would identify participants will&#xD;
           be tightly controlled and limited to authorized individuals using the follow safeguards:&#xD;
           roles and privileges, defined data owners, automatic log off and lockouts, field level&#xD;
           hide, read only, or read-write permission at user level, encryption of data transfers,&#xD;
           and limited/controlled delete capabilities. Standard backup procedures will be employed&#xD;
           at Kaiser Permanente, where data will be backed up nightly to a secured disk based&#xD;
           storage system and then offloaded to a robotic tape library system, with tapes rotated&#xD;
           offsite for additional level of protection. This ensures against data loss in the event&#xD;
           of a local systems failure or natural disaster.&#xD;
