             g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has adequate liver function as shown by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. total serum bilirubin ≤2.0 mg/dL,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. ALT and AST ≤2.5x ULN (≤5x ULN in patients with liver metastases),&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. INR ≤2;.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has adequate renal function as shown by serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has fasting serum cholesterol ≤ 300mg/dl or 7.75mmol/L AND fasting&#xD;
             triglycerides ≤ 2.5 × ULN. NOTE: In case one or both of these thresholds are exceeded,&#xD;
             the patient can only be included after initiation of appropriate lipid lowering&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;

             highly effective contraception during this specified time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women of childbearing potential must have had a negative serum pregnancy test 14 days&#xD;
             prior to the start of everolimus treatment plus a negative local urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             prior to treatment and must be willing to use highly effective methods of&#xD;
             contraception during the study and for 8 weeks after study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has had prior therapy with mTOR inhibitors (e.g. sirolimus, temsirolimus,&#xD;

             ULN despite adequate therapy. Patients with a known history of impaired fasting&#xD;
             glucose or diabetes mellitus (DM) may be included, however blood glucose and&#xD;
             antidiabetic treatment must be monitored closely throughout participation in the&#xD;

               5. active, bleeding diathesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Chronic treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
