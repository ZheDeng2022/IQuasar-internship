  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coordination disorders are common among children that arrive to child development services.&#xD;
      Children with coordination disorders have impaired proprioceptive sensation and motor&#xD;
      planning. It is important to carry out a comprehensive assessment of these children in order&#xD;
      to design an appropriate and effective treatment. There is a lack of an objective and&#xD;
      standard assessment tools for proprioception and motor planning. Technology based assessment&#xD;
      tools might offer a solution, as they enable automated and accurate measurement. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to examine the validity and reliability of a new diagnostic computerized&#xD;
      kit, which was developed for assessment of proprioception and motor planning among children&#xD;
      with coordination disorders. The hypothesis includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine the construct validity of the new diagnostic computerized kit (the known group&#xD;
           procedure). Whether there is a difference in the outcomes between children with typical&#xD;
           development and children with coordination disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the construct validity of the new diagnostic computerized kit outcomes -&#xD;
           correlation with the following associated variables: (a) motor skills; (b) sensory&#xD;
           function; (c) participation in daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine of test-retest reliability of the new diagnostic computerized kit. Whether the&#xD;
           outcomes are stable in repeated measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will include fifty children between the ages of 5 to 7 years: 25 children&#xD;
      with coordination disorders (study group), and 25 children with typical development (control&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each child will arrive for an evaluation meeting that includes: (a) the new diagnostic&#xD;
      computerized kit; (b) standard and routine tests for motor skills (Movement Assessment&#xD;
      Battery for Children-2-MABC-2, and two sub-test of the Beery-Buktenica developmental test of&#xD;
      visual-motor integration- Beery VMI). In addition, the children's parents will complete two&#xD;
      questionnaires: (a) Sensory Processing Measurement (SPM) for sensory function assessment; (b)&#xD;
      Participation in Childhood Occupations Questionnaire (PICO-Q) for daily participation&#xD;
      assessment. After two weeks, ten children from the control group will be evaluated once again&#xD;
      by the new diagnostic computerized kit for examine test-retest reliability.&#xD;

      Coordination disorders are common among children that arrive to child development services.&#xD;
      Children with coordination disorders have impaired proprioceptive sensation and motor&#xD;
      planning. It is important to carry out a comprehensive assessment of these children in order&#xD;
      to design an appropriate and effective treatment. There is a lack of an objective and&#xD;
      standard assessment tools for proprioception and motor planning. Technology based assessment&#xD;
      tools might offer a solution, as they enable automated and accurate measurement. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to examine the validity and reliability of a new diagnostic computerized&#xD;
      kit, which was developed for assessment of proprioception and motor planning among children&#xD;
      with coordination disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new diagnostic computerized kit consists a computerized thumb- fingers matching test (for&#xD;
      proprioception).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine the construct validity of the new diagnostic computerized kit (the known group&#xD;
           procedure). Whether there is a difference in the outcomes between children with typical&#xD;
           development and children with coordination disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the construct validity of the new diagnostic computerized kit outcomes -&#xD;
           correlation with the following associated variables: (a) motor skills; (b) sensory&#xD;
           function; (c) participation in daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine of test-retest reliability of the new diagnostic computerized kit. Whether the&#xD;
           outcomes are stable in repeated measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will include fifty children between the ages of 5 to 7 years: 25 children&#xD;
      with coordination disorders (study group) in a waiting list for an occupational therapy&#xD;
      evaluation (in Orlansky Children's Development Center, Dan -Petah Tikva Region, Clalit Health&#xD;
      Services), and 25 children with typical development (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be recruited by a convenience sample. Participation in the study will&#xD;
      be offered by telephone to parents of children who may meet the inclusion /exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. For the study group the recruitment will be to children in a waiting list for an&#xD;
      occupational therapy evaluation (in Orlansky Children's Development Center). For the control&#xD;
      group, the recruitment will be by a snowball sample (a friend brings a friend), through&#xD;
      acquaintances of the investigators. Children whose parents agree to participate in the study&#xD;
      will attend one meeting, accompanied by at least one parent. At the beginning of the meeting,&#xD;
      the parents will receive a detailed explanation about the purpose and the study process. The&#xD;
      new diagnostic computerized kit will be presented and explained how to use it. Parents will&#xD;
      be assured total privacy. In addition, parents of children from the study group will be told&#xD;
      that their child's medical record will be used to ensure inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Parents who express their consent to participate in the study will sign an informed consent&#xD;
      form and then complete a demographic questionnaire and a screening questionnaire. Children&#xD;
      that will be find suitable for the study will Be evaluated by: (a) the new diagnostic&#xD;
      computerized kit; (b) standard and routine tests for motor skills (Movement Assessment&#xD;
      Battery for Children-2-MABC-2, and two sub-test of the Beery-Buktenica developmental test of&#xD;
      visual-motor integration- Beery VMI). In addition, the children's parents will complete two&#xD;
      questionnaires: (a) Sensory Processing Measurement (SPM) for sensory function assessment; (b)&#xD;
      Participation in Childhood Occupations Questionnaire (PICO-Q) for daily participation&#xD;
      assessment. After two weeks, ten children from the control group will be evaluated once again&#xD;
      by the new diagnostic computerized kit for examine test-retest reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the data will be done using the SPSS version 32. Descriptive statistics will be&#xD;
      used for description of the population and the variables. Shapiro-wilks test will be used to&#xD;
      examine the type of distribution of the dependent variables. According to the type of&#xD;
      distribution will use t-test for two independent samples or Mann-Whitney test to examine the&#xD;
      differences between groups (hypothesis 1). Pearson Correlation Coefficient test or Spearman's&#xD;
      Rank Correlation Coefficient test will be used to examine correlation between the outcomes of&#xD;
      the assessment tools (hypothesis 2 and 3). The significance level for all the statistical&#xD;
      tests will be p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
