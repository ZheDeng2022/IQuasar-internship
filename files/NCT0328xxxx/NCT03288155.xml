  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study determines to evaluate the effectiveness of the daily consumption of&#xD;
      flavonoid-rich cocoa in the treatment of fatigue in Parkinson's patients. The participants&#xD;
      were divided equally between the flavonoid-rich cocoa (device) and control cocoa groups. The&#xD;
      participant will engage in a six day trial, with measures taken at Day 1 and Day 6.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many pwPD have expressed their interest in dietary therapies to manage their symptoms;&#xD;
      however scientific evidence for these therapies is lacking. Flavonoids, plant compounds found&#xD;
      in certain foods, may have the ability to improve fatigue. However, to date, no well-designed&#xD;
      intervention studies assessing the role of flavonoid consumption for fatigue management in&#xD;
      pwPD have been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to undertake a feasibility preliminary study to determine whether&#xD;
      flavonoid-rich cocoa has the potential to improve fatigue in pwPD in order to inform a follow&#xD;
      on trial. Participants will be recruited from the European Parkinson Therapy Centre (EPTC)&#xD;
      and will be those about to enrol onto the 6 day program. They will be required to consume a&#xD;
      cocoa drink each morning for 6 days. They will have measures taken including fatigue measures&#xD;
      using visual rating scales, walking tests and several questionnaires will be administered&#xD;
      during this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the consumption of a flavonoid-rich pure cocoa beverage will reduce&#xD;
      fatigue in pwPD. The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of a trial to evaluate&#xD;
      this proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomised double-blind placebo controlled feasibility study in which 20 (+&#xD;
      potentially 20 more if adherence is acceptable and recruitment is progressing as expected)&#xD;
      pwPD will be recruited from the European Parkinson Therapy Centre (EPTC), Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 6 day nutrition intervention period, with a total of 2 assessments (baseline and day 6)&#xD;
      where outcome measures will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 men and women with a diagnosis of PD and who are over 18 years of age. There will be 10&#xD;
      participants in each trial arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess benefits, a range of outcomes will be obtained. Outcome measures include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levels of physical activity: wearable activity monitors (worn like a watch)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary patterns: 2-24 hour dietary record&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue levels: Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and during the intervention the numerical rating&#xD;
      scale (NRS) 3 times daily&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigability: performance on 6 minute walk test (physical) and AMIPB cognitive test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health descriptives: basic health questionnaire, Euroqol (EQ5DVAS), SF36 Health survey,&#xD;
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale non motor symptoms (UPDRSNMS), routinely&#xD;
      administered to the centre by Trescore Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration and follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be consented by a trained researcher at the Centre and, if successfully&#xD;
      pass the eligibility check will be enrolled into the study. Staff at the Centre will be&#xD;
      trained on taking consent by researchers at OBU. Once a participant is enrolled, a baseline&#xD;
      assessment (Assessment 1) will be conducted at day 1. Immediately following completion of&#xD;
      Assessment 1, participants will be randomly allocated to either the high flavonoid&#xD;
      intervention group or the control group, and intervention delivery will begin immediately&#xD;
      after allocation. They will be reassessed at day 6. Those in the control group will follow&#xD;
      the same procedure, the only difference being that they receive the low flavonoid drink. Alex&#xD;
      Reed and the EPTC will inform participant GPs about their involvement in the study.&#xD;

    <measure>Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery (AMIPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements taken at baseline and Day 6</time_frame>
    <description>The AIMPB test is taken after a fasted night, provided unseen to the participant. The participant must circle the second highest number out of five. There are ten lines of numbers. The test is timed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6-Minute Walking Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements taken at baseline and Day 6</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-minute walking test measures the participants' physical competency. It is taken after the AIMPB (on a fasted stomach). The participant must walk around a set course, of 13 metres, which is timed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dietary Recall</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements taken at baseline and Day 6</time_frame>
    <description>The dietary recall is taken to ensure any extraneous factors, potentially affecting the severity of Parkinson's symptoms or fatigue. The dietary recall is taken on the first (Day 1) and last day (Day 6) of the trial. The participants are not notified of the dietary recall commencement dates, to ensure they do not change their natural eating habits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Accelerometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements continuously taken from baseline to Day 6</time_frame>
    <description>The accelerometer measures the amount of activity expended by the participant during the duration of the trial (Day 1 to day 6). This is used to help distinguish variations between the FNS results, as well as fatigue related to physical exertion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Final Evaluation Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>Taken at day 6</time_frame>
