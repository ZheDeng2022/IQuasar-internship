  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The GAVI® closed vitrification system is a CE labelled device licensed for use in human IVF.&#xD;
      It has been developed to standardize the process of vitrification and to increase the safety&#xD;
      of the procedure. It has been demonstrated that the novel semiautomated, closed vitrification&#xD;
      system providing standardized equilibration prior to cryopreservation can produce similar&#xD;
      results in terms of recovery rate and Embryo development up to the blastocyst stage as&#xD;
      compared to the commonly used Manual Cryotop® open vitrifcation system when applied in a&#xD;
      mouse model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, its application has resulted in first pregnancies after transfer of&#xD;
      vitrifiedwarmed biopsied human blastocyts. Due to limitations of the preliminary studies&#xD;
      (application in mouse model; absence of a larger clinical Trial assessing pregnancy and live&#xD;
      birth rates in human model etc.) it is of paramount importance to compare the GAVI®&#xD;
      vitrification method to the routinely used Cryotop® method in a human IVF setting employing&#xD;
      randomization and a-priori sample size definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of vitrification using&#xD;
      the semi-automated GAVI® closed system over the so-far routinely used manual Cryotop® open&#xD;
      system in terms of post-thawing survival rate of 2PN oocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this trial is to study differences in embryo development, clinical&#xD;
      pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate and live birth rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, differences in procedure duration and convenience will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred and eighty (n=180) patients presenting more than 2 surplus 2 PNoocytes for&#xD;
      vitrification or patients having all available 2PN oocytes electively vitrified will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated (1:1) on day of fertilization check (day 1 after ovum pickup) to either&#xD;
      procedure. In the study group, 2PN oocytes will be cryopreserved utilizing the semi-automated&#xD;
      GAVI® open vitrification/warming technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, 2PN oocytes will be cryopreserved utilizing the manual Cryotop® open&#xD;
      vitrification/warming technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participation in this study will be limited to one cycle per patient. The study&#xD;
      population consists of infertile couples undergoing IVF or ICSI treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration will be minimally 6 months per subject, e.g. the main study on the Primary&#xD;
      outcome 2PN survival will be closed 6 months after randomization of the last patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from pregnancy and live birth outcome will be reported in addenda to the main clinical&#xD;
      study report, as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before initiation of the study, all study sites will have investigators sufficiently trained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed in at least three sites within Germany. Patient recruitment will&#xD;
      be competitive between study´centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients having oocyte pick-up during the time frame of the study conduct will&#xD;
      consist of the population screened for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, patients complying with the inclusion and exclusion criteria are eligible for&#xD;
      inclusion and randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no restrictions on the ovarian stimulation protocol and type or dose of ovulation&#xD;
      induction agent (hCG or GnRH-agonist). Ovum pick-up is usually performed by transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided follicle aspiration 36±2 hours after hCG administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVF or ICSI procedure is performed according to the investigator site´s standard operating&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fertilization check is performed on day 1 after ovum pick-up (OPU) 17±1 hours post&#xD;
      insemination. The number of regularly fertilized oocytes, defined as oocyte presenting 2&#xD;
      pronuclei and 2 polar bodies, is assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting ≥ 2 surplus regularly fertilized oocytes for cryoperservation on day 1&#xD;
      and patients undergoing elective cryopreservation of all available 2 PN oocytes are are&#xD;
      allocated to one of the two 2 procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed on day of fertilization check (day 1 after OPU) by lab staff&#xD;
      by opening a numbered, opaque sealed envelopes. The random sequence will be&#xD;
      software-generated and blocks will be used. All randomized patients will be logged in a&#xD;
      paper- based randomization log with initials, DOB, study number, date, study group, name and&#xD;
      signature of staff. Randomization will be stratified by Center and by indication (surplus 2PN&#xD;
      oocyte cryopreservation vs. elective cryopreservation of all available 2PN oocytes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All vitrification and warming procedures will be performed according to the manufacturer´s&#xD;
      instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to investigate the differences in vitrification procedure duration, the time span&#xD;
      between starting with preparations needed for vitrification and transferring the&#xD;
      vitrification device(s) into the liquid nitrogen tank for storage will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the investigator site's cryo embryo transfer policy, in a subsequent natural or&#xD;
      programmed cycle vitrified/warmed embryos will be replaced. Within site, all patients will&#xD;
      undergo the same cryoprotocol for preparation of the endometrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no specifications on the protocol to be used. The number of 2 PN oocytes to be&#xD;
      warmed will be decided by the investigator on a case by case basis. Embryo culture will be&#xD;
      performed in all cases in individual microdroplets covered with culture oil up to the day of&#xD;
      scheduled embryo transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day of embryo transfer and the number of embryos to be transferred will be decided by the&#xD;
      investigator on a case by case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to investigate survival rate, warmed 2PN-ooytes will be assessed immediately and 2&#xD;
      hours post warming procedure. Survival will be confirmed by the presence of an intact oolemma&#xD;
      and regular cytoplasm 2 hours after the warming procedure and/or when embryonic cleavage is&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to investigate potential differences in development and quality of vitrified/warmed&#xD;
      embryos cleavage and morphology will be assessed as followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      day 2 (44±1 hours post insemination) : cell number, blastomere size, grade of fragmentation&#xD;
&#xD;
      day 3 (68±1 hours post insemination): cell number, blastomere size, grade of fragmentation&#xD;
&#xD;
      day 5 (116±1 hours post insemination): blastocyst stage (grade of expansion), ICM (inner cell&#xD;
      mass) morphology, TE (trophectoderm) morphology&#xD;
&#xD;
      day 6 (140±1 hours post insemination): blastocyst stage (grade of expansion), ICM (inner cell&#xD;
      mass) morphology, TE (trophectoderm) morphology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who conceive will undergo ultrasound examination to confirm clinical pregnancy at&#xD;
      6-7 weeks of gestation. Follow-up data regarding the confirmation of ongoing pregnancy will&#xD;
      be obtained by telephone. Live birth including related data will be obtained by a questonaire&#xD;
      to be completed by the patient and returned to the investigator´s clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses will be done per-intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP), as appropriate.&#xD;
      The ITT population is the randomized patient population. The PP population is the population&#xD;
      of patients undergoing an attempt of thawing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source data will be paper-based case report forms (CRF).&#xD;

      absolute difference with 95% CI. For the primary outcome, a linear model will be constructed&#xD;
      accounting for treatment group, study site and randomization stratum exclusively for the&#xD;
      per-protocol population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For secondary outcomes ITT and/or PP analyses will be performed. No correction for&#xD;
      multiplicity is planned. Parametric and non-parametric tests will be used for normally&#xD;
      distributed and non-normally distributed variables, respectively, to compare secondary&#xD;
      outcomes between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient data will be entered into a computer database in a pseudonymized way. Data&#xD;
      management and analysis will be carried out by the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
