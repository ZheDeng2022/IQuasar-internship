  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a standard 3+3 design with a lead in of TGR-1202 at dose of 600mg (dose&#xD;
      level 1) or 800mg daily (dose level 2) for 6 weeks, i.e. 2 cycles, followed by pembrolizumab&#xD;
      at 200mg every 3 weeks for 8 cycles along with TGR-1202 for patients with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      B-cell NHL or CLL. If the dose of 600mg daily of TGR-1202 (dose level 1) is tolerated in the&#xD;
      first cohort the dose will be increased to 800mg qd which is the only and final dose&#xD;
      escalation. If TGR-1202 is not tolerated at 600mg daily the dose will be decreased to 400mg&#xD;
      daily. The lead in of TGR-1202 was chosen to ensure clinical benefit and to minimize the&#xD;
      occurrence of early overlapping toxicity with pembrolizumab as most toxicities were observed&#xD;
      early on in the treatment with idelalisib, a related PI3K-inhibitor, and rituximab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Of note, TGR-1202 has not been associated with treatment related pneumonitis, transaminitis,&#xD;
      colitis, PCP-infection nor CMV-reactivation which distinguishes TGR-1202 from idelalisib's&#xD;
      toxicity profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the maximum tolerated dose has been safely reached the study will open an expansion&#xD;
      cohort to enroll 18 patients with a patient group in which a clinical signal is detected.&#xD;
      Another 7 patients (up to a total of 25 patients in the expansion cohort) may be enrolled&#xD;
      after an interim analysis. The duration of therapy will be 2 cycles of TGR-1202 followed by 8&#xD;
      cycles with pembrolizumab and TGR-1202. Thereafter patient will continue on TGR-1202 at the&#xD;
      MTD until disease progression. Subjects who experience disease progression while on TGR-1202&#xD;
      maintenance may be eligible for re-treatment with pembrolizumab for up to 6 cycles at the&#xD;
      discretion of the Local Investigator if the patient experienced at least disease&#xD;
      stabilization during the initial treatment with pembrolizumab, the subject meets the safety&#xD;
      parameters listed in the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the trial is still open. Subjects&#xD;
      will resume therapy at the same dose and schedule at the time of initial discontinuation. If&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of the combination is confirmed in this dose expansion cohort, a&#xD;
      randomized phase II trial comparing TGR-1202 with pembrolizumab versus TGR-1202 could be&#xD;
      considered in a larger patient population, possibly within the cooperative group setting for&#xD;
      patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell NHL and CLL&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the dose expansion cohort will be CR rate. Secondary endpoints will&#xD;
      include safety and feasibility, PFS, OS and clinical response (SD, PR, PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored for disease response, adverse events and survival for a minimum of&#xD;
      2 years following enrollment. During and after treatment, patients will be evaluated for&#xD;
      toxicities, particularly immunologic adverse events including pneumonitis, autoimmune&#xD;
      colitis, dermatitisetc. Peripheral blood, lymph node and bone marrow samples will be&#xD;
      collected before and during the treatment course for the correlative studies outlined below.&#xD;
      Complete blood counts and differential counts with a complete metabolic panel will be&#xD;
      obtained at the time intervals. If the patients are confirmed to have disease progression or&#xD;
      intolerable toxicities the patients will be offered alternative treatment at the physicians'&#xD;
      discretion. All of the patients will be followed for survival. All patients will receive HSV&#xD;
      prophylaxis with acyclovir 400mg po bid or per institutional standards.&#xD;

             at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic&#xD;
             symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain&#xD;
             metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment&#xD;
