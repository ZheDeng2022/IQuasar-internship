  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to get a better understanding of the impact of Hidradenitis&#xD;
      Suppurativa (HS) on the quality of life of patients with this condition. Patients with HS&#xD;
      will be asked questions about demographics including gender, age, and ethnicity. They will&#xD;
      also be asked to complete questionnaires to determine how their skin condition affects their&#xD;
      life. Study participation will last for 1 day, with potential for follow-up in the future. We&#xD;
      hope this information will help us improve our treatment for this skin condition.&#xD;

      The goal of this study is to get a better understanding of the impact of the skin condition,&#xD;
      Hidradenitis Suppurativa, on quality of life function of patients. Patients with HS will be&#xD;
      asked questions about demographics including gender, age, and ethnicity. They will also be&#xD;
      asked to complete questionnaires to determine how their skin condition affects their life.&#xD;
      The questionnaires include Beck Depression Inventory form, which gives us information how you&#xD;
      feel about your skin condition and how it changes your mood; Dermatology Life Quality Index&#xD;
      (DLQI), which gives us information about how your skin condition affects your quality of&#xD;
      life; Skindex, which gives us more specific information about how your skin condition affects&#xD;
      your quality of life; SF-36 health survey, which gives us information about your general&#xD;
      health status; the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire- short form&#xD;
      (Q-LES-Q-SF), which gives us information on your enjoyment and satisfaction of your life; and&#xD;
      the Employment/Productivity Health Economic Questionnaire, which will give us more&#xD;
      information on your work and school status as well as household income. Study participation&#xD;
      will last for 1 day, with potential for follow-up in the future. Through potential follow up&#xD;
      visits we hope to determine the longitudinal effect of treatment modalities on QoL through&#xD;
      future survey performance of the patient cohort. We hope this information will help us&#xD;
      improve our treatment for this skin condition.&#xD;
