&#xD;
      Baseline parameters --&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endodontic evaluation - Pulp sensibility testing was performed with a combination of heat&#xD;
      test (heated gutta-percha), cold test (Endo-Frost, Coltene Whale dent) and electric pulp test&#xD;
      (Digitestz D626D, Parkell electronics, New York). Teeth not responding to both thermal and&#xD;
      electric test were considered non vital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic evaluation - Radiographs with paralleling cone technique was taken at baseline&#xD;
      and at subsequent appointments at standardized exposure parameters (70kvp, 3.5mAs, and 0.2&#xD;
      seconds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Periodontal Evaluation - The following clinical parameters were evaluated at&#xD;
      baseline and at subsequent follow up appointments in the test tooth and the contra lateral&#xD;
      normal tooth in the same patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bleeding on probing - The presence or absence of bleeding following pocket probing were&#xD;
           recorded at 6 sites per tooth - mesiobuccal, buccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual,&#xD;
           midlingual, distolingual. This assessment was done in full mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Probing pocket depth (PPD) - Probing depth was measured as the distance from the&#xD;
           gingival margin to the base of the clinical pocket. The probing depth measurements was&#xD;
           assessed using a calibrated manual periodontal Williams 0 probe. The probe was inserted&#xD;
           with a firm, gentle pressure to the bottom of the pocket and maintained parallel to the&#xD;
           vertical axis of the tooth. Measurements were noted at 6 sites per tooth- mesiobuccal,&#xD;
           midbuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, midlingual, distolingual. Measurements will be&#xD;
           rounded to the nearest whole millimeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical Attachment Level (CAL) - Clinical Attachment Level was measured as the distance&#xD;
           between the base of the clinical pocket and a fixed point on the crown, the&#xD;
           cementoenamel junction (CEJ). Measurements were made at 6 sites per tooth- mesiobuccal,&#xD;
           midbuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, midlingual, distolingual using wiliiams 0 probe.&#xD;
           Measurements were rounded to the nearest whole millimeter. The mean CAL over all&#xD;
           examined surfaces were calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Gingival marginal level/position from CEJ was measured.Radiographic examination was&#xD;
           performed at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months by using Rinn ( XCP instruments, Elgin, IL )&#xD;
           paralleling technique digitized by using Kodak RVG 6000 ( Kodak Digital Radiographic&#xD;
           System, Pt Husada Intra Care, Banten, Indonesia ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total number of 15 patients in each group were selected. Sample size was determined by&#xD;
      calculating the difference of success rate between the previous studies of GTR procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test Group: 15 Non vital teeth having through and through periradicular lesion diagnosed&#xD;
           clinically and radiographically first treated with conventional endodontic treatment.&#xD;
           After follow up of one month if no improvement found clinically and radiographically&#xD;
           then apical surgery was carried out using guided tissue regeneration in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control Group: 15 Non vital teeth having through and through periradicular lesion&#xD;
           diagnosed clinically and radiographically first treated with conventional endodontic&#xD;
           treatment. After follow up of one month if no improvement found clinically and&#xD;
           radiographically then apical Surgery was carried out without using guided tissue&#xD;
           regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly allocated by computer program [ Random Allocation Software&#xD;
      (http://www.msaghaei.com/Softwares/dnld/RA.zip) ] into two group. Group I=Collagen membrane&#xD;
      group (MG), group II=Control group (CG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGICAL TECHNIQUE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the exception of incisions, flap elevation and suturing, all surgical procedures was&#xD;
      performed under operating microscope in an operating room under 8x to 16x magnification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full thickness (mucoperiosteal flap) was reflected under aseptic condition by the&#xD;
      following technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preoperative mouth rinse with 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Local anaesthesia with lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 1:80,000 was achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Buccal intrasulcular incision was given up to the alveolar crest including one tooth&#xD;
           mesial to the lesion &amp; two teeth distal to the lesion, using no.15 blade on handle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Mesial and distal vertical releasing incision were given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Full thickness flap was gently reflected towards the apical area by periosteal elevator.&#xD;
           The flap was frequently irrigated with sterile saline to prevent dehydration of&#xD;
           periosteal surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. After complete elevation of the flap, debridement (periradicular curettage -enucleation)&#xD;
           of the bony lesion was performed. For additional hemostasis during surgery, cotton&#xD;
           pellets soaked in 0.1% epinephrine was applied topically as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A 2-3mm root tip with a 0Âº to 10Âº bevel angle was sectioned with cylindrical surgical&#xD;
           carbide burs at high speed with sterile water coolant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Root end preparations extending 3mm into the canal space along the long axis of the root&#xD;
           was made by using a piezoelectric ultrasonic system with double angled Retrotips coated&#xD;
           with Diamond abrasives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Isthmuses, fins, and other significant anatomic irregularities were identified in high&#xD;
           magnification and was treated with the ultrasonic instruments. Then the resected root&#xD;
           surfaces was stained with methylene blue and were inspected with micromirrors under high&#xD;
           magnification of 24x to examine the cleanliness of the root end preparation and detect&#xD;
           any other overlooked anatomic details.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Root end filling were with mineral trioxide aggregrate (MTA). The adaptation of the&#xD;
           filling material to the canal apical walls was confirmed with the aid of an operating&#xD;
           microscope at high magnification.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. After MTA retrofilling in the test group Collagen membrane was applied on buccal side&#xD;
           and in the control group nothing was apllied and flap will be closed with 4-0 reverse&#xD;
           cutting black silk suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESORBABLE COLLAGEN MEMBRANE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioabsorbable membranes are composed of a wide variety of materials including collagen,&#xD;
      polylactic acid, polyurethane, polyglactin 910, acellular dermal matrix, dura mater,&#xD;
      chitosan, periosteum, and calcium sulfate. The most common material is collagen, which can be&#xD;
      modified through various collagen cross-linking processing techniques to vary the resorption&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies have shown bioabsorbable membranes to be effective at promoting regeneration&#xD;
      in both endodontic and periodontal defects. Because alveolar bone and the periodontal&#xD;
      ligament contain collagen, using a collagen membrane might impart some additional advantages&#xD;
      for GTR purposes by augmenting its native properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collagen facilitates hemostasis and therefore wound stability by promoting platelet&#xD;
      aggregation in addition to promoting fibroblast migration, which could accelerate wound&#xD;
      closure. After inspecting the root end filled teeth with microscope and radiographically the&#xD;
      defect will be covered with resorbable collage membrane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative instructions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care must be taken not to over compress the area. patient should rinse with an appropriate&#xD;
      antimicrobial agent of the clinician's choice (chlorhexidine glucoanate) twice daily for two&#xD;
      weeks. patient should avoid brushing the area for 2 weeks from the surgery date, avoid&#xD;
      flossing for 4 weeks from surgery date. following the first 2 weeks from surgery for the next&#xD;
      3 weeks it is recommended to brush the area only with soft brush.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post - Operative Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed every 3, 6 and 12 months by assessing&#xD;
      the same parameters as baseline except that PD, CAL, and GMP were not measured until 12&#xD;
      months. Routine examination procedure was used to evaluate any evidence of signs and/or&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jig radiographs will be taken at 3, 6 and 12th month of follow up. Radiographic healing will&#xD;
      be assessed by the criteria as below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete healing, defined by re-establishment of the lamina dura&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Incomplete healing (scar tissue)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Uncertain healing&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Unsatisfactory healing (failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Processing Of Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inter and intra observation of data will be analyzed by distribution of data. Categorical&#xD;
      data will be analyzed by chi square test. Regression analysis will be done to observe any&#xD;
      association between independent and dependent variables. Interobserver/intraobserver&#xD;
      reliability with cohen kappa analysis.&#xD;
