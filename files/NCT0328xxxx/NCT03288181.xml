  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with peripheral arterial disease often have walking impairment due to insufficient&#xD;
      oxygen supply to lower extremity skeletal muscle. In an aging rat model, we have previously&#xD;
      shown that daily calf muscle stretching improves endothelium-dependent dilation of soleus&#xD;
      muscle arterioles and blood flow during exercise. The effect of muscle stretching on&#xD;
      endothelial function and walking distance in patients with peripheral arterial disease is&#xD;
      unknown. We performed a prospective, randomized, non-blinded, crossover study in 13 patients&#xD;
      with stable symptomatic peripheral artery disease. Patients were randomized to undergo either&#xD;
      4 weeks of passive calf muscle stretching (ankle dorsiflexion splints applied 30 minutes/day,&#xD;
      5 days/week) followed by 4 weeks of no muscle stretching (control group) and vice versa.&#xD;
      Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and endothelium- independent&#xD;
      nitroglycerin-induced dilation of the popliteal artery and a 6 minute walk test were&#xD;
      evaluated at baseline and after each 4 week treatment interval. Patients crossed over to the&#xD;
      other treatment arm after 4 weeks and endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and&#xD;
      endothelium- independent nitroglycerin-induced dilation of the popliteal artery and the 6&#xD;
      minute walk test were repeated.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective randomized, non-blinded, crossover trial conducted at Tallahassee&#xD;
      Memorial HealthCare, Tallahassee, FL, USA between October 2015 and May 2016. The Tallahassee&#xD;
      Memorial Healthcare Institutional Review Board and the Human Subject Committee at Florida&#xD;
      State University approved the study prior to initiation. Informed written consent was&#xD;
      provided by all patients prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Patients The study sample consisted of patients with stable symptomatic PAD. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria included reproducible claudication with walking associated with an ankle brachial&#xD;
      index of less than 0.90,15 and/or computed tomographic angiographic evidence of at least a&#xD;
      60% stenosis of the iliac, femoral, or popliteal artery deemed to be the source of&#xD;
      claudication. Individuals with critical limb ischemia or who had severe comorbid conditions&#xD;
      limiting their walking ability were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were initially randomized to undergo either 4 weeks of passive stretching or 4&#xD;
      weeks of no stretching (control), respectively, followed by cross-over to the other&#xD;
      intervention. Patients were evaluated at baseline, after the first 4 weeks of initial&#xD;
      intervention (stretching or no stretching) and then again after 4wks following the cross-over&#xD;
      intervention (stretching or no stretching). Participants were taught how to apply a simple&#xD;
      dorsiflexion splint and during the 4 wks of daily stretching intervention and applied the&#xD;
      splint daily at home for 30 minutes/day, 5 days/week. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated&#xD;
      dilation (FMD) and endothelium-independent nitroglycerin-induced dilation (NID) of the&#xD;
      popliteal artery (measured by doppler ultrasound) and a 6 minute walk test were evaluated at&#xD;
      baseline and after each 4 week treatment interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle stretching Protocol. To passively stretch each patient's calf muscle, dorsiflexion&#xD;
      splints (Healwell Plantar Fasciitis Night Splint®, FLA Orthopedics, Charlotte, NC, USA) were&#xD;
      applied. Using the splint, ankle joints were kept at 15 degrees of dorsiflexion for 30&#xD;
      min/day, 5 days/wk, for the 4 week interval. The splint has a strap to adjust the angle of&#xD;
      the joint. Participants learned how to wear the splint correctly from a trained physical&#xD;
      therapist who initially fitted and adjusted the splint. Splints were sent home with the&#xD;
      patient and a physical therapist was available for questions by phone. Using the splint, both&#xD;
      the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were effectively stretched. If participants complained&#xD;
      of pain during muscle stretching, the physical therapist assisted in adjusting the straps,&#xD;
      but efforts were made to maintain the angle of dorsiflexion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow-mediated dilation of the popliteal artery. Vascular functional testing was performed in&#xD;
      a temperature controlled (72 degrees F), quiet and dark laboratory. To exclude the acute&#xD;
      effects of acute exercise or medicine on vascular endothelial function, participants were&#xD;
      asked to refrain from taking sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil for 48 hours prior to the&#xD;
      vascular assessment, and not to take carvedilol, cartelol labetalol, verapamil, diltiazem,&#xD;
      nifedipine, nicardipine, isradipine, felodipine and amlodipine for 24 hours prior to the&#xD;
      assessment. Participants were also asked to refrain from any form of exercise and not to eat&#xD;
      or drink for 3 hours prior to the assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systolic and diastolic blood pressure was measured using an automatic brachial&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer applied to the upper arm after at least 10 min of quiet rest with the&#xD;
      patient seated in the vascular laboratory. Pulse rate was recorded. Participants then assumed&#xD;
      a prone position on a bed and a blood pressure cuff applied to the lower thigh of the most&#xD;
      symptomatic lower extremity. Using vascular ultrasound and Doppler (GE Vivid Q ultrasound&#xD;
      with 12L-RS Linear Vascular Probe, GE, Milwaukee, WI, USA), flow-mediated dilation of the&#xD;
      popliteal artery was measured in the following manner. The measurement was conducted on the&#xD;
      affected leg (leg with greater symptoms or lower ankle-brachial index). First, popliteal&#xD;
      artery diameter and blood flow velocity were recorded after resting for 10 min. A lower thigh&#xD;
      blood pressure cuff was then inflated up to 250 mmHg for 5 min. During the 5 min of arterial&#xD;
      occlusion, participants were asked to remain as still as possible. The blood pressure cuff&#xD;
      was then quickly deflated, and popliteal artery diameter and blood flow remeasured in the&#xD;
      same location for another 10 min. FMD was obtained by referencing the peak popliteal artery&#xD;
      diameter to the baseline measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelium-independent dilation of the popliteal artery. At least 30 min after the&#xD;
      assessment of FMD, nitroglycerin-induced dilation (NID) of the popliteal artery was also&#xD;
      assessed as a measure of endothelium-independent dilation. Baseline popliteal artery diameter&#xD;
      was recorded after resting for 10 min. The recording was done continuously for 10 min after&#xD;
      the administration of 400 µg of sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG, Wilshire, Atlanta, Georgia).&#xD;
      The peak diameter relative to baseline served as the measurement of endothelium-independent&#xD;
      dilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic analyses. Vessel diameter and blood flow velocity were recorded at 30 Hz of&#xD;
      frequency, and converted into DICOM (DICOM, Rosslyn, VA, USA) format to perform further&#xD;
      analysis. Since peripheral arterial diameter and blood flow velocity vary during the cardiac&#xD;
      cycle,16 popliteal artery diameter was measured at the end of the diastolic phase (defined as&#xD;
      the point just before the popliteal arterial Doppler waveform rises). Blood flow velocity was&#xD;
      measured at the peak of the systolic phase. Using two-dimensional B mode images,&#xD;
      end-diastolic popliteal artery diameter and peak velocity were obtained from three&#xD;
      consecutive cardiac cycles, averaged and the same technique used to measure arterial diameter&#xD;
      for FMD and NID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six-minute Walk Test (6MWT) The Six-minute walk test (6MWT) was performed after vascular&#xD;
      function testing according to the American Thoracic Society guidelines.Using a straight 30m&#xD;
      corridor, participants were asked to walk back and forth over 6 minutes. Participants were&#xD;
      asked to report any symptoms, including leg pain or cramping, tiredness and/or chest&#xD;
      discomfort. Participants were allowed to rest if they felt it necessary and then asked to&#xD;
      resume walking as soon as able. Symptom-free walking distance was measured as the distance&#xD;
      covered without symptoms. Continuous walking distance was also measured as the distance&#xD;
      covered without stopping. Total 6-minute walking distance was measured as the distance&#xD;
      covered for 6 minutes. Immediately after the 6-minute walk, participants were seated and&#xD;
      again asked to report any chest and lower-extremity symptoms. Chest and lower-extremity&#xD;
      exertional symptoms were assessed using a modified borg scale. The modified borg scale is&#xD;
      scored from zero (no symptoms of exertion) to 10 (maximal sensation of symptoms).&#xD;
      Participants answered the chest and lower-extremity symptoms by indicating a number from zero&#xD;
      to 10. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were then measured at&#xD;
      approximately 1-min after 6-min walk termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation. The primary endpoint for which the sample size was derived was&#xD;
      popliteal artery FMD. From published data, we estimated that the FMD of popliteal artery&#xD;
      would improve by approximately 40% with muscle stretching. In a prior pilot study, we&#xD;
      observed a baseline FMD of 3.87% (standard deviation of 0.62%) in 13 patients with stable&#xD;
      PAD. Assuming an alpha of 0.05, and a cross-over design, we predicted that we would need at&#xD;
      least 12 patients per group to have 90% power to detect a 20% increase in FMD. Allowing for&#xD;
      an approximately 20% drop out rate (3 patients), the targeted sample size was adjusted to 15&#xD;
      in this study. However, recruitment was to continue until at least 12 patients were enrolled&#xD;
      and completed the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. Baseline clinical characteristics are reported as means and standard&#xD;
      deviations. A histogram of vascular function and walking distance was made to assess their&#xD;
      distribution. If non-normal distribution was suggested by the histogram, a Kolmogorov-smirnov&#xD;
      test was performed to assess the distribution of obtained data. On the basis of the&#xD;
      distribution test, paired t-test (normal distribution) or Wilcoxon signed-rank test&#xD;
      (non-normal distribution) were used to compare between those data obtained after 4 weeks of&#xD;
      stretching and after 4 weeks of no stretching with a 2-sided level of significance of 0.05.&#xD;
      Data were presented as mean ± standard error.&#xD;
