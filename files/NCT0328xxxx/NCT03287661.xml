  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a serious health issue in Canada. Individuals who experience chronic pain&#xD;
      often find it difficult to attend in-person treatment sessions for a variety of reasons&#xD;
      including pain flare-ups, discomfort when travelling, pain-induced avoidant behaviours, and&#xD;
      time constraints. These factors, if not addressed through appropriate treatment, serve as a&#xD;
      detriment to the individual's functioning by maintaining the pain cycle and preventing the&#xD;
      individual from engaging in previously enjoyed activities. Online treatments have the&#xD;
      potential to assist individuals who would otherwise have difficulty attending in-person&#xD;
      treatment sessions. This study evaluated the efficacy of an online acceptance-based&#xD;
      behavioural treatment for chronic pain designed for military, police, and veteran&#xD;
      populations. Participants (n = 29) were randomized into either a treatment condition or&#xD;
      wait-list control condition, and asked to complete a battery of measures which underscore the&#xD;
      key facets of the fear-avoidance model of chronic pain. A series of 2 x 2 mixed model ANOVA's&#xD;
      revealed statistically significant Time x Condition interactions for pain disability,&#xD;
      kinesiophobia, and pain acceptance, as well as statistically significant pre- to&#xD;
      post-treatment simple main effect contrasts for pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, and pain&#xD;
      acceptance. For those in the treatment group, no significant changes in scores were found&#xD;
      between post-treatment and three-month follow-up; however, the sample size was too small to&#xD;
      draw conclusions regarding this finding. Baseline PTSD and depression scores were found to be&#xD;
      significant predictors of change in pain acceptance levels over the course of treatment.&#xD;
      Overall, the results support the efficacy of the ABBT treatment for chronic pain for&#xD;
      military, police and veterans.&#xD;

      This study is an extension of a pilot study that was conducted investigating an online&#xD;
      acceptance-based behavioural therapy (ABBT) for chronic pain. The online treatment runs for a&#xD;
      total of 8 weeks and includes interactive content to promote the participant's engagement&#xD;
      with the treatment material. The treatment has been specifically tailored for military,&#xD;
      police and veteran populations as it uses language and audio vignettes to which military,&#xD;
      police and veteran individuals can easily relate. Based on promising results from a pilot&#xD;
      study conducted using the online ABBT program, the investigators conducted a randomized&#xD;
      control trial (RCT) of the treatment by randomly allocating participants into either a&#xD;
      treatment group, or a wait-list control group. Clients who are new to the participating&#xD;
      clinic participate in an intake appointment with the clinic's intake nurse, and during this&#xD;
      appointment are informed about the different research projects currently being run at the&#xD;
      clinic. Participants interested in the study were screened for inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria during their intake appointment. For this study, all eligible participants were&#xD;
      asked to complete an informed consent form prior to being issued a unique password and user&#xD;
      ID for access to the online portion of the treatment. A treatment fidelity plan and data&#xD;
      safety monitoring plan have been established to ensure treatment procedures remain consistent&#xD;
      across groups, and that data integrity is monitored over the duration of the study. The&#xD;
      treatment program is an eight module (8-week) ABBT for chronic pain. The online treatment&#xD;
      material is administered via the WebCAPSI Therapy program. This is an online&#xD;
      password-protected program which allows participants to progress through the treatment&#xD;
      modules at their own pace. Each module is designed to cover a specific component of ABBT and&#xD;
      facilitated understanding of the components through audio files, veteran, military and&#xD;
      RCMP-specific vignettes, text-based material, and homework exercises/assignments. Each module&#xD;
      is designed to be completed in 60 minutes or less and participants have the option to return&#xD;
      to the program and the modules as often as they like during the course of the treatment&#xD;
      period. On the completion of each module, and facilitated through the WebCAPSI Therapy&#xD;
      program, the participants are asked to complete a homework exercise to which they answer&#xD;
      questions previously encountered throughout the module. The principle therapist responds to&#xD;
      each homework exercise within 24-hours of its online submission, with feedback and&#xD;
      encouragement. The participants completed a battery of measures at the outset of the&#xD;
      randomization process (both treatment and wait-list control conditions), and again at the end&#xD;
      of the 8-weeks. A 3-month follow-up assessment was conducted to evaluate the maintenance of&#xD;
      treatment gains. Only participants who complete at least 5 out of the 8 modules were&#xD;
      considered to have &quot;completed&quot; the treatment, and therefore included in the analyses. The&#xD;
      interactions from the mixed model ANOVA analyses were statistically significant for changes&#xD;
      in pain interference, kinesiophobia, and pain acceptance. Regarding the main effects of Time,&#xD;
      only change in pain acceptance was found to be significant, whereas no main effect of&#xD;
      Condition was found to be statistically significant. For the treatment condition, dependent&#xD;
      t-tests were conducted to further assess mean differences between the pre-treatment,&#xD;
      post-treatment, and follow-up scores on each of the four dependent variables. The results for&#xD;
      the pre- to-post-test dependent t-tests revealed statistically significant differences for&#xD;
      all of the dependent variables except for pain interference, although even this measurement&#xD;
      was close to statistical significance with t(13) = 2.07, p = .059. As expected, there were no&#xD;
      statistically significant differences between post-treatment and follow-up for each of the&#xD;
      dependent variables. Only change in pain acceptance scores was significantly predicted by&#xD;
      participants scores on both measures of PTSD and depression symptoms. The results from this&#xD;
      study provide further empirical support for the use of acceptance-based behavioural&#xD;
      interventions for treating various chronic pain conditions, and thus add to the recent&#xD;
      growing body of literature for acceptance-based treatments for chronic pain. These results&#xD;
      also highlight how this acceptance-based behavioural treatment helps to significantly&#xD;
      decrease pain interference and kinesiophobia, as well as increase pain acceptance. This study&#xD;
      adds a unique contribution to the understanding of how depression and PTSD symptoms influence&#xD;
      treatment gains for pain acceptance, when utilizing an acceptance-based behavioural&#xD;
      intervention for chronic pain. These positive findings provide further support for the use of&#xD;
      this acceptance-based behavioural treatment for chronic pain within police and military&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
