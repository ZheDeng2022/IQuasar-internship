  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) experience physiological and&#xD;
      psychological complications, such as shortness of breath, anxiety and depression. This has&#xD;
      negative influence on their social life, daily activity level and overall quality of life.&#xD;
      Patients can participate in a pulmonary rehabilitation program (PR) for the purpose of better&#xD;
      managing of the disease and its symptoms and for avoiding future relapses and&#xD;
      hospitalisations. However there is a large number of dropouts from PR, and therefore a need&#xD;
      for investigation of new activities. Singing training may be one such potential relevant and&#xD;
      motivating rehabilitation activity. This study aims to investigate the effects of singing&#xD;
      training on both physiological and psychological aspects, and will compare the effects with&#xD;
      that of physical training (golden standard in PR). Effects will be investigated in a&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial (RCT) with 10 week intervention period. In all the study includes&#xD;
      11 municipalities from around all regions of Denmark, and in all 220 participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is is rapidly&#xD;
      increasing, and the disease is projected to be the third leading cause of death worldwide in&#xD;
      2020. At the present time 320.000 people in Denmark suffer from COPD, though only half of&#xD;
      them are diagnosed and hence treated with appropriate medication. Often patients are not&#xD;
      diagnosed until the pulmonary function is only 50% and therefore at a severe stage of the&#xD;
      disease, where there tends to be a high rate in hospitalisations and recurring exacerbations&#xD;
      with increasing symptoms. COPD amounts to 10% of the Danish national health care budget, and&#xD;
      Denmark has the highest COPD related mortality rate in the EU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides sufficient medical treatment, patients are offered attendance in pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation, since lifestyle changes are crucial in order to prevent disease progression,&#xD;
      and for better management of symptoms and higher Quality of Life (QoL). Pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation consists of evidence based activities and are based on international and&#xD;
      national guidelines. However there is a need for investigation of new motivating and&#xD;
      perceived relevant rehabilitation activities due to a large number of drop-outs of the&#xD;
      ordinary rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to examine the effects of singing training for patients with COPD in relation&#xD;
      to physiological as well as psychological aspects. Intervention is singing training, and&#xD;
      active control is usual care: Physical training (golden standard and standard part of&#xD;
      ordinary pulmonary rehabilitation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of this study is that singing training as activity in pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation is non-inferior in relation to effects on specific physiological and specific&#xD;
      psychological/psychosocial aspects compared to physical training (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically, the hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Singing training leads to a positive rehabilitation process as regards selected&#xD;
           physiological parameters as well as selected psychological and psychosocial parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Attending the singing training program leads to a more consistent rehabilitation process&#xD;
           with higher motivation and less drop outs among the participants than in the control&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential moderators and mediators:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the project potential mediating and moderating factors will be explored, e.g.&#xD;
      including socio-demographic, disease-, lifestyle- and attitude-related characteristics (COPD&#xD;
      participants are e.g. characterised by relatively old age and lower socio-economic status).&#xD;
      Furthermore, relevant psychological aspects (e.g. in correlation with building and&#xD;
      maintaining motivation) will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also baseline attitude towards singing (and physical training), the relationship between the&#xD;
      facilitator and participants, and the significance of influence associated with the&#xD;
      intervention (e.g. in terms of musical taste) will be taken into consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical and psychological effects of COPD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD is a syndrome with a progressive pulmonary obstruction leading to increasingly impaired&#xD;
      lung function due to chronic inflammation in the respiratory passages and pulmonary tissue.&#xD;
      Living with COPD everyday life is a struggle and often marked by continuous dyspnea, cough&#xD;
      and sputum. The patients often suffer from emphysema leading to stiff lungs and insufficient&#xD;
      diffusion of oxygen. This again leads to a vicious circle with lack of control of respiratory&#xD;
      function, increased hyperinflation and forced, clavicular oriented breathing. Comorbidities&#xD;
      such as heart disease, muscle wasting, hypertension and infections are common, which again&#xD;
      lead to further complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On a psychological level patients are often also affected negatively as a sequela of the&#xD;
      disease. E.g. COPD patients tend to suffer from comorbidities such as increased stress and&#xD;
      anxiety levels e.g. due to dyspnea. Furthermore patients experience social isolation,&#xD;
      financial downfall and generally impaired Quality of Life (QoL). Also activities of daily&#xD;
      life are significantly affected by COPD, and the reduced activity again leads to depression&#xD;
      and further physical health problems, by which a vicious circle develops. In other words COPD&#xD;
      often leads to a severe condition that both physically and psychologically can be very&#xD;
      difficult to manage and cope with.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COPD and rehabilitation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the COPD related degeneration of the lungs is irreversible, treatment may slow down&#xD;
      further progression, and improve the interrelated physical and psychological consequences of&#xD;
      the disease. Besides required medical treatment participants life style change, e.g. smoking&#xD;
      cessation, physical training and psychosocial support, are crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to guidelines from the Danish Government Health Agency patients are encouraged to&#xD;
      join an 8-12-wk multidisciplinary rehabilitation program in order to improve physical and&#xD;
      mental condition, improve general function and QoL levels, and prevent exacerbations,&#xD;
      hospitalisations and early mortality. The overall recommendations are that patients should&#xD;
      not only receive clinical control and medical treatment, but should also participate in&#xD;
      additional interventions. This is essential in terms of supporting the participants in&#xD;
      maintaining (or retrieve) empowerment and self-dependence, also as regards education, work,&#xD;
      income, housing and social network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is a high drop out rate, both due to exacerbations or mortality and to lack of&#xD;
      mobility or motivation. Therefore it is of high importance to develop alternative&#xD;
      rehabilitation activities that are motivating and are perceived relevant for the participants&#xD;
      and that both includes physical training and enables the participants to lead their lives&#xD;
      with a higher QoL level. Furthermore, physical and psychological effects of COPD seem to&#xD;
      influence each other significantly, suggesting that both areas should be considered in&#xD;
      rehabilitation of COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an unmet need for new types of interventional therapies to help COPD patients. This&#xD;
      study aims to investigate singing training as a potential new rehabilitation activity, since&#xD;
      singing might lead to a more efficient utilisation of the remaining respiratory function of&#xD;
      participants with COPD and improve QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Singing and COPD rehabilitation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of international studies have investigated the effects of singing in relation to&#xD;
      COPD patients. The core of singing activity is to learn how to control the respiratory&#xD;
      function, including training and coordination of both inspiration and expiration function,&#xD;
      focusing on the related primary and secondary musculature. An essential part of the singing&#xD;
      training is also focused exercises for posture, relaxation and general body awareness.&#xD;
      Moreover, group singing might have a positive impact on the experiences of social&#xD;
      interaction, and music in general seems to have an ability to create emotions, and seems to&#xD;
      have a positive impact on well-being, anxiety and depression level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies differ in methodology (randomized controlled trials, observational studies,&#xD;
      qualitative studies and literature reviews), and furthermore sample size and statistical&#xD;
      power are not sufficient to conclude on significance and results. Therefore it is of great&#xD;
      importance to conduct further and larger trials in order to provide evidence to the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark a number of COPD choirs have been launched, and it seems to have become&#xD;
      common-sense that singing is healthy to patients with COPD. The choirs however are launched&#xD;
      quite randomly, there is no common methodology on the COPD choirs, and also effects of the&#xD;
      choir singing has not yet been investigated. COPD singing therefore has not yet been&#xD;
      considered in the national guidelines as a validated rehabilitation activity, however popular&#xD;
      among the participants. Therefore the present study is of high relevance, since it aims to&#xD;
      provide knowledge and evidence within this field, for the benefit of the large and&#xD;
      dramatically growing number of COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a non-pharmacological two-armed randomized controlled trial with intervention&#xD;
      group receiving singing training (ST), and active control group receiving &quot;golden standard&quot;:&#xD;
      Physical training (PT). Both groups will participate in a 10 weeks' program, 1 1/2 hour,&#xD;
      twice a week. Both groups also participate in education activities as part of pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation, such as smoking cessation course. Participants randomised to singing training&#xD;
      will be offered opportunity to participate in standard physical training post intervention.&#xD;
