  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a chronic, inflammatory, subepidermal, autoimmune blistering&#xD;
      disease which mainly develops in the elderly, with onset usually in the late 70s and a&#xD;
      substantial increase in incidence in people older than 80 years. If untreated, it can persist&#xD;
      for months or years, with periods of spontaneous remissions and exacerbations. It has been&#xD;
      found that blisters and sera of BP patients contain abnormally high levels of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8. Recently, it also has been&#xD;
      demonstrated that NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3) inflammasome&#xD;
      components (the NLRP3-caspase-1-IL-18 axis) were significantly up-regulated in peripheral&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cells from BP patients and positively correlated with disease activity.&#xD;
      AC-203 is a topical formulation of an oral modulator of inflammasome and IL-1beta pathways.&#xD;
      In vitro studies have demonstrated that AC-203 significantly reduced secretion of IL-6 and&#xD;
      moderately reduced IL-8 secretion in HaCaT cells treated with specific anti-BP180 IgG. This&#xD;
      study is designed to test the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of AC-203&#xD;
      ointment (vs. a topical steroid comparator representing standard of care) ointment in&#xD;
      subjects with BP.&#xD;
