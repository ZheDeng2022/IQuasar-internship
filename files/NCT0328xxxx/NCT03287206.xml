  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intellectual deficiency (ID) is a veritable public health issue because it affects 1 to 3% of&#xD;
      the population at large. Currently, in France, the diagnosis is based on clinical expertise,&#xD;
      the use of DNA microarray analysis, screening for fragile-X syndrome and, if necessary, a&#xD;
      study of target genes depending on the clinical data. Although clinical expertise is not&#xD;
      enough to target one gene in particular, these different tools currently lead to diagnosis in&#xD;
      only 20% of patients on average (higher percentage in cases of syndromic intellectual&#xD;
      deficiency), sometimes after numerous expensive biological examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thanks to high-throughput sequencing (HTS), medical genetics is experiencing a major&#xD;
      technological upheaval, originating from the development of sequencing panels of target&#xD;
      genes, such as, for example, the DI459 panel, composed of 459 genes implicated in or likely&#xD;
      to be implicated in ID, developed by the team in Strasbourg and whole-exome sequencing (WES).&#xD;
      The deployment of HTS in diagnosis has occurred at different speeds depending on the country,&#xD;
      some of which have been using it in routine diagnosis for several years. The type of strategy&#xD;
      to adopt in development anomalies is still a matter of debate in France, in the absence of&#xD;
      results from cost-effectiveness analyses; this absence has hampered the implementation of&#xD;
      these technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the diagnosis of ID, the DI459 panel has a diagnostic yield of 25%. Data in the literature&#xD;
      also show a high efficacy of WES in patients with ID: approximately 32% of genetic diagnoses&#xD;
      (progressively increasing thanks to possible reanalysis as knowledge of genomics advances)&#xD;
      and 10% of additional diagnoses through the identification of chromosomal&#xD;
      micro-rearrangements, making an expected total of 42% of diagnoses. WES could thus replace&#xD;
      array-CGH. The cost is higher than that for the DI44 and DI459 panels, but it means that&#xD;
      examinations don't have to be repeated sequentially over time if the investigations are&#xD;
      negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question of medico-economic value is thus central so as to determine which strategy is&#xD;
      the most effective. A few medico-economic studies, comparing classical investigations with&#xD;
      WES, have already been carried out concerning the use of HTS for diagnostic purposes, but&#xD;
      none have concerned ID, or compared panel sequencing with WES. In this context, a&#xD;
      medico-economic study is essential in France, because ultimately the choice of the most&#xD;
      appropriate HTS strategy in the diagnosis of ID will have major repercussions not only&#xD;
      clinical and economic, but also for society at large, on the one hand because of the benefits&#xD;
      1) for the management and prognosis of patients, and 2) for families as they will have&#xD;
      improved access to genetic counselling. It is important to note that the Genetic community&#xD;
      has never experienced such a huge technological innovation, which will lead to a massive&#xD;
      increase in diagnostic yield, thus justifying the interest that the community must give to&#xD;
      this innovation.&#xD;
