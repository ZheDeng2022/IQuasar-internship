    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib works in treating participants with untreated&#xD;
      high risk smoldering mental cell lymphoma. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure the progression-free survival (PFS) in previously untreated high-risk&#xD;
      smoldering mental cell lymphoma (MCL) patients treated with ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety of ibrutinib in previously untreated high risk smoldering MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the response rate and duration of response of ibrutinib. III. To study clonal&#xD;
      evolution in MCL while under ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To collect serial samples for our correlative study (plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells [PBMC], initial tumor biopsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      28 days for 5 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 2 months for 6&#xD;
      months, every 2-4 months for 2 years, then every 4-6 months thereafter.&#xD;
