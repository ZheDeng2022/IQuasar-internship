    <textblock>
      Bangladesh has the earliest patterns of marriage in the current developing world, high&#xD;
      adolescent fertility and high rates of spousal violence against women and girls. Women and&#xD;
      girls are often denied the right to choice or consent with respect to marriage, sex,&#xD;
      contraceptive use and childbearing. However, the denial of these rights and its consequences,&#xD;
      have not been adequately recognized and addressed in the context of the existing discourse or&#xD;
      interventions in Bangladesh on sexual and reproductive health or violence against women. It&#xD;
      is envisaged that the focus on realizing the right to choice and consent will bring about&#xD;
      change in attitudes and behaviors that could not be achieved through a single intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multi-sectoral action research-based intervention is proposed, involving access to&#xD;
      information about rights, available remedies and related referrals. Information will be&#xD;
      coupled with access to legal and health services. This action research project aims to create&#xD;
      a body of evidence. This multi-sectoral intervention in urban Bangladesh will highlight the&#xD;
      critical element of expressing or refusing consent and choice, through a strong network&#xD;
      between legal services, reproductive and sexual health service providers, human rights&#xD;
      advocates, and research organizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project proposes to implement an integrated intervention with both primary preventions&#xD;
      and curative components based on the findings of the formative research. This project will&#xD;
      document the program implementation and impact through detailed quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      evidence gathering, and carrying out an advocacy program to disseminate the results and bring&#xD;
      about change. It includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  designing culturally sensitive intervention activities with a joined up approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a strong community mobilization campaign for creating an enabling environment for women&#xD;
           to live violence free lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  individual access to reproductive and sexual health services provided through health&#xD;
           clinics and legal services, with legal clinics providing information, advice and support&#xD;
           access to judicial remedies for redress in cases of serious violence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  broader advocacy activities involving key stakeholders to reflect upon the findings and&#xD;
           understandings geneated by the study and their relevance for the administration of&#xD;
           justice delivery mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community engagement in the project will occur at multiple levels. At the local level the&#xD;
      project will engage through community mobilisation and service delivery with adolescent&#xD;
      girls, women and men living in urban slums of Dhaka city. It will also undertake targeted&#xD;
      advocacy programmes with the frontlines of the justice delivery system relevant to these&#xD;
      areas. Finally, it will engage at a national level with policymakers, researchers and key&#xD;
      stakeholders in the justice system and health through its advocacy related interventions,&#xD;
      drawing directly upon its findings.&#xD;

      Background Bangladesh has high rates of physical and sexual violence against women and girls.&#xD;
      Women and girls in Bangladesh are often denied the right to make decisions regarding&#xD;
      marriage, sex, and childbearing, yet neither the denial of these rights, nor their&#xD;
      consequences, have been adequately recognized and addressed in the context of ongoing&#xD;
      interventions to address violence against women. While higher court judgments, and key legal&#xD;
      and policy provisions recognize women's rights to exercise choice or the requirements of&#xD;
      obtaining their consent with respect to marriage, these are rarely applied or invoked in&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Bangladesh, more than 65 percent of girls are married before the age of 18. Child marriage&#xD;
      is associated with demands for dowry, with amounts increasing with age. Additionally, women&#xD;
      or girls' ability to exercise their right to consent or choice with regard to marriage, sex&#xD;
      and sexuality, is routinely denied. Child marriage represents a set of increased reproductive&#xD;
      health risks that are associated with limited knowledge and skills to negotiate adult roles&#xD;
      and diminished status in the marital home for an adolescent girl. One major reason for the&#xD;
      association with early marriage and negative reproductive health outcomes is that young age&#xD;
      at marriage for girls is associated with larger age differences that reduce her power within&#xD;
      the marital relationship. This may affect factors such as negotiating timing of births,&#xD;
      choice of contraception or use of maternal and child health (MCH) services. Child marriage&#xD;
      has highly detrimental sexual and reproductive health (SRH) consequences resulting in early&#xD;
      childbirth, and adverse effects on child and maternal nutrition and also maternal morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. Child marriage and economic disempowerment may also be related to the high&#xD;
      levels of intimate partner violence (IPV) observed in Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gender norms and perceptions about male predominance, strength and superiority further&#xD;
      exacerbate the problem. Evidence suggests that such presumptions of superiority and&#xD;
      acceptance of male prerogative and dominance, and corollary acceptability of violence as a&#xD;
      form of control, are associated with greater violence. The reason may be that in settings&#xD;
      where there is high acceptance of gender based violence the social costs of violence to&#xD;
      perpetrators is lower. There is also some research to show that in addition to such community&#xD;
      level attitudes, individual attitudes among women and men independently contribute to higher&#xD;
      risk of IPV. Thus, modifying individual attitudes and community norms related to gender based&#xD;
      violence is an important basis for behavioural change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Bangladesh adolescent girls and women are denied SRHR through patriarchal institutions and&#xD;
      long standing practices such as child marriage and force marriage, segregation of the sexes&#xD;
      and economic exclusion that relegate women to low status. Inadequate SRHR information and&#xD;
      services make men vulnerable to diseases. Gender education is normally geared towards women&#xD;
      and girls; thus men miss opportunities to become gender sensitive and responsible. While&#xD;
      Bangladesh has traditionally afforded women reasonably good access to family planning&#xD;
      services, the context of low status of women means that women are unable to exercise their&#xD;
      right to choose in decisions regarding marriage, sex and childbearing to the full extent of&#xD;
      their rights and ability. This project will seek to enhance people's ability to exercise&#xD;
      their SRHR by strategically expanding their knowledge and understanding of the notions of&#xD;
      full and informed consent and choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child marriage and IPV are common in both urban and rural areas, with women in poor urban&#xD;
      areas are most at risk, yet most programs and projects aimed at empowering women remain in&#xD;
      rural areas. Data from Dhaka slums compared to non-slum populations as well as rural data&#xD;
      shows higher prevalence and acceptance of gender-based violence among women living in urban&#xD;
      slums. Migrant girls and women, particularly those living in urban slums, lack even the most&#xD;
      rudimentary social protection - thus being particularly vulnerable to violence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bangladesh has clear obligations under international law and the Constitution to ensure equal&#xD;
      treatment under the law to all individuals and to ensure freedom from violence as well as&#xD;
      effective remedies. An overarching framework of fundamental rights -- to liberty, personal&#xD;
      security equality and freedom of expression -- applies in the form of constitutionally&#xD;
      guarantees to all persons - women and men - within Bangladesh. However, the content and&#xD;
      application of specific laws often operate to deny or constrain the enjoyment of such rights&#xD;
      in practice. This is due in large measure to the limits of the law, and inherent paradoxes,&#xD;
      resulting from the continued prevalence of religion-based personal laws, which contradict and&#xD;
      constrain the ambit of operation of constitutional rights. The Constitution clearly prohibits&#xD;
      discrimination based on sex, and exhorts the state to ensure equal rights to men and women in&#xD;
      the state and public sphere, as well as guaranteeing the fundamental rights to personal&#xD;
      liberty, freedom of expression and freedom of religion. It also specifies that any laws which&#xD;
      violate such fundamental rights will be void.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is widely recognised that interventions should employ a multi-sectoral approach and work&#xD;
      at different levels: individual, community, institutional, and laws and policies. Several&#xD;
      reproductive health initiatives have shown that communication programs can be effective in&#xD;
      improving knowledge and awareness. However, behavior change is more difficult to bring about.&#xD;
      These operations research studies hypothesize the need to bring about attitudinal change in&#xD;
      communities and among health care providers about the need to engage men in multiple ways to&#xD;
      improve the communities' SRH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Programs to delay marriage timing include community mobilization, behaviour change&#xD;
      communication, educational incentives such as scholarships for girls and programs to promote&#xD;
      lifeskills and livelihood skills. In Bangladesh a program entitled &quot;Raising the Age of&#xD;
      Marriage for Young Girls in Bangladesh&quot; is one such project. A program in rural Bangladesh to&#xD;
      delay marriage by providing adolescent life skills and livelihood skills showed increase in&#xD;
      reproductive health knowledge, reduced school dropout and delayed marriage relative to girls&#xD;
      in control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Government of Bangladesh's (GoB) has several initiatives on VAW aims to improve services&#xD;
      for women survivors of violence and does so through targeting various different critical sets&#xD;
      of actors, including health personnel, police. The Police Reform Programme promises to&#xD;
      include a specific focus on addressing gender violence including training and collaboration&#xD;
      with civil society actors. While several leading women's rights, human rights and legal&#xD;
      service NGOs collaborate with the GoB programme, many others also run independent&#xD;
      initiatives, either singly or in collaboration with others, aimed at ending VAW and at&#xD;
      providing support and redress to survivors. This reluctance on the part of service providers&#xD;
      to use available institutional processes reflects that of women survivors themselves. As&#xD;
      research in Bangladesh has shown only 2% of the women physically assaulted by their husbands&#xD;
      have ever sought help from any institutional source. Moreover, they approached these sources&#xD;
      only when their situations became unendurable or the violence became life threatening or&#xD;
      children were at risk. The findings show that while providing appropriate services is&#xD;
      necessary, it is critical to make people aware of such services and to actively foster their&#xD;
      use of such services by creating an enabling environment in the community. It is equally&#xD;
      critical to make the services available within the justice sector more gender responsive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance and Rationale Bangladesh is a signatory to international treaties to promote&#xD;
      gender equality. Ending VAW is an integral part of that agenda. The primary focus of the&#xD;
      current coalition is to reduce gender based violence beginning with the most vulnerable&#xD;
      groups-poor and adolescent girls living in Dhaka city. The project is clearly framed within&#xD;
      an understanding of the GoB's obligations to implement the provisions of key international&#xD;
      human rights treaties such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of&#xD;
      Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), in particular its understanding that the right to&#xD;
      equality within the family (Article 16) includes the right to choice with regard to 'if, when&#xD;
      and whom to marry', and its elaborate interpretation of the state's obligations to prevent&#xD;
      VAW (Declaration on Violence against Women, as well as General Recommendation 19 of the CEDAW&#xD;
      Committee).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is timed to seize a window of opportunity provided in part by recent national&#xD;
      democratic elections - which have resulted in clear government commitments to: 1) address&#xD;
      discriminatory laws and practices, including through taking up long-standing demands for&#xD;
      legal reform (e.g., the recent Cabinet approval of the domestic violence prevention and&#xD;
      protection bill); 2) strengthen existing institutional protections on VAW (victims support&#xD;
      centres, legal aid programme); and 3) increased space and a more enabling environment for the&#xD;
      operation of women's rights organisations and related service providers. The Project plans to&#xD;
      engage directly with key policy makers and justice sector institutions to press for legal and&#xD;
      policy reforms as necessary, and also to simultaneously reach out at the frontlines to press&#xD;
      for more effective enforcement of existing laws and rules safeguarding women's rights to&#xD;
      consent and choice. It will focus in part on enabling an informed understanding within key&#xD;
      justice sector institutions at a local level of the issues relating to investigation and&#xD;
      prosecution and prevention of VAW, as part of the roll out of the domestic violence law. The&#xD;
      evidence yielded by the project will be critical for engaging with ongoing legislative&#xD;
      advocacy initiatives on law and policy reform on women's rights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase awareness among adolescent girls and women in urban slums regarding SRHR, and&#xD;
           the right to freedom from violence, in particular the right to consent and choice&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop a community environment by engaging and working with men to address denial of&#xD;
           the right to choice and consent of adolescent girls and women and violence against them&#xD;
           are less condoned&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enable access to and more effective use of legal and health services by adolescent girls&#xD;
           and women in dealing with violence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduce incidence of violence against adolescent girls and women due to the deterrent&#xD;
           effect of increased awareness among them of their rights and remedies in this&#xD;
           connection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ensure law, policy and procedural reforms regarding access to justice, including with&#xD;
           respect to developing protocols and practices for investigation and prosecution of VAW,&#xD;
           procedures for registration of marriages which involve identification of the age of the&#xD;
           woman and of whether her consent has been obtained, and recognition of age and the right&#xD;
           to consent in court proceedings Research Design and Methods The proposed action research&#xD;
           project is a mixture of research and programmatic intervention activities with different&#xD;
           kinds of interventions targeted at different levels and research findings being fed back&#xD;
           into the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Awareness Raising: The main interventions will be awareness-raising in three&#xD;
                domains, on the rights of women and girls: i) to live a violence-free life; ii)&#xD;
                regarding SRH; and iii) legal provisions. In each area, a key focus would be on&#xD;
                women's rights to exercise choice and consent. The awareness raising activities&#xD;
                will be based on curriculum and materials developed jointly by project partners.&#xD;
                These will draw heavily upon existing local and global resources, and be tailored&#xD;
                to the needs of the given context.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The awareness raising activities will seek to engage groups such as women (aged 10&#xD;
                to 29); men (aged 18-35) and community leaders from Dhaka slums. Initial activities&#xD;
                will involve establishing adolescent and women's groups. Upon entry in the&#xD;
                community, Marie Stopes will organize separate groups of women and men (about&#xD;
                fifteen members each). About 450 women's groups and 150 men's groups will be&#xD;
                formed. Regular sessions will be held with each group with varying frequency. Women&#xD;
                will receive about five sessions per quarter, while men will receive one session&#xD;
                per quarter. These sessions will focus on discussions on SRHR issues and life&#xD;
                skills; right of a young woman to live a violence free life; and legal provisions&#xD;
                for addressing violence including rights within the family, and the rights to&#xD;
                consent and choice with regard to marriage, sex and childbirth.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Advocacy in these groups on the question of consent will be an important area for&#xD;
                enhancing women's and girls' capacity to combat and to seek redress for sexual&#xD;
                abuse, underage marriage and forced marriage, and child bearing. Skilled trainers&#xD;
                and paralegals will impart this training. As appropriate they will also provide&#xD;
                referrals to health care providers, and lawyers for legal assistance and assist&#xD;
                women who need to make complaints of violence to the police or to the courts and&#xD;
                accompany them to support them through court hearings.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. One-Stop Service Centre (OSC): Awareness raising activities will be backed up by&#xD;
                provision of health, legal and other support services to women survivors of&#xD;
                violence from OSC. The services will be provided by Marie Stopes, BLAST, and Nari&#xD;
                Maitree. The existing Marie Stopes clinics near the slums will be focal points for&#xD;
                the dissemination of information and advice, service provision and referrals. Marie&#xD;
                Stopes will provide SRH services while BLAST will provide legal services to the&#xD;
                clients. Nari Maitree will make services available so that the community can take&#xD;
                part in the campaign activities from these service points.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Community Mobilisation and Community-wide Campaign: The above interventions will be&#xD;
                supplemented by community mobilisation efforts by Nari Maitree, which will commence&#xD;
                with the formation of community groups (e.g., local ward commissioners, leaders of&#xD;
                youth clubs, teachers etc) as well as training and orientation targeted to them.&#xD;
                Information and communication using relatively innovative means, such as&#xD;
                rickshaw/wall paintings, mobile phone messages/ring tones, and mobile van campaign,&#xD;
                etc will also be utilised as appropriate.The community-wide campaigns will be led&#xD;
                by Nari Maitree, applying the model already developed by the We Can Campaign.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Broader Advocacy: The intervention is partly linked to service delivery and&#xD;
                community mobilisation, and partly free-standing, will involve more broadly&#xD;
                targeted advocacy initiatives at a local and national level, which will engage all&#xD;
                project partners on the recognition and realisation of women's right to consent and&#xD;
                choice. Such advocacy will engage law makers and policy makers, and focus in&#xD;
                particular on key actors within the justice system, i.e., police, prosecutors,&#xD;
                social workers, health professionals and the judiciary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence gathering through collaborative action research The project has been designed to&#xD;
      enable a more joined up approach to service delivery targeted to the most vulnerable for&#xD;
      ensuring effective access to information and health services and justice to ensure that those&#xD;
      needing advice and assistance are able to access appropriate services. The research component&#xD;
      enable capacity building of the service delivery organizations to fine tune the existing&#xD;
      services to better meet the needs of the people. The quantitative and qualitative evidence&#xD;
      generated by the program will help to (i) identify vulnerable populations and the nature of&#xD;
      their vulnerabilities to inform the intervention approach; (ii) enable designing a culturally&#xD;
      sensitive appropriate set of initervention activities; (iii) monitor program inputs and&#xD;
      document the activities in the interventions; (iv) give constant feedback into the program;&#xD;
      (v) assess impact to understand what works and what does not work; and (vi) inform advocacy&#xD;
      messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the project aims to ensure that the findings from on the ground interventions are fed&#xD;
      into learning, which can be disseminated through professional and ongoing education for the&#xD;
      relevant policy makers including judges, prosecutors and lawyers and police. This will ensure&#xD;
      that the health education, services as well as justice systems are sensitised to the real&#xD;
      needs of the poorest and most vulnerable users, and at the same time to use such information&#xD;
      to develop focused and specific recommendations for policy and programmatic or procedural&#xD;
      reforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and Scoping Study, and Impact Evaluation The research will be carried out through a&#xD;
      scoping study and baseline survey in the first year, and an impact evaluation at the end of&#xD;
      the third year. In particular, the baseline and scoping study will focus on the influence of&#xD;
      prevalent norms and the potential for diffusion dynamics in changing normative structures and&#xD;
      breaking rules. The impact evaluation will allow comparison between intervention and control&#xD;
      areas in order to measure changes due to intervention.The study will be carried out using&#xD;
      mixed methods of qualitative and quantitative data collection, using separate sample pre-test&#xD;
      post-test control group design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data collection: Qualitative data will be collected for the scoping study and for&#xD;
      evaluation of the intervention. Qualitative data will inform the design and questionnaire&#xD;
      wording for the quantitative study, to interpret quantitative results. Tools for qualitative&#xD;
      data collection will invovle 12 Key Informant Interviews (KII) (5 males and 7 females), 15&#xD;
      Focus Group Discussions (FGD) (3 with unmarried young women, 3 with married young women, 3&#xD;
      with unmarried young men, 3 married young men and 3 with community leaders) and 61&#xD;
      Indepth-Interviews (IDI) (20 with unmarried young women, 25 with married young women, 7 with&#xD;
      unmarried young men and 9 with married young men). in the baseline study. Potential key&#xD;
      informants are female and male NGO workers from the study site and women and men from the&#xD;
      slums who have first-hand knowledge regarding the study population and are knowledgeable in&#xD;
      the area this study is interested in exploring. The selection of informants for each kind of&#xD;
      data collection will be opportunistic. In the endline study, there will be 16 KIIs (8 with&#xD;
      females and 8 for males), 10 FGDs (2 with unmarried young women, 2 with married young women,&#xD;
      2 with unmarried young men, 2 married young men and 2 with both females and males&#xD;
      irrespective of their marital status), 116 in-depth interviews (34 with unmarried young&#xD;
      women, 34 with married young women, 24 with unmarried young men and 24 with married young&#xD;
      men).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data collection: The baseline and endline survey will be cross-sectional and&#xD;
      will be conducted among 4,212 adolescent girls and women between the ages of 15 and 29; and&#xD;
      1,458 young and adult men ages between 18 and 35 living in the sample area at the time of the&#xD;
      survey. Survey sample will include 15-19 years old unmarried and married girls; 20-29 married&#xD;
      and unmarried females; and 18-35 years old married and unmarried males. Samples will be drawn&#xD;
      separately for these three groups of respondents. The study will have 3-arms: (a) Strategy 1:&#xD;
      group level awareness raising activities with females and males, plus a community wide&#xD;
      campaign and one-stop service centres; (b) Strategy 2: group level awareness raising&#xD;
      activities only with females plus a community wide campaign and one-stop service centres; and&#xD;
      (c) Strategy 3: community wide campaigning activities coupled with one-stop service centres.&#xD;
      Thus, there will be no &quot;blank&quot; or &quot;no intervention&quot; control condition. The design will allow&#xD;
      comparison across male involvement versus no male involvement in strategy 1 versus strategy&#xD;
      2; and added advantage of reaching females on top of community campaigning and onestop&#xD;
      service centres in comparison between strategy 2 and strategy 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample selection: The respondents will be selected from slums in the vicinity of three Marie&#xD;
      Stopes clinics in Dhaka. Each of the three clinic site slums will be divided into 51, 27, and&#xD;
      27 non-contagious clusters of 15-19 year old females; 20-29 year old females and 18-35 years&#xD;
      males, respectively. These clusters, then, will be randomly assigned to the three strategies.&#xD;
      Male respondents will not be selected from the same household because their exposure to the&#xD;
      survey may make the females vulnerable. There are different sizes of slums according to&#xD;
      population and area, which may impact on violence towards women at different levels.&#xD;
      Therefore, the study will incorporate both large and small slum areas in drawing sample&#xD;
      according to size of the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriately trained same sex interviewers will recruit respondents only after receiving&#xD;
      consent or assent when appropriate. Before entering into the slums and households, permission&#xD;
      will be taken from the gatekeepers, and household heads. The survey questionnaire draws&#xD;
      heavily upon widely used standard research tools from sources such as the WHO multi-country&#xD;
      study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Area The study will be conducted in areas within urban slums of Dhaka city. The&#xD;
      intervention will be carried out in communities surrounding three Marie Stopes clinics in&#xD;
      Dhaka located in Mohammadpur, Mohakhali, and Jatrabari. According to Marie Stopes records&#xD;
      there are 4 slums in Mohammadpur; 5 slums in Mohakhali and 10 slums in Jatrabari in the&#xD;
      vicinity of these clinics. Marie Stopes estimated a total population of 51,514 in these&#xD;
      slums. Applying the proportion of women aged 10 to 24 found in Dhaka slums by the Urban&#xD;
      Health Survey we estimated about 8,336 women and girls to be residing in these slums.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Beneficiaries: The project will primarily affect some 6,750 slum adolescent girls and&#xD;
      women, while the secondary group affected would be all the women (slum and non-slum) in the&#xD;
      intervention area during the intervention period in Dhaka. For some of the interventions such&#xD;
      as nation-wide media campaign or sensitization of key actors in the judiciary system a much&#xD;
      broader section of Bangladeshi women will be the beneficiaries. In order to create an&#xD;
      enabling environment for girls and women to practice their rights to freedom from violence,&#xD;
      this project will also engage young men. Thus, in Dhaka 2,250 young men will be directly&#xD;
      involved. These men will be encouraged to sensitize other members of the community, including&#xD;
      the community leaders. Thus, the ultimate target becomes the entire community consisting of a&#xD;
      total (slum and non-slum) population of around 128,785.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation and Outcome (Primary and Secondary) Variable(s). Sample sizes for&#xD;
      this study are calculated assuming that treatment effects will be observed by measuring&#xD;
      change in key outcomes between baseline and endline surveys and by comparing treatment and&#xD;
      control groups. The sample also takes into account an extensive baseline survey that will&#xD;
      allow the statistical analysis to control for known factors associated with the outcomes.&#xD;
      Sample for the quantitative survey has been calculated using the three-level multi-site&#xD;
      cluster randomized trial design. In this design, individuals are nested within clusters and&#xD;
      the clusters are randomly assigned to the three strategies 1 or 2 or 3. Using the Optimal&#xD;
      Design (OD) software, assuming 5% significance level, 80% power, intra-class correlation of&#xD;
      0.01, and cluster size of 15 respondents, 153 female groups of 15-19 years old (51 groups per&#xD;
      site); 81 female groups of 20-29 years old (27 groups per site); and 81 male groups of 18-35&#xD;
      (27 groups per site) are needed to detect a minimum detectable effect size (MDES) of 45% to&#xD;
      55% (Table 3). Allowing for 20% oversampling to group's size in order to address 5%&#xD;
      non-response and 15% migration at the endline, the cluster size increases to 18 for which the&#xD;
      sample size increases from 4,725 to 5,670 (4,212 females and 1,458 males).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations There are number of ethical considerations that need to be made when&#xD;
      conducting research on VAW in families. The CIOMS International Guidelines for Ethical Review&#xD;
      of Epidemiological Studies (1991) and the WHO recommendations (2001) are being adhered to in&#xD;
      the development of this Protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Do no harm and respect adolescent girls' and women's decisions and choices Particular care&#xD;
      will be taken to ensure that all questions about violence and its consequences are asked&#xD;
      sensitively, in a supportive and non-judgmental manner. Interviewers and program staff will&#xD;
      be trained to be aware of the effects that the questions may have on the informant and, if&#xD;
      necessary, will terminate the interview. Care has been taken when designing the&#xD;
      questionnaires and interview guides to try to carefully and sensitively introduce and enquire&#xD;
      about adolescent girls' and women's experiences of violence. Each interview or session will&#xD;
      aim to end in a positive manner to provide the participant with a positive outlook and&#xD;
      reinforces her coping strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotional support and skills Given the prevalence of VAW, many interviewers and program staff&#xD;
      would either have experience of IPV themselves or have been affected by it in some way. For&#xD;
      this reason, the training will be explicitly designed to provide an opportunity for them to&#xD;
      reflect on their own experiences with abuse. At all times interviewers will be informed that&#xD;
      they have the option of withdrawing from the project. Trainings will also include how to be&#xD;
      empathetic and supportive, allowing the participant time to take a break and giving her the&#xD;
      opportunity to reschedule or terminate the interview or discussion. At all interviews,&#xD;
      participants will be informed orally of the purpose and nature of the study, why and how s/he&#xD;
      has been selected, what is expected from the participant, privacy, anonymity and&#xD;
      confidentiality, the expected benefits of the study, future use of the data, the principles&#xD;
      of compensation and the right of the participants not to participate and to withdraw from the&#xD;
      study if they so wish. Details for some of these areas of informed consent are given below&#xD;
      Oral consent and assent Verbal consent will be taken on the following ground: 1) Request for&#xD;
      signature on the consent form may arouse the respondent's suspicion; 2) The issue of&#xD;
      maintaining confidentiality is further challenged when the respondent's signature is placed&#xD;
      on the form; 3) It is expected that a major proportion of the respondents will be&#xD;
      non-literate. In this situation asking for a thumbprint would further raise suspicion. In&#xD;
      order to interview minors (aged below 18) consent from guardians would normally be sought.&#xD;
      However, in a sensitive study such as this taking consent from potential perpetrators&#xD;
      (fathers, brothers, husbands, in-laws) of abuse would further jeopardize the girls' and&#xD;
      women's safety as well as the principle of confidentiality employed in the study. This is why&#xD;
      oral consent from a guardian (if available) will be sought first introducing the study as a&#xD;
      study of health and life experiences of young women. Then the full consent procedure will be&#xD;
      followed with the young women in question. Assent form will be used to interview minors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voluntary participation Participation in the study will be on a voluntary basis. No&#xD;
      inducements will be made. The participant will be free not to participate in the study; to&#xD;
      terminate the interview at any point, and to skip any questions that s/he does not wish to&#xD;
      respond to. As a token sign of appreciation SAFE one-stop services (legal and health) will be&#xD;
      offered to all study participants; they will receive free treatment, free medicine that is&#xD;
      available in the Marie Stopes clinics and travel allowance of TK. 60. This is applicable only&#xD;
      for the first visit and at any time throughout the project period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality Much of the information provided by the participants will be extremely&#xD;
      personal. The dynamic of a violent relationship is such that the act of revealing the painful&#xD;
      details of abuse to someone outside the family nucleus could provoke another violent episode.&#xD;
      As part of the consent procedure, the participant will be informed that the data collected&#xD;
      will be held in strict confidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanisms to attend to researchers' and field workers' needs The high prevalence of VAW&#xD;
      worldwide means that, almost without exception, one or more project staff will have been a&#xD;
      direct target, or have familial experiences of violence. While this may improve the&#xD;
      interviewers' skills and empathy, the process of being involved in the study may awaken&#xD;
      images, emotions, internal confusion and conflict. These reactions may affect their ability&#xD;
      to work, may have a negative impact on their health, and may create tension in the home.&#xD;
      During the fieldwork, regular meetings will be held with interviewers for emotional&#xD;
      debriefing. In contrast to more technical meetings that focus on evaluating progress with&#xD;
      data collection or program and other aspects of project logistics, these debriefing sessions&#xD;
      will aim to provide staff with an opportunity to discuss their own feelings about the work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical safety of informants and researchers&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical safety of study participants and project staff from potential retaliatory&#xD;
      violence by the abuser is of prime importance. If the focus of the project becomes widely&#xD;
      known, this may place the participant or the staff member at risk of violence, either before,&#xD;
      during or after the project. For this reason, the following measures will be adopted to&#xD;
      ensure that the research topic does not become widely known:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The survey will be framed as a survey of young women's health and life experiences, and&#xD;
           will be introduced at the local and household level in this manner. The interviewers&#xD;
           will carry a separate dummy questionnaire for use in situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviews and discussion sessions will only be conducted in a private setting. Only&#xD;
           children under 2 will be permitted to be present. If necessary, locations outside the&#xD;
           household where the interview can be conducted in private will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will be free to reschedule (or relocate) the interview or session to a&#xD;
           time (or place) that may be more safe or convenient for her.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interviewers will be trained to terminate or change the subject of discussion if an&#xD;
           interview or discussion is interrupted by anyone. During the interview, the interviewer&#xD;
           will forewarn the respondent that she will terminate or change the topic of conversation&#xD;
           if the interview is interrupted, and will be able to skip to these questions at any&#xD;
           point if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Harmful publicity During dissemination of study findings care will be taken to highlight the&#xD;
      extent to which violence against women is cross cutting, existing in all communities and&#xD;
      socioeconomic groups. Particular attention will be paid to ensuring that the findings are not&#xD;
      used as a means to describe one setting or group as being worse than another.&#xD;
