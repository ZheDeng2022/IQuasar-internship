  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to characterize the curcumin metabolites of 2 different&#xD;
      capsule formulations of curcumin relative to unformulated Curcuma longa extract of Rhizomes&#xD;
      including assessing relative bioavailability and absorption/kinetic profile of curcumonoids&#xD;
      and their metabolites in human plasma and urine after acute consumption.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized, 3-arm, double-blinded, within subject cross-over trial focused on&#xD;
      understanding pharmacokinetic profile of curcuminoids and their metabolites after intake of&#xD;
      curcumin supplement with different capsule formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A planned sample size of 6 will be enrolled into the study. This study will require one&#xD;
      initial screening visit and 3 weekly visits. This study will take approximately 4 weeks per&#xD;
      subject to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial screening visit will provide subject with the informed consent document and&#xD;
      determine subject eligibility through anthropometric measurements, vital signs, fasting blood&#xD;
      glucose test (finger prick), and completion of a survey relate to general eating, health, and&#xD;
      exercise habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If willing and eligible to participate, subjects will be invited to participate in the study&#xD;
      for 3 study days. Subjects will be instructed to maintain their usual diet pattern and&#xD;
      physical activity throughout study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will arrive at the center in a fasted state for at least 10 hours, well hydrated and&#xD;
      rested. Each study visit will require blood draws throughout the visit. After evaluation of&#xD;
      subject's health status (via anthropometric, vital sign and blood glucose measurements and&#xD;
      in-person interview), a Licensed health Care Professional will place a catheter in subject's&#xD;
      arm for the purpose of multiple blood sample collections and take the initial blood draw in&#xD;
      the fasting state. Subjects will be randomized to receive a curcumin supplement based on&#xD;
      randomized treatment sequences for 3 study visits immediately after fasting blood draw. The&#xD;
      sequences of receiving the supplement at each visit will be randomly assigned based on&#xD;
      treatment sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study visit will involve with blood samples collection at time points 0 (fasting), 0.5,&#xD;
      1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hour (h) for assessment of change in plasma curcuminoids and metabolites. A&#xD;
      standard breakfast will be provided immediately after the 0.5 h blood collection and standard&#xD;
      lunch after 6 h blood collection. Urine samples will be collected at 0 (fasting), 4 and 8 h.&#xD;
