      The PREdiCCt Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a major study that is now being launched. This is the first study of its kind and is&#xD;
      specifically directed toward understanding how environmental factors and the gut&#xD;
      microorganisms influence IBD flare and recovery. For the PREdiCCt study, the investigators&#xD;
      hope to recruit 3100 people in remission from Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis (illness&#xD;
      under control) from 28 inflammatory bowel disease clinics across the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to conduct the study in the following stages;-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
           unclassified (IBDU) in clinical remission (under control) will be approached in&#xD;
           gastroenterology clinics across the country and invited to take part in the PREdiCCt&#xD;
           study. Alternatively they will express their interest in the study after seeing PREdiCCt&#xD;
           promotional leaflets/posters/videos/social media.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants will attend a clinic visit for routine tests and also to complete several&#xD;
           questionnaires with a research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At home over the next week participants will complete detailed questionnaires assessing&#xD;
           their environment and diet. Participants will also collect a stool and saliva sample and&#xD;
           send this to our laboratories (the investigators have developed easy ways of doing this&#xD;
           reliably by post). The stool sample is to analyse the microorganisms in the&#xD;
           participant's gut and the saliva is used to analyse their DNA. In addition to this the&#xD;
           participants are asked to complete a 4-day weighed food diary. The food diary is sent to&#xD;
           the University of Aberdeen for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Investigators will then follow patients' progress over 24 months. They will be asked to&#xD;
           complete a short questionnaire every month with a longer questionnaire after 12 months&#xD;
           and culminating in a final questionnaire 24 months after their initial clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If a participant experiences a flare, investigators will collect an additional stool&#xD;
           sample; but most importantly investigators will look to see how the environmental and&#xD;
           microorganism factors recorded at the beginning differ for those that flare up versus&#xD;
           those that don't.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What investigators hope to achieve;-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Finding out the environmental and dietary factors for patients to avoid because they&#xD;
           trigger flare.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Finding out behaviours for patients to adopt because they bring about remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Finding out what the microorganisms that predict flare look like.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Gaining information which helps future studies aimed at finding better diets for IBD&#xD;
           sufferers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Developing ways of gathering information online from IBD patients about their well-being&#xD;
           that doctors can routinely use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have assembled expert doctors, epidemiologists, microbiologists, nutrition&#xD;
      scientists, and bioinformaticians. These experts will use the systems the investigators have&#xD;
      put in place to make sure PREdiCCt succeeds. It will yield a lot of new information to help&#xD;
      sufferers right away; but the information will also help to kick start many important future&#xD;
      studies that will bring us ever closer to a cure for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common cause of chronic ill-health among young people&#xD;
      in the UK (prevalence estimated at 1 in 200 for adults and 1 in 2000 for children, with a&#xD;
      peak incidence in the second and third decades of life)1-2. The major forms of IBD, namely&#xD;
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), all too often confer a lifetime of&#xD;
      unpleasant, intrusive and potentially dangerous burden of intestinal inflammation on&#xD;
      individuals. Typical symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhoea, weight loss, and lethargy.&#xD;
      These adversely affect schooling, work attainment, psycho-social well-being and sexual health&#xD;
      3-4. IBD costs the NHS £720 million per year, based on an average per patient cost of £3,000;&#xD;
      of which half of the costs are directly attributable to relapsing patients 5. Healthcare&#xD;
      expenditure focus in IBD is shifting from hospitalisation and surgery to medical therapy 6.&#xD;
      However, existing treatment modalities remain limited by lack of efficacy, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity and poor patient acceptability. Major surgical intervention is frequently required&#xD;
      (&gt;50% in CD; ~20% in UC), with a high risk of disease recurrence, and there is an increased&#xD;
      risk of cancer (in CD), with the highest incidence of colon cancer observed in those patients&#xD;
      with poorly controlled disease 7. Nevertheless, there is a wide spectrum of disease severity.&#xD;
      Around one third of patients will follow a relatively quiescent disease course 8.&#xD;
      Understanding who gets severe, progressive disease and why, is an urgent research priority.&#xD;
      Accurate prediction of these patients will enable precise, tailored intervention early in the&#xD;
      disease course. This should reduce the substantial morbidity and costs associated with IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetics, Environment and the Microbiota and Disease Natural History.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic factors play a modest role in defining disease location and extent but not disease&#xD;
      behaviour 9-12. There is very limited evidence about the gut microbiota in disease&#xD;
      progression, although emerging data support a potential role in treatment response. We cannot&#xD;
      alter our genes and, despite intense interest in modifying the gut microbiota (e.g. faecal&#xD;
      transplantation) there is only limited clinically data to support this 13-14. However, it is&#xD;
      within our control to change what we eat and to therefore potentially modify our gut&#xD;
      microbiota to a more favourable phenotype. Patients suspect this should be part of the&#xD;
      answer: one of the commonest questions in the clinic is, &quot;What should I eat?&quot; Established&#xD;
      clinical strategies include the use of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) to induce remission&#xD;
      in CD, and a low fibre diet to alleviate obstructive symptoms in stricturing disease 15.&#xD;
      However, beyond this there is presently very limited data to support any on-going specific&#xD;
      dietary strategy for the vast majority of patients with IBD 16. Multiple lines of emerging&#xD;
      evidence in animal models suggest that diets high in natural plant fibres favour an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory gut milieu, via alterations in the gut microbiota, measurable by&#xD;
      short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations in stool 17. Dietary fibre may protect against&#xD;
      the development of IBD, through several mechanisms, through its conversion to acetate,&#xD;
      butyrate and propionate (the major SCFAs). Firstly, butyrate is the main energy source for&#xD;
      colonocytes and is associated with the maintenance of the intestinal epithelium 18. Secondly,&#xD;
      SCFAs have immunomodulatory roles including inhibition of the transcription factor NF-KB and&#xD;
      are the only known ligands of G-protein-coupled receptor, GPR43, which limits the&#xD;
      inflammatory response 19-20. Interestingly, the fermentation of fibre is dependent on gut&#xD;
      microbiota, such as Bacteroidetes species, which are deficient in patients with IBD 21. The&#xD;
      individual source of fibre may also be important. In the US Nurses' Health Study of 170,776&#xD;
      women with 3,317,425 person-years of follow-up over 26 years there were 269 incident cases of&#xD;
      Crohn's disease diagnosed and 338 cases of ulcerative colitis 22. For the latter illness,&#xD;
      there were no associations with either total dietary fibre intake or fibre from any specific&#xD;
      food groups. However, for Crohn's disease the highest quintile of energy-adjusted cumulative&#xD;
      average dietary fibre intake, namely 24.3 g/day, was associated with a 41% reduction in risk&#xD;
      compared with the lowest quintile (hazard ratio (HR) =0.59, 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      (CI=)=0.39-0.90). This reduction was associated with the fibre content from fruits (highest&#xD;
      vs. lowest quintile HR=0.57, 95% CI=0.38-0.85) with no associations detected between fibre&#xD;
      from vegetables, cereals or legumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These are important issues; the lack of data means patients may resort to untested and&#xD;
      potentially harmful 'fad' diets 16. More pressingly, this is potentially a novel therapeutic&#xD;
      approach to both induce and maintain prolonged remission. Interventional studies in cases and&#xD;
      controls will be necessary, but first further data are required from observational&#xD;
      epidemiological studies to inform which 'interventions' are indicated and/or justified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is presently very hard to predict which IBD patients in remission will flare and when.&#xD;
      Scant data are available to advise patients on any substantial lifestyle measure they can&#xD;
      adopt to help prevent or retard future disease from flaring. Potential areas of direct&#xD;
      relevance to patients are aspects of habitual diet, regular exercise, sleep and stress,&#xD;
      including that from major life events. It is hypothesised that there are multiple factors in&#xD;
      habitual diet that are associated with increased risk of disease flare, including reduced&#xD;
      levels of dietary fibre, high levels of n-6 PUFAs, low levels of n-3 PUFAs and dietary&#xD;
      emulsifiers. High levels of regular physical activity are also hypothesised to reduce the&#xD;
      rates of disease flare. These dietary aspects and facets in concert with other lifestyle&#xD;
      factors may contribute in part to the intestinal dysbiosis associated with flare, where the&#xD;
      investigators anticipate seeing a reduction in microbial diversity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major aim of this study is to identify the environmental and gut microbiota factors that&#xD;
      predispose to disease flare and influence disease outcomes in IBD. Further, the investigators&#xD;
      aim to build intelligent predictive models of disease behaviour and prognosis combining&#xD;
      phenotypic, environmental and biological data inputs of direct clinical utility.&#xD;
