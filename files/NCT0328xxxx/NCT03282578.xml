      Introduction/Background Information Since the inception of cardiac surgery in the early&#xD;
      1960s, division of the sternum has provided the superior access to cardiac structures.&#xD;
      Cardiac surgery may involve treatment of the coronary arteries, valves or major vessels such&#xD;
      as the ascending aorta. In children, correction of congenital malformations is also&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conventional bone fixation during the 1960s was the placement of stainless steel wires&#xD;
      around or through the sternum, predominantly as single wires which were tensioned by&#xD;
      twisting. In the 1980s, it became fashionable for some cardiac surgeons to pass the wire&#xD;
      twice around the bone (as would be the case repairing a fence on a farm), so-called &quot;figure&#xD;
      of 8&quot; configuration and tensioning again occurring by twisting the wires. There have been no&#xD;
      adequate studies investigating which of these two techniques may be superior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In simple terms, bone healing is promoted by&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minimising movement of the bone edges at the fracture site and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improved alignment of the bone edges&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sternum is a connecting bone that moves in multiple planes to transfer load and position&#xD;
      the limbs in space during every day functional tasks and respond to the demands of&#xD;
      respiration. The healing of the sternum is in the context of many efforts by the treating&#xD;
      physicians and physiotherapists to encourage activities that might cause distracting forces&#xD;
      at the sternal fracture site. Additionally, simple everyday activities by the patient such as&#xD;
      coughing, deep breathing, sneezing, transferring in and out of bed, turning over in bed and&#xD;
      driving all lead to substantial distracting forces acting on the sternal fracture site1.&#xD;
      External fixation is not encouraged because the patient needs to have significant chest wall&#xD;
      movement in order to breathe and clear sputum as part of the recovery from surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, ultrasound data suggests an additional mechanism by which sternal healing is&#xD;
      compromised with conventional sternal wiring techniques. The shape of the sternum is complex&#xD;
      1. The upper part is called the manubrium to which the clavicles and first rib join, and is&#xD;
      generally quite thick with a reasonably robust and cortex and strong marrow. By contrast, the&#xD;
      body of the sternum which forms the majority of the sternum is thinner and the marrow is&#xD;
      frequently less robust than for the manubrium. In both areas, the cortical bone is present&#xD;
      superficially (anterior) and deep (posterior) with the marrow between. When sternal wires are&#xD;
      used, and the two halves of the sternum brought together and tensioned by twisting the wires,&#xD;
      best efforts made to ensure that the cortical bone edges on either side are opposed or well&#xD;
      aligned (that is, that in the anterior and posterior direction that the two bone edges from&#xD;
      either side of well opposed). Generally, this is quite well achieved, but not always. Yet,&#xD;
      even with ultrasound studies performed 1 or 2 days after surgery, the alignment between the&#xD;
      anterior cortical bone edge on either side is lost as detected by the cortical bone of one&#xD;
      side overriding the cortical bone of the other side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implications of this ultrasound finding are twofold&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Irrespective of the perfect alignment of the two sides of the sternal fracture at the&#xD;
           time of surgery under general anaesthetic, coughing and deep breathing usually leads to&#xD;
           distraction forces that results in one side of the divided sternum overriding the other&#xD;
           side, typically by a couple of millimetres or so. This must be because there is less&#xD;
           bone to bone force when the cortical bone edge is being forced against soft tissue or&#xD;
           against the marrow than it would be if it were forced against the cortical bone of the&#xD;
           other side. This is important because any distracting force caused by coughing or deep&#xD;
           breathing or indeed any other activity should logically, result in the two halves of the&#xD;
           sternal bone adopting a position of least force.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What this means is that the two halves of the sternum in combination (and after over&#xD;
           riding has occurred) are now less wide than they had been at the time that the sternal&#xD;
           wire was tensioned at the end of the surgical procedure, by the distance of the sternal&#xD;
           override detected by the ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequences of poor sternal healing: Patients may feel movement of the sternum and that may&#xD;
      limit their activity. However, chronic sternal instability is associated with pain 2, which&#xD;
      may in turn affect other aspects of daily living, require long term medications and&#xD;
      predispose to depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SternaLock 360 system The SternaLock 360 system is a band and plating system designed to&#xD;
      improve sternal stability. 3 bands surround the sternum to oppose the bones (like wires), but&#xD;
      an additional 3 plate system prevents anterior posterior displacement and provides a rigid&#xD;
      fixation. CT scan follow up shows improved bone healing at 3 months after surgery compared to&#xD;
      conventional wires, but the CT scan is a poor measurement of dynamic movement. Quality of&#xD;
      recovery and functional status has not been adequately studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unique design of the SternaLock 360 system, is that it combines a&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compressive force to the two sternal halves forcing them together (similar to the&#xD;
           principal of the sternal wires), thus counteracting lateral distracting forces.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Additionally, by the placement of metal plates that cross the fracture and are fixed on&#xD;
           either side by screws, predominantly the plates acts to prevent anterior/posterior&#xD;
           distracting forces; longitudinal translation and thus better maintain the cortical bone&#xD;
           to cortical bone apposition between the two sides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot Data Our research group is experienced in assessing sternal motion with ultrasound 4.&#xD;
      We have conducted sternal ultrasound measurements of sternal motion after surgery as part of&#xD;
      clinical follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over all the SternaLock 360 results in a far greater rigid fixation as noted at the time of&#xD;
      surgical implantation. Subsequent pilot ultrasound studies performed during dynamic&#xD;
      distracting forces (such as coughing) reveal reduced or absent movement at the fracture site&#xD;
      and better preservation of fracture alignment. Ultrasounds have been performed at varying&#xD;
      intervals from Day 1 post-operative to 6 weeks post-operative, and ultrasounds of sternal&#xD;
      wire fixation have been performed at varying intervals after 10 months post-operative. Our&#xD;
      observations are that fewer than 10% of patients who have received the SternaLock 360 have&#xD;
      had motion &gt;2 mm, whereas patients with conventional wiring have motion &gt; 2 mm in more than&#xD;
      50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence Gap The SternaLock 360 is an effective system for closing the sternum. There are few&#xD;
      comparative data investigating bone healing with CT scans, but the CT alone is a poor&#xD;
      indicator of sternal instability. There is no long term comparative data on sternal micro&#xD;
      motion, or quality of recovery outcomes to identify whether the SternaLock 360 system will&#xD;
      improve patient centred outcomes over and above improved bone healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives Hypothesis Use of the SternaLock 360 will reduce the incidence of sternal&#xD;
      motion &gt; 2mm by absolute difference of 40% at 6 weeks of surgery compared to stainless steel&#xD;
      wiring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of the SternaLock 360 will improve bone healing and quality of recovery after surgery&#xD;
      compared to stainless steel wiring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims To determine if the SternaLock 360 system reduces sternal instability, increases&#xD;
      bone healing, and improves quality of recovery compared to stainless steel wiring of the&#xD;
      sternum, after cardiac surgery involving median sternotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation The randomization sequence will be produced using a computer generated&#xD;
      randomization sequence, in unequal blocks. Concealment will be by placing the card containing&#xD;
      the allocation information in double opaque sealed envelopes, and concealment will be&#xD;
      maintained until after recruitment and the patients is admitted to the operating theatre. The&#xD;
      treating surgical team will then open the envelopes to reveal the allocation after (1)&#xD;
      weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass and (2) final confirmation from the treating surgeon that&#xD;
      the patient is suitable to be randomised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods Participants who are scheduled for cardiac surgery will be screened and&#xD;
      recruited from the cardiac surgery operation lists, surgeon's clinics and pre-operative ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial contact will be made in person during the first contact session prior to surgery.&#xD;
      In-patients scheduled for cardiac surgery will be screened on the ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical histories will be reviewed and screened for participant suitability and eligibility.&#xD;
      Once the patient's medical history has been reviewed and the patient's eligibility has been&#xD;
      confirmed, the patient is then approached by the research staff member and the process of&#xD;
      informed consent will proceed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Calculation and Study Size Sample size estimates are based on the primary outcome of&#xD;
      sternal motion &gt; 2 mm at any location at 6 weeks after surgery. From pilot data, fewer than&#xD;
      10% of patients who have received the SternaLock 360 have had motion &gt;2 mm, whereas patients&#xD;
      with conventional wiring have motion &gt; 2 mm in more than 50%. Based on a Fischer's Exact&#xD;
      test, Alpha of 0.05, power of 80% and two-tailed design, 25 participants are required in each&#xD;
      group to detect a difference of 50% to 10% between groups, favoring the SternaLock 360&#xD;
      system. The sample size will increase to 26 in each group to account for an estimated 5%&#xD;
      dropout rate. The total number will be 52 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods To Be Undertaken The primary endpoint will be assessed using the Chi&#xD;
      Squared test on the incidence of sternal motion &gt; 2 mm at 6 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Quality of Recovery Variables of &quot;recovery&quot; are dichotomized to &quot;recovered&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;not recovered&quot; based on whether they have returned to their baseline (preoperative) values&#xD;
      or a better result than their preoperative values; at each of the time points when&#xD;
      measurements are performed. A tolerance factor is included in the scoring of cognitive&#xD;
      recovery to allow for performance variability 6. The secondary outcomes of recovery over&#xD;
      time, analysis will be performed using the a general linear mixed model to investigate group&#xD;
      differences over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous data will be analyzed using independent samples t test, or repeated measures&#xD;
      analysis of variance (RM ANOVA). A P[Symbol]0.05 will define statistical significance.&#xD;
