      Main Objective: To identify changes in metabolic control of type 2 diabetes in patients of&#xD;
      the Catalan national health system during 2007-2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Follow-up of a population with type 2 diabetes during 7 years (2007-2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants: Approximately 300,000 people with a clinical record in the SIDIAP&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source: SIDIAP database. Variables and measurements: Age, gender, time since diagnosis of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, associated cardiovascular risk factors, micro- and macrovascular&#xD;
      complications of diabetes, causes of mortality, treatment for hyperglycaemia and for&#xD;
      modifiable risk factors, other conditions related to diabetes and its management. The&#xD;
      economic costs of diabetes during the study period will also be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: The clinical variables will be described and 95% confidence intervals will be&#xD;
      calculated for the main variables associated with the study outcomes. Missing values will&#xD;
      count as non-existing data and missing value imputation will not be used in the analysis. If&#xD;
      a subgroup of patients is considered of particular interest, sub analyses will be carried&#xD;
      out. Predictive variables of good metabolic control and of complications and mortality of&#xD;
      diabetes will be analyzed with the hazard ratios for each factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applicability: The results related to control of diabetes will serve as a basis for improving&#xD;
      metabolic control and decreasing chronic complications and to optimize cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: A long-term study of a population receiving usual treatment is required to&#xD;
      understand the changes in indicators of metabolic control, morbidity and mortality and in the&#xD;
      management of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations: Those associated with the use of large population databases.&#xD;

      Main Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To determine the changes in metabolic control of type 2 diabetes during 2007-2013 in&#xD;
      patients of the main Catalan public health provider (Catalan Health Service-CHS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe changes in HbA1c values in the Catalan population with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
           during 2007-2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe changes and control of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (blood&#xD;
           pressure, lipid profile, smoking and obesity) in the Catalan population with type 2&#xD;
           diabetes during 2007-2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify factors associated with changes in HbA1c and in the variables of metabolic&#xD;
           control during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe changes in the prevalence of macrovascular (ischemic heart disease,&#xD;
           cerebrovascular accident, peripheral arterial disease) and microvascular complications&#xD;
           (kidney disease, retinopathy) in the Catalan population with type 2 diabetes during&#xD;
           2007-2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe changes in mortality in the Catalan population with type 2 diabetes during&#xD;
           2007-2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyse the main costs of diabetes in Catalonia during 2007-2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe changes in the use of hypoglycaemic agents in the Catalan population with&#xD;
           type 2 diabetes during 2007-2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe changes in the use of medicines to control cardiovascular risk factors&#xD;
           (antihypertensive, hypolipidemic and antiplatelet agents) during 2007-2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis During 2007-2013 the metabolic control of type 2 diabetes patients in the public&#xD;
      health system of Catalonia (CHS) improves. The management of type 2 diabetes incorporates new&#xD;
      pharmacological treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Longitudinal study with cross-sectional, yearly analysis for each year of the&#xD;
      study period (2007-2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference Population and Study Population A longitudinal study with a cross-sectional yearly&#xD;
      analysis on June 30 of each year (DTALL) in those patients with a verified type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      diagnosis will be carried out with SIDIAP data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observation period will be the calendar years 2007 (baseline), 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011,&#xD;
      2012 and 2013 (final).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SIDIAP database includes the following information of the 5.8 million people from the 282&#xD;
      primary care centres of the Catalan Health Service linked with a unique, anonymized personal&#xD;
      identifier:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Information from the electronic clinical records (eCAP): demographic data, visits to the&#xD;
           primary care centre, health conditions (codes ICD-10), clinical variables,&#xD;
           prescriptions, immunizations and referrals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood tests results: will be directly retrieved from the laboratories databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Information on the medication dispensed in pharmacies: obtained from the pharmacy&#xD;
           billing database of the Catalan Health Institute (CatSalut).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Information Sources The data sources are constituted by the electronic&#xD;
      clinical records, blood tests results, the pharmacy register of the SIDIAP database and&#xD;
      mortality data from AQuAS (Health Quality and Evaluation Agency of Catalonia)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the study does not target any specific treatment and no specific medication is&#xD;
      considered an exposure therapy under investigation, no definition of exposure to any&#xD;
      medication is included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be performed on study patients meeting inclusion criteria. The clinical&#xD;
      variables will be described in terms of absolute and relative frequency for qualitative&#xD;
      variables. Central tendency and dispersion measures will be used to describe quantitative&#xD;
      variables as appropriate and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the main&#xD;
      variables associated with the study outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical tests will be used to compare the distribution of risk factors over time (DTALL):&#xD;
      ANOVA will be used for normally distributed quantitative variables, the non-parametric&#xD;
      equivalent (Kruskal-Wallis) will be used for non-normally distributed variables, and&#xD;
      chi-square test will be used for categorical variables. The P value of the linear trend over&#xD;
      the different time periods will be calculated for each variable. The cost associated with&#xD;
      diabetes will be calculated for each time cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The likelihood-ratio test will be used to test for interaction between the study variables&#xD;
      (eg, HbA1c or cardiovascular events) in nested models with the terms of interaction included&#xD;
      or removed. To analyse changes over time of variables to control diabetes in the study&#xD;
      cohorts from 2007 to 2013, repeated measures ANCOVA and multinomial logistic regression&#xD;
      analysis will be used for quantitative and categorical variables, respectively. These models&#xD;
      will be then be adjusted for potential confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence rate per year will used to analyse the frequency of events during the follow-up&#xD;
      period (eg. ischaemic heart disease, stroke). The Cox proportional hazard model will be&#xD;
      adjusted for potential confounders. Linearity and risk proportionality will be graphically&#xD;
      verified in every model using mean weighted residuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing values will count as non-existing data and missing value imputation will not be used&#xD;
      in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical comparisons will be performed using two-tail hypothesis testing with level of&#xD;
      significance of 0.05. Data management will be conducted by IDIAP Jordi Gol personnel using&#xD;
      the SIDIAP database and data analysis will be conducted by epidemiologists and statisticians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Limitations The main limitations of the study derive from the quality of the register&#xD;
      of big databases. Previous studies with the SIDIAP showed the validity of most of the&#xD;
      variables used in the current protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality The study will follow the International Guidelines for Ethical Review of&#xD;
      Epidemiological Studies (Council for the International Organizations of Medical Sciences&#xD;
      -CIOMS-, Geneva, 1991), and the Declaration of Helsinki (revision 64th WMA General Assembly,&#xD;
      Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management, communication and transfer of data of the participants will comply with the&#xD;
      Protection of Personal Data Organic Law of December 13, 15/1999.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amendments in the study protocol will be communicated in writing to all investigators and to&#xD;
      the appointed Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CREC) and to the competent authorities&#xD;
      according to the order sas / 3470/2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk-benefit assessment The current study involves solely access to a database where the data&#xD;
      are anonymized and unlinked. It does not carry therefore any risk for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Confidentiality All information in the SIDIAP database is anonymized and unlinked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of electronic data Data extraction will be carried out from the SIDIAP electronic&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up and final reports A final report with the results obtained will be reviewed and&#xD;
      approved by the IDIAP Jordi Gol researchers. No interim reports are anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The report should be written following dates in the workplan; a copy of the report will be&#xD;
      sent to the Clinical Research Ethics Committee that has authorised the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditions of Publication The results of this retrospective, observational study will be&#xD;
      published in international journals with mention of the Clinical Research Ethics Committee&#xD;
      and the sources of funding. None of the investigators will communicate to any third party the&#xD;
      results of the study before final results and interpretation have been agreed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CREC) The IDIAP Jordi Gol CREC will evaluate this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conflict of Interests AstraZENECA will provide funding through a contract with the IDIAP&#xD;
      Jordi Gol Foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AstraZENECA will not interfere in data extraction, analysis and presentation of reports. The&#xD;
      funding is unlinked to the results of the study.&#xD;
