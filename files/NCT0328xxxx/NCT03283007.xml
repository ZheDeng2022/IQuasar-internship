      Lung transplantation (TxP) is now a validated treatment of end-stage pulmonary diseases, but&#xD;
      long-term graft and patient survival are still hampered by the development of chronic&#xD;
      allograft dysfunction (CLAD) affecting &gt; 50% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a phase III clinical randomized trial that will assess&#xD;
      the efficacy of Nintedanib to hamper the lung decline in LTx recipients with BOS. This is the&#xD;
      first trial testing this molecule in lung Tx recipients. If case of demonstrated&#xD;
      effectiveness of Nintedanib, the benefit for lung transplant patients carrying a BO is high&#xD;
      in terms of stabilization of lung function and enhancement of survival.&#xD;

      Introduction: Lung transplantation (TxP) is now a validated treatment of end-stage pulmonary&#xD;
      diseases, but long-term graft and patient survival are still hampered by the development of&#xD;
      chronic allograft dysfunction (CLAD) affecting &gt; 50% of patients. Obliterative bronchiolitis&#xD;
      (OB), the obstructive CLAD, is the most common manifestation of CLAD, and affects &gt; 50% of&#xD;
      recipients who survive the early post-transplant period. OB is thought to arise from repeated&#xD;
      injury to graft epithelial cells, leading to fibrous scarring and obliteration of the small&#xD;
      airway lumen, as a result of dysregulated fibrotic repair and loss of peribronchial&#xD;
      microvasculature. The patchy histopathologic distribution at onset makes it difficult to&#xD;
      confirm histopathologically the diagnosis of OB from lung specimens. Hence, bronchiolitis&#xD;
      obliterans syndrome (BOS) has become a generally accepted surrogate diagnostic of OB,&#xD;
      characterized physiologically by progressive airflow limitation, with a median monthly&#xD;
      decline of FEV1 of about 50 ml. Survival after onset of BOS is poor, reported as &lt; 50% at 3&#xD;
      years after onset of disease, due to end-stage respiratory failure. Thus far, there is&#xD;
      currently no approved treatment to stabilize BOS disease, and especially no treatment&#xD;
      addressing the fibrotic lung graft manifestation of BOS. The crucial role of a dysregulated&#xD;
      fibrotic repair has now been demonstrated in BOS, with the following: (i) Architectural&#xD;
      remodelling with fibrosis and scarring of airways involving myofibroblasts; (ii) Increased&#xD;
      extracellular matrix synthetic; (iii) Epithelial-mesenchymal transition mechanism; (iv) Role&#xD;
      of growth factors PDGF, VEGF, FGF, and IGF-1 shown in BO mechanisms (animals and humans&#xD;
      studies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data strongly suggest the potential role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) that&#xD;
      target these growth factors involved in the post-TxP BO. In this axis, the new TKI&#xD;
      Nintedanib, which has recently been demonstrated as effective in the treatment of idiopathic&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in large-scale randomized studies (8) appears as a candidate&#xD;
      molecule capable of stopping the fibroproliferative process and stabilize the development of&#xD;
      a CLAD after TxP. Whereas Nintedanib is a validated and available treatment in patients with&#xD;
      IPF, paucity of data are currently available in lung-transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: to assess Nintedanib efficacy in the reduction of the rate of decline of&#xD;
      FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 sec) in BOS post-LTx at a dose of 150 mg twice daily&#xD;
      (bid) compared to placebo over 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: to assess Nintedanib efficacy and tolerance in the treatment of BOS&#xD;
      grade 0p-1-2 post-lung transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design: a 2 groups parallel, randomized, prospective multicentric&#xD;
      placebo-controlled phase III trial to assess Nintedanib superiority versus placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible LTx recipients with BOS are to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either&#xD;
      Nintedanib 150 mg BID or the matching placebo treatment for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up of patients with BOS included in the trial will be similar to usual and&#xD;
      standard care in both arms of the study (Nintedanib group and placebo group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group is expected to be beneficial compared to the placebo group.&#xD;
