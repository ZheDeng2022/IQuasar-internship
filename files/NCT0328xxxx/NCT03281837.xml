  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is among the most common causes of musculoskeletal pain and&#xD;
      disability. At present, there is no cure for OA. Therefore, the primary aims of therapy are&#xD;
      to reduce pain, maintain or improve function and mobility, and prevent or slow the&#xD;
      progression of adverse changes to the joint tissues, while keeping potential therapeutic&#xD;
      toxicities to a minimum. Current treatment guidelines begin with non-pharmacologic&#xD;
      modalities, such as patient education, weight loss, and physical therapy. Several&#xD;
      exercise-based therapeutic approaches, such as aerobic exercise programs, range-of-motion&#xD;
      exercises, and muscle-strengthening exercises are recommended and have shown clinical benefit&#xD;
      in randomized, controlled clinical trials. However, non-pharmacologic approaches frequently&#xD;
      provide insufficient pain relief and restoration of function and mobility, and pharmacologic&#xD;
      modalities become necessary. Although simple analgesics such as acetaminophen provide relief&#xD;
      for many OA subjects with mild to moderate pain, alternatives should be considered for&#xD;
      subjects who fail to obtain adequate symptomatic relief with these measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This post-market, single blind, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical study is&#xD;
      designed to enroll a relatively young, active population of subjects with patellofemoral&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (PFOA) and/or tibiofemoral osteoarthritis (TFOA), and to compare responses to&#xD;
      treatment with 2 weekly intra-articular (IA) hyaluronan (HA) injections, with each injection&#xD;
      given 1 week apart, of HYMOVIS combined with a physical exercise program (PEP) to PEP alone.&#xD;
      Because PEP or exercise programs may be considered the first line standard of care in OA knee&#xD;
      pain, particularly in younger, active patients, the hypothesis of the study is that Hymovis&#xD;
      combined with PEP program provides greater relief of pain associated with knee OA in the&#xD;
      enrolled study subjects than with use of PEP alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study provides for subjects randomized to the PEP alone study group to cross over to&#xD;
      HYMOVIS+PEP if improvement has not been achieved by the 3 month follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited over an 18 month period. The duration of the trial per center will&#xD;
      be approximately 27 months. This includes the enrollment period of 6 months, the follow-up&#xD;
      period at 3 and 6 months and the additional follow-up period for patients who crossed-over;&#xD;
      they will be followed for an additional 6 months following the initial 3month follow-up. The&#xD;
      trial will end when the last subject makes the last visit.&#xD;
