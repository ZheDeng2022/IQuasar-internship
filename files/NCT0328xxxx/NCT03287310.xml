  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3511294 is a humanized monoclonal antibody antagonist of Interleukin (IL)-5 which is known&#xD;
      to block binding of IL-5 to the IL-5 receptor complex, causing a reduction in the circulating&#xD;
      population of eosinophils. This is a single ascending dose FTIH study to investigate safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of GSK3511294,&#xD;
      administered SC in subjects with mild to moderate asthma maintained on a low-medium daily&#xD;
      dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or ICS/long acting beta-agonist (LABA), and short&#xD;
      acting beta-agonist (SABA). The subjects will attend a pre-screen visit of up to 12 weeks&#xD;
      before dosing for assessment of blood eosinophils. Eligible subjects with blood eosinophils&#xD;
      &gt;=200 cells per microliter (cells/µL) will undergo a screening period of up to 4 weeks. The&#xD;
      subjects will then be randomized into 5 cohorts. In each cohort, the subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive a single dose of GSK3511294 or placebo in a ratio of 3:1. The follow-up&#xD;
      period will be up to 40 weeks post dose and will be dose-dependent. The scheduled maximum&#xD;
      duration for each subject will be up to 44 weeks including up to 28 days of screening.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a multi-center, double-blind study in which subjects will be allocated to five cohorts. The subjects in each cohort will be randomized to receive GSK3511294 and placebo in a ratio of 3:1. In each cohort, dosing will be staggered: one subject will receive GSK3511294 and one subject will receive placebo at least 72 hours before the remaining subjects in that cohort are dosed. The remaining subjects will be dosed if the review of all safety data up to 72 hours after dosing of the first two subjects in each cohort is satisfactory.</intervention_model_description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; other important medical events that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed before; is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function.</description>

        <description>12-lead ECG were performed in a supine position using an automated ECG machine that calculated PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval and QTcF interval. ECG measurements were performed in triplicate. When multiple ECGs were performed at the same planned timepoint, the average value of each parameter was used. Baseline was defined as latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline was defined as post-dose visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

Baseline is defined as the latest predose non-missing blood eosinophil count. Ratio to Baseline is defined as post-dose visit value divided by Baseline value.

        <description>Urine samples were collected to analyze presence of ketones, occult blood, glucose, and protein in urine. In this dipstick test, the level of occult blood, glucose, ketones and urine protein in urine samples were recorded as negative, trace, 1+ and 2+ indicating proportional concentrations in urine.

        <title>Urine Potential of Hydrogen (pH) Analysis by Dipstick Method</title>
        <description>Urinary pH measurement is a routine part of urinalysis. Urine pH is an acid-base measurement. pH is measured on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 14; values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acid pH (5.0 - 6.0).</description>
