  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how early cognitive training (participation/involvement&#xD;
      in activities to stimulate the brain) in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) affects the number of&#xD;
      patients who experience delirium (confusion) and cognitive impairment (problems with&#xD;
      thinking). Reports have shown that 30% to 80% of all ICU patients will have some type of&#xD;
      cognitive impairment: remembering, paying attention, solving problems, organizing, and&#xD;
      working on complex tasks for some time after they leave the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occupational therapy will do an assessment after an order is received from the doctor. The&#xD;
      patient will be randomly placed into one of two groups. If the patient is in group A then&#xD;
      they will continue with occupational therapy as normal. If the patient is assigned to group B&#xD;
      then they and the family will have access to an activity cart found there in the ICU unit,&#xD;
      directed by the nurses. The family will work with the patient on a daily basis to complete&#xD;
      activities that are appropriate for the patient based on the occupational therapist's&#xD;
      assessment. All patients in the study will receive medical care as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about the patient's recovery in the hospital will be collected. In addition,&#xD;
      patients and/or their family member will complete surveys at 6 months and 1 year after&#xD;
      enrollment to see how they have recovered and if there are continuing issues. The two groups&#xD;
      of patients, those who received the early cognitive training and those who did not, will be&#xD;
      compared statistically to see if there are any differences in how well they recovered. Since&#xD;
      this intervention involving family members working with the patient has not previously been&#xD;
      evaluated, the study will also examine the feasibility of conducting these activities in the&#xD;
      ICU setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will assess the feasibility of implementing a randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      testing an early cognitive training program for patients in the ICU. This cognitive training&#xD;
      program was developed at Mount Carmel Health System in conjunction with occupational&#xD;
      therapists and has not been previously evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To evaluate whether the trial can accrue a sufficient number of patients&#xD;
      within a reasonable time period to complete a randomized trial for efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate whether the trial can be conducted as designed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the likelihood that the trial can retain a sufficient number of&#xD;
      patients through the end of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments include the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (MoCA), Richmond Agitation and&#xD;
      Sedation Scale (RASS), Confusion Assessment Method in the ICU (CAM-ICU) and a validated&#xD;
      quality of life survey.&#xD;
