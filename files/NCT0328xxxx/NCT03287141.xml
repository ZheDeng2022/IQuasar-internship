    <textblock>
      Introduction: Dyspnea and fatigue are the main clinical symptoms of heart failure and&#xD;
      primarily responsible for exercise intolerance found in this syndrome. Now, It is known that&#xD;
      the use of NIV in CPAP mode applied before exercise increases exercise tolerance in people&#xD;
      with heart failure; however, it's not yet known if the bi-level mode is able to generate&#xD;
      similar or even better results, due to pressure increase of the ventilatory support in this&#xD;
      modality. Moreover, it is possible that there is influence between the pressure levels set in&#xD;
      the NIV and the magnitude of its effect on the exercise in this population Objective: 1) test&#xD;
      for differences between the acute effects of NIV on exercise tolerance in patients with HF,&#xD;
      when applied CPAP or bi-level mode; and 2) check for discrepancies in the acute effects of&#xD;
      Bi-level mode on the physical performance of these individuals, when applied at different&#xD;
      pressure levels. Methodology: This is a controlled, randomized, double-blind and cross-over&#xD;
      clinical trial, to be composed of 45 volunteers of both genders, aged between 30 and 80&#xD;
      years, with chronic heart failure, functional class II and III (New York Heart Association)&#xD;
      in clinical stability. The experiment will be carried out on four different days, with a&#xD;
      48-hour interval between them, in which NIV will be used in the following modes: Bi-level&#xD;
      with minimum parameters (EPAP = 6 cmH2O and IPAP = 12 cmH2O), Bi-level with maximum&#xD;
      parameters EPAP = 8 cmH2O and IPAP = 14 cmH2O) and CPAP (6 cmH2O). Thus, all the volunteers&#xD;
      will participate in the four TGC. During the tests, distance walking, perceived levels of&#xD;
      fatigue and dyspnea, affective response, as well as other physiological variables will be&#xD;
      analyzed. Statistical analysis, the ANOVA test for repeated measurements will be used,&#xD;
      followed by the Bonferroni post-test, considering p-value less than or equal to 0.05 as&#xD;
      statistically significant. Expected Results: This work is expected to improve the therapeutic&#xD;
      management of HF patients, assisting in the implementation and improvement of methods to&#xD;
      improve dyspnea and muscle fatigue, thus increasing tolerance to exercise.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized controlled trial, double-blind and cross-over, to be composed of&#xD;
      45 volunteers of both genders, aged between 30 and 80 years, with CHF will be selected from a&#xD;
      specialized outpatient clinic with medical consent. Patients should have symptoms of&#xD;
      compensated CHF; presenting functional capacity II and III (New York Heart Association), with&#xD;
      left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50%; not participating in cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs; and clinical stability in the last three months, with no history of angina or&#xD;
      coexistence of obstructive pulmonary disease (Tiffeneau-Pinelli index&gt; 70% in spirometry). In&#xD;
      addition, they should not present any osteoarticular or neurological disease would prevents&#xD;
      them from performing the proposed tests, as well as having a score higher than 22 in the&#xD;
      Leganés cognitive test (20). In the case of NIV or exercise intolerance, as well as in case&#xD;
      of non-attendance to the experiments on the scheduled days, subjects will be excluded from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will be the result of a non-probabilistic sampling process, calculated based on&#xD;
      the magnitude of the effect of the main variable (distance traveled) after the use of NIV&#xD;
      therapy, obtained in a pilot study. In addition, this protocol was aproved by the&#xD;
      institution's Ethics Committee on Human Research (CAAE: 49324415.0.000.5537).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental procedure The experimental protocol will occur in three visits, one per day,&#xD;
      with a minimum interval of 48 hours between them. On the first visit, the volunteers will&#xD;
      undergo a screening that consists of clinical evaluation (assessment sheet) and cognitive&#xD;
      (Leganéscognitive test), as well as evaluation of lung function (spirometry) and QoL&#xD;
      (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire). Next, the Shuttlel Walking Test (SWT)&#xD;
      control (T-Co) will be performed, without previous use of NIV, in order to determine the&#xD;
      distance traveled and other physiological variables in the absence of interventions. Finally,&#xD;
      during the initial visit, a preliminary NIV session will be held to adjust the interface and&#xD;
      adapt the volunteer to the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each subsequent visit, volunteers will perform a SWT immediately after 30 minutes of NIV,&#xD;
      one day in Bi-level mode and one in CPAP mode, following a randomized sequence. Thus, all&#xD;
      volunteers will perform one SWT after CPAP (T-CP) and one SWT after Bi-level (T-Bi). In the&#xD;
      experiment, the CPAP pressure will be maintained at 6 cmH2O, while at the Bi-level an&#xD;
      expiratory pressure (EPAP) of 6 cmH2O and an inspiratory pressure (IPAP) of 12 cmH2O will be&#xD;
      defined.&#xD;
