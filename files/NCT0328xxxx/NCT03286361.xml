      The BeGraft Plus PMCF Trial investigates the efficacy of the BeGraft Peripheral Plus Stent&#xD;
      Graft System in the treatment of iliac stenotic or occlusive lesions (TASC A, B, C and D). An&#xD;
      expected total of 20 patients with TASC A and B lesions and an expected total of 50 patients&#xD;
      with TASC C and D lesions will be treated. The lesion is located within the native Iliac&#xD;
      arteries. Prior to stenting with the BeGraft Peripheral Plus Stent Graft System,&#xD;
      pre-dilatation can be performed according to the physician's discretion. Also post-dilatation&#xD;
      can be performed according to the physician's discretion. Patients will be invited for a&#xD;
      follow-up visit at 1, 6 and 12 month post-procedure. The primary efficacy endpoint of the&#xD;
      study is the primary patency at 12 months. The primary safety endpoint is the freedom of&#xD;
      periprocedural Serious Adverse Events (SAEs). Secondary endpoint include primary patency rate&#xD;
      at 1 and 6 month, stent graft occlusion rate at pre-discharge, 1, 6 and 12 month follow-up,&#xD;
      anke-brachial index (ABI) at 1, 6 and 12-month follow-up, amputation rate at 1, 6 and&#xD;
      12-month follow-up, performance success rate, freedom from target lesion revascularization&#xD;
      (TLR), technical success and clinical success at 1, 6 and 12-month follow-up.&#xD;

      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate, in a controlled setting, the&#xD;
      long-term safety and efficacy of the BeGraft Peripheral Plus Stent Graft System in clinical&#xD;
      settings post CE-certification when used according to the indications of the IFU with focus&#xD;
      on the treatment of complex TASC A, B, C and D iliac lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be selected based on the investigator's assessment, evaluation of the&#xD;
      underlying disease and the eligibility criteria. The patient's medical condition should be&#xD;
      stable, with no underlying medical condition which would prevent them from performing the&#xD;
      required testing or from completing the study. Patients should also be geographically stable,&#xD;
      willing and able to cooperate in this clinical study and remain available for long-term&#xD;
      follow-up. A patient is considered enrolled in the study after obtaining the patients&#xD;
      informed consent, if there is full compliance with the study eligibility criteria and after&#xD;
      successful guidewire passage through the study target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the index procedure the following tests and clinical data will be collected:&#xD;
      informed consent for data collection, demographics, medical history, medication record,&#xD;
      physical examination, clinical category of chronic limb ischemia (Rutherford category) and&#xD;
      resting ankle-brachial index (ABI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the procedure, the vascular access can be achieved to the investigator's standard&#xD;
      clinical practice. After successful lesion passage, diagnostic angiography of the lesion area&#xD;
      and distal run-off is performed and angiographic measurements (vessel diameter, percentage&#xD;
      stenosis and lesion length) are collected. At the physician's discretion, the patient&#xD;
      receives at least 1 BeGraft Peripheral Plus Stent Graft System. Pre- and post-dilatation are&#xD;
      according to the physician's discretion. No other adjunctive therapies (atherectomy, laser)&#xD;
      are allowed. The complete iliac vasculature should be treated in one single session, staged&#xD;
      interventions are not allowed. All outflow-limiting lesions must be treated according to the&#xD;
      hospital treatment standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The regular follow-ups are necessary to monitor the condition of the patient and the&#xD;
      stent/procedure. Patients will be invited for a follow-up visit at 1, 6 and 12 months after&#xD;
      the index procedure. The following data will be collected during these follow-up visit:&#xD;
      medication record, physical examination, rutherford categorization, ABI and color flow&#xD;
      doppler ultrasound.&#xD;
