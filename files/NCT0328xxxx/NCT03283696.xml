Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia, or sepsis., or&#xD;
Grade 4 neutropenia lasting 7 days or longer.&#xD;
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage.&#xD;
Nonhematologic Grade ≥3 toxicity, except for toxicities (such as nausea, vomiting, transient electrolyte abnormalities, or diarrhoea) that can be controlled with optimal medical management within 48 hours or clinically non-significant laboratory abnormalities.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Anti-Olaratumab Antibodies</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Follow-up (Up To 21 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with treatment-emergent anti-drug antibody (TE ADA) positive were 1) a participant with a 4-fold (2 dilutions) increase over a positive baseline antibody titer; or 2) for a negative baseline titer, a participant with an increase from the baseline to a level of 1:20.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR): Number of Participants Who Achieve Best Overall Tumor Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Short-Term Follow-Up Period (Up To 21 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate is the best overall tumor response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as classified by the independent central review according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). CR is a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of non-target lesions or appearance of new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Objective Disease Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Up To 21 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival time was measured from randomization until the date of objective progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 (RECIST v1.1), or death from any cause. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions. Participants who have neither progressed nor died were censored at the day of their last radiographic tumor assessment, if available, or date of randomization if no post-baseline radiographic assessment is available.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DoR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Date of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) to Objective Disease Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Up To 21 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response is defined as the time from the date measurement criteria for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) are first met until the first date that disease is recurrent or objective progression is observed, per RECIST 1.1, or the date of death from any cause in the absence of objectively determined disease progression or recurrence. Participants known to be alive and without disease progression will be censored at the time of the last adequate tumor assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR): Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response of CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until Disease Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Up To 21 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control rate (DCR) is the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR, PR or SD as defined by RECIST v1.1. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD) for target lesions, no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Date of Death Due to Any Cause (Up To 21 Months)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. For each participant who is not known to have died as of the data-inclusion cut-off date for a particular analysis, overall survival duration was censored for that analysis at the date of last prior contact.</description>

        <description>Disease control rate (DCR) is the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR, PR or SD as defined by RECIST v1.1. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD) for target lesions, no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions.</description>

          <title>Disease Control Rate (DCR): Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response of CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD)</title>
          <description>Disease control rate (DCR) is the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR, PR or SD as defined by RECIST v1.1. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD) for target lesions, no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions.</description>
