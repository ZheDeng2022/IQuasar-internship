  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test any good and bad effects of an experimental diet, called&#xD;
      a ketogenic diet, in endometrial cancer. A ketogenic diet is one that is very low in&#xD;
      carbohydrates (simple and complex sugars). The goal of this diet is for the body to go into a&#xD;
      state of ketosis. Ketosis is when the body does not have enough sugar for energy so it burns&#xD;
      stored fats which create acids called ketones, which can be used for energy. Researchers hope&#xD;
      to learn whether or not a ketogenic diet is well-tolerated and safe to eat before surgery in&#xD;
      endometrial cancer patients.&#xD;
