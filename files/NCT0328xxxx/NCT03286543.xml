  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if electrical stimulation (small levels of&#xD;
      electricity) in addition to the standard of care can safely and effectively reduce pain&#xD;
      following total knee replacement more than the standard of care, alone. This study involves a&#xD;
      device called the SPRINT Beta System. The SPRINT Beta System delivers mild electrical&#xD;
      stimulation to nerves in the leg that received the knee replacement. The SPRINT Beta System&#xD;
      includes a small wire (called a &quot;lead&quot;) that is placed through the skin in the upper leg. It&#xD;
      also includes a device worn on the body that delivers stimulation (called the SPRINT Beta&#xD;
      Stimulator). About half the subjects in this study will receive the SPRINT Beta system&#xD;
      (treatment group) and half will not (control group). Both groups will receive the standard of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

    <measure>Average Knee Pain While Walking</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative Day 0 to 28 (first 4 weeks following Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects were asked to complete daily diaries to record their average pain intensity while walking during the past 24 hours on each day of a 7-day period using an 11-point numerical rating scale where 0 represents &quot;No Pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;Pain as bad as you can imagine.&quot; For each subject, the mean score for each diary period was calculated and a mean of all four diary periods was calculated (weeks 1-4). The mean group scores for weeks 1-4 are reported.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects That Experienced at Least One Study-Related Adverse Event</measure>
    <time_frame>30 months (from when the first Treatment Group subject enrolled to when the last Treatment Group subject completed the study)</time_frame>
    <description>At each study visit following the baseline assessment at Visit 1, subjects were questioned if any changes in their medical status or condition has occurred since their previous visit. If the subject experienced a change that was an adverse event, an Adverse Event Form was completed by the site. The number of Treatment Group subjects that experienced at least one study-related adverse event is reported here.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Right Now as Measured by the Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 2a/2b), Visit 3 (Day of Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)), Visit 4 (in-hospital), Visit 6 (2-weeks post TKA), and Visit 8 (4-weeks post TKA)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to rate their pain right now on an 11-point numerical scale where 0 represents &quot;No Pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;Pain as bad as you can imagine.&quot; The median score for each time point is reported. Baseline is considered Visit 2a (Lead Placement) for Treatment Group subjects and Visit 2b for Control Group subjects. For Treatment Group subjects for Visits 3, 4, 6, and 8, pain right now was assessed while peripheral nerve stimulation was on for at least one Lead. For Visit 4, the score reported during the last in-hospital day was used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Amount of Analgesic Usage</measure>
    <time_frame>Visits 5-8 (weeks 1-4 post-Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA))</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects recorded the amount/type of analgesics used in daily diaries. Narcotic usage was converted into morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Diaries were collected at various visits and were translated into post-operative days. The average MME was calculated for each subject for the first 28 days (4 weeks) following surgery, and the median of these averages across subjects was determined. If subjects had ceased opioid use (per the Recovery Milestones log), then missing scores following the date of opioid cessation were replaced with 0 MME. If diary entries were missing but the subject had not yet reported opioid cessation, then the missing value was replaced with the mean usage of the available days for the corresponding week. Subjects missing data from one or more entire diaries (i.e., weeks) and had not yet reported opioid cessation by the date of any missing diary were not included in this analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects That Experienced at Least One Opioid-Related Side Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 2a/2b), Visits 4-11 (in-hospital days through 12-months post-Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA))</time_frame>
    <description>Throughout the study, subjects were asked if they experienced any side effects related to opioid pain medications. The occurrences of these side effects were recorded and were not considered Adverse Events. The number of subjects that experienced at least one opioid-related side effect at each visit is reported. Baseline is considered Visit 2a (Lead Placement) for Treatment Group subjects and Visit 2b for Control Group subjects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Baseline), Visit 4 (In-Hospital), Visit 6 (2-weeks Post-Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)), Visit 8 (4-weeks Post-TKA)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects began this test from a seated position in a standard chair and were timed while they stood up, walked to a marked point 10 feet away (at a normal, safe pace), returned to the chair, and sat down. Timed Up and Go (TUG) test times are expected to be greater immediately after surgery as compared to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Baseline), Visit 3 (Day of Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)), Visit 6 (2-weeks post-TKA), Visit 8 (4-weeks post-TKA), Visit 10 (3-months post-TKA), and Visit 11 (12-months post-TKA)</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire consists of 24 items that evaluate pain, stiffness, and physical functional disability. Each item is scored on an 11-point numerical rating scale from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate greater pain, stiffness, and disability. For each subject, the scores from each of the 24 items were summed to calculate the subject's total score, with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 240. The mean total score was then calculated across subjects for each time point.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Meaningful Improvement, Minimal or No Change, or Meaningful Worsening on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Visits 3-11 (Day of Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) through 12-months post-TKA)</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) asks subjects to rate their improvement with treatment on a 7-point scale ranging from &quot;very much worse&quot; to &quot;very much improved&quot; as compared to before their knee replacement surgery. The subjects combine all the components of their experience into one overall score. Ratings of Much- or Very Much Improved are considered &quot;Meaningful Improvements&quot;; similarly, ratings of Much- or Very Much Worse are categorized as &quot;Meaningfully Worse.&quot; Ratings of Minimally Improved, No Change, or Minimally Worse are considered &quot;Minimal or No Change.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Baseline), Visit 8 (4 weeks post-Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)), Visit 10 (3-months Post-TKA)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) questionnaire has 13 questions that assess rumination, magnification, and helplessness. Subjects are asked to think back on painful experiences in the past and reflect on how often they had specific thoughts or feelings. Each of the 13 questions is scored on a 5-point scale where 0 represents &quot;not at all,&quot; and 4 represents &quot;all the time.&quot; The scores from each question were summed for each subject to provide a total PCS score, with a possible range from 0 to 52 with higher scores indicating a greater tendency to catastrophize pain (i.e. a higher score indicates a worse outcome). The median scores were then calculated across all subjects.</description>

    <measure>Time to Meet Recovery Milestones up to Twelve Months Post-Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day of Surgery through completion of milestone or 12-months from Day of Surgery, whichever came first</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were queried at each visit from the date of their Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) until they met specific, post-surgical recovery milestones. Participants were queried up through the time at which they met each milestone or through their completion of the study, whichever came first (up to twelve months post-surgery). For each milestone, the median number of days between the date of TKA and date to achieve the milestone was calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Satisfaction Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 8 (4-weeks post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA))</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects completed a sponsor-developed survey with questions pertaining to their feelings about the treatment they received following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery. Treatment Group subjects were asked to report on their experience using the SPRINT Beta Stimulation System as a method for managing post-surgical pain. Depending on the question, subjects were asked to indicate their agreement with the question (strongly disagree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree), their comfort with the therapy (very uncomfortable, a little bit uncomfortable, fairly comfortable, very comfortable), or when pain relief was felt (immediately, a few minutes later, a few hours later, more than a day later or never). Responses are presented for Treatment Group subjects for key groups of questions related to the therapy whereby answer options are considered affirmative for strongly agree/agree, very easy/easy, very comfortable/comfortable.</description>

    <measure>Subject's Use of Device (Compliance)</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 4 (In-Hospital), Visit 6 (2-weeks post-Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)), and Visit 8 (4-weeks Post-TKA)</time_frame>
    <description>The hours of usage were recorded for each Lead (femoral and sciatic) from the SPRINT Beta stimulator throughout the study to assess the level of subject compliance with the peripheral nerve stimulation therapy. Treatment Group subjects were asked to use the device for up to 24 hrs each day. The stimulator provided the cumulative number of hours in use since the device was activated. For each timepoint for Treatment Group participants (subjects who received stimulation therapy), the median cumulative number of hours of use for each lead is presented for each timepoint.</description>

        <description>All subjects were asked to complete daily diaries to record their average pain intensity while walking during the past 24 hours on each day of a 7-day period using an 11-point numerical rating scale where 0 represents &quot;No Pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;Pain as bad as you can imagine.&quot; For each subject, the mean score for each diary period was calculated and a mean of all four diary periods was calculated (weeks 1-4). The mean group scores for weeks 1-4 are reported.</description>

        <title>Amount of Analgesic Usage</title>
        <description>Subjects recorded the amount/type of analgesics used in daily diaries. Narcotic usage was converted into morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Diaries were collected at various visits and were translated into post-operative days. The average MME was calculated for each subject for the first 28 days (4 weeks) following surgery, and the median of these averages across subjects was determined. If subjects had ceased opioid use (per the Recovery Milestones log), then missing scores following the date of opioid cessation were replaced with 0 MME. If diary entries were missing but the subject had not yet reported opioid cessation, then the missing value was replaced with the mean usage of the available days for the corresponding week. Subjects missing data from one or more entire diaries (i.e., weeks) and had not yet reported opioid cessation by the date of any missing diary were not included in this analysis.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects That Experienced at Least One Opioid-Related Side Effect</title>
        <description>Throughout the study, subjects were asked if they experienced any side effects related to opioid pain medications. The occurrences of these side effects were recorded and were not considered Adverse Events. The number of subjects that experienced at least one opioid-related side effect at each visit is reported. Baseline is considered Visit 2a (Lead Placement) for Treatment Group subjects and Visit 2b for Control Group subjects.</description>

        <description>The Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire consists of 24 items that evaluate pain, stiffness, and physical functional disability. Each item is scored on an 11-point numerical rating scale from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate greater pain, stiffness, and disability. For each subject, the scores from each of the 24 items were summed to calculate the subject's total score, with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 240. The mean total score was then calculated across subjects for each time point.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects Reporting Meaningful Improvement, Minimal or No Change, or Meaningful Worsening on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Survey</title>
        <description>The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) asks subjects to rate their improvement with treatment on a 7-point scale ranging from &quot;very much worse&quot; to &quot;very much improved&quot; as compared to before their knee replacement surgery. The subjects combine all the components of their experience into one overall score. Ratings of Much- or Very Much Improved are considered &quot;Meaningful Improvements&quot;; similarly, ratings of Much- or Very Much Worse are categorized as &quot;Meaningfully Worse.&quot; Ratings of Minimally Improved, No Change, or Minimally Worse are considered &quot;Minimal or No Change.&quot;</description>

        <title>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</title>
        <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) questionnaire has 13 questions that assess rumination, magnification, and helplessness. Subjects are asked to think back on painful experiences in the past and reflect on how often they had specific thoughts or feelings. Each of the 13 questions is scored on a 5-point scale where 0 represents &quot;not at all,&quot; and 4 represents &quot;all the time.&quot; The scores from each question were summed for each subject to provide a total PCS score, with a possible range from 0 to 52 with higher scores indicating a greater tendency to catastrophize pain (i.e. a higher score indicates a worse outcome). The median scores were then calculated across all subjects.</description>

        <title>Subject Satisfaction Survey</title>
        <description>Subjects completed a sponsor-developed survey with questions pertaining to their feelings about the treatment they received following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery. Treatment Group subjects were asked to report on their experience using the SPRINT Beta Stimulation System as a method for managing post-surgical pain. Depending on the question, subjects were asked to indicate their agreement with the question (strongly disagree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree), their comfort with the therapy (very uncomfortable, a little bit uncomfortable, fairly comfortable, very comfortable), or when pain relief was felt (immediately, a few minutes later, a few hours later, more than a day later or never). Responses are presented for Treatment Group subjects for key groups of questions related to the therapy whereby answer options are considered affirmative for strongly agree/agree, very easy/easy, very comfortable/comfortable.</description>

        <description>The hours of usage were recorded for each Lead (femoral and sciatic) from the SPRINT Beta stimulator throughout the study to assess the level of subject compliance with the peripheral nerve stimulation therapy. Treatment Group subjects were asked to use the device for up to 24 hrs each day. The stimulator provided the cumulative number of hours in use since the device was activated. For each timepoint for Treatment Group participants (subjects who received stimulation therapy), the median cumulative number of hours of use for each lead is presented for each timepoint.</description>
