    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed amplicon sequencing and genotyping study is to assess vaccine&#xD;
      efficacy against clinical and asymptomatic malaria infection using ultra-sensitive molecular&#xD;
      amplification and sequencing methodology to detect Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum)&#xD;
      parasites from serial blood samples to be collected from children immunized with the primary&#xD;
      and yearly booster immunizations of the RTS,S/AS01E vaccine as part of their participation in&#xD;
      Protocol MALARIA-094 (parent clinical study protocol). Genomic analysis will be performed on&#xD;
      parasites from blood spot samples collected from children aged 5 17 months immunized with&#xD;
      RTS,S/AS01E on different dosage and schedule regimens under the parent clinical study&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;

      This genotyping study of malaria parasites collected from serial blood samples following&#xD;
      RTS,S/AS01E immunization will assess vaccine efficacy using molecular genetic data to&#xD;
      identify first infections following vaccination, and to distinguish new from existing&#xD;
      infections, using an amplicon sequencing-based strategy: deep sequencing of small, highly&#xD;
      variable regions of the parasite genome to allow for both:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Highly sensitive detection of parasitemia (analogous to conventional polymerase chain&#xD;
           reaction [PCR]-based detection), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identification of genetically distinct parasite populations within or between affected&#xD;
           individuals.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Signed or thumb-printed and witnessed informed consent obtained from the&#xD;
             parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject prior to performance of any study specific procedure.&#xD;
             Where parent(s)/LAR(s) are illiterate, the consent form will be countersigned by an&#xD;
