      Aim of the study was to evaluate and compare clinical and radiographic success with MTA and&#xD;
      calcium hydroxide as direct pulp capping materials in cariously exposed mandibular molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study was conducted in Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Rohtak in department of&#xD;
      Conservative Dentistry &amp; Endodontics. Mature permanent mandibular molars with reversible&#xD;
      pulpitis exhibiting occlusal pulp exposure from primary dental caries were included in the&#xD;
      study. After excavation of caries and obtaining pulpal hemostasis, patients were randomly&#xD;
      allocated into two groups- MTA and Calcium Hydroxide. Pulp was capped with respective&#xD;
      allocated material and then tooth in both groups were restored according to standard&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;

      AIM AND OBJECTIVES The present study aims to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the success of direct pulp capping in mandibular molar teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate and compare the clinical and radiographic success with MTA and calcium&#xD;
           hydroxide as direct pulp capping materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the pain intensity before and after the direct pulp capping with visual analog&#xD;
           scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS Study subjects were recruited from the patients visiting the Department&#xD;
      of conservative dentistry and endodontics, PGIDS, Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY Prior to treatment, a thorough clinical and radiological examination was carried&#xD;
      out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A thorough history will be taken from each patient. Prior informed consent was obtained&#xD;
      either from the patient or guardians after explaining the procedure, risks and benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mature mandibular permanent molars exhibiting deep caries approaching pulp were chosen for&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The teeth were evaluated by periapical radiographs, periodontal probing, percussion test, and&#xD;
      vitality assessment with thermal test and electric pulp test; the teeth determined to have&#xD;
      reversible pulpitis were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All periapical radiographs were exposed by using constant kVP, mA, and exposure time (70 KVP,&#xD;
      8 mA, and 0.8 sec.) with a Rinn paralleling device and processed manually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After administration of local anesthesia, rubber dam isolation of the involved tooth was&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tooth was disinfected by scrubbing with 2% chlorhexidine and 75% isopropyl alcohol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially caries was removed with round bur under sterile water spray. Then, the remaining&#xD;
      caries was removed carefully with a spoon excavator. After complete caries excavation,&#xD;
      disinfection of exposed pulp with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite irrigation and a soaked cotton&#xD;
      pellet was done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then sodium hypochlorite dressing was placed for 10 minutes to achieve adequate pulpal&#xD;
      hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly allocated into two groups (Group I - MTA and Group II -Calcium&#xD;
      hydroxide) using a computer program This study was a double blinded trial i.e. both the&#xD;
      patient and the investigator were not aware of the group to which the participant belongs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I- CALCIUM HYDROXIDE GROUP Calcium hydroxide powder was mixed according to&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions and applied directly onto the exposed pulps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cavities were then restored with resin modified GIC liner followed by composite&#xD;
      restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II - MTA GROUP MTA was mixed according to manufacturer's instructions i.e. 1:3 water/&#xD;
      powder ratio and applied to exposure site with a sterile carrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then cotton pellets soaked in normal saline was placed over MTA and cavity was sealed&#xD;
      temporarily with intermediate restoration material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 24 hours, the patient was recalled and the setting of MTA was confirmed and the cavity&#xD;
      was restored with resin modified GIC liner followed by composite restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW UP The patients were recalled periodically at 1 week, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months&#xD;
      after the direct pulp capping procedure for clinical (post operative sensitivity, pain,&#xD;
      tenderness, vitality) and radiographic (widening of periodontal ligament space and periapical&#xD;
      radiolucency) evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRITERIA FOR SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME A positive vitality test. No pain on percussion. No widening&#xD;
      of periodontal ligament on periapical radiograph. No clinical or radiographic signs and/or&#xD;
      symptoms of irreversible pulpitis and pulp necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRITERIA FOR FAILURE No response to pulp vitality test. Teeth exhibiting clinical or&#xD;
      radiographic signs and/or symptoms of irreversible pulpitis and pulp necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was done using Horizontal VAS scale preoperatively, 6, 12, 18 hours, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,&#xD;
      and 7 days after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain VAS was completed by the patients themselves. The patients were asked to place a&#xD;
      line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were also asked to take analgesic (ibuprofen 400 mg/6-8h) according to the intensity&#xD;
      of pain experienced by them and note down the details of analgesic intake on the proforma&#xD;
      regarding the number of doses required and timing of the dose.&#xD;
