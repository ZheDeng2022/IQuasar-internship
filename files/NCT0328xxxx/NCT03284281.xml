      SPECIFIC AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study the effects of TVNS on inflammation in patients with STEMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the clinical impact of TVNS on 30, 3,6 and 12-month clinical outcomes in&#xD;
           patients with STEMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B: BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is the leading cause of death in United States.1&#xD;
      Improved survival following myocardial infarction has largely been due to the contribution of&#xD;
      timely reperfusion strategies and advanced pharmacologic management (anti-coagulant and&#xD;
      anti-platelet strategies).2 With acute myocardial infarction follows the accompaniment of a&#xD;
      systemic and local inflammatory reaction involving both humoral and cell mediated&#xD;
      inflammation, which is important in healing and scar formation.3,4 Reperfusion of ischemic&#xD;
      myocardium sets the stage for an inflammatory response for the repair and remodeling of the&#xD;
      ischemic territory. Experimental evidence has shown that the complement cascade plays an&#xD;
      important role in triggering inflammation.3,4 These mechanisms drive the formation of the&#xD;
      inflammasome resulting in the release of interleukin (IL)-1 activating expression of&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators in necrotic myocardium.5 C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 levels have&#xD;
      been shown to correlate to infarction size post-percutaneous coronary intervention.6 Tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor (TNF- α) may be a predominant factor in up regulating the production of IL-6.&#xD;
      The presence of significant levels of TNF- α post MI has been shown to correlate to infarct&#xD;
      size and recurrent myocardial infarction.4,7 IL-10, an anti-inflammatory marker is important&#xD;
      during the late phase of acute inflammation within myocardium in helping to inhibit&#xD;
      inflammation while attenuating remodeling, increasing capillary density and improving left&#xD;
      ventricular function.8 Expression of TGF-beta isoforms increases in necrotic myocardial&#xD;
      regions and may exert anti-inflammatory effects by down regulating proinflammatory cytokine&#xD;
      production, chemokine and adhesion molecule synthesis and promoting differentiation of&#xD;
      inhibitory lymphocyte subsets. Lastly, TGF- β promotes matrix-stabilizing effects and is key&#xD;
      in matrix remodeling and fibrosis in post myocardial infarction tissue and in chronic heart&#xD;
      failure.5 Brunetti et. al. outlined the trend in inflammatory biomarkers such as CRP, ESR,&#xD;
      and fibrinogen in patients presenting with STEMI receiving fibrinolytic therapy. They&#xD;
      reported a peak level of such markers on day 2-3 post-STEMI.9 In a similar study by Brunetti&#xD;
      et. al. it was also noted that higher TNF- α levels were associated with subsequent adverse&#xD;
      cardiac events.10 Pudil et. al studied the variation in the levels of IL-6, CRP and TNF-alpha&#xD;
      among 24 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients over 96 hours and determined that IL-6&#xD;
      and TNF- α levels were continually high during the 96 hours, however CRP increased later than&#xD;
      IL-6 and peaked at 42 hrs after AMI.11 IL-6 levels seem to be elevated more so in the first&#xD;
      1-3 days following AMI with levels persistently elevated even 3 weeks after AMI.12&#xD;
      Inflammation plays a key role in atherogenesis and several complex interconnected pathways&#xD;
      exist that modulate inflammation in STEMI. There remains an intense interest to identify&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory therapies that may help reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. A&#xD;
      recently published study with an anti-inflammatory agent Losmapimod ( p38 mitogen activated&#xD;
      protein kinase), failed to demonstrate any improvement in clinical outcomes.13 It is thought&#xD;
      that due to the interplay of several inflammatory cascades, targeting one particular pathway&#xD;
      may not provide the desired impact on inflammatory milieu and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigator's knowledge, there is no data that suggests that modulating the autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system via TVNS (by increasing the parasympathetic tone and reducing the sympathetic&#xD;
      nervous system activity) would lead to a reduction in the circulating pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines in patients with STEMI. Since this concept has not been tested previously, the&#xD;
      investigators embark on the idea of using autonomic modulation via TVNS to reduce the level&#xD;
      of systemic inflammation that is rampant in patients admitted with STEMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TVNS will lead to a reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as&#xD;
           TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, CRP, TGF- β) and increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, in&#xD;
           patients with STEMI. PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TVNS may lead to a reduction in clinical adverse events (assessed cumulatively over a&#xD;
           period of one-year post-STEMI). Major Adverse Cardiac Events- death, myocardial&#xD;
           infarction, heart failure, readmission for acute coronary syndrome or heart failure,&#xD;
           repeat revascularization. SECONDARY HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      C: PRELIMINARY STUDIES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to perform a pilot study to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the anti-inflammatory effect of TVNS in patients with STEMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the impact of TNS on adverse clinical events post-STEMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D: RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intended sample size: 50&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the inpatient services of OUHSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After full written informed consent be randomly assigned (1:1) to active TVNS vs. control&#xD;
      group with no TNS. The patients will be requested to refrain from discussing the details of&#xD;
      their treatment with other patients in the hospital and with the physicians, nurses and the&#xD;
      rest of clinic staff. The clinical coordinator who will not participate in any of the other&#xD;
      study related assessments will instruct the patients on the proper use of the device. These&#xD;
      study personnel will be designated to address the patients' questions and concerns as well as&#xD;
      to record any side effects related to the use of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active TVNS will be performed by use of a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation 14&#xD;
      device with electrodes attached to the tragus of the ear, which is innervated by an auricular&#xD;
      branch of the vagus nerve. The SALUSTIM Digital TENS Unit, distributed within the US by US&#xD;
      Medical Inc. will be used for TVNS or sham stimulation. The device will be connected to a&#xD;
      clip electrode that will be attached to the external ear. In the active group, the ear clip&#xD;
      electrode will be attached to tragus in the active stimulation group (Figure 3). The ear clip&#xD;
      electrode has not been previously reviewed by the FDA for purposes such as this but has been&#xD;
      classified as a non-significant risk device per FDA guidelines. It has been however studied&#xD;
      in Europe and is available in the European market under the name SaluSTIM®. The TENS unit&#xD;
      will be set at a pulse width of 100 μs and a pulse frequency of 20 Hz. Amplitude will be&#xD;
      titrated to the level of sensory threshold, typically in the range of 10-50 mA. The&#xD;
      stimulation strength will be gradually increased until the patient experiences mild&#xD;
      discomfort, and then decreased by 1 mA below that threshold. TENS will be applied&#xD;
      continuously for 8 hours daily (4 hours twice daily) for 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During index hospitalization: The patients randomized to TVNS will be stimulated soon after&#xD;
      the consent is obtained. The initial stimulation duration will be for 4 hours. After this,&#xD;
      the patients will follow the stimulation times of 6AM-10AM and 5PM-9PM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post discharge: Patients will be instructed to apply the devices at the same time each day&#xD;
      for 1 week to avoid discrepancy in the time of stimulation. The optimal timing will be 7AM-11&#xD;
      AM and 5 PM- 9 PM. However, the patients will be given a window of 5AM-Noon(7 hours) and&#xD;
      4PM-11PM( 7 hours) and will be told to use the unit for 4 hours continuously during this&#xD;
      window. The clinical coordinator will instruct the patients on the proper use of the device.&#xD;
      The choice of treatment for STEMI will be left at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the baseline hospital admission, a complete history and physical examination will be&#xD;
      done by one of the research co-ordinators. Laboratory data, electrocardiographic data, and&#xD;
      echocardiographic data will also be reviewed. 10ml of blood will be drawn for cytokine&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline sample: a 10 ml blood sample will be collected upon arrival and prior to&#xD;
      angioplasty/stenting. This could be performed either in the emergency room or in the&#xD;
      catheterization laboratory after informed consent obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent sample collection: a 10 ml blood sample will be collected 12, 24 and 48 hours post&#xD;
      PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up sample: a 10 ml blood sample will be drawn a week and a month after discharge&#xD;
      during a regular clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample analysis: Samples will be collected in BD red top glass tube. The tube will be left in&#xD;
      a standing position for about 30-45 minutes and then centrifuged at room temperature, 1500g&#xD;
      for 10 minutes. Serum will be removed immediately and frozen in 0.5 cc aliquots at -80C. The&#xD;
      samples (in blocks) will then be transferred to OU Medical Center/Research lab where levels&#xD;
      of CRP, TNF- α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10 and TGF- β will be measured in batches.&#xD;
