  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, twelve-month safety study. There is a screening period followed by a&#xD;
      run-in period to record migraine activity. Qualified subjects will receive study medication&#xD;
      for up to twelve months for the treatment of multiple migraine attacks. Using the electronic&#xD;
      diary (eDiary) to confirm they are experiencing a qualified migraine, subjects will&#xD;
      self-administer the patches and respond to questions in the eDiary post treatment&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, twelve-month safety study. There is a screening period followed by a&#xD;
      run-in period (14 to 21 days) to determine eligibility for treatment with study medication&#xD;
      based on daily eDiary data collection. Qualified subjects will receive study medication on&#xD;
      Day 1 for up to twelve months for the treatment of migraine headaches. Migraines will be&#xD;
      treated with a single dose, consisting of two patches, but subjects can treat multiple&#xD;
      migraine attacks throughout the 12 months. Using the eDiary to confirm they are experiencing&#xD;
      a qualified migraine, subjects will self-administer the patches and continue to respond to&#xD;
      questions in the eDiary for 48 hours post treatment administration.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Any Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) Over 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number and % of subjects in safety population with any treatment-emergent adverse event(s) during the study. TEAE is defined as any new adverse event (AE) that started after first patch application. This was an open-label study with no control group. No statistical analyses were performed. Application site skin reactions including erythema, swelling, haemorrhage, bruise, pain, and pruritus were collected systematically via subject e-diary and/or investigator skin assessment at study visits. All other AEs were spontaneously reported by subject or observed upon examination.</description>

    <description>Percentage of migraine attacks for which pain freedom defined as a pain level of 'None' (Grade 0 on pain severity scale where 0: None, 1: Mild, 2: Moderate, 3: Severe, and lower values represent a better outcome) was achieved at 2 hours post-dose without the use of rescue medication.

    <description>Percentage of migraine attacks for which freedom from most bothersome symptom other than pain defined as an absence of the most bothersome symptom was achieved at 2 hours post-dose without the use of rescue medication.

    <measure>Percentage of Migraine Attacks for Which Pain Relief Was Achieved at 2 Hours Post-dose</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours for each Migraine, up to 12 months for each subject</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of migraine attacks for which pain relief defined as an improvement of pain severity (1) to mild (Grade 1) or none (Grade 0) from moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) at baseline, or (2) an improvement of pain severity to none (Grade 0) from mild (Grade 1) at baseline, without rescue medication was achieved. Pain severity scale has grades: 0: None, 1: Mild, 2: Moderate, 3: Severe, where lower values represent a better outcome. This was an open-label study with no control group. No statistical analyses were performed.</description>
