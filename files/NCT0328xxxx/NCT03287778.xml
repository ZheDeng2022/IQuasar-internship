      Purpose: Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a involuntary movement disorder that can occur following&#xD;
      long term treatment with antipsychotic medications and for which few treatment options exist.&#xD;
      This study will test the efficacy of pyridoxine (also known as vitamin B6) for TD. This will&#xD;
      be an 8 week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial measuring the effect of&#xD;
      pyridoxine 400 mg/day on the severity of involuntary muscle movements in people who meet&#xD;
      Schooler-Kane criteria for TD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Approximately 50 subjects will be recruited from the UNC Schizophrenia&#xD;
      Treatment and Evaluation Program (STEP) and other local psychiatric clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): Symptoms of TD will be assessed using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement&#xD;
      Scale (AIMS). Pharmacological Intervention: All participants who meet entry criteria will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of two treatment groups: pyridoxine or placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overview of Procedures: All procedures will be conducted at either the University of North&#xD;
      Carolina Hospitals in Chapel Hill, or at the North Carolina Psychiatric Research Center&#xD;
      (NCPRC), a specialized program of the University of North Carolina Center for Excellence in&#xD;
      Community Mental Health, in Raleigh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: During the initial clinic visit and after providing written informed consent,&#xD;
      prospective subjects' psychiatric and medical histories will be reviewed, physical exams&#xD;
      conducted, demographics and vital signs obtained, and blood and urine collected. The&#xD;
      Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-V, the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS),&#xD;
      and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      psychopathology. Involuntary muscle movements will be assessed using the Abnormal Involuntary&#xD;
      Movement Scale (AIMS). The AIMS exam will be video recorded. Other neurological side effects&#xD;
      of antipsychotic medications will be assessed using the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BARS) and&#xD;
      Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline visit will be scheduled within 28 days of the screening visit. Vital signs and&#xD;
      weight will be measured. A blood test to measure baseline pyridoxine level will be collected.&#xD;
      A battery of assessments will be administered including the Clinical Global&#xD;
      Impressions-Severity (CGI-S), the Alcohol Use Scale, Substance Use Scale, Brief Psychiatric&#xD;
      Rating Scale (BPRS), Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), AIMS (video recorded),&#xD;
      BARS, and SAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of the baseline visit, subjects who continue to meet study inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be randomized to one of two treatment groups (pyridoxine or placebo). Subjects&#xD;
      assigned to the pyridoxine group will receive 200 mg per day for one week and then 400 mg per&#xD;
      day, as tolerated, for the remainder of the study. Subjects assigned to the placebo group&#xD;
      will receive matching placebo capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After study enrollment, subjects will be scheduled for Week 1 and Week 2 study visits. The&#xD;
      purpose of these visits will be to assess medication management (i.e., adverse events/side&#xD;
      effects, adherence), collect vital signs, assess current psychiatric status, and assess&#xD;
      neurological symptoms using the AIMS (video recorded), BARS, and SAS. The CGI-S will be&#xD;
      performed at both Week 1 and Week 2, however, the C-SSRS will be completed at Week 2 only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visit at Week 4 and end-of-study visit at Week 8 will be similar to Week 2, with the&#xD;
      addition of the BPRS, Substance Use Scale and Alcohol Use Questionnaire. A blood test to&#xD;
      measure pyridoxine levels will also be collected during these visits. Study drug is&#xD;
      discontinued at the Week 8 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up visit at Week 10, two weeks after stopping the treatment, will consist of&#xD;
      assessing for adverse events/side effects, collecting vital signs, administrating the CGI-S&#xD;
      and C-SSRS, and performing the AIMS (video recorded), BARS, and SAS. The follow-up visit will&#xD;
      help determine whether the potential benefits of pyridoxine for TD may continue after&#xD;
      treatment is discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs, adverse events, and side effects will be obtained at all in-person study visits.&#xD;
      Blood collection and laboratory testing will be done at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week&#xD;
      8 .&#xD;

    <description>Mean difference in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) total scores in participants assigned to pyridoxine and participants assigned to placebo from baseline to Week 8.&#xD;
The severity of TD symptoms is assessed by the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) total score (sum of items 1 through 7). The AIMS total dyskinesia score rates a total of 7 items, rating involuntary movement from 0 (no dyskinesia) to 4 (severe dyskinesia). Items 1 through 7 include facial and oral movements (Items 1-4), extremity movements (Items 5-6), and trunk movements (Item 7). The AIMS dyskinesia total score for Items 1-7 ranges from 0 to 28; a higher score reflects increased severity.</description>

    <description>Mean difference in Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) scores in participants assigned to pyridoxine and participants assigned to placebo from baseline to Week 8.&#xD;
Barnes Akathisia Scale (BARS) is a rating scale that is administered by physicians to assess the severity of drug-induced akathisia, which is a movement disorder characterized by a feeling of inner restlessness and a compelling need to be in constant motion. The following subcategories are scored: objective akathisia, subjective awareness of restlessness and subjective distress related to restlessness and are rated on a 4-point scale from 0 - 3. In addition, the global clinical assessment of akathisia uses a 6-point scale ranging from 0 - 5 (absent to severe). The total score ranges from 0 to 14 with a higher score indicating increased severity.</description>

    <description>Mean difference in Simpson Angus Scale (SAS) scores in participants assigned to pyridoxine and participants assigned to placebo from baseline to Week 8.&#xD;
The Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) is a 10-item testing instrument used to evaluate drug-related extrapyramidal syndromes. The following items are included in the SAS: gait, arm dropping, shoulder shaking, elbow rigidity, wrist rigidity, leg pendulousness, head dropping, glabella reflex, tremor, and salivation. Total score ranges from 0 to 40 with a higher score indicating increased severity.</description>
