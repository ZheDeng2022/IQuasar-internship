  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is a common disease after minor head trauma, especially in&#xD;
      elderly patients. This medical condition is characterized by blood collection in the subdural&#xD;
      space, which can result in severe neurological impairment. Current standard of care is the&#xD;
      evacuation of the CSDH by means of different surgical approaches. Although clinical and&#xD;
      surgical outcomes are satisfying in most cases, considerable morbidity and mortality as well&#xD;
      as recurrence rates of 3-31% are frequently reported. Therefore a non-surgical approach for&#xD;
      the treatment of CSDH would be desirable. Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic drug has&#xD;
      been shown to decrease hematoma volume in a small cohort of patients suffering from CSDH. The&#xD;
      present study is designed to test the hypothesis that TXA can reduce the volume of CSDH.&#xD;
      Volume measurements of residual CSDH after burr-hole surgery will be performed during study&#xD;
      course to quantify treatment success. The trial is designed as a randomized controlled pilot&#xD;
      study, where half of the patients will be assigned to daily intake of TXA, whereas the other&#xD;
      half will receive medical treatment according to current practice without TXA prescription.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is defined as volume change in milliliters (mL) after 4-8&#xD;
      weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints are hematoma volume change at 8-12 weeks, the rate of&#xD;
      patients with resolution of the CSDH after 4-8 weeks and 8-12 weeks days, as well as the rate&#xD;
      of reoperation during study course due to hematoma extension and neurological deterioration.&#xD;
      Additionally the neurological outcome and the drug compatibility will be estimated as&#xD;
      secondary objectives.&#xD;

Participants of the Tranexamic Acid (TXA) arm will receive the study drug, TXA. Participants of average body weight (60-100kg) will receive TXA according to a 500mg three times daily (TID) dose regimen. Weight deviations from this range will see dose adjustments as follows: participants &lt;60kg will receive 500mg two times daily (BID), and participants &gt;100kg will receive 1000mg BID.</description>
