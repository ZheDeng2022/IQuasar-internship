  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco consumption is a major public health problem, ranking second in the leading cause of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality worldwide, in 2010. The prevalence of tobacco smoking in hospitalized&#xD;
      patients is evaluated around 20% and the management of tobacco reduction/cessation is an&#xD;
      major issue for the course and outcome of many disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent recommendations published by the French National Health Authority (&quot;Haute Autorité de&#xD;
      Santé&quot;, HAS) call for the involvement of all health professionals in helping patients to stop&#xD;
      smoking and hospitalized patients are identified as a specific target. In addition, the&#xD;
      meta-analysis of Rigotti et al. (2012) showed that the most effective programs (tobacco&#xD;
      cessation) were those that include all patients, starting during the hospitalization with a&#xD;
      specific follow-up of at least one month, and with the addition of nicotine replacement&#xD;
      therapy. This combination increased the odds of successful tobacco cessation by 54%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project aims to evaluate the short-term efficacy (1 month) of a nurse-based program on&#xD;
      tobacco smoking consumption in a population of hospitalized patients.&#xD;
