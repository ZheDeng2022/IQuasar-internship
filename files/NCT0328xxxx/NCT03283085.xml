    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs with start dates or worsening dates at the time of or following the first exposure to investigational product. The TEAEs will be further categorized based on severity as mild (may require only minimal treatment) to severe (may require intensive therapeutic intervention).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Ulcerative Colitis with Treatment Response Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline upto 12 weeks post end of treatment (EOT) (upto a maximum of 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment response over time is defined as clinical composite score that has decreased by greater than or equal to (&gt;or= 2) points and &gt;or=30 percentage (%), with an accompanying decrease in the sub score for RB &gt;or= 1 point or a subscore for rectal bleeding (RB) &gt;or=1, and/or composite score that has decreased by &gt;or= 30% and &gt;or=3 points compared to the baseline value for induction studies. The clinical composite score is a measure consisting of sub scores RB (0-3) plus stool frequency (0-3) with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Crohn's Disease with Treatment Response Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline upto 12 weeks post EOT (upto a maximum of 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment response over time defined as CDAI score that has decreased &gt;or= 100 points compared to baseline value for induction studies and/or simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD) that has decreased by &gt;or= 25% compared to baseline value for induction studies. SES-CD is simple scoring system based on 4 endoscopic variables measured in same 5 ileocolonic segments as Crohn's disease index of severity. Overall values on SES-CD range from 0-56, with higher values indicating more severe disease. 4 endoscopic variables are scored from 0-3 in each bowel segment: ileum, right/transverse/left colon, rectum. Presence and size of ulcers (none= score 0; diameter 0.1-0.5centimetre(cm)= score 1; 0.5-2cm= score 2; diameter &gt;2cm= score 3); extent of ulcerated surface (none= 0; &lt;10%=1; 10%-30%= 2; &gt;30%= 3); extent of affected surface (none= 0; &lt;50%= 1; 50%-75%= 2; &gt;75%= 3); Presence and type of narrowing (none=0; single can be passed=1; multiple can be passed=2; cannot be passed=3).</description>
