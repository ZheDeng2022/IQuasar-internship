    <textblock>
      Charcot neuropathic osteoarthropathy (CNO) is a progressively destructive process resulting&#xD;
      from significant peripheral neuropathy of almost any aetiology. Diabetes mellitus has emerged&#xD;
      as the commonest cause of CNO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Charcot foot in diabetes poses many clinical challenges in its diagnosis and management.&#xD;
      The lacuna primarily lies in delineation of its etio-pathogenesis and consequently in&#xD;
      targeted treatment modalities. Although traditional approaches focus on neurotraumatic and&#xD;
      neurovascular theories, these fail to explain all the features of CNO, hence, other&#xD;
      hypotheses have been put forward.The current belief is that once the disease is triggered in&#xD;
      a susceptible individual, it is mediated through a process of uncontrolled inflammation&#xD;
      which, in turn, leads to osteolysis, fractures and joint destruction. Of these processes, the&#xD;
      involvement of the receptor activator of nuclear factor- ÐºB (RANK) ligand&#xD;
      /RANK/osteoprotegerin (OPG) system in the process of acute CNO is particularly appealing and&#xD;
      suggests new pharmacological approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard modalities of treatment include offloading and casting. Although various trials have&#xD;
      analysed the impact of medical agents including bisphosphonates, teriparatide and bone&#xD;
      stimulation techniques, the results have been either inconclusive or not translated into&#xD;
      clinical practice. Hence, there is no efficacious treatment of active CNO apart from the&#xD;
      traditional offloading. In view of recent advances in understanding of the disease process,&#xD;
      the target of intervention should, logically, be interruption of the inflammatory cascade and&#xD;
      subsequent osteoclast resorption. Zoledronic acid is the most potent bisphosphonate that has&#xD;
      been studied in clinical trials to date and has the distinctive profile of strong inhibitory&#xD;
      activity on the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, essential for osteoclast function.&#xD;
      Methylprednisolone conceivably has a potential benefit by offsetting the RANKL/OPG system&#xD;
      involved. There have been conflicting reports with bisphophosphonates in active CNO and&#xD;
      Zoledronic acid has been infrequently used despite being the most potent. Glucocorticoids&#xD;
      including methylprednisolone have also not been systematically tried in this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise that targeting the inflammatory cascade with Methylprednisolone and osteoclast&#xD;
      mediated damage by Zoledronic acid will address the basic etiopathogenesis of active CNO and&#xD;
      may result in earlier resolution of the disease activity. The above mentioned hypothesis is&#xD;
      hence, planned to be tested in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Charcot's neuroarthropathy has been identified since 1883, yet we have much to learn about&#xD;
      the pathophysiology and evidence based treatment options. Active CNO is characterised by&#xD;
      repetitive trauma leading to inflammation in an insensate foot. This includes polypeptide&#xD;
      receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL) which triggers the synthesis of the&#xD;
      nuclear transcription factor nuclear factor-kb (NF-kb), and this in turn stimulates the&#xD;
      maturation of osteoclasts from osteoclast precursor cells. At the same time, NF-kb stimulates&#xD;
      the production of the glycopeptide osteoprotegerin (OPG) from osteoblasts. This &quot;decoy&#xD;
      receptor&quot; acts as an effective antagonist of RANKL . It has been suggested that this results&#xD;
      in continual production of proinflammatory cytokines, RANKL, NF-kb, and osteoclasts, which in&#xD;
      turn leads to continuing local osteolysis .This has adequately demonstrated by an increase in&#xD;
      proinflammatory phenotypes of monocytes in those with active Charcot foot when compared with&#xD;
      diabetic control subjects. Also osteoclasts generated in vitro in the presence of macrophage&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factor and RANKL from patients with active CN have been shown to be more&#xD;
      aggressive and exhibit an increase in their resorptive activity compared with control&#xD;
      subjects. Motor neuropathy contributes to altered structure of the foot with resultant&#xD;
      abnormal loading. Finally, it is possible that peptides like calcitonin gene-related peptide&#xD;
      (CGRP) , which normally antagonizes the synthesis of RANKL, reduced due to neuropathy&#xD;
      increase the RANKL expression. Diabetes may predispose to occurrence of CNO through a number&#xD;
      of mechanisms. Apart from the presence of neuropathy and possible osteopenia, these include&#xD;
      the effects of advanced glycation end products, reactive oxygen species, and oxidized lipids,&#xD;
      which may all enhance the expression of RANKL in diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The average delay in the diagnosis of acute Charcot has been reported to be around 29 weeks.&#xD;
      Common misdiagnoses include cellulitis, erysipelas, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), venous&#xD;
      insufficiency, gout, pseudogout, acute inflammatory arthritis, fracture, sprain, tumor,&#xD;
      septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, Sudeck's atrophy, and rheumatoid arthritis. Delay in prompt&#xD;
      diagnosis and initiation of treatment results in progression of the pathology resulting in&#xD;
      rigid osseous deformity of the foot increasing the risk of callus formation, ulceration,&#xD;
      infection, and lower extremity amputation by 15- to 40-fold .With the propensity for&#xD;
      misdiagnosis and high potential for progression to a rigid foot deformity, early recognition&#xD;
      and prompt initiation of treatment is paramount.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographs are the primary initial imaging method for evaluation of the foot in suspected&#xD;
      CNO. However, they may initially be normal or show subtle fractures and dislocations.&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a higher sensitivity that allows detection of subtle&#xD;
      changes in the early stages of active CNO when X-rays could still be normal. MRI primarily&#xD;
      images protons in fat and water and can depict anatomy and pathology in both soft tissue and&#xD;
      bone in great detail because of its unique capability of differentiating tissues with high&#xD;
      detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of CNO is aimed at offloading the foot, treating bone disease, and preventing&#xD;
      further foot fractures. Because of the various etiologies of increased local bone resorption&#xD;
      and/or secondary osteoporosis in patients with CNO and limited randomized placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trials in this area, treatment guidelines are largely based on professional opinion rather&#xD;
      than the highest level of clinical evidence. Hence, there remains a dearth of evidence based&#xD;
      medical management for Charcot neuroarthropathy. Offloading at the acute active stage of the&#xD;
      Charcot foot is the most important management strategy and could arrest the progression to&#xD;
      deformity. Ideally, the foot should be immobilized in an irremovable total contact cast&#xD;
      (TCC), which is initially replaced at 3 days, then checked each week. Edema reduction is&#xD;
      often remarkable in the first few weeks of treatment. The cast should be changed frequently&#xD;
      to avoid &quot;pistoning&quot; as the edema subsides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, It is important to take into consideration that TCC may actually have unfavorable&#xD;
      consequences including unnatural stress patterns, increased instability, loss of muscle tone,&#xD;
      proprioception and boe density.Also, they are not designed to affect the underlying&#xD;
      physiological mechanisms that cause bone destruction.In this context, treatment by&#xD;
      antiresorptive drugs emerges as an attractive option. Bone turnover in patients with active&#xD;
      CNO is excessive, hence bisphosphonates, by inhibiting osteoclast mediated resorption, have&#xD;
      an important role to play. However, there is little evidence to support their use at&#xD;
      present.Both oral and intravenous bisphosphonates have been studied in the treatment of CNO&#xD;
      in small randomized, double-blind, controlled trials or in retrospective controlled studies.&#xD;
      Whatever the precise pathophysiological mechanism of CNO, bone resorption and osteoclastic&#xD;
      hyperactivity is a major feature of the early acute stage of this condition and makes the use&#xD;
      of bone-resorption-inhibiting agents such as bisphosphonates(BPs) a logical therapeutic&#xD;
      approach. Theoretically, pharmacological treatment of CNO by BPs, which inhibit osteoclastic&#xD;
      resorption and may have direct anti-inflammatory properties, might slow or even stop the bony&#xD;
      destruction through its ability to cause macrophage apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selby et al first reported the use of a BP in the treatment of CNO. They administered 30 mg&#xD;
      pamidronate i.v.,followed by five infusions of pamidronate 60 mg every 2 weeks for 12 weeks&#xD;
      in six patients with diabetes and acute CNO. The treatment was associated with improvement in&#xD;
      local pain and a significant reduction in the activity of the CNO as measured by the decrease&#xD;
      in the temperature of the affected foot, from 3.4Â±0.7Â°C (meanÂ±SE) to 1.0Â±0.5Â°C (p 0.05).&#xD;
      There was also a significant reduction in bone turnover as judged by alkaline phosphatase&#xD;
      (ALP) level, which fell by 25Â±3% compared with initial values (p&lt;0.001). Stansberry et al in&#xD;
      1999 reported a decrease in peak cutaneous blood flow in response to the infusion of 90 mg&#xD;
      pamidronate i.v. over 24 h in 20 patients with diabetes and CNO, suggesting a&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory action of pamidronate. In 1999, Young reported anecdotally two cases of&#xD;
      diabetic acute CNO treated with i.v. infusions of pamidronate associated with immobilisation.&#xD;
      After 3 months, the clinical outcome was judged favourable with a reduction in clinical signs&#xD;
      and an absence of deformity. Pakarinen et al. in 2002 retrospectively analysed clinical&#xD;
      records and X-rays of 36 feet with CNO from 1994 to 2000. Eighteen patients received BPP&#xD;
      treatment (pamidronate 30-60 mg i.v. once a week for 6 weeks) and no complications were&#xD;
      registered. There was no statistically significant difference in casting time between&#xD;
      patients who received (11 weeks) and patients who did not receive (13 weeks) pamidronate. In&#xD;
      this series, pamidronate infusions were used for selected individuals without any striking&#xD;
      benefits or disadvantages. Clinically, treatment with BP was associated with a more rapid&#xD;
      decrease in skin temperature, but this effect was not sustained. Effect on the pain differed&#xD;
      among studies, with one showing improvement but another showing none.Pakarinen et al tried&#xD;
      Zoledronic acid and reported that it did not reduce the duration of immobilization. Rather&#xD;
      there was an increase in total time for casting in subjects treated with Zoledronic&#xD;
      acid.Similar observations about longer time of immobilization with the use of BPs was&#xD;
      reported in the the recent multicentric observational audit of acute diabetic CNO in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised trials looking into possible use of glucocorticoids in management of active CNO&#xD;
      have not been undertaken, possibly because of only recent understanding of the role of acute&#xD;
      inflammation triggering the osteolysis that characterizes CNO. Intravenous&#xD;
      supra-pharmacological doses of corticosteroids have been used in various inflammatory and&#xD;
      autoimmune conditions because they are cumulatively less toxic than sustained steroid&#xD;
      treatment at lower quantitative dosage. Their action is supposed to be mediated through&#xD;
      non-genomic actions within the cell. When corticosteroids are administered as pulses, an&#xD;
      immediate profound anti-inflammatory effect is achieved, inflammatory damage is minimized ,&#xD;
      toxicity is low and there is no prolonged suppressive effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary&#xD;
      axis. But there are no randomized trials looking into the efficacy and potential benefit of&#xD;
      methylprednisolone in CNO as of date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence this trial was designed to compare the therapeutic efficacy and profiles of two well&#xD;
      known agents Zoledronic acid (antiresorptive) and Methylprednisolone (anti-inflammatory) in&#xD;
      patients of diabetes mellitus with active CNO of foot.&#xD;
