      Admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is one of the major causes of stress and both&#xD;
      physical and emotional difficulties for critically ill patients, both because of the illness&#xD;
      that caused the admission and of the ICU nevironment itself. Despite the use of protocols and&#xD;
      tools to evaluate sedation, many patients continue to have high levels of anxiety. An&#xD;
      inadequate treatment of this condition is associated with increased sympathetic activity&#xD;
      which causes dyspnea and an increase in myocardial oxygen consumption. Sedative drugs, on the&#xD;
      other side, may have significant side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of this, there is clear need to find new strategies and instruments allowing for the&#xD;
      maximization of critical patients' comfort, by promoting pain, anxiety, stress and agitation&#xD;
      relief and minimising the need of sedative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of this study is that the use of music therapy for critically ill&#xD;
      patients can lead to a significant increase of the days free from neuroactive therapy&#xD;
      (analgesics, sedatives, antianxiety meds, antipsychotics) in the first 28 days following&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit admission. To this purpose, data obtained from 3 groups of patients will&#xD;
      be compared - a group with individual treatment administered by a music therapist and&#xD;
      delivered by headphones, a group with a generalised treatment, through the creation of a&#xD;
      weekly musical program continuously broadcasted in the hospital room, and a control group.&#xD;

      Introduction The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is one of the major causes of stress and both&#xD;
      physical and emotional difficulties for patients and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have been conducted in the investigators' and other Intensive Care Units and they set&#xD;
      out to investigate main causes of stress in critical patients; among the most significant&#xD;
      factors were shown to be life saving treatment such as mechanical ventilation, invasive&#xD;
      procedures, restriction of movement, pain and inability to verbally express it, environment&#xD;
      characterized by constant light and sound stimulation, loss of interaction with loved ones&#xD;
      and the staff, and sleep deprivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the use of protocols and tools to evaluate sedation, many patients continue to have&#xD;
      high levels of anxiety. An inadequate treatment of this condition is associated with&#xD;
      increased sympathetic activity which causes dyspnea and an increase in myocardial oxygen&#xD;
      consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of it, there is clear need to find new strategies and instruments allowing for the&#xD;
      maximization of critical patients' comfort, by promoting pain, anxiety, stress and agitation&#xD;
      relief and minimising the need of sedative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among non pharmacological treatment, hypnosis and relaxation techniques, implementation of&#xD;
      communication with patient, music therapy and physical support are shown to be effective (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of music as a therapeutic complement has been described in literature for a long&#xD;
      time, using a rational selection in musical composition. Music application to obtain health&#xD;
      benefit is defined music therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main research question which this study aims to answers is music therapy's effectiveness&#xD;
      in reducing analgesics and sedatives need, as well as reducing anxiety and loneliness, and in&#xD;
      re- establishing normal sleep patterns. It should be noted that music brings significant&#xD;
      benefits as there is absence of contraindications and it is immediately usable by everybody.&#xD;
      Italian experiences in the music therapy field in the Intensive Care Unit are low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this music therapy project, the investigators intend to build a multifactorial&#xD;
      intervention to reduce stress risk factors of patients and their families, still not applied&#xD;
      in our country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many factors influence the effectiveness by music therapy: age, gender, cognitive abilities,&#xD;
      stress levels, anxiety, pain, music education, familiarity with a determinate type of music,&#xD;
      individual preferences, and culture are all elements which can modify the effect of certain&#xD;
      music selection on the subject (19, 20). From this, there is the need of individual choice&#xD;
      and careful monitoring of effects that music has on each individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music therapy in the treatment of stress in the Intensive Care Unit&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent meta analysis (21) reveals that listening to music can cause a reduction of anxiety&#xD;
      levels in mechanically ventilated patients; some studies show, moreover, a reduction of&#xD;
      analgesic and sedative need in response to the application of a music therapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanisms underlying music therapy effectiveness A shared theory about the reduction of&#xD;
      anxiety induced by music is that it helps patients to distance their minds from environmental&#xD;
      stress factors to focus on pleasant sounds and calming incentives (8, 22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of music is extensive, moreover giving patients an aesthetic experience which&#xD;
      offers comfort and peace in a stressful situation. Guided interventions by music therapists&#xD;
      are more effective because music used is adapted to the needs of that determinate moment,&#xD;
      thanks to professional abilities. If music is selected personally by patient, this provides a&#xD;
      major sense of control in the environment, like that of Intensive Unit, where the patient is&#xD;
      almost totally dependent from health workers (23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the neuropsychological point of view, it was assumed that music has a relaxing effect&#xD;
      through its impact on central and autonomic nervous system (24- 26); more specifically, its&#xD;
      application determines a deleting effect on the sympathetic system, leading to a reduction of&#xD;
      circulating catecholamines and to lower nervous and muscle stimulation (25,27). Potential&#xD;
      benefits which result are reduction of pain, reduction of blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen&#xD;
      consumption and muscle tension (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis of the study The hypothesis of this study is that the use of music therapy for&#xD;
      critically ill patients can lead to a significant increase of the days free from neuroactive&#xD;
      therapy (analgesics, sedatives, antianxiety meds, antipsychotics) in the first 28 days&#xD;
      following Intensive Care Unit admission, in absence of statistically significant reduction of&#xD;
      the welfare index of health workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these data are not available in the literature and would represent an undiscussed&#xD;
      advantage in the promotion of welfare in critical patients during recovery in Intensive Care&#xD;
      and at distance from itself; this can also lead to possible significant implications in terms&#xD;
      of a more effective assistance and lower duration of the stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study study has the main purpose of verifying if using music therapy as an&#xD;
      individualised or generalized intervention in hospitalised patients in Intensive Care, in&#xD;
      different cure settings, allows for a reduction of total dose of&#xD;
      analgesics/sedatives/antipsychotics administered. The investigators will analyse if the&#xD;
      proposed intervention of music therapy can have a role in giving the following advantages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increased hours of sleep of patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduction of anxiety and psychomotor agitation manifestations,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improvement of work welfare,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lower grade of anxiety, stress, and post traumatic symptoms of the family,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduction of frequency and duration of physical restraint,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  practicability of the proposal of generalized music therapy, through the understanding&#xD;
           the frequency in which music is interrupted for reasons of clinical contingency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this purpose, data obtained from 3 groups of patients will be compared - a group with&#xD;
      individual treatment, a group with generalised treatment, through the creation of a weekly&#xD;
      musical program, and a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population in study will be that of patients hospitalised in Intensive Care for variable&#xD;
      aetiologies, which recovery is longer than 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All without undermine (or even improve) worker welfare, in order to improve physical and&#xD;
      psychological outcome of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and study groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3 groups are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control: the patients who belong to this group will not be assigned to a regulated music&#xD;
           therapy treatment, thus they will listen to the background sounds (alerts, voices) right&#xD;
           in the Intensive Care environment; radio use will be allowed according to medical/&#xD;
           nursing judgements;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Personalised treatment: during a music therapy consultancy, each patient will be&#xD;
           investigated (if possible from the neurological point of view) on musical preferences&#xD;
           and list of possible music will be proposed which will be reproduced for 2 hours at day.&#xD;
           It is specified that this genre of intervention, as far as well described and studied in&#xD;
           literature, does not belong in clinical practice, and therefore earphones for listening&#xD;
           to music are not yet used in our task force.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Generalised treatment: it will be carried out through the creation of a 'weekly&#xD;
           playlist' with the following considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Daily sound reproduction from 7 am to 11 pm, with 10 minutes break about every 50&#xD;
                minutes of music;&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Spread through the environment with specifically designated speakers, at a&#xD;
                controlled volume (30-50 dB);&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Choice of playlist of music both classic and modern, with very easy listening,&#xD;
                selected according to the daily hours to restore circadian rhythm and following&#xD;
                predictable activities of care provided to patients (hygienic care, retail food,&#xD;
                administration other therapies, physiotherapy, visit by relatives, …);&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Mixing tracks so that there is continuity and fluidity of listening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to the study groups. On the basis that proposed&#xD;
      intervention has environmental nature (in control and music therapy group), patients&#xD;
      respecting inclusion and exclusion criteria to the protocol will be divided according to the&#xD;
      room occupied. The study is configured like a randomized study, not a blind one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The environment where the study will take place, the departement of Anestesia e Rianimazione&#xD;
      of San Paolo Hospital - University, does not have single box but 3 open rooms, each one with&#xD;
      2 beds, in which single beds are separated by about 5 meters. This logistic issue will not&#xD;
      hinder the study execution since nothing changes with control group patients about sound&#xD;
      environmental management; for personalized music therapy group the use of earphones avoid the&#xD;
      music overlap coming from the other patients; equally for the generalized music therapy, in&#xD;
      view of intervention nature which provides passive exposure of patients to the music&#xD;
      reproduced in the whole environment of the room, the results will not be relatively impacted&#xD;
      by the ward. The 3 rooms are instead well disjoint among themselves, so that music coming&#xD;
      from one hardly can reach the others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected data It will be measured for each patient's' free days from neuroactive drugs and&#xD;
      neuroactive drug total dosage administered. Moreover, the eventual need of use of restraints&#xD;
      for patient safety and duration will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once per nursing shift, anxiety levels will be detected, measured with verbal scale number&#xD;
      (VNR), agitation, measured with RASS scale (Richmond Agitation- Sedation Scale), and pain&#xD;
      will be detected with VNR scale or behavioural measures (Behavioral Pain Scale, BPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover the hours of sleep declared in medical record will be registered on the basis of&#xD;
      nurse evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through semi structured interviews, welfare of the health care workers and relatives will be&#xD;
      investigated as well as the perceived interference of the intervention based on music&#xD;
      therapy; the impact of experience in Intensive Care on the lives of relatives will be&#xD;
      evaluated through a validated questionnaire (SSS- Short Scale for PTSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to verify the feasibility of the proposal of generalised music therapy, the number&#xD;
      of interruptions of music reproduction will be registered for contingent clinical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of data From the data collected, organised in a database in compliance with the&#xD;
      applicable privacy policy (law 196/2003), it will be possible to verify if the use of&#xD;
      personalised and generalised music therapy in patients hospitalized in Intensive Care, in&#xD;
      different care settings, allows for a reduction of total dosage of analgesic/ sedative/&#xD;
      antipsychotic drugs administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the analysis will be centralised at the investigators' institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Assuming the possibility to transform data with Blom method, in order to obtain a&#xD;
      normal distribution and so higher power in equal amplitude sample, and assuming a effect size&#xD;
      of 0.30 and a doubling of the parameter of main outcome (days free from neuroactive drugs&#xD;
      administration) in the 2 groups of intervention compared to the control group, the sample&#xD;
      size required or an effective power of 80% is 53 subjects per group. This sample size is also&#xD;
      sufficient to cover the analysis conducted comparing measurements repeated on the same&#xD;
      patient. To this purpose, a linear model will be used which requires 51 subjects per groups,&#xD;
      assuming a correlation coefficient of 0.5 between measures and a size effect of 0.25. Sizing&#xD;
      was conducted with SAS software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data will be expressed as median (standard deviation) if normally&#xD;
      distributed (Shapiro- Francia test), or like median ( range interquartile) otherwise. Data&#xD;
      will be transcribed from clinical records on a sheet of Microsoft Excel 2010 calculations&#xD;
      (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). Statistical analysis will be performed with&#xD;
      Stata/SE 12.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX USA). For each comparison statistical&#xD;
      significance will be considered for values of p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
