  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although tuberculosis is a treatable disease, it is currently the infectious disease with the&#xD;
      highest mortality in the world. It is estimated that one-third of the world's population is&#xD;
      infected. HIV is the main predisposing factor for TB development. The Brazilian Ministry of&#xD;
      Health and the World Health Organization recommends that patients should initially be treated&#xD;
      orally with RIPE - rifampicin (R), isoniazid (I), pyrazinamide (P) and ethambutol (E). The&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) first benefit was reported during the 1960s, when it proved to be an&#xD;
      effective mucolytic agent in individuals with cystic fibrosis. Later, a new role arose when&#xD;
      investigating its therapeutic potential in acetaminophen intoxication. Cleavage of the acetyl&#xD;
      group makes cysteine available for later incorporation into glutathione synthesis, decreased&#xD;
      in hepatic injury caused by acetaminophen. This mechanism causes NAC to have an indirect&#xD;
      antioxidant effect, which aroused an interest in studying the effect in diseases that occur&#xD;
      with oxidative stress. TB and HIV/Aids are also diseases with chronic inflammation. The&#xD;
      present study aims to evaluate the effects of NAC as a adjuvant therapy in the treatment of&#xD;
      TB. This is a phase II randomized clinical trial in which the safety and tolerability of NAC&#xD;
      as adjunctive therapy for TB treatment will be assessed. Fifty-six patients will be&#xD;
      randomized into two groups. The first group will receive the standard tuberculosis treatment&#xD;
      as recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Health (RIPE); the second will receive in&#xD;
      addition to this treatment 1200mg of NAC per day for two months. In this way, microscopy and&#xD;
      culture conversion rate to mycobacteria at 8 weeks, levels of glutathione and biomarkers of&#xD;
      immune activation and inflammation in case of TB with or without NAC will be monitored.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      TB and AIDS are also diseases that occur with a chronic inflammatory stimulus, with constant&#xD;
      formation of excessive free radicals, leading to cellular and systemic oxidative stress. The&#xD;
      effects of NAC in both populations are studied. A study demonstrated that HIV-positive&#xD;
      individuals have low levels of glutathione in CD4+ T lymphocytes when compared to healthy&#xD;
      controls, these levels being restored after in vivo supplementation with NAC, favoring the&#xD;
      production of cytokines involved in Th1 response. They also observed that glutathione&#xD;
      depletion in lymphocytes was correlated with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor and&#xD;
      free radicals. Some authors suggested that the immune system's inability of HIV-positive&#xD;
      individuals (or not) in containing Mycobaterium tuberculosis (Mtb) may be a consequence of&#xD;
      low levels of glutathione in macrophages. The same occurred in a model of animals infected&#xD;
      with Mtb, suggesting that oxidative stress was partly due to the poor antioxidant defense of&#xD;
      the host. NAC supplementation decreases the bacterial load on the spleen and the severity of&#xD;
      necrosis in the lung. The balance between oxidative and antioxidant substances plays a&#xD;
      critical role in the induction of IL-12 production involved in the Th1 response and suggests&#xD;
      that the use of NAC may be useful for better immune control of TB. Additional benefits of NAC&#xD;
      in individuals with TB are related to the possible protective effect of hepatic to&#xD;
      tuberculostatic drugs and to the direct antimicrobial effect demonstrated in vitro. Some&#xD;
      authors suggest that the restoration of glutathione levels reversed the loss of innate&#xD;
      immunity functions, pointing to a new mechanism of control of Mtb and a possible complement&#xD;
      to antiretroviral treatment. This clinical trial will be undertaken in the Amazonas State&#xD;
      (Western Brazilian Amazon), in Manaus, at Fundação de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira&#xD;
      Dourado. It is a prospective, open-label, 2-arm, randomized clinical trial. Twenty-five&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled in each treatment arm. A total number of 50 patients should be&#xD;
      enrolled. Patients hospitalized in the ICU, in the wards or emergency room of the tertiary&#xD;
      unit care will be invited to participate in this study. The assessment schedule will be done&#xD;
      in days 1, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 120 and 180 (in addition, patient will be asked to come back to&#xD;
      the health centre if symptoms occurs at any time). Sputum and blood collection and medical&#xD;
      evaluation will be performed.&#xD;
