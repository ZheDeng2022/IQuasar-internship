      Emergence delirium/emergence agitation (ED/EA) is a behavioral phenomenon of unclear etiology&#xD;
      consisting of short lived behavioral changes that can be both traumatic to families and pose&#xD;
      a safety risk to patients and staff. ED is characterized by a variety of presentations,&#xD;
      including crying, excitation and agitation, that occur during the early stage of recovery&#xD;
      from general anesthesia, generally in the first 30 minutes. Emergence delirium occurs in&#xD;
      children of all ages following an anesthetic with halogenated agents (e.g.&#xD;
      sevoflurane/isoflurane) with or without having undergone a surgical procedure (e.g. MRI&#xD;
      patients). Presently, the treatment for ED is to revert the patient back to a hypnotic state&#xD;
      mainly with sedatives so that they may &quot;reset&quot; themselves postulating that by re-inducing a&#xD;
      hypnotic state, the brain has time to resolve this issue. The hypothesis of this study is&#xD;
      that during ED, there is failure of organized EEG activity, especially alpha wave activity&#xD;
      and that by enhancing alpha activity, the incidence of ED may be reduced without the need for&#xD;
      additional pharmaceuticals which may be costly, delay recovery and are not without adverse&#xD;
      effects specifically cardiopulmonary depression through the use of blue monochromatic light.&#xD;

      Emergence delirium/emergence agitation (ED/EA) is a behavioral phenomenon of unclear etiology&#xD;
      consisting of short lived behavioral changes that can be both traumatic to families and pose&#xD;
      a safety risk to patients and staff. ED is characterized by a variety of presentations,&#xD;
      including crying, excitation and agitation, that occur during the early stage of recovery&#xD;
      from general anesthesia, generally in the first 30 minutes. Involuntary activity in the bed&#xD;
      and even thrashing about during an episode of ED can lead to dislodgement of IV cannulas,&#xD;
      surgical dressings and or surgically placed items such as drains and catheters. Emergence&#xD;
      delirium occurs in children of all ages following an anesthetic with halogenated agents (e.g.&#xD;
      sevoflurane/isoflurane) with or without having undergone a surgical procedure (e.g. MRI&#xD;
      patients). Electroencephalograms (EEG) in patients experiencing emergence delirium show&#xD;
      diffuse background slowing. Presently, the treatment for ED is to revert the patient back to&#xD;
      a hypnotic state mainly with sedatives so that they may &quot;reset&quot; themselves postulating that&#xD;
      by re-inducing a hypnotic state, the brain has time to resolve this issue. The hypothesis of&#xD;
      this study is that during ED, there is failure of organized EEG activity, especially alpha&#xD;

      Monochromatic light (ML) has been used in a variety of clinical and non-clinical applications&#xD;
      to affect a variety of changes. Exposure to light of short wavelength within the visible&#xD;
      spectrum (450-470nm) has been associated with effects on circadian rhythm, neuroendocrine and&#xD;
      neurobehavioral changes and enhanced cognitive performance. Blue ML has been studied safely&#xD;
      to enhance work-place alertness and productivity. Clinically, blue ML has been used safely&#xD;
      for decades in the neonatal intensive care unit to treat jaundice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blue ML, has been known to suppress melatonin secretion and enhance alertness and workplace&#xD;
      performance. The effect occurs within the retinal photoreceptive ganglion cells which mediate&#xD;
      the observed responses. The effect is even present in visually blind persons lacking outer&#xD;
      retinal function. Short exposure to bursts of blue light has revealed enhanced neural&#xD;
      activity on functional MRI. Use of blue ML has been shown to enhance EEG activity in the&#xD;
      alpha range (awake range) compared with light of greater wavelengths. Using blue ML in the&#xD;
      operating room may enhance alpha EEG activity, (a circadian marker for alertness) it may be&#xD;
      possible to reduce the incidence of emergence delirium in the post-operative period and&#xD;
      therefore the amount of (non-pain) sedative medication needed in recovery.&#xD;
