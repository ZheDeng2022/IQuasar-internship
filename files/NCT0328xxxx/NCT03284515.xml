      A study investigating gene expression profiles in pregnant women in response to a pertussis&#xD;
      containing vaccination in pregnancy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaccinations are a vital part of ensuring population health, but there is a continued need&#xD;
      for new and improved vaccines to be developed and this process of design and development can&#xD;
      be both slow and expensive. Vaccination in pregnancy against pathogens such as pertussis,&#xD;
      influenza and tetanus is a routine part of antenatal care in many countries. The principle&#xD;
      behind this approach is that through vaccination the amount of disease specific antibody is&#xD;
      increased in the woman and there is therefore an increase in transplacental transfer to the&#xD;
      fetus providing protection for infants after birth. In the UK vaccination against pertussis&#xD;
      is recommended from 16 weeks gestation and against influenza at any gestation within the&#xD;
      influenza season. There is evidence that pertussis vaccination in pregnancy is highly&#xD;
      effective against pertussis in infants too young to be protected by the routine infant&#xD;
      immunisation programme (Amirthalingam G et al, 2014, Dabrera G et al, 2015). There is also&#xD;
      evidence that this is a safe strategy in pregnancy to protect newborn infants (Donegan K et&#xD;
      al, 2014) with no evidence of adverse clinical outcomes for mother or infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BioVacSafe project has been designed to develop techniques which can be used to&#xD;
      understand more about biomarkers of safety in individuals' response to vaccines. This will&#xD;
      improve our understanding of how reactogenicity can be identified earlier, how adverse&#xD;
      reactions can be identified and classified and how individuals interact with vaccines,&#xD;
      specifically in conditions of health and disease. Since the start of the BioVacSafe project&#xD;
      the importance of vaccination in pregnancy has become better understood and it has become&#xD;
      important to include pregnant women as participants in this project. Pregnancy is a time of&#xD;
      altered immunity and it may be that there are differences in gene signatures following&#xD;
      vaccination in pregnant women compared with non-pregnant women. Insights into this could be&#xD;
      extremely important in the development of new vaccines for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of vaccination in pregnancy is of primary importance to pregnant women and their&#xD;
      partners, clinical trials investigators, ethics committees, vaccine manufacturers and&#xD;
      regulators. Determining specific genetic signatures following vaccination may accelerate&#xD;
      vaccine development by predicting possible adverse events early in the development process.&#xD;
