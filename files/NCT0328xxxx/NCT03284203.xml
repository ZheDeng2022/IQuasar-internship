  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' central hypotheses predict that the handheld spirometry device will be&#xD;
      feasible for inpatient and at-home use, and is equally efficacious at determining lung&#xD;
      function when compared to traditional, bedside spirometry measurements. To test these&#xD;
      hypotheses, the investigators propose the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Determine the correlation of SpiroPD handheld spirometry measurements with&#xD;
      bedside Koko spirometry lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Correlation between the two lung function tests will be substantial for both&#xD;
      hospitalized and ambulatory patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the feasibility, adherence, and preliminary management efficacy&#xD;
      of home SpiroPD testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: (1) Patients will demonstrate substantial adherence to daily home spirometry&#xD;
      testing; (2) medication adherence will increase significantly in patients who are adherent to&#xD;
      daily home spirometry testing; (3) acute care utilization will decrease significant in&#xD;
      adherent patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) results in nearly 750,000 hospitalizations&#xD;
      annually and is the third leading cause of &quot;early&quot; (within 30-day) hospital readmissions in&#xD;
      the United States. Curbing preventable early readmissions for acute exacerbations of COPD&#xD;
      (AECOPD) has become a national priority, as demonstrated by the Medicare Hospital&#xD;
      Readmissions Reduction financial penalty program. One critical barrier in assessing&#xD;
      readmission risk is the lack of an easily-measured 'vital sign' for COPD: accurate, timely&#xD;
      measurements of lung function. Unlike other medical problems that have validated,&#xD;
      easily-obtained measurements of organ function, COPD evaluation often defaults to patient&#xD;
      report and physician evaluation without critical physiologic data. This lack of objective&#xD;
      pulmonary function data during AECOPD in turn leads to critical errors in disease severity&#xD;
      assessment. However, the required, repeated measurements by spirometry that can demonstrate&#xD;
      responses to therapy can be time-consuming and expensive to perform in a laboratory, and both&#xD;
      equipment and staffing infrastructure for bedside testing is cumbersome and often not&#xD;
      prioritized. For these reasons, spirometry frequently is not done for patients with AECOPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To monitor patient responses to therapy and to assess risks based on objective measures, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to the study the use of a portable, patient-driven device (&quot;SpiroPD&quot;)&#xD;
      that can be used in both in-patient and outpatient settings, and that reports (via the&#xD;
      internet) values collected in real time. While the device has been used in the lung&#xD;
      transplant community and for patients with cystic fibrosis, no studies have been done to&#xD;
      validate its use in COPD. This protocol involves in-hospital patient training with the device&#xD;
      followed by serial measurements at home in the first 30 days post hospital-discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demonstration in a pilot, single-center trial of the usefulness of real-time, repeated&#xD;
      hand-held spirometry to provide objective measurements of lung function in AECOPD will have a&#xD;
      substantial impact on both patient health outcomes and on health care utilization and will&#xD;
      set the stage for appropriate next-step studies and NIH grant applications. It is unknown&#xD;
      whether this specific technology will be acceptable in the target population, though previous&#xD;
      research suggests that older patients may be more willing to use home monitoring technology.&#xD;
      This multi-disciplinary research team includes providers from the Department of Medicine and&#xD;
      the UCM COPD Readmissions Program team.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    The aims represented in this study are also included in another, larger study of at-home COPD&#xD;
    care. There was insufficient research team support to complete both protocols and the work&#xD;
    would have been duplicative. Thus, we have terminated this study.&#xD;

    <measure>Spirometry measurements from use of SpiroPD instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days from patient enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will use the handheld spirometry device every day for 30 days. After use, the device will store spirometry measurements for each patient each day and the data will be synced over wifi to each individual's associated online account. Daily measurements from the SpiroPD device will be collected over the course of 30 days. These measurements will then be compared against spirometry measurements collected using the bedside KoKo machine during baseline and 30-day follow-up visits.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to using the SpiroPD device at home on a daily basis</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days from patient enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Daily use of the SpiroPD will be measured by way of captured spirometry measurements. IF there is no recorded spirometry measurement in the SpiroPD device for certain days, those days will be considered when discussing non-adherence to daily use of the SpiroPD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of Patients to use the SpiroPD device at home consistently</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days from patient enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility, or ease of use, will be measured by tracking the number of inquiries received on the designated SpiroPD help line. Each inquiry will be measured and tracked using an inquiry intake form. The type of inquiry or issue the patient is having and the possible solutions to the issue will be recorded. The patient's study ID and the date and time of their call will be recorded. These metrics along with adherence measurements will be factored in when discussing the feasibility of the SpiroPD device.</description>
