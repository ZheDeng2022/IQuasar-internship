  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized cross-over pilot study. The research hypothesis is that the diet&#xD;
      high in SDS content (H-SDS) will lower the daylong glycemic response and improve the glycemic&#xD;
      control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to the diet low in SDS content&#xD;
      (L-SDS).&#xD;

      The study is a randomized cross-over pilot study. The research hypothesis is that the diet&#xD;
      high in SDS content (H-SDS) will lower the daylong glycemic response and improve the glycemic&#xD;
      control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to the diet low in SDS content&#xD;
      (L-SDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 patients with type 2 diabetic patients will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjets will have 5 visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection visit (V1) is required to check whether the patients fulfill inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visit V2 will include randomization, medical check-up and a dietary interview (LogBook&#xD;
      supply with explanations for filling and dietary advice cards for the 1st week of diet). The&#xD;
      nurse will insert the CGMS and the patient will receive detailed instructions on wearing the&#xD;
      sensor and recorder. The patient will leave the research center with a glucometer, the&#xD;
      starchy foods and cereal products adapted for its first week of diet and the associated&#xD;
      cooking instruction sheets and menus given by the dietician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each day of the first experimental diet period, the patient will take at least four&#xD;
      blood glucometer readings per day, and will consume the food products according to a menu&#xD;
      plan and the cooking instruction sheets given by the dietician, and fill a dietary record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 days +/- 1 day, the patient will return to the center (Visit V3) to remove the CGMS,&#xD;
      bring back the glucometer and the follow-up LogBook. A Medical check-up will also be&#xD;
      performed. Compliance will be assessed using the dietary record of the follow-up LogBook and&#xD;
      the return of the uneaten products (weighting). A feedback questionnaire will be completed by&#xD;
      each patient to have a global assessment of the diet and to evaluate the feasibility of this&#xD;
      type of diet over longer periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wash-out period will then last 2 weeks +/- 3 days. Then a new sequence will start. The&#xD;
      visit V4 will be similar to visit V2 with: installation of the CGMS, provision of the LogBook&#xD;
      and diet specific information for the second period. The glucometer and starchy foods and&#xD;
      cereal products will be supplied to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each day of this second diet period, patients will be required to consume starchy&#xD;
      foods and cereal products according to a menu plan and cooking instructions provided by the&#xD;
      dietician, and fill a dietary record. The patient will realize 4 capillary blood glucose&#xD;
      control and will fill the information required in the LogBook.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, Visit V5 will be the last visit. It will include, like for visit V3: removal of&#xD;
      CGMS, return of glucometer and follow-up LogBook and a medical check-up . Compliance will be&#xD;
      assessed using the dietary record of the follow-up LogBook and the return of the uneaten&#xD;
      products (weighting). A feedback questionnaire will be completed by patients.&#xD;
