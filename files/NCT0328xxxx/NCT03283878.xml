      The Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Patients Undergoing Elective Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA):&#xD;
      Multi-Center Trial is a study that will compare the effectiveness of various perioperative&#xD;
      strategies for antibiotic delivery as prophylaxis for periprosthetic joint infections (PJI)&#xD;
      and surgical site infection in elective primary TKA. The investigators hypothesize that a&#xD;
      single dose of prophylactic antibiotic administered within 60 minutes before the incision is&#xD;
      not an effective way to prevent PJI in elective primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The&#xD;
      investigators also hypothesize that the prolonged delivery (24 hours) of antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis after surgery does not further reduce the incidence of PJI in elective primary&#xD;
      TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duke University is the only site recruiting both primary total knee arthroplasty and&#xD;
      unilateral knee arthroplasty.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total joint arthroplasty (TJA), is one of the most successful operations in modern medicine;&#xD;
      however, it remains an expensive procedure in an era of constrained health care resources.&#xD;
      Arthritis affects 49.9 million Americans with 21.1 million experiencing&#xD;
      arthritis-attributable activity limitations. As these numbers are expected to increase&#xD;
      significantly by 2030, the demand for primary total knee arthroplasties (TKA) by 673% to 3.48&#xD;
      million procedures/year. Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), with its disastrous&#xD;
      implications, continues to challenge the orthopaedic community. Practicing orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgeons continue to invest efforts to minimize surgical site infection (SSI). Kamath et al.&#xD;
      evaluated characteristics and resource utilization associated with revision arthroplasty for&#xD;
      PJI using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. The authors found that PJI was the most common&#xD;
      indication for revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and the third most common reason for&#xD;
      revision total hip arthroplasty (THA). Prophylactic antibiotics aim to provide protection&#xD;
      against bacteria most likely to gain access to the surgical site during the procedure and in&#xD;
      the perioperative period. The two most common bacteria causing contamination and subsequent&#xD;
      deep infection in TKA are Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While antibiotic regimens for antimicrobial prophylaxis might carry different risks and&#xD;
      side-effect profiles, e.g., hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), acute kidney&#xD;
      injury, and Clostridium difficile infection, there are a number of studies which validate the&#xD;
      importance of the preoperative dose of antibiotics in decreasing periprosthetic joint&#xD;
      infection (PJI) and surgical site infection (SSI) in total joint arthroplasty (TJA). However,&#xD;
      there are conflicting recommendations/guidelines as to the optimal timing and the optimal&#xD;
      duration perioperative antibiotics. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), the&#xD;
      Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and SCIP guidelines recommend that prophylactic&#xD;
      antibiotics be completely infused within one hour before the surgical incision. The US&#xD;
      advisory statement recommends that antimicrobial prophylaxis be administered within one hour&#xD;
      before incision and discontinued within 24 hours after the end of the operation, while&#xD;
      European guidelines recommend a single dose within 30 minutes before incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) published its updated guidelines for&#xD;
      prevention of SSI prevention that included a recommendation regarding peri-operative&#xD;
      antibiotic prophylaxis. Based on their evaluation of the available literature, the CDC&#xD;
      recommended that a single dose of peri-operative antibiotics be utilized for patients&#xD;
      undergoing clean-contaminated surgical interventions, advocating for no prophylaxis after the&#xD;
      incision is closed in the operating room. This guideline encompasses several surgeries where&#xD;
      implants are utilized, including arthroplasty, spine fusion, and fracture fixation.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it was classified as a category IA-strong recommendation with high quality&#xD;
      evidence. However, much of the literature cited for this recommendation is based on&#xD;
      cardiothoracic, vascular, and general surgeries, where few or no implants are utilized. It is&#xD;
      important to recognize that these surgical cohort may behave differently from the orthopaedic&#xD;
      patient population in terms of infection risk and severity of infection outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical research protocol seeks to address the lack of knowledge and Level I data&#xD;
      around the optimal antimicrobial prophylaxis and to address the question if a single&#xD;
      preoperative dose is enough compared to additional postoperative prophylaxis. Several smaller&#xD;
      clinical studies have used pre- and post-intervention periods to assess the effect of&#xD;
      antibiotic duration for surgical prophylaxis. Tang et al launched a surgical wound infection&#xD;
      surveillance program to monitor all orthopaedic surgeries and changed the prophylactic&#xD;
      antibiotic regimen from intravenous cefuroxime (one preoperative and 2 postoperative doses&#xD;
      every 8 hours) to one single preoperative dose of intravenous cefazolin for all clean&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgeries. The authors of this study found no significant difference in the&#xD;
      superficial and deep wound infection rates in 1,367 primary arthroplasties performed with a&#xD;
      single preoperative dose of cefazolin versus 3 doses of cefuroxime. The deep wound infection&#xD;
      rate for THA was 1.1% (95% CI, 0%-3.3%) in the cefuroxime group and 1.1% (95% CI, 0%-2.2%) in&#xD;
      the cefazolin group (p=1.0). The deep wound infection rate of TKA was 1.6% (95% CI, 0%-3.8%)&#xD;
      in the cefuroxime group and 1.0% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.7%) in the cefazolin group (p=0.63).121 In a&#xD;
      retrospective review of 1,341 TJAs, Williams and Gustilo found no difference in deep&#xD;
      infection rates between a 3 day and 1 day course of prophylactic antibiotics, but emphasized&#xD;
      the importance of the preoperative dose, which was 2g of cefazolin. Mauerhan compared the&#xD;
      efficacy of a one-day regimen of cefuroxime with a 3-day regimen of cefazolin in a&#xD;
      prospective, double-blinded, multicenter study of 1,354 patients treated with arthroplasty&#xD;
      and concluded that there was no significant difference in the prevalence of wound infections&#xD;
      between the two groups.[34] In the group treated with primary THA, the prevalence of deep&#xD;
      wound infection was 0.5% (1/187) for those treated with cefuroxime compared with 1.2% (2/168)&#xD;
      for those who had received cefazolin. In the group treated with a primary TKA, the rate of&#xD;
      deep wound infection was 0.6% (1/178) for those treated with cefuroxime compared with 1.4%&#xD;
      (3/207) for those who had received cefazolin. Heydemann and Nelson, in a study of hip and&#xD;
      knee arthroplasty procedures, initially compared a 24-hour regimen of either nafcillin or&#xD;
      cefazolin with a 7-day regimen of the same and found no difference in the prevalence of&#xD;
      infection. They then compared a single preoperative dose with a 48-hour regimen and again&#xD;
      found no difference in infection prevalence. A total of 466 procedures was performed during&#xD;
      the 4-year study. No deep infections developed in either the one-dose or 48-hour antibiotic&#xD;
      protocol group. A deep infection developed in one (0.8%) of the 127 patients in the 24-hour&#xD;
      protocol group and in two (1.6%) of the 128 patients in the 7-day protocol group for an&#xD;
      overall infection rate of 0.6% (3/466). The authors recognized that as a result of the small&#xD;
      sample sizes, the study lacked the power to compare the one dose and the more than one dose&#xD;
      categories. In two trials, a total of 1609 patients were randomly assigned to receive 1.5 g&#xD;
      of cefuroxime intravenously every 8 hours for a total of 16 hours (n = 1511) or 24 hours (n =&#xD;
      98) postoperatively versus 1600 patients given no postoperative prophylaxis. Both studies&#xD;
      showed no difference between treatment groups suggesting that current available evidence may&#xD;
      not support the efficacy of postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of&#xD;
      surgical-site infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics have been a critical public health tool since the discovery of penicillin in&#xD;
      1928, saving the lives of millions of people around the world. Today, however, the emergence&#xD;
      of drug resistance in bacteria is reversing the miracles of the past eighty years, with drug&#xD;
      choices for the treatment of many bacterial infections becoming increasingly limited,&#xD;
      expensive, and, in some cases, nonexistent. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#xD;
      (CDC) estimates that drug-resistant bacteria cause two million illnesses and approximately&#xD;
      23,000 deaths each year in the United States alone. The Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
      Prevention (CDC) estimates that drug-resistant bacteria cause two million illnesses and&#xD;
      approximately 23,000 deaths each year in the United States alone&#xD;
      (https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/). The National Action Plan for Combating&#xD;
      Antibiotic-resistant Bacteria provides a roadmap to guide the Nation in rising to this&#xD;
      challenge. Developed in response to Executive Order 13676: Combating Antibiotic-Resistant&#xD;
      Bacteria - issued by President Barack Obama on September 18, 2014 - the National Action Plan&#xD;
      outlines steps for implementing the National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant&#xD;
      Bacteria and addressing the policy recommendations with regard to antibiotic stewardship as&#xD;
      outlined by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). One of the&#xD;
      goals of the National Action Plan is the implementation of evidence-based infection control&#xD;
      practices can prevent the spread of resistant pathogens and questions the way surgeons use&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics in the preoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientific rationale for antibiotic prophylaxis is to inhibit or eliminate contaminating&#xD;
      microorganisms that gain access to the surgical site during the procedure. Thus, the goal of&#xD;
      administering preoperative antibiotics is to allow for adequate tissue (blood, soft tissue,&#xD;
      and bone) concentrations by the time of incision. Thus, these antibiotics should exceed the&#xD;
      minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the organisms most likely to be encountered for&#xD;
      the duration of the operation. While the role of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis is well&#xD;
      established, controversy exists about best clinical practice guidelines with regard to&#xD;
      antibiotic regimen and route of administration. The results of the proposed study will be&#xD;
      used to establish a clinical practice guidelines for antimicrobial prophylaxis in elective&#xD;
      total joint arthroplasty.&#xD;
