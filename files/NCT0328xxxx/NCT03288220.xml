      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When people have a stroke, they often have difficulty moving their arms and hands.&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can improve how well people with and without stroke&#xD;
      can move their arms and hands. But the effects of TMS are minor, and it doesn t work for&#xD;
      everyone. Researchers want to study how to time brain stimulation so that the effects are&#xD;
      more consistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand how the brain responds to transcranial magnetic stimulation so that treatments&#xD;
      for people with stroke can be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older who had a stroke at least 6 months ago&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers ages 50 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have up to 5 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 1, participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
      Participants with stroke will also have TMS and surface electromyography (sEMG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For TMS, a brief electrical current will pass through a wire coil on the scalp. Participants&#xD;
      may hear a click and feel a pull. Muscles may twitch. Participants may be asked to do simple&#xD;
      movements during TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For sEMG, small electrodes will be attached to the skin and muscle activity will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 2, participants will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They will lie on a table&#xD;
      that slides into a metal cylinder in a strong magnetic field. They will get earplugs for the&#xD;
      loud noise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 3, participants will have TMS, sEMG, and electroencephalography (EEG). For EEG,&#xD;
      small electrodes on the scalp will record brainwaves. Participants will sit still, watch a&#xD;
      movie, or do TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be asked to have 2 extra visits to redo procedures.&#xD;

      Study Description: We will study if corticospinal excitability (primary outcome measure)&#xD;
      varies across different sensorimotor alpha EEG waveform oscillation phases in healthy older&#xD;
      adults and chronic stroke patients. Sensorimotor cortical neuronal spiking is highest at&#xD;
      sensorimotor alpha oscillation troughs and lowest at sensorimotor alpha oscillation peaks,&#xD;
      suggesting that cortical excitability is higher at sensorimotor alpha oscillation troughs&#xD;
      relative to peaks. We will address these questions using closed-loop TMS. Based on this&#xD;
      previous work, we hypothesize that corticospinal excitability (primary outcome measure) will&#xD;
      be increased at sensorimotor alpha oscillation troughs compared to peaks in healthy older&#xD;
      adults (Experiment 1), and chronic stroke patients (Experiment 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a potential adjunct therapy for&#xD;
      post-stroke neurorehabilitation. So far, it has been customarily applied uncoupled from brain&#xD;
      oscillatory activity (as measured using EEG waveforms), resulting in variability in the&#xD;
      biological response to each stimulus, small effect sizes and significant inter-individual&#xD;
      variability. Brain oscillatory activity (i.e., EEG waveform oscillatory activity) in the&#xD;
      alpha band (8-12 Hz) is linked to cortical inhibition, motor function and cognitive&#xD;
      processing, and therefore influences brain function. For example, corticospinal excitability&#xD;
      (as measured with TMS) in healthy humans varies depending on the sensorimotor alpha&#xD;
      oscillatory phase during which TMS is delivered: corticospinal excitability is higher when&#xD;
      TMS is delivered during sensorimotor alpha oscillation troughs (i.e., maximum surface&#xD;
      negativity) and lower when TMS is delivered during sensorimotor alpha oscillation peaks&#xD;
      (i.e., maximum surface positivity). We recently replicated this result in young healthy&#xD;
      adults. We therefore aim to extend these findings to two new populations: healthy older&#xD;
      adults (Experiment 1) and patients with chronic stroke (Experiment 2). Previous studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that older adults exhibit significant differences in motor cortical physiology&#xD;
      compared to young adults, so Experiment 1 will be performed to determine whether an&#xD;
      association between sensorimotor alpha oscillatory phase and corticospinal excitability is&#xD;
      present in healthy aging. Additionally, Experiment 2 will be performed to determine if the&#xD;
      expected association between sensorimotor alpha oscillatory phase and corticospinal&#xD;
      excitability is also present after chronic stroke. Importantly, acquiring information&#xD;
      regarding how the aged and damaged brain respond to EEG waveform oscillation-dependent&#xD;
      closed-loop TMS will be critical for developing more effective TMS-based (i.e., closed-loop)&#xD;
      interventions. In both experiments, TMS delivery will be timed to specific sensorimotor alpha&#xD;
      oscillation phases. We expect the results of this work to provide new insights into how&#xD;
      corticospinal excitability is affected by sensorimotor alpha oscillation phase in the aged&#xD;
      and post-stroke brain, which could lead to more effective use of sensorimotor alpha&#xD;
      oscillation-dependent neuromodulatory TMS protocols in the future.&#xD;
