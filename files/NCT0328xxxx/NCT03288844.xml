  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, multicentre, prospective, non-pharmacological follow-up study of the&#xD;
      clinical trial HOLOCORE. All patients transplanted with Holoclar in the HOLOCORE clinical&#xD;
      trial who consent to participate will be enrolled in this prospective study and observed for&#xD;
      at least 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HOLOCORE FOLLOW-UP prospective study offers the opportunity to collect long-term efficacy and&#xD;
      safety data after one or two treatments with Holoclar. Moreover, since Holoclar (study drug&#xD;
      used in the main HOLOCORE interventional clinical trial) is suspected to improve the success&#xD;
      of keratoplasty in those patients candidate to receive this treatment but no data were&#xD;
      collected in the three previous retrospective studies (HLSTM01, HLSTM02 and HLSTM04) on&#xD;
      Holoclar, this follow-up study has been thought to observe the progress of the disease and to&#xD;
      collect data on keratoplasty and evaluate the benefits of Holoclar in subsequent keratoplasty&#xD;
      in patients treated once or two times with Holoclar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients treated in the HOLOCORE clinical trial who consent to roll over to the present&#xD;
      extension study at the end of the HOLOCORE will be observed for a follow-up period which may&#xD;
      vary from a minimum of 12 month for the last patient to a maximum of 57 months for the first&#xD;
      patient entered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of approximately 70 patients is expected (all patients who completed the HOLOCORE&#xD;
      study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case the last enrolled patient undergoes to Keratoplasty at the Last Visit of the&#xD;
      Follow-up study, this will consequently lead to a prolongation of the study up to further 12&#xD;
      months for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be enrolled and observed at the same investigational centers where they&#xD;
      were recruited for the HOLOCORE clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No drug will be administered for the scope of this study. Ophtalmological visits including&#xD;
      pictures collection and quality of life evaluations will be performed every 6 months.&#xD;
