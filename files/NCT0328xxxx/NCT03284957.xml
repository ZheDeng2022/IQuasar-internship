      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the incidence rate of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and to determine the&#xD;
           maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as well as the recommended dose (RD) of amcenestrant&#xD;
           administered as monotherapy and in combination with palbociclib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the incidence rate of DLT and determine the RD of everolimus or abemaciclib in&#xD;
           combination with the selected amcenestrant dose for the combination therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Run-In:&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Residual ER availability with positron emission tomography (PET) scan [(18)F]&#xD;

      Duration of the study, per participant, will include eligibility period (screening period) of&#xD;
      up to 4 weeks (28 days), treatment period (at least 1 cycle [28 days] of study treatment),&#xD;
      and end of treatment (EOT) visit at least 22 to 30 days (or until the participant receives&#xD;
      another anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier) following the last study treatment&#xD;
      administration. The expected enrollment period is approximately 42 months.&#xD;

    <description>Part A: Amcenestrant will be administered orally once daily (QD). Treatment will begin with an identified starting dose. Administration of higher doses to subsequent participants is based on occurrence of DLTs and evaluation of target saturation and PK parameters at initial and subsequent doses, until maximum administered dose (MAD) is reached. Drug will be administered in a 28-day cycle.&#xD;

    <description>Part C: Amcenestrant will be administered in combination with palbociclib: amcenestrant starting oral daily dose will be one dose level below monotherapy RD and palbociclib will be dosed at fixed standard dose. Administration of higher dose of amcenestrant (with standard palbociclib dose) to subsequent participants will be based on occurrence of DLTs at initial and subsequent doses, until MAD of amcenestrant is reached. Drugs will be administered in a 28-day cycle (palbociclib will be administered for 21 days of cycle).&#xD;
Part D: Based on the results in Part C, participants will be administered either: 1) a determined amcenestrant dose (RD) with standard dose of palbociclib in combination therapy, or 2) one of two randomized dose levels of amcenestrant with standard dose of palbociclib in combination therapy.
