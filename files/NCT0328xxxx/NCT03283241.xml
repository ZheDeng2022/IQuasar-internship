      A randomised, multicentre, double blind, parallel group comparative investigation where&#xD;
      subjects will be randomised to receive coated or uncoated implants&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of two parts. Part I, is the main study ending when all subjects have&#xD;
      reached visit 5. The study will be evaluated and Clinical Study Report (CSR) will be written&#xD;
      for this part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II, of the study is a post-follow up study starting when the first subject has completed&#xD;
      visit 5. There will be a separate CSR written for Study Part II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study Part I will begin with a baseline visit, visit 1, Informed consent procedure will&#xD;
      take place. Provided the subject will give informed consent for both Study Part I and Study&#xD;
      Part II the screening procedure starts. Subjects will undergo all screening and baseline&#xD;
      assessment procedures including assessments of dental status to determine number of implants&#xD;
      needed. Subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be given a date for implant surgery within three weeks. The required number of implants will&#xD;
      be ordered from the Study Distributor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the implantation day, visit 2, eligibility will be re-checked before the surgery&#xD;
      procedures starts. The subjects who still are eligible will enter the treatment and the&#xD;
      implantation surgery is conducted. The first follow-up visit after implantation will take&#xD;
      place week 2 post-surgery and the last follow-up visit in Study Part I will be at week 12.&#xD;
      Any post-surgical complications and adverse events will be collected and recorded in the&#xD;
      eCRF. On demand, depending on the outcome of the surgery, additional visits might occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Part II, the Post Follow-up Study, consist of two visits, one at month 12 and another&#xD;
      visit at month 24 post-surgery. Post-surgical complications and adverse events from Study&#xD;
      Part I will be followed-up if not resolved previously. Safety, survival rate and marginal&#xD;
      bone loss will be assessed and outcome recorded in the eCRF. Additional visits might occur&#xD;
      depending on the status of the subjects.&#xD;
