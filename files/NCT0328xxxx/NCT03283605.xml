  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway had previously been shown to be efficacious in&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.&#xD;
      Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) to metastatic lesions causes localized cancer cell&#xD;
      killing and the release of cancer cell debris, which could stimulate the immune system in the&#xD;
      presence of immunotherapy. The purpose of this study is to assess the tolerability and&#xD;
      efficacy of combining Durvalumab (MEDI4736), Tremelimumab and SBRT in controlling cancer&#xD;
      progression. SBRT will be administered to patients while they are receiving Durvalumab and&#xD;
      Tremelimumab.&#xD;
