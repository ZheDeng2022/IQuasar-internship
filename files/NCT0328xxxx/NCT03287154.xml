  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate in patients with alcohol disorder and forehand weaned the&#xD;
      efficiency of 10 active tDCS sessions versus 10 sham (placebo) sessions in the support of&#xD;
      abstinence at 3 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study takes place at one site (Henri Laborit Hospital, Poitiers, France) and is&#xD;
      comparative, randomized and controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 groups : one group is receiving sessions of active tDCS (active group) whereas&#xD;
      the second group is receiving sham (placebo) sessions (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized either in the active group or in the control group with a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An unblinded investigator is responsible of the stimulation part and could not evaluate the&#xD;
      patients. The other investigators are blinded and could evaluate the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is going to evaluate the effect produces by stimulations in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the placebo group, after the intensity has reached its maximal intensity (the same as in&#xD;
      the active group), the stimulation is stopped after few seconds (30 seconds in mostly&#xD;
      studies). This process allow patients in the placebo group to feel the same sensations as&#xD;
      patients in the active group (indeed, tingles and itches are felt only during the first few&#xD;
      seconds of stimulation). The poor duration of stimulation do not produces clinical effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study begins after a withdrawal period of 7 days +/- 3 days with 10 stimulations of 2 mA&#xD;
      during 20 minutes from Monday to Friday during 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following these stimulation sessions, the patient will have 5 follow-up visits on site with&#xD;
      an investigator and 2 phone follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-inclusion visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V0 visit (inclusion visit): takes place at the earliest 48 hours after stopping&#xD;
           benzodiazepines used in the withdrawal period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment (weeks 0 and 1): 5 days of treatment per week during 2 weeks 2 arms : sham&#xD;
           (placebo, 10 stimulations) vs active (10 stimulations of 2 mA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1 (Week 4) : short nurse consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2 (Week 6) : short medical consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3 (Week 10) : short medical consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 4 (Week 14) : long medical consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 5 (Week 18) : nurse phone follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 6 (Week 22) : nurse phone follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 7 (Week 26) : long medical consultation&#xD;
