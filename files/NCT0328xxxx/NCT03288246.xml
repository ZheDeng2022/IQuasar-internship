  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as an individual randomized trial among 150 HIV-infected adolescents&#xD;
      aged 10-24 years who have been on ART for &gt;6 months and will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion&#xD;
      to one of two arms: 1) the intervention arm (POC) will receive a POC VL test with adherence&#xD;
      counseling informed by the VL result the same day as testing vs. 2) the standard-of-care arm&#xD;
      (SOC) will receive a standard laboratory-based test with adherence counseling informed by the&#xD;
      VL result 1 month later. The study tests an intervention, POC VL testing, which reduces the&#xD;
      time between sample collection and participant receipt of results, thus decreasing the number&#xD;
      of steps in the HIV treatment cascade. This intervention was developed to addresses health&#xD;
      systems-based barriers which delay clinic, laboratory, and data management processes for VL&#xD;
      monitoring for HIV-infected adolescents. Our results will contribute to research on whether&#xD;
      POC VL testing is a feasible testing method which could be incorporated into health systems&#xD;
      in similar resource-limited settings and whether it can improve outcomes among HIV-infected&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;

      This study is designed as an individual randomized trial among 150 HIV-infected adolescents&#xD;
      aged 10-24 years who have been on ART for &gt;6 months and will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion&#xD;
      to one of two arms: 1) the intervention arm (POC) - receiving a POC VL test with adherence&#xD;
      counseling informed by the VL result the same day as testing vs. 2) the standard-of-care arm&#xD;
      (SOC) - receiving a standard laboratory-based test with adherence counseling informed by the&#xD;
      VL result 1 month later. The study tests an intervention, POC VL testing, which reduces the&#xD;
      time between sample collection and participant receipt of results, thus decreasing the number&#xD;
      of steps in the HIV treatment cascade. This intervention was developed to addresses health&#xD;
      systems-based barriers which delay clinic, laboratory, and data management processes for VL&#xD;
      monitoring for HIV-infected adolescents. The results will contribute to research on whether&#xD;
      POC VL testing is a feasible testing method which could be incorporated into health systems&#xD;
      in similar resource-limited settings and whether it can improve outcomes among HIV-infected&#xD;
      adolescents. The two study arms are described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard-of-care (SOC): At the first visit after enrollment and randomization, participants&#xD;
      in the SOC arm receive a standard laboratory-based VL test. Steps in the standard&#xD;
      laboratory-based VL testing process include: sample collection at a phlebotomy clinic&#xD;
      adjacent to the adolescent HIV clinic, labeling and daily storage, transportation (1 hr&#xD;
      drive) to the central laboratory, arrival and intake at the laboratory, processing in the&#xD;
      fully automated Abbott system, manual entry of the printed results into an excel spreadsheet&#xD;
      by laboratory staff, and manual entry of results on the spreadsheet into the EMR by data&#xD;
      management staff. This process - from sample collection to patient return of results - varies&#xD;
      depending on the volume of samples collected each day and on laboratory and data management&#xD;
      staffing. Average time from blood collection to availability of the result in the EMR is 2-3&#xD;
      weeks. Per standard clinical care at the adolescent HIV clinic, adolescents return for&#xD;
      monthly visits, and the patient receives the VL result and adherence counseling which is&#xD;
      informed by the VL result 1 month after providing the blood sample. The primary endpoint is&#xD;
      return of the VL result within 6 weeks of sample collection to allow for a short time buffer&#xD;
      for appointments that are not scheduled exactly 1 month from the previous visit for reasons&#xD;
      related to school, work, family obligations, or holidays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These standard laboratory procedures were developed to meet the high demand for VL testing&#xD;
      when the Haitian national guidelines switched from recommending routine CD4 testing to&#xD;
      routine VL testing. Since the Abbott systems are fully automated and can batch large&#xD;
      quantities of samples together, this approach is appropriate for a routine nation-wide health&#xD;
      system testing protocol. However, the need for transportation, cold-chain storage, and manual&#xD;
      entry of thousands of results every year may not be the optimal structure for HIV-infected&#xD;
      adolescents who are more likely to have high VL results and are more likely to be lost from&#xD;
      care in between visits. This study will test the POC VL test vs. this standard&#xD;
      laboratory-based test to determine if reducing the time between sample collection and patient&#xD;
      receipt of results (removing a step in the HIV treatment cascade), can increase the impact of&#xD;
      VL testing on clinical management and adolescent patient outcomes. The study will test if&#xD;
      implementation of the POC VL test, in collaboration with clinicians and laboratory staff, and&#xD;
      accompanied by patient education, can address many of the logistical barriers to&#xD;
      laboratory-based VL testing in a resource-limited setting such as Haiti.&#xD;
