  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Does a rotary based triplanar exercise intervention that utilizes the trunk as a proximal&#xD;
      lever, strengthen the hip and alter dynamic LE alignment in running females?&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current hip-focused programs fail to alter hip adduction angles in females while performing&#xD;
      higher speed and more complex maneuvers such as running.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Willy, et al., 2011) - 10 female runners, underwent 6 wk. hip focused intervention, change&#xD;
      in SLS but NO change in hip adduction angle while running.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A different intervention strategy that includes utilizing the trunk as the proximal lever to&#xD;
      strengthen the hip, could potentially alter biomechanical outcomes such as hip adduction&#xD;
      angles in female runners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will apply a new intervention model and then measure running, single leg squat and&#xD;
      hip strength to determine if a newly informed intervention can alter LE kinematics in females&#xD;
      while running and make improvements in hip strength following the intervention Inclusion&#xD;
      Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18 years old or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Female Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Injury of the lumbar spine, hips, knees or foot/ankle in the last 6mos that required&#xD;
           medical attention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  any surgery of the lower back or the pelvis or lower extremities any time in the&#xD;
           subjects life&#xD;

    <description>Subject squats on single leg and qualitative scoring is administered to determine the subjective amount of contralateral pelvic drop and femoral adduction to be described as dynamic knee valgus. The qualitative values will be binary in nature, whereas DKV is present or not.</description>

    <description>2/3D analysis of running gait following intervention; Utilizing both 3D/2D methods the measure of contralateral pelvic drop and the bisection of the patella will determine the amount of femoral adduction noted during running. The change in the femoral adduction angle after a 6 week intervention is the specific outcome measure to be obtained.</description>
