    <textblock>
      This Phase III study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KX2-391 Ointment in&#xD;
      adult participants when applied to an area of skin containing 4-8 stable, clinically typical&#xD;
      Actinic Keratosis (AK) lesions on the face or scalp.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was a double-blinded, multicenter, activity, and safety study of KX2-391 Ointment&#xD;
      administered topically to the face or scalp of participants with actinic keratosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of Screening, Treatment, Follow-up, and Recurrence Follow-up Periods.&#xD;
      Eligible participants received 5 consecutive days of topical treatment, to be applied at the&#xD;
      study site. Activity (lesion counts) and safety evaluations was performed.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 57</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal post baseline LSR was defined as the highest grade of any LSR reported at any post baseline visits for a participant. The LSR assessment was an Investigator's (or sub-investigator's) assessment of the following signs on the treatment area: erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration. The LSRs were graded on a 4-point scale ranging from 0=absent, 1=mild (slightly, barely perceptible), 2=moderate (distinct presence), and 3=severe (marked, intense).</description>

        <description>Maximal post baseline LSR was defined as the highest grade of any LSR reported at any post baseline visits for a participant. The LSR assessment was an Investigator's (or sub-investigator's) assessment of the following signs on the treatment area: erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration. The LSRs were graded on a 4-point scale ranging from 0=absent, 1=mild (slightly, barely perceptible), 2=moderate (distinct presence), and 3=severe (marked, intense).</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in participant which does not necessarily have causal relationship with treatment. An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of medicinal product, whether or not considered related to medicinal product. An SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death; was life threatening; required persistent/significant disability/incapacity; resulted in initial or prolonged in patient hospitalization; was congenital anomaly/birth defect or otherwise considered medically important. TEAEs (serious and non-serious) were defined as either those AEs with onset after first dose or those pre-existing AEs that worsen after first dose. Events of special interest included skin cancers (including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and their location and treatment area), ocular exposure, overdose, and pregnancy.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death; was life threatening; required persistent/significant disability/incapacity; resulted in initial or prolonged in patient hospitalization; was congenital anomaly/birth defect or otherwise considered medically important. Events of special interest included skin cancers (including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and their location and treatment area), ocular exposure, overdose, and pregnancy.</description>
