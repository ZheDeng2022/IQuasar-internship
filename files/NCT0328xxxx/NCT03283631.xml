  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this protocol is to transfer autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
      (PBMCs) transduced with genes encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that recognizes&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) tumor-specific antigen into patients&#xD;
      with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The CAR used is&#xD;
      targeted to a tumor-specific mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFRvIII,&#xD;
      which is expressed on a subset of patients. Normal PBMCs derived from patients with GBM are&#xD;
      genetically engineered with a viral vector encoding the CAR and infused directly into the&#xD;
      patient's tumor with the aim of mediating regression of their tumors. Despite our CAR being&#xD;
      targeted to a tumor specific antigen, given the prior toxicity using CARs that were not&#xD;
      targeted to tumor-specific antigens, the investigators elected to begin with very low doses&#xD;
      of cells. Enrollment on this study was suspended in April 2020 while an amendment to reduce&#xD;
      the anticipated number of participants was under review and approved. The decision to&#xD;
      terminate the study was made in January, 2021 to shift toward the next iteration of a related&#xD;
      CAR T cell trial.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with evidence of radiographic recurrence who expressed EGFRvIII on their original&#xD;
      tumor diagnosis had autologous PBMCs harvested by leukapheresis. These autologous PBMCs were&#xD;
      transduced with a retrovirus containing the sequences for the EGFRvIII CAR and sent to the&#xD;
      Duke Radiopharmacy for radiolabeling with 111Indium (111In). Within 2-3 weeks of&#xD;
      leukapheresis, on Day -4 to -2, patients had a BrainLab MRI to prepare for biopsy and&#xD;
      catheter placement. On Day -1, the patient underwent standard of care (SOC) stereotactic&#xD;
      biopsy under local anesthesia to confirm tumor recurrence. At the time of biopsy, prior to&#xD;
      catheter insertion and administration of study drug, the presence of recurrent tumor was&#xD;
      confirmed by histopathology. If tumor recurrence was confirmed, a catheter was placed&#xD;
      intratumorally for delivery of EGFRvIII-CARs by Convection Enhanced Delivery (CED).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SRS will took place on Day 0 (+1 day) and 111In-labeled EGFRvIII-CARs were infused on the&#xD;
      same day over a 6 to 6.5 hour period immediately after SRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days 1 and 2 after 111In-labeled EGFRvIII-CAR infusion, whole planar imaging followed by&#xD;
      Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) Computed Tomography (CT) imaging assessed&#xD;
      the intracerebral and systemic localization of the 111In-labeled EGFRvIII-CARs that described&#xD;
      the distribution of EGFRvIII-CARs within the brain and systemically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a novel,&#xD;
      tumor-specific treatment with autologous EGFRvIII-CARs. The proposed starting dose was 2.5 x&#xD;
      10^8 of 111In-labeled cells in 3 milliliters (mL). The infusion flow rate was fixed at 0.5&#xD;
      mL/hr.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment on this study was suspended in April 2020 while an amendment to reduce the&#xD;
      anticipated number of participants was under review and approved. Upon approval of this&#xD;
      amendment, the enrollment suspension remained due to a change in access to necessary&#xD;
      equipment for CAR manufacturing. The decision to terminate the study was made in January,&#xD;
      2021 to shift toward the next iteration of a related CAR T cell trial. The knowledge gained&#xD;
      from this study experience is directing our next CAR T-cell platform and will be used to&#xD;
      secure additional funding.&#xD;
