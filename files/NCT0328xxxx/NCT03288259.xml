      Transnasal Endoscopy in Obese Patients are Candidates for Bariatric Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction and Objectives: high digestive endoscopy (HDE) is an important tool in the&#xD;
      preoperative period of bariatric surgery. Patients with excess weight have a higher risk of&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory complications during this procedure, being that the transnasal endoscopy&#xD;
      (TNE) with an endoscope-thin is a safe alternative, comfortable and great value for money.&#xD;
      The TNE allows the study of the upper gastrointestinal tract without the need for sedation.&#xD;
      The objective of this work was to evaluate the feasibility, tolerance and safety of TNE in&#xD;
      obese patients are candidates for bariatric surgery. Methods: This was a prospective study&#xD;
      with all patients with indication for surgery of obesity undergoing endoscopic transnasal&#xD;
      preoperatively, between December 2016 and August 2018, at the Hospital of the Federal&#xD;
      University of Minas Gerais. The variables evaluated were: age, gender, suitability of the&#xD;
      exam, tolerance by the patient through the visual analogue scale, incidence of complications&#xD;
      and need for sedation. Oxygen saturation, heart rate and systolic blood pressure were&#xD;
      recorded. Conclusion: The transnasal endoscopy is a feasible alternative, well tolerated and&#xD;
      safe the conventional endoscopy in evolution the preoperative bariatric surgery. The benefits&#xD;
      of transnasal endoscopy in obese patients mainly consist in carrying out the procedure&#xD;
      without sedation, which may provide reduction of risks, costs and waive the need for a&#xD;
      companion. Key words: transnasal endoscopy - Obesity - endoscopy without sedation.&#xD;

      1. - Introduction - scientific background, relevance and rationale of the research&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to data from 2014 of the World Health Organization (WHO), globally there are&#xD;
           more than 1.9 billion adults are overweight and at least 600 million obese. 39% of&#xD;
           adults above 18 years were overweight and 13% were obese that year. According to the WHO&#xD;
           classification, the population with overweight is one that has a body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
           greater than or equal to 25 kg/m² and has a BMI greater than or equal to 30 Kg/m² is&#xD;
           obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In Brazil, the excess weight also assumes epidemic proportions. The most recent survey&#xD;
           of the Ministry of Health (MH) conducted in 2014 found that more than half of the&#xD;
           Brazilian population is overweight (52.5%) and of these, 17.9% are obese. The prevalence&#xD;
           of obesity has doubled during the period between 1980 and 2014 in Brazil. The data are&#xD;
           disclosed annually by MH since 2006. Obesity and overweight are considered risk factors&#xD;
           relevant to chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 2, cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
           and malignant neoplasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Among the various treatment modalities, the bariatric surgery is an effective remedy in&#xD;
           cases of morbid obesity with a failure of clinical treatment, giving patients a&#xD;
           reduction of mortality rates and resolution of clinical comorbidities, as was&#xD;
           demonstrated in an observational study of ten years of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The reason for indication of high digestive endoscopy (HDE) in the pre-operative&#xD;
           bariatric surgery refers to the detection and/or treatment of injuries that could affect&#xD;
           the type of proposed surgery, causing complications in the immediate postoperative&#xD;
           period or result in symptoms after surgery. However, the endoscopic examination of&#xD;
           routine pre-operative in these patients is controversial if there is no gastrointestinal&#xD;
           symptoms studies. One of the reasons for this, concerns the increased cardiovascular&#xD;
           risk of obese subjects associated with sedation. In Brazil as well as in other centers,&#xD;
           the guidelines recommend HDE with research of Helicobacter pylori infection in all&#xD;
           patients preoperatively of bariatric surgery. The traditional HDE involves the use of&#xD;
           conscious sedation, with a mortality rate of 0.03% and morbidity of 0.54%. Adverse&#xD;
           cardiopulmonary related to sedation and analgesia equivalent to about 60% of the&#xD;
           complications of high digestive endoscopy, and such complications are more frequent in&#xD;
           obese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is important to highlight the high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in&#xD;
           morbidly obese patients, some studies suggest up to 68%. The OSA is a syndrome&#xD;
           characterized by periods of partial or complete obstruction during sleep, which is more&#xD;
           common in obese individuals. OSA may cause hypoxemia, hypercarbia and cardiovascular&#xD;
           dysfunction. BMI &gt; 30 kg/m² is a risk factor known for hypoxemia in subjects undergoing&#xD;
           endoscopic procedures. Small doses of opioids and benzodiazepines may cause deep&#xD;
           sedation and obstruction of the airway is high in obese patients who have obstructive&#xD;
           sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The endoscopy by transnasal (TNE), founded in 1994, uses ultrathin endoscopic from 5 to&#xD;
           6 mm in diameter that can be introduced through the nasal passages allowing complete&#xD;
           study of upper gastrointestinal tract including the possibility of realization of&#xD;
           biopsies and other small interventions. The main advantage of the TNE is to dispense&#xD;
           with the use of sedation, making the endoscopic procedure safer for patients who have&#xD;
           cardiorespiratory risk and anesthesia higher. Moreover, compared to conventional HDE the&#xD;
           costs involved in the TNE are significantly lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Few studies have compared the TNE with conventional HDE. A Japanese study measured the&#xD;
           diagnostic efficacy of the TNE compared to HDE. This study found that the resolution of&#xD;
           images endoscopy was similar between the two modalities. Sensitivity, specificity and&#xD;
           accuracy of transnasal were 90, 100 and 93%, respectively. One of the largest series&#xD;
           evaluated 1100 patients undergoing TNE, with satisfactory results in 94% of patients. In&#xD;
           the same study, 91% of patients who had undergone prior to conventional endoscopy&#xD;
           preferred the transnasal. A multicenter study published in 2003 showed a significant&#xD;
           difference in cost between the HDE and the TNE. The average total cost of the procedure&#xD;
           was 512 US dollars (+/- 100.8 US dollars) for HDE with sedation and 328.6 US DOLLARS&#xD;
           (+/- 70.3 US dollars) for TNE without sedation (p&lt;0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
           After extensive research in major databases of literature, the investigators found only&#xD;
           one study that examined the use of the TNE in obese patients are candidates for&#xD;
           bariatric surgery. In this study, Nigeria Tome et al., 25 patients were allocated. The&#xD;
           variables analyzed were suitability of examination, patient tolerance, need for sedation&#xD;
           and ability to carry out interventions. Significant pathological alterations during the&#xD;
           endoscopic examination were present in 14 patients (56%), which included hiatal hernia&#xD;
           (28%), gastritis (16%), intestinal metaplasia in the esophagus (12%), gastric polyps&#xD;
           (8%), gastric ulcer (4%) and varices (4%). In all participants reached the second&#xD;
           duodenal portion with excellent tolerance. There was no need for sedation in 23 patients&#xD;
           (92%). biopsies were indicated in 12 participants and successful in all 12 (100%).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The TNE has been validated, mainly in Japan, for screening of gastric cancer early.&#xD;
           Although the TNE is still little used in the west, is considered an attractive&#xD;
           alternative for patients with cardiovascular comorbidities and important respiratory the&#xD;
           example of elderly and obese. Since 2009, our center has developed lines of research&#xD;
           related to the use of the TNE in specific populations, such as for screening of&#xD;
           esophageal neoplasm in high risk patients and for the screening of esophageal varices in&#xD;
           end-stage cirrhosis. In the literature, there is no publication concerning the use of&#xD;
           the TNE in obese patients in Brazil and Latin America.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - The research objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           This prospective clinical study, has the objective of evaluating the feasibility, the&#xD;
           acceptance of the patient, the safety and the costs involved using the TNE in obese&#xD;
           patients are candidates for bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prospective study proposed to be initiated after approval by The Ethics Committee and&#xD;
           completed by August 2018. The target of the study of approximately 100 patients, based&#xD;
           on the expectation of new cases per month of patients who are candidates for bariatric&#xD;
           surgery the outpatient obesity. The demand of the ambulatory of Digestive System Surgery&#xD;
           of the Clinicals Hospital of Minas Gerais is on average of 5 new cases per month.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients referred to the endoscopy of the Institute Alfa of Gastroenterology of the&#xD;
           Clinicals Hospital (IAG-HCUFMG) by the Digestive System Surgery and which meet the&#xD;
           following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Between the ages of 18 and 65 years. A BMI greater than or equal to 40 Kg/m² or greater&#xD;
           or equal 35 Kg/m² associated with comorbidity; The absence of contraindications to&#xD;
           bariatric surgery; Voluntary acceptance to be submitted to the transnasal endoscopy;&#xD;
           Agreed to participate in the study and sign the informed consent form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Surgery, fractures or nasal malformations in advance; History of epistaxis; Allergy to&#xD;
           components of the topical anesthetic used prior to the examination; Coagulation&#xD;
           disorders or use of anticoagulants; Pregnancy; Psychiatric disorder important; Clinical&#xD;
           contraindication to the examination of high digestive endoscopy;&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The procedure of transnasal endoscopy will be performed by endoscopists trained in the&#xD;
           technique, industry members of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy of the IAG-HCUFMG. The&#xD;
           information from the questionnaires will be collected by members of the service. The&#xD;
           ultra-thin endoscope with a diameter of 5.9 mm and working channel of 2 mm, with digital&#xD;
           chromoscopic, will be used in exams. The representative images of the examination will&#xD;
           be recorded and photographed. The patients will be monitored with pulse oximetry and ECG&#xD;
           monitor for assessment of heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation. If&#xD;
           necessary, will be provided supplemental oxygen via nasal catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before the TNE, will be carried out topical anesthesia of the pharynx with lidocaine&#xD;
           spray (10%) 6 jets and instillation of nasal vasoconstrictor. The procedures initially&#xD;
           will be performed without sedation. However if the degree of discomfort is high, or&#xD;
           nasal cavity does not allow the passage of the endoscope, can be used to oral&#xD;
           administration, at the discretion of the endoscopist.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The exam will be considered complete if the appliance reaches the second duodenal&#xD;
           portion and is performed retroflex, allowing the visualization of all portions of the&#xD;
           digestive system and the achievement of biopsies if necessary. The samples of biopsies&#xD;
           will be obtained by collet pediatric 1.8 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The tolerance of the patient will be assessed through a visual analogue scale (VAS) from&#xD;
           0 to 10 (0 - no discomfort; 10 - unbearable) which will be completed by the patient&#xD;
           after the examination, at the request of an independent researcher. Another parameter to&#xD;
           measure the level of comfort of the patient will be performed by the physician&#xD;
           endoscopist wizard, who uses VAS to efforts of vomiting and intolerance, being 0 for no&#xD;
           reflection of vomiting and 10 to violent efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The safety of the procedure of TNE will be evaluated by the rate of complications and&#xD;
           side effects that occurred (cardiorespiratory impairment, epistaxis, nasal pain,&#xD;
           reaction vessel vagal-) and by the index called double product (DP). The heart rate&#xD;
           (HR), blood pressure and oxygen saturation will be documented before, during and after&#xD;
           the procedure. The double product will be the product of the systolic blood pressure and&#xD;
           heart rate (SBP X HR). The DP reflects the myocardial oxygen consumption and cardiac&#xD;
           output in tests of effort, being a tool the prognosis of mortality in cardiac patients&#xD;
           during rest and exercise. A value greater than 15000 is indicative of cardiovascular&#xD;
           stress considerably. The cardiovascular stress serves to evaluate both the safety of the&#xD;
           procedure as well as the comfort of the patient according to the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Shall be assessed the cost of the TNE compared with the conventional HDE. To do this&#xD;
           will be compared the values of inputs, materials and medicines needed. The researchers&#xD;
           will use as the basis for these calculations the updated values of medicinal products&#xD;
           and inputs used during sedation. Will be considered the table of the Unified Health&#xD;
           System (SUS) as the main reference. There will be a real comparison of costs between the&#xD;
           two methods of examination. For this reason, will be calculated the values of medicinal&#xD;
           products and inputs used in 100 patients undergoing traditional endoscopy comparing&#xD;
           costs with the group of candidates in the study that pass through the transnasal&#xD;
           endoscopy. Similar profiles of patients will be allocated and the same researchers&#xD;
           conduct the tests in both groups and at the same institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients will complete a questionnaire 15 to 30 minutes after the transnasal&#xD;
           endoscopy and will be released next to the house.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Collected Data and Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Will be collected general data of patients such as age, gender, BMI, comorbidities,&#xD;
           medications in use, history of allergic reactions, type of bariatric surgery proposal,&#xD;
           history of previous surgeries, previous experience with endoscopic procedures and vital&#xD;
           data. On the exam will be collected information about the endoscopic findings, biopsies,&#xD;
           complications and adverse reactions, patient tolerance and expenses. After the&#xD;
           procedure, the degree of patient satisfaction will also be analyzed in questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All of this information and the results will be compared with the main data in the&#xD;
           literature. Bivariate analyzes shall be calculated from the test &quot;t&quot; test for continuous&#xD;
           variables and the chi-square test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables.&#xD;
           Proportions will be reported by categorical data; and mean, median and standard&#xD;
           deviation for continuous variables. P values less than 0.05 are considered statistically&#xD;
           significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - Plan for the collection and analysis of data&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be conducted as schedule shown below:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Collection of cases - After approval by The Ethics Committee Literature Survey - 12/2015&#xD;
           to 12/2017 Preliminary analysis of the results - 12/2017 Final analysis of results -&#xD;
           12/2017 to 06/2018 Copyrighting - 12/2017 to 08/2018 Presentation - 08/2018&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. - critical analysis of the potential risks and benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patients will be submitted to the transnasal endoscopy and biopsies as a way of&#xD;
           assessing the upper gastrointestinal tract in the pre-operative bariatric surgery. It is&#xD;
           a procedure mandatory before surgery for obesity. The risks related to the endoscopic&#xD;
           procedure are very low. The TNE will be performed by experienced endoscopists of&#xD;
           clinical staff of the Clinicals Hospital and in an environment that has all the human&#xD;
           and material resources for hemodynamic monitoring and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main complications as the endoscopic procedure are: epistaxis, nasal pain,&#xD;
           gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, infection, need for surgery, sepsis and death.&#xD;
           To minimize the risks, the hospital offers equipment for basic and advanced life support&#xD;
           in addition to trained personnel in these situations The benefits of transnasal&#xD;
           endoscopy in this group of patients (obese) consist primarily in performing the&#xD;
           procedure without sedation, which may provide reduction of risks, costs and waive the&#xD;
           need for a companion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. - Plan for dissemination of results&#xD;
&#xD;
           The results of this study will be presented at conferences and published in specialized&#xD;
           journals of recognized credibility. These results will compose the masters thesis to be&#xD;
           defended by the Graduate Program in Applied Sciences to Adult Health, concentration area&#xD;
           in Applied Sciences the digestive tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. - explanation of the criteria to stop or suspend the search&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the beginning of the collection of cases, if this happens to any complications or&#xD;
           unexpected deaths, the work will be suspended immediately or even stopped on duty, and&#xD;
           the Committee on Ethics statement without holding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. - Place of Research&#xD;
&#xD;
           The survey will be conducted in the upper digestive endoscopy of the Institute Alfa of&#xD;
           Gastroenterology at the Clinicals Hospital of UFMG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. - Budget detailed financial&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resources for completion of endoscopic procedure and histopathological diagnosis,&#xD;
      expenditures on inputs, drugs and human material are already part of the list of procedures&#xD;
      covered by SUS. There is no additional cost to the institution or to the patient. Therefore,&#xD;
      this study will not charge for the Clinicals Hospital, as financial resources are already&#xD;
      covered by the Public Health System and the procedure is already part of the routine of the&#xD;
      Digestive Endoscopy of the Institute Alfa of Gastroenterology.&#xD;
