  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurologic disease with loss of motor function is a major health burden. Brain-computer&#xD;
      interfaces (BCI) are systems that use brain signals to power an external device, such as a&#xD;
      communication board or a prosthetic device, which may help people with loss of motor&#xD;
      function. Electrocorticography (ECoG) has been used to decode hand movements and as a control&#xD;
      signal for brain-computer interface (BCI). This study hopes to use a smaller spacing of ECoG&#xD;
      to see if a better motor signal can be found and used as a BCI control signal.&#xD;

      Stroke, spinal cord injury, extremity injury and degenerative/locked-in syndromes are among&#xD;
      those conditions that may benefit from sustainable neuroprosthetic options. The investigators&#xD;
      have studied human motor cortex and related cortical areas with direct brain recording&#xD;
      (electrocorticography or ECoG) as a signal for motor neuroprosthetics. Completing exciting&#xD;
      studies in humans with local fields using intracortical electrodes and long-term working&#xD;
      brain-computer interfaces with EEG, electrocorticography surveys an intermediate level of&#xD;
      spatial specificity and may have durability in long-term recordings. ECoG signals could&#xD;
      ultimately be obtained epidurally or even more superficially if the exact signals were better&#xD;
      understood. To date, the investigators have demonstrated that ECoG signals from motor cortex&#xD;
      can be used to decode movement and have a precision using clinic arrays (1 cm resolution)&#xD;
      that can decode hand movement and allow for the separation of digit movement. These signals&#xD;
      have been used for brain-computer interface and can be used to control a prosthetic hand in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocorticography (ECoG) is the recording of brain signals directly from the cortical&#xD;
      surface. In patients undergoing surgical treatment of epilepsy, these signals have been&#xD;
      available and have shown to be rich sources of motor-related signals that can drive a hand&#xD;
      neuroprosthetic as part of a brain-computer interface (BCI). Though the clinically available&#xD;
      resolution of 1 cm allows for separation of different types of finger movement by using the&#xD;
      high-frequency characteristics of the ECoG recording (70-100Hz), higher spatial resolutions&#xD;
      (3mm) increases the ability to decode finger movements and more complicated hand movements,&#xD;
      such as grasping of different objects. Ideal resolution is one of the several gaps in&#xD;
      knowledge limit pursuing implementation of ECoG-based BCI along with uncertainty about the&#xD;
      longevity of ECoG signals and human implementation of feedback directly to cortex through&#xD;
      electrical stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Higher resolution arrays over subacute (1 week) time frame to allow for adaptation and BCI&#xD;
      use of the higher resolution signals. An 8x8 array of 3mm resolution will be placed over&#xD;
      sensorimotor cortex. Grasp synergies will be determined and mapped onto the electrodes to&#xD;
      determine control channels for each synergy. Control of multiple synergies will move a&#xD;
      simulated robotic hand to a visually cued target shape&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hand synergies will be independently mapped onto the 3mm x 3mm (microarray) with at&#xD;
           least one independent electrode for each of the first three synergies&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Using the signals from the microarray, participants will correctly move the robotic hand&#xD;
           into one of 6 target postures with 50% accuracy.&#xD;
