    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pivotal investigation is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      Cutera enlighten multi-wavelength 532 nm and 1064 nm Nd:YAG picosecond pulse duration laser&#xD;
      and an investigational micro-lens array (MLA) handpiece attachment for improvement of acne&#xD;
      scars.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, prospective, multicenter, pivotal study in up to 45 male or female&#xD;
      subjects, age 18 to 65 years who desire laser treatment for the improvement of acne scars.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive up to 6 laser treatments, spaced 6 weeks (± 2 weeks) apart with the&#xD;
      Cutera enlighten laser with the Micro-Lens Array handpiece attachment. Subjects will be&#xD;
      contacted by phone 7 days (± 2 days) after their first treatment for follow-up. Subjects will&#xD;
      return to the site after all study treatments have been delivered for two follow-up visits: 6&#xD;
      and 12 weeks (± 2 weeks) following their final study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Primary Efficacy Endpoint as the correct identification of the 12 weeks post final&#xD;
           treatment photographs from the baseline by at least two of the three blinded reviewers&#xD;
           in 75% of the patients and an improvement of one point in the ASAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Secondary Efficacy Endpoints as the:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Efficacy of the Cutera enlighten laser with the Micro-Lens Array handpiece&#xD;
                attachment treatment as assessed by the investigator starting from the 2nd&#xD;
                treatment onward, and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subject satisfaction levels as assessed from the subject questionnaire completed at&#xD;
                the final follow-up visit 12 weeks post final treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Safety Endpoint as the safety of the Cutera enlighten laser with Micro-Lens Array&#xD;
           handpiece attachment as assessed by the frequency and severity of device related adverse&#xD;
           events,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The Exploratory Analysis as the Efficacy of the Cutera enlighten laser with a Micro-Lens&#xD;
           Array handpiece attachment for the improvement of skin quality as assessed by the&#xD;
           investigator and/or blinded evaluators 12-weeks-post final study treatment.&#xD;
