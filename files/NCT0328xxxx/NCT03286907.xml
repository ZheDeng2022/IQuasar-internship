      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate efficacies of two online and theory-based interventions [HC: health communication&#xD;
      only and HC-MI health communication plus motivational interviewing (MI)] in increasing uptake&#xD;
      of three doses of HPV vaccines within the 9-month follow-up period among Hong Kong Chinese&#xD;
      men who have sex with men (MSM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HPV vaccination rate of the three groups would be in the order HC-MI group &gt; HC group &gt;&#xD;
      Control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A three-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted (n= 624). With informed&#xD;
      consent, anonymous surveys will be conducted at baseline, Months 3, 6, and 9. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria: 1) HK Chinese men aged &gt;18, 2) oral or anal intercourse with men in the last six&#xD;
      months; 3) no intention to leave HK for one month consecutively within the next 12 months, 4)&#xD;
      regular internet access, and 5) willing to be followed up by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structured questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Group HC: exposure to web-based, interactive and theory-based health communication&#xD;
      promoting HPV vaccination uptake; 2) Group HC-MI: same exposure as Group HC plus MI; and 3)&#xD;
      Group C: exposure to online materials about mental health (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uptake of three doses of HPV vaccination within the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis and expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention-to-treat analysis, General Estimation Equation (GEE) and Cox regression methods&#xD;
      will be used. Significance differences in HPV vaccination uptake rates will be found among&#xD;
      the three groups.&#xD;

      Aims and objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary objective of the RCT study is to evaluate the relative efficacies of two&#xD;
           online, theory-based and interactive interventions [health communication (HC) and health&#xD;
           communication plus MI (HC-MI)] in increasing uptake of three required doses of HPV&#xD;
           vaccination within a 9-month follow-up period among Hong Kong Chinese MSM who had not&#xD;
           previously taken up any dose of HPV vaccination, as compared to the control group (Group&#xD;
           C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the relative efficacies of the interventions in&#xD;
           increasing the following responses at the end of the 9-month follow up period:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) Intention to take up all doses of HPV vaccination in the next 12 months. ii)&#xD;
           Theory-based cognitions supportive of HPV vaccination [e.g. those of the Health Belief&#xD;
           Model (HBM)].&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study design A three-arm parallel RCT will be conducted. Background information and&#xD;
           potential confounder(s) are recorded at baseline. Three post-intervention evaluations&#xD;
           will be performed through short telephone surveys 3, 6 and 9 months after exposure to&#xD;
           the intervention. Participants who have already taken up all three doses of HPV&#xD;
           vaccination at Month 3 or 6 will be asked the termination questionnaire (same as that&#xD;
           for Month 9). Interviewers and data analysts are blinded from participants'&#xD;
           randomization status.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subject Inclusion criteria: 1) Hong Kong Chinese speaking men of aged ≥18, 2)&#xD;
           self-reported oral or anal intercourse with ≥1 man (last six months); 3) no intention to&#xD;
           leave Hong Kong for &gt;1 month consecutively within the next nine months, 4) regular&#xD;
           internet access and 5) willing to be followed up by phone. Those who have ever received&#xD;
           HPV vaccination will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruitment procedures Participants will be recruited by outreaching in local&#xD;
           gay-friendly venues. The fieldworkers will explain the study's detail to participants.&#xD;
           Verbal instead of written informed consent will be obtained due to the need to maintain&#xD;
           anonymity; the fieldworkers will sign a form pledging that participants have been fully&#xD;
           briefed and participants' verbal informed consent was obtained. Fieldworkers obtain&#xD;
           multiple contacts (mobile, email and/or other e-contact) from prospective participants.&#xD;
           Participants will also be recruited via the Internet by comparable procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ethical considerations Fieldworkers guarantee anonymity, the right to quit at any time&#xD;
           and that refusal will not affect participants' chance in using any services. Verbal&#xD;
           instead of written informed consent will be obtained due to the need to maintain&#xD;
           anonymity; the fieldworkers will sign a form pledging that participants have been fully&#xD;
           briefed. In addition, all participants will reconfirm informed consent online before&#xD;
           receiving the online intervention; if the participants select &quot;refuse&quot; for the online&#xD;
           informed consent form, the program will close automatically. Ethics approval was&#xD;
           obtained from the Survey and Behavioral Research Ethics Committee of the CUHK and the&#xD;
           Joint CUHK-NTEC Clinical Research Ethics Committee. All information will be kept in&#xD;
           locked areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization In the pre-arranged phone call, fieldworkers brief prospective&#xD;
           participants again and reconfirm participants' informed consent. Participants are&#xD;
           randomly allocated into one of the three groups, with a sealed opaque envelop drawn by&#xD;
           the research staff. Computerized random numbers and block randomization (block size of&#xD;
           12) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary and secondary outcomes The primary outcome of the study is whether the&#xD;
           participant has taken up all three doses of HPV vaccination (at any clinic) within a&#xD;
           9-months follow-up period. Secondary outcomes include intention to take up all three&#xD;
           doses of HPV vaccination in the next 12 months and changes in HBM-related cognitions on&#xD;
           HPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The baseline survey After randomization takes place, the fieldworker will administer a&#xD;
           baseline telephone survey to record information on potential confounders (Questionnaire&#xD;
           A: 10-15 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evaluation surveys at Months 3, 6 and 9 A short interim phone interview will be&#xD;
           administered at Month 3 and 6 to those who have not taken up three doses of HPV&#xD;
           vaccination at Months 3 and 6 (non-termination) after exposure to intervention,&#xD;
           recording only uptake of HPV vaccination (one dose or two doses, price, venue and date)&#xD;
           during the inter-survey intervals and intention to take up three doses of vaccination in&#xD;
           the next 12 months (Questionnaire B, &lt;5 minutes). Participants present at Month 9 or&#xD;
           having taken up all three dose at Month 3 and 6 (termination) will be asked about HPV&#xD;
           vaccination history, as well as cognitive perceptions and emotional factors included in&#xD;
           the baseline survey (Questionnaire C, about 10 minutes). To reduce loss-to-follow-up,&#xD;
           the investigators will show these questionnaires to the participants at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Information for validating vaccine uptake All participants, including those who are&#xD;
           vaccinated at the collaborating clinic, will be requested to send the research team an&#xD;
           image of the receipt, hiding personal identification and via the same smartphone number,&#xD;
           social media account, or email previous used in this project, after participants have&#xD;
           taken up each dose of HPV vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention of the Group HC (Online Health Communication Only Group) Participants will&#xD;
           watch two short health promotion videos (five minutes each), which contain health&#xD;
           communication messages about HPV and HPV vaccination and complete a self-administered&#xD;
           exercise which attempts to increase related knowledge and supportive cognitions. After&#xD;
           completing the tutorials, participants will be requested to answer an online&#xD;
           questionnaire that contains only three simple questions asking about some details of the&#xD;
           two videos. This is to verify exposure to the videos. One's login time for the tutorial&#xD;
           will be recorded by the computer program (another way to cross-check exposure).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention of the Group HC-MI (Online Health Communication Plus MI Group) In addition&#xD;
           to the components received by the Group HC, Group HC-MI will receive motivational&#xD;
           interviewing (MI) of 15 minutes. To increase involvement of the interviewer and rapport,&#xD;
           the interviewer will &quot;wait for&quot; the participants while the participants are performing&#xD;
           the tutorial. [The interviewer will hold (via third line holding) or hang up the phone&#xD;
           while the participant is doing the tutorial and call back 20 minutes afterwards]. The&#xD;
           interviewer will discuss briefly about the tutorial (e.g. participants' responses or&#xD;
           questions) with the participants to enhance support and also to verify exposure to the&#xD;
           tutorial. The interviewer will then conduct a 15-minute MI session with the participant&#xD;
           over phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Maintenance of motivation for Group HC and Group HC-MI In order to maintain motivation&#xD;
           formed during the intervention, tailored reminders will be sent by Whatsapp or emails to&#xD;
           all participants of the Group HC and Group HC-MI. A link to the project webpage will be&#xD;
           included in such reminders, prompting participants to access a webpage where&#xD;
           participants can watch a testimonial video about HPV experience presented by a peer MSM,&#xD;
           read comments made by other participants, add participants' own comments and feedback on&#xD;
           others' comments. Such arrangements will provide continuous cues to action for&#xD;
           maintaining motivation. The number of reminders will be standardized to five (at month&#xD;
           1, 2, 4, 6 &amp; 8). The number of reminders sending to participants who have taken up all&#xD;
           three doses of HPV vaccination will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The control group (Group C) The health communication messages in Group C will consist of&#xD;
           online messages about prevalence of some common mental health problems among MSM and&#xD;
           introduction of stress reduction exercises. No reminder will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size planning For planning purpose, the investigators conservatively assume 30%&#xD;
           of the automated health communication intervention (Group HC) would show an intention,&#xD;
           and 40% of those with such an intention would actually take up HPV vaccination (i.e. 12%&#xD;
           of Group HC). Regarding the Group HC-MI, the investigators assume the intention would&#xD;
           increase to 60% as MI is a powerful tool; the investigators assume that 50% of its&#xD;
           members with an intention would actually take up the vaccine (hence 30% of Group HC-MI&#xD;
           would be vaccinated). A sample size of 113 per group is needed to achieve the planned&#xD;
           effect sizes and power of .8 and alpha of .0125 for all comparisons (taking into account&#xD;
           multiple comparisons). With an expected loss-to-follow up rate of 35% at month 9, a&#xD;
           sample size of about 174 per group is required (total n=522). To be conservative, the&#xD;
           investigators keep the target sample size of 208 per group (624 in total); which can&#xD;
           detect smallest between-group difference of 16.2% between Group HC (12%) and Group HC-MI&#xD;
           (~28.2%), and detect smallest between-group difference of 10% between Group HC (12%) and&#xD;
           Group C (~2%), at power of .8 and alpha of .0125 (taking into account multiple&#xD;
           comparisons).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data processing and analysis Test-retest reliability of the baseline questionnaire will&#xD;
           be assessed. For categorical responses, Cohen's Kappa statistics will be tested, while&#xD;
           for continuous responses, intra-class correlation coefficient will be used. Chi-square&#xD;
           test or one-way ANOVA will be conducted to compare differences in background&#xD;
           characteristics of those being followed up and loss to follow-up, and differences in&#xD;
           potential confounders recorded at baseline among the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed to assess relative efficacy of the two&#xD;
           interventions Generalized Estimation Equation (GEE) models will be fit to investigate&#xD;
           significance of differences in primary and secondary outcomes across the three groups,&#xD;
           adjusted for any significant potential confounders. Absolute and relative risk&#xD;
           reductions and corresponding 95% CI will be derived. Cox regression analysis will also&#xD;
           be performed, treating those who are loss to follow-up during the follow-up period and&#xD;
           those who had not taken up all three doses of HPV vaccination at the end of the 9-month&#xD;
           follow-up period as censored cases, and completion of all three doses of HPV vaccination&#xD;
           as the event (endpoint), and intervention group membership as the covariate. Adjustment&#xD;
           for potential confounders (found to be significant at baseline analysis) will be&#xD;
           performed if necessary.&#xD;
