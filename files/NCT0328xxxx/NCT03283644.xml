      This study investigates the chronic long-term health condition of obesity and its effect on&#xD;
      neutrophil function and the inflammatory response&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation is a central component of the immune response. In its acute form it aids the&#xD;
      transition from disease to health via the activation of numerous immune cells, enabling them&#xD;
      to reach the site of infection/injury and orchestrate themselves to combat pathogens,&#xD;
      facilitating resolution and repair to restore the host to health. However, chronic&#xD;
      inflammation is deleterious to the host and differs from the &quot;classical&quot; acute inflammatory&#xD;
      process in that the inflammation is not necessarily so readily obvious and is not&#xD;
      self-limiting; rather, the immune system is in a constant state of low-grade activation and&#xD;
      when challenged by pathogenic or sterile injury the response is heightened, resulting in&#xD;
      prolonged tissue damage and a failure of efficient resolution mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neutrophils are important mediators of acquired innate immune responses but may also&#xD;
      contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases. Neutrophils are heavily&#xD;
      involved in antimicrobial defence; their primary role is the localisation and elimination of&#xD;
      pathogenic microorganisms. This, combined with their relatively short lifespan, has resulted&#xD;
      in a traditional view of them as limited &quot;kamikaze&quot; cells. However, as detailed here,&#xD;
      neutrophils have been shown to act with complexity and sophistication, orchestrating the&#xD;
      immune/inflammatory response but also inadvertently contributing to tissue damage in&#xD;
      different disease states. This study investigates the chronic long-term health condition of&#xD;
      obesity and its effect on neutrophil function and the inflammatory response&#xD;
