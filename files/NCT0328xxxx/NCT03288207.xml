      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart disease is a leading cause of death. People can reduce their heart disease risk by&#xD;
      exercising more. Mobile health technology may make people more successful at increasing their&#xD;
      exercise. This includes things like physical activity monitors and smartphone apps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out if mobile health technology can increase physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      African American women ages 25-75 who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are overweight or obese&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Live in certain areas near Washington, DC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a smartphone that can use the study app&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 1, participants will&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Answer survey questions. These may be about medical history, physical activity, and&#xD;
           weight. They may also cover body image, health perception, and spirituality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have body size measured and get blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Get a device to wear on the wrist. It will record physical activity and hours of sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn how to download and use the study mobile app&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 2 weeks, researchers will collect data about participants physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then participants will have a study visit with additional blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will get messages from the app that encourage exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will get data from the app about exercise near their home or work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants may get face-to-face coaching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may get wireless devices. These measure body weight, blood pressure, and blood&#xD;
      glucose. Participants can measure these at home and upload the data to the app for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have visits after 3 and 6 months. They will repeat the visit 1 tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Targeted, effective behavioral interventions are critically needed to ameliorate the&#xD;
      disproportionate prevalence of poor cardiometabolic health for African-American women. We&#xD;
      propose a sequential, multiple-assignment, randomized trial targeting physical activity (PA)&#xD;
      among at-risk African-American women in resource-limited, Washington, D.C. communities using&#xD;
      mobile health (mHealth) technology. We hypothesize that by beginning a community-based,&#xD;
      adaptive PA intervention with remote coaching tailored to neighborhood environment PA&#xD;
      resources, we will see greater increases in PA levels as compared to standard remote&#xD;
      coaching. In Aim 1, we will determine if beginning an adaptive intervention with remote&#xD;
      coaching tailored to neighborhood environment resources and delivered using mHealth&#xD;
      technology (wearables and mobile applications) will lead to a greater PA increase (as&#xD;
      measured by steps per day) as compared to standard remote coaching. In Aim 2, we will examine&#xD;
      which of four embedded adaptive interventions produce the largest PA increase over the&#xD;
      six-month study period. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the feasibility of remote capture of&#xD;
      cardiometabolic measures, including blood pressure, weight, and glucose, using mHealth&#xD;
      technology. We will also examine intervention effects on cardiometabolic health (adiposity,&#xD;
      blood pressure, fasting lipids/glucose, self-reported PA, dietary intake, cigarette smoking).&#xD;
      In Aim 4, we will characterize effects of increasing PA on integrated serologic&#xD;
      cytokine/chemokine and lipid inflammatory intermediates to identify potential novel&#xD;
      inflammatory pathways linked to cardiometabolic risk phenotypes most responsive to the&#xD;
      multi-level, community-based PA intervention. We will also determine the feasibility of&#xD;
      measuring behavioral and psychosocial mediating factors of the relationship between PA change&#xD;
      and cardiometabolic health in this intervention, including chronic&#xD;
      psychological/environmental stress and sedentary behavior/sleep. This project provides&#xD;
      fundamental knowledge towards the development of tailored, effective behavioral interventions&#xD;
      incorporating mHealth technology to promote health among populations most impacted by health&#xD;
      disparities.&#xD;
