  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) works in imaging lymph nodes in patients with rectal cancer that has spread from where&#xD;
      it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced). Ferumoxytol is a form of very&#xD;
      small iron particles that are taken up by cells in normal lymph nodes and may work better in&#xD;
      imaging patients with rectal cancer when given with MRI.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine feasibility of administering ferumoxytol and obtaining ferumoxytol enhanced&#xD;
      magnetic resonance (MR) images in patients with resectable locally advanced rectal cancer&#xD;
      with enlarged or suspicious lateral pelvic lymph nodes before starting neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
      and again before total mesorectal excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To collect detailed information about the location of ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron&#xD;
      oxide (USPIO)-MRI detected lymph nodes prior to neoadjuvant therapy and again prior to total&#xD;
      mesorectal excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the sensitivity and specificity of ferumoxytol enhanced MR imaging in&#xD;
      assessment of pathological lymph nodes with those of non-USPIO-MRI and positron emission&#xD;
      tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ferumoxytol intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes and then after 24-36 hours&#xD;
      undergo ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI before start of neoadjuvant therapy and within 4 weeks&#xD;
      before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4-6 weeks.&#xD;
