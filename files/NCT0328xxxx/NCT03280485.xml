  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are one of the most common reasons for patients to attend the&#xD;
      emergency department (ED). 90% of patients with TBI are defined as mild TBI (mTBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small minority of patients with mTBI would show pathological computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      results and even fewer need neurosurgical intervention. Nevertheless, complications would be&#xD;
      so severe, if neurosurgical intervention is delayed, that it has become common practice to&#xD;
      subject all patients with mTBI to CT. The high number of CT scans has an impact on health&#xD;
      care resources but may also involve risk by subjecting patients through potentially harmful&#xD;
      ionizing radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several independent research groups have attempted to optimize CT use in mTBI patients by&#xD;
      forming guidelines that aim to identify patients at high risk for intracranial complications.&#xD;
      Most guidelines have been published in the past 15 years and have been validated both&#xD;
      prospectively internally and externally; all guidelines have been shown to be safe when&#xD;
      implemented in clinical use with few missed complications. However the number of CT scans has&#xD;
      not been reduced dramatically, in some cases it has even increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2013, the new Scandinavian guidelines (SNC13) were published. They are the first&#xD;
      guidelines that use a biomarker, S100B, as a tool for managing patients with mTBI. Although&#xD;
      S100B has a low specificity for intracranial complications, a high sensitivity makes it&#xD;
      suitable to be implemented into clinical practice as a tool for CT reduction. Previous SNC&#xD;
      guidelines have been compared to other prominent guidelines with impressive results. The&#xD;
      SNC13 have been externally validated in a retrospective study from the USA that was&#xD;
      underpowered for important outcomes. Nevertheless, SNC13 have already been partially&#xD;
      implemented in clinical practice in Scandinavia. However, a strict multicenter validation has&#xD;
      not been performed yet nor a systematic comparison to other available guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary aim is to validate the performance of the SNC13 in predicting intracranial&#xD;
      complications in adult patients presenting with traumatic head injury in Swedish hospitals. A&#xD;
      secondary aim is to compare the performance of SNC 13 with 6 other clinical guidelines, with&#xD;
      respect to important outcomes. Moreover, to explore the performances of different biomarkers&#xD;
      in predicting intracranial complications in predefined subgroups of TBI. Finally, to evaluate&#xD;
      the possibility of further improvement of the SNC13.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design Investigators will perform a prospective, multicenter, pragmatic, observational study&#xD;
      of adults presenting with traumatic head injury at the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data necessary for analysis including predictor variables and outcome data for all the&#xD;
      seven guidelines included in the study will be registered (table 1). Patients will be managed&#xD;
      clinically accordingly to the judgment of the responsible physician and/or local guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting and population The study will be set in Halmstad, Malmö, Lund, Örebro and&#xD;
      Linköping, Sweden. Hallands Hospital Halmstad (HS) is a level II trauma centre, Skåne&#xD;
      University Hospital in Malmö and Lund (SUS), Örebro University Hospital, Linköping University&#xD;
      Hospital are level I trauma centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coordinating site for the study will be HS where the statistical and the comparative&#xD;
      biomarker analysis will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria From September 2017 investigators will prospectively enroll all adult&#xD;
      patients with a GCS 9-15 that seek the ED within 24h after TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients younger than 18 years of age;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients without a Swedish personal identification number due to difficulties in&#xD;
           performing the follow up phase;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  all patients that refuse to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data registration and follow-up Details of how patients are managed, including patient&#xD;
      characteristics, injury type, patient history, clinical examination results, current&#xD;
      medications and CT findings will be documented in a pre-determined case-report form by the&#xD;
      triage nurse and/or physician on call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be asked to answer a questionnaire sent by mail 3 months after the injury.&#xD;
      The questionnaire will be re-sent if no answer is received. If no answer is received from&#xD;
      these attempts, patients will be contacted via telephone. The questionnaire includes&#xD;
      questions that would identify a significant intracranial lesion, data concerning sick-days,&#xD;
      new contacts with medical professionals and information concerning quality of life. In cases&#xD;
      where patients can not be reached by mail or telephone, medical records and national&#xD;
      mortality databases will be consulted for evidence of complications and/or death. The Swedish&#xD;
      health care system allows full visibility of data for persons with a Swedish personal&#xD;
      identification number for medical records and mortality database over the whole country.&#xD;
      Patients who suffer significant (enough to seek medical care) intracranial complications&#xD;
      after discharge would therefore be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details on study period are specified on figure 1 with an algorithm for patient eligibility&#xD;
      and data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be registered in an Excel® file. Descriptive statistics will be analysed using IBM&#xD;
      SPSS® Statistics Version 20 software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S100B analysis A 5ml blood sample is drawn from patient's cubital vein in the ED. Samples are&#xD;
      analysed with the fully automated Elecsys® S100 (Roche AB) at the Clinical Chemistry&#xD;
      Department of HS, SUS, Örebro University Hospital and Linköping University Hospital, Sweden.&#xD;
      Cut-off level for normal levels of S100B according to the SNC guidelines is less than&#xD;
      0.10μg/L and a window of sampling of within 6 hours from the time of the injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From all patients seeking care within 24h form injury with medium and low risk TBI, according&#xD;
      to SNC13 (including multitrauma patients), a 5ml blood sample will be drawn, centrifuged and&#xD;
      frozen at -70 degrees Celsius. Samplings will be coded and registered for analysis of GFAP,&#xD;
      SBP-50 and TAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT examinations CT scans are always analysed by a board certified radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The Scandinavian guidelines will recommend discharge (i.e. neither CT nor&#xD;
      admission) in approximately 50% of patients and a prevalence of our primary outcome of 5%&#xD;
      (from our own observations and from data derived from a pre-selected cohort) . Allowing for&#xD;
      one missed case, a sensitivity of &gt;99% with a lower 95% confidence interval, a sample size of&#xD;
      2490 patients is required to detect traumatic intracranial complications according to the&#xD;
      SNC13. Allowing for a 10% lost to follow-up, the desired sample size is 2767 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analysis After 1000 patients, the prevalence for the primary outcome will be measured&#xD;
      in order to be able to reevaluate sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Ethical approval was granted from the Regional Ethical Review Board of Lund (approval&#xD;
      number 2012/574).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed verbal consent will be obtained and registered by nurses responsible for triage at&#xD;
      ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' data and social security number will be stored and handled accordingly to Swedish&#xD;
      Personal Data Act, (PUL 1998: 204).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written consent will be obtained from all patients from whom the extra blood sampling for&#xD;
      biomarker analysis will be requested. Sampling will be coded and patients will be able at any&#xD;
      time to refuse to be part of the study.&#xD;
