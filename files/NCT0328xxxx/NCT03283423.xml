      To perform image-guided laparoscopic intra-abdominal lymph node biopsy with goal of&#xD;
      minimizing surgical risk and improving accuracy of biopsy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only the superficial lymph nodes are accessible to physical examination, and assessment of&#xD;
      deeper nodes, such as those in the abdomen, requires radiological imaging. As a result,&#xD;
      abdominal CT and PET scanning of patients with a history of malignancy or concerns for a new&#xD;
      diagnosis of cancer is an important diagnostic test. As well as looking for distant&#xD;
      metastasis, the images are carefully assessed for evidence of intra-abdominal&#xD;
      lymphadenopathy, which can be a marker of new or recurrent cancer. If such nodes are&#xD;
      identified, they often require a biopsy for further evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lymph nodes located in the abdomen or the retroperitoneum are not easily accessible for&#xD;
      percutaneous biopsy, often requiring an abdominal exploration which can be done either&#xD;
      laparoscopically or via laparotomy. The laparoscopic approach represents a better approach&#xD;
      that is associated with reduced surgical risks and complications as well as a quicker&#xD;
      recover. In fact in many cases, the laparoscopic approach can be done as a day surgery&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although non-invasive imaging technologies such as computed tomography (CT) scanning,&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning can be&#xD;
      useful in the diagnosis of lymphadenopathy, they often provide an estimate of the location of&#xD;
      the nodes, and exact localization of the lymph node of interest can be challenging. The&#xD;
      surgeons rely on anatomical landmarks which can be distorted during laparoscopy and to help&#xD;
      reduce the rate of false negative lymph node biopsy, the surgeons often perform&#xD;
      intra-operative histological assessment of the lymph nodes (Frozen Section) which can be time&#xD;
      consuming and in itself associated with diagnostic errors. The uncertainty about the exact&#xD;
      location of the node of interest often leads to extensive surgical dissection, biopsy of&#xD;
      multiple nodes, and sometimes repeat surgery. During the dissection, care must be taken to&#xD;
      avoid injury to the neighboring structures, such as blood vessels, nerves or adjacent organs.&#xD;
      In cases, where an intra-operative dissection occurs, or lymph nodes can not be identified,&#xD;
      the laparoscopic surgery is converted to open surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the unique capabilities of the AMIGO suite, investigators aim to test intra-operative&#xD;
      image guidance to help them identify diseased intra-abdominal lymph nodes, allowing for more&#xD;
      precise and safer surgeries. The improved accuracy will allow investigators to perform&#xD;
      surgeries with minimal dissection and reduced complications while improving biopsy rates and&#xD;
      enhancing ability to accurately stage intra-abdominal malignancies.&#xD;
