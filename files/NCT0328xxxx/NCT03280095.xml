        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy male and female volunteers aged 18-45 (both inclusive), as determined by&#xD;
             medical history, physical examination, laboratory test values, vital signs and 12-lead&#xD;
             ECGs at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-smokers from at least three months before receiving the first dose of study drug&#xD;
             and for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 and ≤ 30 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to voluntarily provide written informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must understand the purposes and risks of the study and agree to follow the&#xD;
             restrictions and schedule of procedures as defined in the protocol, as confirmed&#xD;
             during the informed consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female volunteers of child-bearing potential and less than one year postmenopausal&#xD;
             must have a negative serum pregnancy test and be non-lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female volunteers who have been post-menopausal for more than one year and have&#xD;
             elevated serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or are treated with hormone&#xD;
             replacement therapy (HRT) or female volunteers who have been permanently sterilised&#xD;
             (e.g. tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male volunteers and female volunteers of child-bearing potential who are sexually&#xD;
             active must use two highly effective methods of contraception with their partners&#xD;
             throughout the study and for 30 days after completion of the study (female volunteers)&#xD;
             or 90 days after completion of the study (male volunteers). Acceptable methods&#xD;
             include: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/ vault caps) with spermicidal&#xD;
             foam/ gel/ film/ cream/ suppository; male sterilisation (with the appropriate&#xD;
             post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate); established&#xD;
             use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception and placement of&#xD;
             an intrauterine device or intrauterine system. True abstinence is an acceptable method&#xD;
             only where this is already established as the volunteer's preferred and usual&#xD;
             lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male volunteers must not donate sperm during the study and for 90 days after&#xD;
             completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be willing to consent to have data entered into The Over Volunteering Prevention&#xD;
             System (TOPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The volunteer's primary care physician has confirmed within the last 12 months that&#xD;
             there is nothing in their medical history that would preclude their enrolment into a&#xD;
             clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers should be cautioned that codeine may impair mental and/or physical&#xD;
             abilities, therefore it may affect their ability to drive or operate machinery for up&#xD;
             to approximately 24 hours post-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers with history or presence of significant cardiovascular disease, pulmonary,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Volunteers who have a history or presence of any significant drug allergy, including a&#xD;
             history of hypersensitivity to paracetamol, codeine phosphate hemihydrate, any related&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Use of any prescription or over-the-counter medication (including vitamins, herbal and&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Volunteers with inadequate venous access to allow collection of blood samples as&#xD;
             required by this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Strenuous exercise, as judged by the Investigator, within 72 hours prior to screening,&#xD;

             until after the post-study medical.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weekly alcohol intake exceeding the equivalent of 14 units per week for females or 21&#xD;
             units per week for males.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consumption of alcoholic beverages within 48 hours prior to study drug administration&#xD;
             and during study confinement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consumption of caffeine or xanthine-containing products within 24 hours prior to study&#xD;
             drug administration and during study confinement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consumption of grapefruit, grapefruit juice, Seville oranges, Seville orange marmalade&#xD;
             or other products containing grapefruit or Seville oranges within 7 days prior to&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Volunteers who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are unsuitable for participation&#xD;
