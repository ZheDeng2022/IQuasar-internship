  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well photodynamic therapy works in treating patients&#xD;
      with mycosis fungoides that does not respond to treatment. Photodynamic therapy uses a drug,&#xD;
      such as aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride, that becomes active when it is exposed to light.&#xD;
      The activated drug may kill cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in refractory tumors and plaques&#xD;
      of mycosis fungoides (MF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effects of sequential PDT and radiation therapy (RT). II. To determine&#xD;
      the side effect profile of PDT in MF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the quality of life during and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride topically and undergo photodynamic therapy&#xD;
      on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning at week 24, patients undergo radiation&#xD;
      therapy daily for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 8 weeks.&#xD;
