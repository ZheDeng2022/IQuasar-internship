      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a treatment for depression. It&#xD;
      stimulates the brain. Researchers want to see if using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans&#xD;
      helps locate the best area for rTMS in each person. They also want to find other ways to make&#xD;
      it more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effects of combining MRI- guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and&#xD;
      talk therapy on the brain in people with depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18-65 with a major depressive disorder and current depression. If taking an&#xD;
      antidepressant, should have been doing so for at least 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical and psychiatric history, psychiatric evaluation,&#xD;
      physical exam, and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 is 1-4 visits in 1 week. Participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain MRI. Participants will lie on a table in a scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about their medical history and psychology symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests of mood and thinking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests of brain activity. Participants may do tasks during these tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A cone with magnetic detectors is put on the head.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A cap with electrodes is put on the scalp.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  TMS. A brief electrical current passes through a wire coil on the scalp.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A metal disk will be placed on the arm. A nerve will be stimulated with a small&#xD;
                electrical shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 is about 6 to 7 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be 30 daily sessions of combined therapy and repetitive TMS (rTMS) for 6&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive rTMS and another therapy by computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For rTMS, repeated pulses will pass through the coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is followed by up to 3 additional visits, when:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will repeat Phase 1 tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will rate their depression symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 is 3 visits over 3 months. Participants will rate their depression symptoms and&#xD;
      repeat some of the previous questionnaires and tests of mood and thinking.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the growing use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a treatment&#xD;
      for unipolar major depression, its typical effect sizes have been modest, and both&#xD;
      methodological and conceptual challenges remain regarding how to optimize its efficacy. Two&#xD;
      key elements have been missing from current work: first, to take an RDoC approach and link&#xD;
      the treatment to a comprehensive model of the neurocircuitry underlying depression, where&#xD;
      applying such a model to personalize the site of stimulation is likely to significantly&#xD;
      improve the efficacy of rTMS; and second, to maximize neural changes to the engaged&#xD;
      depression network by utilizing cognitive paired associate stimulation (C-PAS), a technique&#xD;
      we have developed over the last decade in which noninvasive stimulation is applied to the&#xD;
      targeted region while the circuit is engaged in processing related to desired behavior (here,&#xD;
      through the simultaneous use of cognitive behavioral therapy). The concurrent firing in the&#xD;
      emotional regulation circuit caused by TMS pulses and by the CBT will lead to neural&#xD;
      plasticity according to the Hebbian conception of fire together, wire together, while&#xD;
      repeated stimulation over the course of multiple TMS sessions will induce neuroplasticity to&#xD;
      accelerate and strengthen those changes, which are expected to be therapeutic. We thus intend&#xD;
      to test a novel integrative multimodal treatment for MDD consisting of a theory-based&#xD;
      protocol for individualized optimization of rTMS site of stimulation plus concurrent&#xD;
      behavioral interventions targeting the same dysfunctional neural circuitry. Our targeting&#xD;
      procedure is based on recent developments in the psychology and neurobiology of&#xD;
      self-regulation which offer a promising conceptual framework for identifying neural network&#xD;
      mechanisms of action in rTMS for depression, as well as for developing guidelines for&#xD;
      individualized rTMS treatment. As preliminary data, we report initial feasibility data from a&#xD;
      clinical paradigm in which five adults with major depressionreceived TMS to the left middle&#xD;
      frontal gyrus targeted on an individual basis using fMRI, while simultaneously receiving a&#xD;
      previously validated self-regulation-based psychotherapy. Here, we will test this&#xD;
      individualized method in a larger randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of 50 individuals between the 18 and 65 years of age, with&#xD;
      a diagnosis of treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single site study is a proof-of-concept clinical trial to test both functional states&#xD;
      associated with an antidepressant response to a six week course of C-PAS using concomitant&#xD;
      SST and 10 Hz rTMS neuronavigated to left DLPFC, as well as the feasibility and safety of&#xD;
      such a course for long-term improvement in depressive symptoms. The proposed study will be&#xD;
      conducted over 3 phases. Phase I will consist of screening, consent, and baseline measures.&#xD;
      Screening will occur under the ETPB screening protocol (01-M-0254). Phase II will consist of&#xD;
      a 6-week double-blind sham controlled trial of neuronavigated TMS cognitive therapy.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to two groups, receiving either Active or Sham&#xD;
      fMRI-guided-TMS, while involved in a cognitive therapy session. Subjects will participate in&#xD;
      30 daily sessions over 6 weeks, with MRI sessions both prior to and immediately after the&#xD;
      course of TMS. Additionally, MEG may optionally be performed at baseline, immediately after&#xD;
      the first TMS/SST session, and immediately after the entire course of TMS, and an optional&#xD;
      battery of TMS/EEG excitability and plasticity measures may be performed pre- and&#xD;
      post-TMS/SST course. In Phase III, the study team will provide standard of care for&#xD;
      depression for up to three months, and will prescribe a relapse prevention strategy, in&#xD;
      consultation with the referring physician, including TMS (which is consistent with standard&#xD;
      of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures are change in magnitude of BOLD signal recorded in pre- and post-TMS&#xD;
      course MRI sessions, in the DLPFC region targeted with TMS based on individual activations in&#xD;
      that region found at baseline using the priming task, and pre- and post-TMS course&#xD;
      connectivity changes between DLPFC (measured with DTI and resting state functional&#xD;
      connectivity), and other regions associated with the emotional regulation network,&#xD;
      specifically OFC, medial PFC, precuneus, and ACC. Pre and post TMS course change in&#xD;
      depression severity scores (HDRS, MADRS) will also be found, in order to look for&#xD;
      correlations with these MRI measures. Secondary outcome measures will be ratings from the&#xD;
      BSL, C-SSRS, CTQ, HAM-A, NIH-BFI, PANAS, RBANS, RRS, SHAPS, and TLEQ, as well as&#xD;
      electrophysiological changes using MEG and EEG measures.&#xD;
