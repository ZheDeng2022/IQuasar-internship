  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays a key part in emotional processing and&#xD;
      regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotions continually influence other cognitive functions such as attentional resources&#xD;
      .Emotions also influence a subject's automatic physiological responses .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an innovative neuro-modulation treatment,&#xD;
      often used in major depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various studies have shown that it is possible to modulate emotional processing in healthy&#xD;
      subjects, however the impact of this modulation on attentional resources and physiological&#xD;
      responses has not been studied. Also, the mechanisms of action of the tDCS on emotional&#xD;
      processing are still unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is necessary to explore the modulation of the DLPFC in healthy subjects in order to better&#xD;
      understand the network and mechanisms at stake in the processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, investigators plan to study the modulation of the DLPFC (left and right) by tDCS&#xD;
      (anode, cathode and placebo) on the processing of emotions and the impact on attentional&#xD;
      resources, and physiological responses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To study the modulation of the DLPFC (left and right) by tDCS (anode, cathode and placebo) on&#xD;
      the processing of emotions and the impact on attentional resources, and physiological&#xD;
      responses, subjects will undertake 3 tasks before and after a unique tDCS session of 30&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first task is a facial expression recognition task, the second measures the attentional&#xD;
      processing of emotional information (&quot;Free-viewing task&quot;) and the last task focuses on&#xD;
      working memory (digit sorting task).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each task has its cognitive variables but physiological responses will also be measured&#xD;
      during each task before and after the tDCS session (Eye movement, i.e. Pupil dilatation and&#xD;
      time spent on region of interest; heart rate, skin conductance and respiratory frequency).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 arms will take part in the study: Anode tDCS Cathode tDCS Placebo tDCS These 3 types of&#xD;
      tDCS stimulation will enable us to study the different modulations possible for the DLPFC and&#xD;
      the impact on all the variables previously mentioned.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from baseline on a facial expression recognition task at one day</time_frame>
    <description>A computerized facial expression recognition task was designed for the study. 240 pictures of emotional faces (8 identities, expressing anger, sadness, happiness, surprise, disgust, or fear, morphed with intensity of 20, 40, 50, 60 and 80%) are randomly displayed on a screen for 500ms. Subjects are asked to identify the emotion by answering on a keyboard.&#xD;
Rate of correct responses is the main outcome. During this task, eye movements are recorded by an eye-tracking device. Skin conductance, respiratory and heart rate frequency are also recorded.</description>

    <description>Computerized &quot;free viewing&quot; attentional task designed for the study. Pairs of emotional faces (neutral/sad ou neutral/happy) are randomly presented on a screen for 3500ms. Subjects are asked to freely explore the faces.&#xD;
During this task, eye movements are recorded by an eye-tracking device. Total time spent on Region of Interest (sad, happy or neutral face) is measured.&#xD;
Skin conductance, respiratory and heart rate frequency are also recorded.</description>

    <description>This working memory task is computerized and designed for this study. It is a digit sorting task in which 5 digits will appear on the screen. After that subjects will mentally have to put the digits in the right order. Subjects will then see a target digit and have to assess whether this target digit is the same as the middle digit in the series previously sorted.&#xD;
During this task, pupil dilatation is recorded by an eye-tracking device. Skin conductance, respiratory and heart rate frequency are also recorded.</description>
