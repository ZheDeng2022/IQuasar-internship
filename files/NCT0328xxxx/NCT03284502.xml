      This study evaluates the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of HM95573 In combination&#xD;
      with either cobimetinib or cetuximab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib, open-label, multicenter dose-escalation study designed to assess the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of oral dosing of HM95573 in combination with&#xD;
      either cobimetinib or cetuximab in patients with histologically/cytologically confirmed,&#xD;
      locally advanced, or metastatic solid tumors with RAS- or RAF-mutation for which standard&#xD;
      therapies either do not exist or have proven ineffective or intolerable. Treatment will&#xD;
      continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, any other discontinuation&#xD;
      criterion is met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two stages of this study: Stage 1 and 1b, standard 3+3 dose escalation, and Stage&#xD;
      2, an indication-specific dose expansion. Stage 1 is designed to establish the combination&#xD;
      MTD for cobimetinib and HM95573. Stage 1 consists of concurrent administration of cobimetinib&#xD;
      and HM95573. Stage 1b, is designed to select the combination dose of cetuximab and HM95573&#xD;
      for expansion stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 2 expansion cohort I and II, the RD of cobimetinib and HM95573 with different dosing&#xD;
      schedules or regimens might be investigated (which may be≤ MTDs established during dose&#xD;
      escalation) in indication-specific expansion cohorts. Stage 2 expansion cohort III will&#xD;
      further characterize the safety and tolerability of cetuximab in combination with HM95573.&#xD;
