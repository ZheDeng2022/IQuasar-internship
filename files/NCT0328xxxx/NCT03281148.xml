    <textblock>
      Patients with hopeless teeth in the esthetic area requiring immediate implant restoration&#xD;
      will be recruited to the study. Patients will be divided into two groups; a group will&#xD;
      receive immediate implants placed using CAD/CAM guides while the other group will receive&#xD;
      immediate implants placed by free hand technique. Accuracy of inserted implants will be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;

      Interventions The principal investigator (DA) will diagnose all patients and select them&#xD;
      according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator (DA) will prepare all patients. Patient preparation will take few&#xD;
      steps that are important for optimum planning of implant insertion and restoration. Actual&#xD;
      treatment steps will start after preparation is done including; surgical and prosthetic&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Case history&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Medical history:&#xD;
&#xD;
                The principal investigator (DA) will ask all patients about their present and&#xD;
                previous systemic condition and any history of hospitalization or surgeries.&#xD;
                Controlled diabetic patients will be asked to bring a recent blood glucose test.&#xD;
                This includes both fasting/post prandial &amp;glycosylated hemoglobin test (Hemoglobin&#xD;
                A1c) to evaluate their current status.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Dental history:&#xD;
&#xD;
                The principal investigator (DA) will ask all patients about past dental procedures&#xD;
                including implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
                b) Clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Visual examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
                The principal investigator (DA) will examine all patients extra orally to assess&#xD;
                the temporomandibular joints, temporalis, and masseter muscle to help in detection&#xD;
                of bruxism. Intraoral examination includes assessment of any pathological lesion&#xD;
                (cyst/tumor) that may interfere with the planned implant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Digital examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
                The principal investigator (DA) will examine the soft tissue surrounding hopeless&#xD;
                teeth digitally using index finger to confirm a firm mucosa free from any flabby&#xD;
                tissue, absence of severe undercuts and absence of abnormal ridge contour. The&#xD;
                principal investigator (DA) will examine the bone volume arbitrary using the two&#xD;
                index fingers to confirm an adequate bucco-lingual bone width. The principal&#xD;
                investigator (DA) will test tooth mobility of adjacent teeth using a periodontal&#xD;
                probe to ensure that the remaining adjacent teeth are not mobile.&#xD;
&#xD;
                c) Construction of scan appliance: The principal investigator (DA) will make&#xD;
                primary upper and lower impressions for the selected patients using irreversible&#xD;
                hydrocolloid impression material in stock trays of suitable sizes. The principal&#xD;
                investigator (DA) will pour impressions using Type IV extra hard dental stone . The&#xD;
                principal investigator (DA) will take a Face bow record and a diagnostic bite&#xD;
                record for each patient using Utility Wax . A semi-adjustable articulator will be&#xD;
                used for mounting.&#xD;
&#xD;
                A diagnostic mock up for broken/ badly decayed teeth will be formed for needed&#xD;
                patients. By pressing a clear thermoplastic sheet using a vacuum forming machine on&#xD;
                the study cast of the patient; a vacuum formed template will be constructed&#xD;
                containing radiopaque markers for easy superimposition later. The vacuum template&#xD;
                is now considered the scan appliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
                d) Patient Radiographic Imaging Every patient will be then sent for a CBCT scanning&#xD;
                for the upper and/or lower arch. The patient will be instructed to wear the scan&#xD;
                appliance during imaging. Midline will be adjusted using laser beam and a scout&#xD;
                will be taken to the patient. The patient will be asked to stay still till the&#xD;
                machine rotates around him/her. The cone beam computed tomography images will be&#xD;
                obtained in Digital Imaging &amp; Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format on a&#xD;
                compact disc.&#xD;
&#xD;
                e) Virtual planning and construction of surgical guide&#xD;
&#xD;
                a) Virtual Planning The CBCT image was used for the virtual surgical and prosthetic&#xD;
                planning of implant placement using Blusky® software. First, the remaining and&#xD;
                neighboring teeth will be segmented. This step helped in virtually inserting&#xD;
                implants in an acceptable position in relation to neighboring teeth with respect to&#xD;
                their crowns and roots. Virtual Setting will be done then virtual insertion of&#xD;
                implants with appropriate sizes will be done with respect to the future prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Cautious respect to anatomical landmarks in the area of interest will be considered&#xD;
                during planning. In the mandible; Mandibular canal will be simulated to be seen in&#xD;
                both 2D and 3D views. In the maxilla; maxillary sinus lining will be checked in all&#xD;
                views during implant positioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
                A Virtual guide will be designed from the CBCT of the patient to be seated on&#xD;
                neighboring teeth. The exported Standard Language transformation (STL) file of the&#xD;
                virtual guide will be sent to labs centers by e-mail for construction.&#xD;
&#xD;
                f) Surgical Procedures: The Principal investigator (DA) will extract the remaining&#xD;
                root or tooth in an atraumatic procedure procedure using lancet, periotome, minimal&#xD;
                force and rotational movement. After extraction the socket will be examined for&#xD;
                intact labial and palatal bone using depth probe. If all walls are intact the&#xD;
                socket would be eligible for immediate implant placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
                In the test group, the computer guided surgical guide will be used for implant&#xD;
                drilling and placement following the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
                While in the control group, after tooth or root extraction implants will be placed&#xD;
                free hand guided by the extraction sockets.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Then in implants with primary stability (Insertion torque&gt; 35 Ncm2), the final&#xD;
                abutment will be placed and any further adjustment would be done immediately in the&#xD;
                lab and re-positioned in place. The principal investigator (DA) will check the&#xD;
                vacuum stent is in its place again intraorally, then a chair side tooth colored&#xD;
                auto-polymerizing resin will be injected into the vacuum sheet corresponding to the&#xD;
                implant site to construct the temporary crown.&#xD;
&#xD;
                If any subject is to feel any movement in his/her temporary crown, an immediate&#xD;
                phone call is to be done to (DA) to examine the cause of mobility (whether it is&#xD;
                the crown only or the implant itself).&#xD;
&#xD;
                g) Postoperative Care: The principal investigator (DA) will manage postoperative&#xD;
                complications. The principal investigator (DA) will remove mobile temporary crowns&#xD;
                and recement them. While mobile implants will be considered as early stage failed&#xD;
                implants and it will be removed immediately. The patient will receive another&#xD;
                implant at the same site after a proper healing period of at least 3 months during&#xD;
                which he/she will be provided with a temporary removable partial denture for&#xD;
                aesthetics.&#xD;
