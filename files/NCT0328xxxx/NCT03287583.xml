  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disordered gambling, like substance misuse, has been associated with various medical problems&#xD;
      and adverse health outcomes. The Maryland Center of Excellence on Problem Gambling, along&#xD;
      with experts in the fields of disordered gambling and behavior change, will work with the&#xD;
      Maryland State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Behavioral Health Administration to&#xD;
      develop a problem gambling-specific Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment&#xD;
      (SBIRT) intervention targeting individuals receiving medical care in general primary care&#xD;
      clinics. The investigators will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of inserting the&#xD;
      problem gambling intervention in to preexisting substance use SBIRT services being provided&#xD;
      in clinics in the state. In addition, the investigators will establish a clinic prevalence&#xD;
      for gambling and finally, conduct a randomized trial using the problem gambling SBIRT&#xD;
      intervention to see if it is effective in helping patients reduce their problematic gambling&#xD;
      behaviors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has made health care&#xD;
      and health systems integration one of its main priorities to ensure that behavioral health is&#xD;
      consistently incorporated within the context of health care delivery systems. However, this&#xD;
      initiative has been focused on substance use disorders and mental health disorders that have&#xD;
      not included gambling disorder. Disordered gambling (DG) is highly associated with substance&#xD;
      use disorders, severe mental illness, depression, domestic violence and suicide. Disordered&#xD;
      gambling has also been linked with adverse health conditions and behaviors. Morasco et al.,&#xD;
      in their analysis of data from the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related&#xD;
      Conditions (NESARC), found that persons with DG were more likely to have a range of medical&#xD;
      problems including tachycardia, angina, cirrhosis or other liver disease. Even moderate&#xD;
      levels of gambling along with more severe levels of DG have been associated with adverse&#xD;
      health consequences and unhealthy life style factors. Morasco et al. report that at risk&#xD;
      gamblers (defined as gambling five or more times in the past 12 months) who they estimate&#xD;
      compose 25% of the population, were more likely to have experienced a severe injury in the&#xD;
      past year, receive emergency room treatment, have hypertension, be obese, have histories of&#xD;
      mood, anxiety, alcohol use and nicotine use disorders. In a more recent study, Black et al.&#xD;
      found individuals with DG were at higher risk for chronic medical conditions including&#xD;
      obesity, heartburn/stomach conditions, headaches, head injury with loss of consciousness,&#xD;
      sleep disorders, mood/emotional concerns, and anxiety, tension or stress. Individuals in the&#xD;
      DG group also were more likely to have poorer health habits. They were more likely to avoid&#xD;
      exercise, to drink alcohol while pregnant, smoke greater than or equal to a pack of&#xD;
      cigarettes per day to drink or more servings of caffeine a day and to watch or more hours of&#xD;
      television weekly. Subjects meeting DG criteria in this study were also less likely to have&#xD;
      regular dental check-ups and more likely to delay medical care for financial reasons.&#xD;
      Additionally the DG subjects were more likely to have at least one emergency room visit and&#xD;
      at least one hospitalization for mental health reasons in the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with gambling problems have been found to utilize medical and behavioral health&#xD;
      services at higher rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have also reported significant rates of gambling and problem gambling in primary care&#xD;
      settings. Pasternak and Fleming in a study of patients in primary care, that 80% had gambled&#xD;
      and 6.2% met criteria for problem gambling (score of 3 or more on South Oaks Gambling Screen,&#xD;
      SOGS). Additionally they report that gambling disorder was even more prevalent among&#xD;
      nonwhites and those from lower socioeconomic groups. In a study of individuals receiving free&#xD;
      or reduced-cost dental care, Morasco &amp; Petry found rates of problem gambling to be&#xD;
      significantly higher than the general population. In their sample, among those receiving&#xD;
      disability, 26% met criteria for disordered gambling and among those not receiving disability&#xD;
      14% met criteria based on SOGS scores. Other studies have found prevalence rates of gambling&#xD;
      problems of between 3 and 5% in primary care settings. However, these studies did not include&#xD;
      any frequency of gambling items nor an explanation of the range of behaviors meant by&#xD;
      &quot;gambling&quot; and have not included the less severe &quot;at risk&quot; gamblers. This study will also&#xD;
      address the need to improve the effectiveness of DG screening strategies in actual clinical&#xD;
      practice and to effectively identify not just those individuals who are exhibiting multiple&#xD;
      symptoms of gambling disorder but those fall into an &quot;at risk&quot; level of gambling that has&#xD;
      been associated with multiple poor health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prevalence study conducted in Maryland supports the likelihood of significant health issues&#xD;
      among those who are identified as at risk, problem or disordered gamblers. This study found&#xD;
      that 90% of adults in Maryland had gambled in their lifetimes. Over 21% had gambled at least&#xD;
      monthly in the past 12 months which would fit the definition of at risk gambling group that&#xD;
      compromised 25% of the subjects in the NESARC study who presented increased medical issues&#xD;
      and utilization. Those who had ever gambled as well the at risk and problem gambling groups&#xD;
      in the Maryland survey also reported higher levels of health risk behaviors (i.e. higher&#xD;
      alcohol intake, more frequent drug use, daily smoking) and reported poorer health status. The&#xD;
      rates of problem/pathological gambling for all adults was found to be 3.4% and at risk&#xD;
      gambling 9%. African Americans(17.3%) were found to have a significantly higher rate of at&#xD;
      risk as well as problem and disordered gambling compared to other ethic/racial groups (10.2%&#xD;
      white, 11.7% other ethnic/racial combined). The lowest socioeconomic group was also found to&#xD;
      have the highest rates of problem/pathological gambling (15%). Therefore, conducting gambling&#xD;
      specific screening and brief intervention in these high risk groups within Maryland is&#xD;
      strongly indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the research as sited above clearly indicates that individuals who are experiencing&#xD;
      gambling related harms in their lives are likely to experience higher rates of medical and&#xD;
      behavioral health problems and utilize health care services, they are not necessarily likely&#xD;
      to seek specific help for gambling problems. Strikingly, Kessler et al. reported that while&#xD;
      nearly half of their large national sample who met criteria for lifetime gambling disorder&#xD;
      received treatment for mental health or substance use disorders, none had received any&#xD;
      specific treatment for gambling problems. Indeed, it is estimated that only between 1 to 3%&#xD;
      of individuals nationwide who meet criteria for gambling disorder access gambling specific&#xD;
      treatment services.While this is in part due to internal factors in individuals with gambling&#xD;
      disorder such as desire to resolve problems on their own, shame, guilt and denial, there are&#xD;
      also provider/institutional factors that are significant. Primary among these is the absence&#xD;
      of screening for gambling problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an evidence based, public&#xD;
      health approach for delivery of early intervention services in medical and primary care&#xD;
      settings for individuals at risk for or experiencing substance use disorders. The most&#xD;
      extensive research evidence for the effectiveness of this approach has been with those&#xD;
      presenting indicators of alcohol abuse. Additionally Brief interventions (BI) have been found&#xD;
      to be effective for a range of non-alcohol substance abuse issues. While many studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that brief interventions with disordered gamblers are effective, these studies&#xD;
      have not focused on identifying or providing brief interventions in actual clinical or&#xD;
      primary care settings. Research has suggested that there are considerable clinician as well&#xD;
      as client factors that contribute to reluctance to address the topic of gambling practice. To&#xD;
      our knowledge no study has sought to obtain both client and clinician input into the content&#xD;
      and process feasibility of providing screening and intervention for risk for GD in real&#xD;
      clinical settings to address clinician and client concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both research and treatment provider surveys have demonstrated that only a very small&#xD;
      percentage of individuals who experience gambling related harms are likely to seek treatment.&#xD;
      Furthermore, there is evidence that at risk gamblers who may comprise 20-25% of the adult&#xD;
      population are likely to experience increase levels of health related problems and utilize&#xD;
      health care services at higher rates than non/low-risk gamblers. However, has been little to&#xD;
      no research on how to effectively screen for risk for gambling in health care settings.&#xD;
