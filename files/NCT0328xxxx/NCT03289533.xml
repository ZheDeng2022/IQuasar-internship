        <description>TTP as assessed by investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, was define as time (in months) from date of first dose of study drug to date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or data censoring date, whichever occurred first. PD was defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 20 percent (%) increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference smallest sum on study treatment (this included baseline sum if that was smallest on study treatment), with a minimum absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm), or appearance of &gt;=1 new lesions. TTP was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. TTP data was censored on the date the last adequate tumor assessment for participants without PD, for participants who start new anti-cancer treatment prior to PD, for participants who died without PD, or for participants with PD after &gt;=2 missing tumor assessments.</description>

TTP was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. TTP data was censored on the date the last adequate tumor assessment for participants without PD, for participants who start new anti-cancer treatment prior to PD, for participants who died without PD, or for participants with PD after &gt;=2 missing tumor assessments.</description>
