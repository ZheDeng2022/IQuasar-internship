  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug called Neratinib with and without Fulvestrant as&#xD;
      possible treatments for HER2-positive breast cancer .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neratinib and Fulvestrant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neratinib alone&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Neratinib as a treatment for&#xD;
      breast cancer. Fulvestrant has been FDA approved for treatment of metastatic hormone receptor&#xD;
      positive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to determine how well neratinib, by itself or together&#xD;
      with Fulvestrant, works in treating breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.&#xD;
      Neratinib is a recently discovered oral drug that may stop breast cancer cells from growing&#xD;
      abnormally by inhibiting (or blocking) members of a family of proteins that include Human&#xD;
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neratinib has been used in other research studies and information from those other research&#xD;
      studies suggests that neratinib may help to shrink or stabilize HER2-positive breast cancer&#xD;
      in this research study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed inoperable locally&#xD;
             advanced or metastatic ER+ breast cancer. To fulfill the requirement for ER+ disease,&#xD;
             a breast cancer must express, by immunohistochemistry (IHC), ER in ≥10% of cells, on&#xD;
             the most recent biopsy. If ER quantification is not available, a determination of ER+&#xD;
             by IHC will suffice. Central confirmation of ER status is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have documented HER2+ disease by overexpression and/or gene&#xD;
             amplification on the most recent biopsy, per current ASCO-CAP (American Society of&#xD;
             Clinical Oncology - College of American Pathologists) guidelines. Central confirmation&#xD;
             of HER2 status is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have received prior therapy with the following agents in any&#xD;
             combination, and in setting (i.e., neoadjuvant, adjuvant, metastatic, etc.). These&#xD;
             therapies do not need to be the most recent line of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Trastuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pertuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must agree to undergo a research biopsy of a reasonably accessible&#xD;
             metastatic lesion (chest wall, skin, subcutaneous tissue, lymph nodes, skin, breast,&#xD;
             bones, lung, and liver metastases). If a reasonably accessible metastatic lesion is&#xD;
             not available, the patient may go on study provided that archived tissue is available.&#xD;
             However, if a reasonably accessible site is available for biopsy, the patient must&#xD;
             agree to biopsy. Any patients not undergoing biopsy must be approved for study&#xD;
             enrollment by the Overall Principal Investigator at DFCI. Biopsies may be done with&#xD;
             local anesthesia or intravenous conscious sedation, according to institutional&#xD;
             guidelines. If a biopsy requires general anesthesia, then it is only allowed if&#xD;
             acquisition of tissue is clinically indicated, and excess tissue may be collected for&#xD;
             research purposes. Patients without sites available for biopsy must have available&#xD;
             tissue [archived formalin-fixed paraffin embedded blocks (FFPB), blocks from which&#xD;
             slides can be created, or fresh frozen tissue from original diagnosis or metastatic&#xD;
             setting] for correlative studies. Tissue needs to be located and available at the time&#xD;
             of registration See Section 9.3 for more details.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women ≥ 18 years of age. Men are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2 (see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥75,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin ≥8g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN); in case of&#xD;
                  known Gilbert's syndrome, &lt;2 x ULN is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤3X institutional ULN without liver metastases, or ≤5X&#xD;
                  institutional ULN with liver metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%, as determined by RVG (MUGA) or&#xD;
                  echocardiogram (ECHO) within 60 days prior to initiation of protocol therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may have received any number of prior therapies as long as they have&#xD;
             adequate performance status and meet all other eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (including premenopausal women and women less than 12&#xD;
             months after menopause) must have a negative β-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)&#xD;
             urine pregnancy test within 4 weeks of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of neratinib and fulvestrant on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
             For this reason and because SERD agents are known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential must agree to be abstinent, or to use a highly effective&#xD;
             double barrier method of contraception (e.g, a combination of male condom with an&#xD;
             intravaginal device such as the cervical cap, diaphragm, or vaginal sponge with&#xD;
             spermicide) or a non-hormonal method, while enrolled in the study, until at least 28&#xD;
             days after the last dose of neratinib or 1 year after the last dose of fulvestrant.&#xD;
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating&#xD;
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. If a woman is of&#xD;
             childbearing potential, she must agree to use adequate contraception prior to the&#xD;
             study, for the duration of study participation, and for one year after completion of&#xD;
             the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of&#xD;
             similar chemical or biologic composition to neratinib or fulvestrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have known hypersensitivity to any component of loperamide or&#xD;
             colestipol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received previous therapy with neratinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received anti-cancer therapy (including chemotherapy, biological&#xD;
             therapy, investigational agents, hormonal therapy, or other anti-cancer therapy) or&#xD;
             radiotherapy within ≤14 days prior to the planned initiation of investigational&#xD;
             products, or those who have not recovered to grade ≤1from adverse events due to their&#xD;
             most recent therapy (excepting alopecia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had any major surgery ≤28 days prior to the planned initiation&#xD;
             of study therapy, or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to&#xD;
             agents/surgery administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require&#xD;
             therapy to control symptoms. Participants with a history of treated central nervous&#xD;
             system (CNS) metastases are eligible. Treated brain metastases are defined as those&#xD;
             without ongoing requirement for corticosteroids, as ascertained by clinical&#xD;
             examination and/or brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging or CT scan) completed&#xD;
             during screening. Any corticosteroid use for brain metastases must have been&#xD;
             discontinued without the subsequent appearance of symptoms for ≥ 7 days prior to&#xD;
             registration. Treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy,&#xD;
             radiosurgery, surgery or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating&#xD;
             physician. Radiation therapy must be completed at least 14 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has active, uncontrolled cardiac disease, including cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
             congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional classification of ≥2),&#xD;
             unstable angina, myocardial infarction within 12 months of enrollment, or ventricular&#xD;
             arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a QTc interval &gt;470 ms or known history of QTc prolongation or Torsade&#xD;
             de Pointes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has an active infection or unexplained fever &gt;38.5°C (101.3°F).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has had another malignancy within the past 5 years with the exception of&#xD;
             a) adequately treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell skin cancer, or thyroid&#xD;
             cancer; b) carcinoma in situ of the breast, cervix or vulva; or c) cancer considered&#xD;
             cured by surgical resection or unlikely to impact survival during the duration of the&#xD;
             study, such as localized transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, or benign tumors&#xD;
             of the adrenal or pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has significant chronic gastrointestinal disorder with diarrhea as a major&#xD;
             symptom (e.g., Crohn's disease, malabsorption, or Grade ≥2 (NCI CTCAE v.4.0) diarrhea&#xD;
             of any etiology at screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has known active infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus.&#xD;
             Hepatitis B and C serology testing is not required, unless active infection is&#xD;
             suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is unable or unwilling to swallow tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has evidence of significant medical illness, abnormal laboratory finding,&#xD;
             or psychiatric illness/social situations that would, in the Investigator's judgment,&#xD;
             limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because fulvestrant is a SERD agent with&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with neratinib and/or fulvestrant, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with neratinib and/or fulvestrant.&#xD;
