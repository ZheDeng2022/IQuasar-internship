      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial of Group Care in the GHESKIO&#xD;
      Community Center versus Individual Care in the GHESKIO Adolescent Clinic for 160 HIV-infected&#xD;
      adolescent girls age 16-23 years in Haiti (80 adolescents per arm). Group Care includes&#xD;
      receiving integrated clinical and social support services in groups of 5-8 adolescents at a&#xD;
      monthly visit. The primary outcome is retention in HIV care at 12 months after randomization.&#xD;

      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial of Group Care in the GHESKIO&#xD;
      Community Center versus Individual Care in the GHESKIO Adolescent Clinic for 160 HIV-infected&#xD;
      adolescent girls age 16-23 years in Haiti (80 per arm). Adolescents randomized to Group Care&#xD;
      will receive HIV services including integrated clinical and social support care in groups of&#xD;
      5-10. Adolescents randomized to Individual Care will continue to receive individual care at&#xD;
      the GHESKIO Adolescent Clinic, which is the current standard of care (described below). If a&#xD;
      subject declines to participate in the study they will continue to receive standard HIV care.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to either Group Care or Individual Care in a 1:1 ratio using&#xD;
      a computer generated random assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual Care (standard of care): Adolescents randomized to Individual Care will receive&#xD;
      care in the GHESKIO Adolescent Clinic which cares for both males and females age 13-23 years.&#xD;
      The Adolescent Clinic waiting room has a television showing educational videos. After seeing&#xD;
      a triage peer counselor and having their vital signs taken, participants see a nurse&#xD;
      practitioner (NP) one-on-one in a private room for a 10-15 minute clinic visit. The NP may&#xD;
      also provide family support counseling including family visits per clinical judgment. Each NP&#xD;
      sees approximately 20 HIV-infected adolescents per day. The adolescent then returns to the&#xD;
      HIV positive peer counselor, who provides one-on-one counseling for 30 minutes on topics&#xD;
      chosen by the adolescent and the counselor. Each counselor sees ~10 adolescents per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group Care (intervention): Adolescent girls randomized to Group Care will join a group within&#xD;
      one week of study enrollment and receive care in the GHESKIO Community Center. The&#xD;
      investigators estimate that it will take 4-6 weeks to constitute a full group of 5-10. During&#xD;
      this enrollment phase, groups will meet weekly, adding new participants each week. The&#xD;
      participants will then meet monthly with an NP and a HIV positive peer counselor. Each&#xD;
      monthly group session will last ~2 hours. This is comparable to the time it takes for a&#xD;
      patient to pass through the Adolescent HIV Clinic. It will start with a 30 minute&#xD;
      unstructured discussion. This time is intentionally unstructured and responds to our previous&#xD;
      research finding that adolescents want to talk about topics of their choosing with their&#xD;
      peers. This will be followed by a 45 minute group counseling session following a structured&#xD;
      curriculum, addressing topics such as social isolation, stigma, family support, sexual risk&#xD;
      behavior, life goals, medication adherence, job skills, and transitions. This is followed by&#xD;
      a 30 minute social activity led by two rotating group leaders who are elected by their peers.&#xD;
      Social activities include crafts, playing cards, and charades. Participants will be seen one&#xD;
      by one by the NP for ~10-15 minutes in a screened in clinical area during the unstructured&#xD;
      discussion and the social activity. All HIV clinical services, including provision of ART&#xD;
      medications, CD4 T cell monitoring, screening for symptoms and OI, medication adherence&#xD;
      monitoring, family planning, and general primary care will be provided by the NP. Girls who&#xD;
      become eligible for ART will be provided with individual counseling and promptly initiated on&#xD;
      ART by the NP. The primary hypothesis is that Group Care will improve retention at 12 months&#xD;
      compared with standard Individual Care. The study has &gt; 90% power to detect a difference in&#xD;
      retention from 60% to 85%. Participants in both study arms will complete a questionnaire with&#xD;
      a research nurse at enrollment, 6, and 12 months collecting data on HIV knowledge,&#xD;
      HIV-related stigma, HIV disclosure, social and family support, depression and alcohol use,&#xD;
      problem solving skills, and food insecurity.&#xD;

    <description>Retention in care at 12 months will be measured. 12 month retention is defined as being alive at 12 months and having a care visit between 11 and 13 months after enrollment.</description>

    <measure>12 month viral suppression</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Viral suppression at 12 months will be measured. Suppressed viral load will be defined as a binary outcome based upon the WHO definition of viral suppression as a plasma HIV-1 RNA level &lt;1000 copies/Âµl.</description>
