  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to look at the effects, good or bad, of TetMYB Vaccine&#xD;
      in combination with BGB-A317 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid cancers (including&#xD;
      colorectal or adenoid cystic cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune system is the body's defence against cancer, bacteria and viruses. TetMYB Vaccine&#xD;
      is a vaccine that helps your immune system to recognise the cancer cells. BGB-A317 is an&#xD;
      antibody (a type of protein made in the body in response to a foreign substance) that helps&#xD;
      to stop or reverse the growth of tumour cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 32 participants may take part in this study, which is divided into 2 stages: dose&#xD;
      escalation (different doses will be tested in small groups of patients) and dose expansion&#xD;
      (one or more doses may be tested in a larger group of patients). Which stage you participate&#xD;
      in will depend on which is open at the time. Your study doctor will discuss this with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During dose escalation, study patients will receive increasing doses of the TetMYB Vaccine,&#xD;
      starting at a low dose. During dose expansion, study patients will receive the dose&#xD;
      determined as safe in dose escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose finding stage, the first patient of each dose level will receive 6 consecutive&#xD;
      weekly doses of intradermal TetMYB monotherapy for safety evaluation. If there are no&#xD;
      reported DLTs, the next 2 patients of the same dose level will also receive 6 consecutive&#xD;
      weekly intradermal doses of TetMYB, however with 3 weekly doses of BGB-A317 commencing with&#xD;
      the fourth TetMYB dose. The dosage of TetMYB are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose level 1: 100 ug in 100 uL of sterile dH2O containing 5% DMSO&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose level 2: 500 ug in 100 uL of sterile dH2O containing 5% DMSO&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose level 3: 1000 ug in 100 uL of sterile dH2O containing 5% DMSO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose expansion stage, the dosage will be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) identified&#xD;
      in the dose-finding stage and in combination with BGB-A317.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TetMYB Vaccine is being developed and manufactured by the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre&#xD;
      according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and in accordance with guidelines provided by&#xD;
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA and Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)&#xD;
      in Australia. TetMYB Vaccine is an experimental treatment and is currently not approved for&#xD;
      use in any country. This means that it is not an approved treatment for cancer in Australia.&#xD;
      This will be the first time that the TetMYB vaccine is given to humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BGB-A317 is being developed by BeiGene, a biopharmaceutical company. BGB-A317 is an&#xD;
      experimental treatment. This means that it is not an approved treatment for solid cancers in&#xD;
      Australia.&#xD;
