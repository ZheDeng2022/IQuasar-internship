    <textblock>
      This study examines a computer-based attention bias modification training as an augmentation&#xD;
      of individual cognitive behavioral therapy for pediatric anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive interviews to assess how they are doing in general, including&#xD;
      general mood, degree of nervousness, and behavior. Each participant and one of his or her&#xD;
      parents will be interviewed separately and together. Participants are asked to complete tasks&#xD;
      involving problem-solving, attention, and emotion that involve looking at pictures,&#xD;
      remembering things, testing reaction times, and making simple choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with anxiety will first meet with a psychologist for 12 weeks of individual&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy. In addition, participants will be randomly and blindly assigned&#xD;
      to receive either an active computer-based attention bias modification training task or an&#xD;
      inactive/placebo version of this task, administered as part of their therapy treatment. The&#xD;
      active training is thought to help anxiety whereas the inactive training is thought to have&#xD;
      no effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this part of the study is to understand the best way to help children and&#xD;
      adolescents who are having problems with anxiety. However, more research is needed to find&#xD;
      the best way to help such children and adolescents. During and after the treatment, each&#xD;
      participant will complete verbal and written symptom ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who have not improved by the end of the study will be offered other treatment for 1 to&#xD;
      3 months, and the clinicians will help with finding subsequent aftercare. Those who improve&#xD;
      with treatment will continue therapy at NIH until an outside physician is able to assume&#xD;
      responsibility for monitoring medication.&#xD;

      Objective: The goal of this protocol is to test the efficacy of a computer-based attention&#xD;
      bias modification training (comparing active vs. placebo) as an augmentation of individual&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy for youth with anxiety disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: A total of 120 children and adolescents (8-17 years old) will be recruited&#xD;
      to participate in this treatment trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Participants' psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses will be assessed by clinical&#xD;
      interview. Participants will engage in 12 weeks of individual cognitive behavioral therapy in&#xD;
      addition to being randomized to receive either an active or placebo version of a&#xD;
      computer-based attention bias modification training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures to be examined are change in scores on the&#xD;
      Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impression Scale across treatment.&#xD;
