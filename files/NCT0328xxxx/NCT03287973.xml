  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common form of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Weight&#xD;
      reduction has always been advocated in patients with OSA who are overweight and may lead to&#xD;
      improvement in the severity of OSA. Previous study reported a randomized controlled trial of&#xD;
      dietician-led lifestyle modification program (LMP) in 104 patients and found that LMP group&#xD;
      had significantly more weight loss and reduced OSA severity, and the response was sustained&#xD;
      after 8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is aimed to compare the effect of weight loss or CPAP alone on subclinical&#xD;
      inflammation, insulin resistance and blood pressure in patients with obesity and&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea, stratified according to the degree of&#xD;
      craniofacial restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study plans to recruit consecutive patients who have been referred to the Respiratory&#xD;
      Clinic at the Prince of Wales Hospital with clinical suspicion of sleep-disordered breathing&#xD;
      with specific study entry criteria including an age of 18 or more, body mass index (BMI) &gt;25&#xD;
      kg/m2, and moderate to severe OSA diagnosed by home sleep study. Patients having conditions&#xD;
      that will affect the serum level of hsCRP will be excluded.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common form of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). It causes&#xD;
      sleep fragmentation, disabling daytime sleepiness, impaired cognitive function, poor quality&#xD;
      of life and cardiovascular diseases. Weight reduction has always been advocated in patients&#xD;
      with OSA who are overweight and may lead to improvement in the severity of OSA. Previous&#xD;
      study reported a randomized controlled trial of dietician-led lifestyle modification program&#xD;
      (LMP) in 104 patients and found that LMP group had significantly more weight loss and reduced&#xD;
      OSA severity, and the response was sustained after 8 months. However, a wide variety of&#xD;
      response to the therapy was observed with 21.3% of patients with severe disease that&#xD;
      converted to mild to moderate and only 6.6% of those with severe disease who became mild in&#xD;
      severity. Apart from obesity, craniofacial factors are well recognized in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      OSA and are likely to play an important role in influencing the response to weight loss. For&#xD;
      the same degree of OSA severity, Caucasians were more overweight whereas Chinese exhibited&#xD;
      more craniofacial bony restriction. Recent studies showed that a smaller craniofacial&#xD;
      skeleton is associated with better response from weight loss program in terms of OSA&#xD;
      improvement. With vast majority of studies investigating the cardiometabolic changes after&#xD;
      CPAP or weight loss on patients with OSA, evaluation based on craniofacial restriction, the&#xD;
      key factor in the pathogenesis, is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to compare the effect of weight loss or CPAP alone on subclinical&#xD;
      inflammation, insulin resistance and blood pressure in patients with obesity and&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea, stratified according to the degree of&#xD;
      craniofacial restriction.&#xD;

      The study plans to recruit consecutive patients who have been referred to the Respiratory&#xD;
      Clinic at the Prince of Wales Hospital with clinical suspicion of sleep-disordered breathing&#xD;
      with specific study entry criteria including an age of 18 or more, body mass index (BMI) &gt;25&#xD;
      kg/m2, and moderate to severe OSA diagnosed by home sleep study. Patients having conditions&#xD;

    <description>Frontal and profile digital photographs of the head and neck are obtained with a standardized setup. A digital camera is mounted on a tripod at a distance of 160 cm from the subject alignment plane.&#xD;
Subjects are photographed standing upright while assuming the natural head position. Standardized methods are used to align subjects for the photographs. For the frontal photograph, the subject's facial landmark nasion is aligned along the subject alignment plane while ensuring both ears are seen equally from the front. For the profile photograph, the subject is instructed to turn 90 degrees to the left after the frontal photograph was taken.&#xD;
The subject's mid-sagittal plane is aligned to the subject alignment plane. Using image analysis software (Image J v1.36, NIH, Bethesda, MD), the photographs are examined for landmark digitization.</description>

    <description>All subjects will perform a three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) scans of the head/neck region to evaluate the size of the maxillomandibular volume (MMV) based on the mandibular cephalometric landmarks (left and right condylion, left and right gonion, and menton). All measurements will be made by a single assessor and the analysis will be performed blind to knowledge of AHI data.</description>
