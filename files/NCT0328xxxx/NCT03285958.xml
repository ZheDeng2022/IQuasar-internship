  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wearable, commercially-available physical activity monitors are being increasingly&#xD;
      incorporated into chronic pain self-management interventions as a tool to help patients set&#xD;
      goals and to tailor intervention content based on patient progress. Yet older adults from&#xD;
      resource-challenged communities may face significant barriers to using these monitors and&#xD;
      reporting activity data. Our pilot study will focus on wearable monitor use among older&#xD;
      adults in Detroit with chronic musculoskeletal pain, testing the feasibility and validity of&#xD;
      various technology-based strategies for reporting daily step count data. The study will also&#xD;
      assess whether six weeks of monitor use is associated with improvements in functioning,&#xD;
      relative to a control group.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29) Pain Interference 4-item subscale, where a higher score indicates more pain interference. Items ask how much pain in the last 7 days has interfered with daily activities such as household chores and social activities (1=not at all to 5=very much). Raw scores are converted to T-scores (normed such that a score of 50 is the population mean and 10 T-score points=1 standard deviation). The possible range is 42 to 76, with a higher score representing worse outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Physical Functioning 4-item subscale of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29 Adult Profile. Items ask how much difficulty participant has in doing daily activities such as household chores, using stairs, and walking 15 minutes (1=without any difficulty to 5=unable to do); raw total scale scores range from 4 (high functioning) to 20 (low functioning). When converted to T-scores (normed such that a score of 50 is the population mean and 10 T-score points=1 standard deviation), the possible range is 23 to 57, with a higher score representing worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities, a 4-item subscale from PROMIS-20 rating the amount of trouble (1=not at all to 5=very much) in participating in social roles such as family activities, leisure activities, and work. Raw total scale scores range from 4 (high functioning) to 20 (low functioning). When converted to T-scores (normed such that a score of 50 is the population mean and 10 T-score points=1 standard deviation), the possible range is 29 to 64, with a higher score representing worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Participants in the STEPS (Seniors Tracking Exercise for Pain Self-management) intervention will receive a commercially-available, wearable physical activity monitor. They will be asked to wear this monitor during waking hours for 6 weeks, reporting their daily step count every evening. The way in which participants report steps will change every 2 weeks. For the first 4 weeks of the study, participants will report via Interactive Voice Response (IVR) calls for 2 weeks and SMS text messages for 2 weeks. For the final two week period, research staff will help participants to set up the monitor to automatically send daily step counts to STEPS project staff. This can be done through a smartphone, tablet, or computer.</description>

        <title>Change in Pain Interference</title>
        <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29) Pain Interference 4-item subscale, where a higher score indicates more pain interference. Items ask how much pain in the last 7 days has interfered with daily activities such as household chores and social activities (1=not at all to 5=very much). Raw scores are converted to T-scores (normed such that a score of 50 is the population mean and 10 T-score points=1 standard deviation). The possible range is 42 to 76, with a higher score representing worse outcome.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, eight weeks</time_frame>
        <population>This is from the analytic sample that had both baseline and follow-up data on this measure. Change score is the follow-up minus baseline score, such that a greater, negative change value is a better outcome.</population>

STEPS Intervention: Participants in the STEPS (Seniors Tracking Exercise for Pain Self-management) intervention will receive a commercially-available, wearable physical activity monitor. They will be asked to wear this monitor during waking hours for 6 weeks, reporting their daily step count every evening. The way in which participants report steps will change every 2 weeks. For the first 4 weeks of the study, participants will report via Interactive Voice Response (IVR) calls for 2 weeks and SMS text messages for 2 weeks. For the final two week period, research staff will help participants to set up the monitor to automatically send daily step counts to STEPS project staff. This can be done through a smartphone, tablet, or computer.</description>

        <description>The Physical Functioning 4-item subscale of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29 Adult Profile. Items ask how much difficulty participant has in doing daily activities such as household chores, using stairs, and walking 15 minutes (1=without any difficulty to 5=unable to do); raw total scale scores range from 4 (high functioning) to 20 (low functioning). When converted to T-scores (normed such that a score of 50 is the population mean and 10 T-score points=1 standard deviation), the possible range is 23 to 57, with a higher score representing worse outcome.</description>

        <population>Participants who had data on both baseline and follow-up measure. Change score is the follow-up minus baseline score, such that a greater, negative change value is a better outcome.</population>

STEPS Intervention: Participants in the STEPS (Seniors Tracking Exercise for Pain Self-management) intervention will receive a commercially-available, wearable physical activity monitor. They will be asked to wear this monitor during waking hours for 6 weeks, reporting their daily step count every evening. The way in which participants report steps will change every 2 weeks. For the first 4 weeks of the study, participants will report via Interactive Voice Response (IVR) calls for 2 weeks and SMS text messages for 2 weeks. For the final two week period, research staff will help participants to set up the monitor to automatically send daily step counts to STEPS project staff. This can be done through a smartphone, tablet, or computer.</description>
