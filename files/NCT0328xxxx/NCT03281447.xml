  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In western countries, the number of cancer survivors increases, and current cancer care seems&#xD;
      insufficient with both patients' experiences of lack of help in transitions and up to 60 % of&#xD;
      the patients having psychological problems after treatment. Further, Denmark shall have new&#xD;
      hospitals, where researchers and healthcare professionals are expected to merge tasks and&#xD;
      reach a higher patient experienced quality of care, without additional costs, so a better way&#xD;
      to provide cancer care, which benefits the patients and supports the ideas within the new&#xD;
      hospitals in Denmark, is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized controlled trial, the organizational structure of the healthcare system is&#xD;
      challenged and the impact of a coherent nurse navigation practice compared to the currently&#xD;
      existing department-specific care coordination is tested. The primary data are changes in&#xD;
      patients' self-reported cancer-related self-efficacy from inclusion till one week after&#xD;
      receipt of the information that they have reached the end of treatment, or in case of&#xD;
      prolonged treatment, till not later than one year after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients can participate if they are 18 years of age or older, speak and understand Danish,&#xD;
      and have a proven lesion suspected of cancer in the colon or rectum after colonoscopy or&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy at the Danish endoscopy centers at Odense University Hospital (the cities:&#xD;
      Nyborg, Svendborg and Odense) or at Slagelse Hospital. Furthermore, participants must not be&#xD;
      mentally retarded, they must not suffer from a constant life-threatening disease, and they&#xD;
      must not suffer from, or be in the diagnostic phase of, dementia or severe psychiatric&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are allocated to support from nurse navigation or to current care coordination,&#xD;
      and fill in four questionnaires during their cancer trajectory: 1) At inclusion, 2) Three&#xD;
      days before treatment start, 3) One week after receipt of information about treatment end or&#xD;
      not later than one year after inclusion, and 4) Six weeks after measure point 3. Data is&#xD;
      analyzed using suitable statistical models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With positive results, participants in nurse navigation are better helped during their cancer&#xD;
      trajectory and have a better psychological start on the rest of their lives after cancer&#xD;
      treatment. Focus will be on colon and rectum cancer care, but the results will be&#xD;
      transferable to similar settings. Furthermore, positive results will support changes in the&#xD;
      onset of rehabilitation initiatives.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurse navigation, as a specific, defined concept of coherent help through cancer&#xD;
      trajectories, will prove superior to current care coordination with regard to patients'&#xD;
      self-evaluated self-efficacy for cancer from inclusion to one week after receipt of&#xD;
      information about treatment end or not later than one year after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation The randomization will be stratified by age and gender. The rational is that age&#xD;
      and gender is differently associated with benefit by a given care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Participants fill in questionnaires at four measurements, and supplements to&#xD;
      sociodemographic information as well as information for an economic evaluation is collected&#xD;
      from provider side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires for participants are available in paper and electronically, and&#xD;
      participants are allowed to discuss the individual questions with a person whom they trust&#xD;
      before filling in their answers. If a participant is blind or dyslexic and has no one to help&#xD;
      them fill in the questionnaires, a trained study nurse will read out loud the questions and&#xD;
      fill in the participant's answers, and eventually in this process, listen to the&#xD;
      participant's pros and cons, acknowledge that they are heard, ask for an answer and read out&#xD;
      loud the question again. All data are stored in Research Electronic Data Capture (RedCap).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding The trial is not blinded but all participants are told, there is no favorite group.&#xD;
      The statistician is blinded to randomization group and this blinding will be unveiled after&#xD;
      the data is analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Data are analyzed following the modified intention-to-treat principle, which is&#xD;
      carried out by a senior statistician in close collaboration with the research group. Usual&#xD;
      descriptive statistics will be used to summarize baseline and subject characteristics. The&#xD;
      analyses of the primary endpoint, i.e. change in self-evaluated self-efficacy for cancer from&#xD;
      inclusion (measurement 1) to end of treatment (measurement 3), and the secondary outcomes are&#xD;
      done using analysis of covariance of the measure at measurement 3 with randomization group as&#xD;
      a factor and measure at measurement 1 as covariate. In secondary analyses for all endpoints&#xD;
      (measurement 1-4), the change over time will be investigated by mixed effects repeated&#xD;
      measures analysis with randomization group as factor and random effects for subjects. These&#xD;
      analyses are repeated within the subgroup of all cancer patients and the subgroup of cancer&#xD;
      patients treated with curative aim. In the subgroup analyses, the influence of relevant&#xD;
      subject-level confounders such as age, disease-stage, treatment, etc. will be explored, and&#xD;
      appropriate adjustment will be performed. An economic evaluation will be performed for each&#xD;
      randomized group and compared.&#xD;
