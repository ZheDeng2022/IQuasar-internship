      This study has 2 parts: a Dose Escalation Part and a Dose Expansion Part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the Dose Escalation Part of this clinical research study is to find the highest&#xD;
      tolerable dose of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab and the standard of care&#xD;
      (lenalidomide and dexamethasone) that can be given to patients with multiple myeloma (MM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the Dose Expansion Part of this clinical research study is to continue to study&#xD;
      the safety of the highest tolerable dose found in Phase 1 of the study.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be&#xD;
      assigned to a study group based on when participant joins this study. Up to 2 groups of up to&#xD;
      6 participants each will be enrolled in the Dose Escalation Part of the study, and up to 24&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled in the Dose Expansion Part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is enrolled in the Dose Escalation Part, the dose of nivolumab participant&#xD;
      receives will depend on when participant joins this study. The first group of participants&#xD;
      will receive the lowest dose level of nivolumab. A second group will then receive a higher&#xD;
      dose of nivolumab than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is enrolled in the Dose Expansion Part, participant will receive nivolumab at&#xD;
      the highest dose that was tolerated in the Dose Escalation Part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose levels of ipilimumab, dexamethasone, and&#xD;
      lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 4 study cycles will be 21 days long, and all remaining cycles will be 28 days long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-4, participant will receive nivolumab by vein over 60 minutes. Thirty&#xD;
      (30) minutes after participant receives nivolumab, participant will receive ipilimumab by&#xD;
      vein over 90 minutes. On Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 5 and beyond, participant will receive&#xD;
      nivolumab by vein over 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will take tablets of lenalidomide on Days 1-14 of Cycles 1-4 and on Days 1-21 of&#xD;
      Cycles 5 and beyond. Participant will take tablets of dexamethasone on Days 1, 8, and 15 of&#xD;
      Cycles 1-4, and on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycles 5 and beyond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 1- 4 (+/- 7 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, biomarker testing, and to&#xD;
           check the status of the disease. If participant can become pregnant, this routine&#xD;
           testing will also include a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected over 24 hours for routine tests and to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Cycle 3 only, participant will have 2 bone marrow biopsies/aspirations to check&#xD;
           the status of the disease and for biomarker testing, including genetic biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Cycle 3 only, urine will be collected for biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Cycle 4, participant will have an ECHO and pulmonary function test to check the&#xD;
      status of participant's lungs and heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 5 and beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check&#xD;
           the status of the disease. If participant can become pregnant, this routine testing will&#xD;
           also include a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected over 24 hours for routine tests and to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants will have a stem cell transplant after Cycle 4. If participant does&#xD;
           not have a stem cell transplant, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for tests of&#xD;
           the immune system every cycle. If participant does have a stem cell transplant, this&#xD;
           will only be done every 3 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participant does not have a stem cell transplant, on Day 1 of Cycles 5 and every 3&#xD;
           cycles after that, urine will be collected for biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 15 of Cycles 5 and beyond, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at any point participant does have a stem cell transplant, participant will have 2 bone&#xD;
      marrow biopsies or aspirations to check the status of the disease and for biomarker testing&#xD;
      after the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When participant stops taking the study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests, to check&#xD;
           the status of the disease, and to learn how the study drugs work in participant's body.&#xD;
           If participant can become pregnant, part of this blood will be used for a pregnancy&#xD;
           test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have 2 bone marrow biopsies/aspirations to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease and for biomarker testing, including genetic biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at any point the disease gets worse:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check&#xD;
           the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected over 24 hours for routine tests and to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a bone marrow biopsy or aspiration to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease and for biomarker testing, including genetic biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for genetic testing to learn if there is a&#xD;
           relationship between participant's genes and the disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant may have the following tests. The schedule for&#xD;
      these tests will depend on what participant's doctor thinks is in participant's best&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests and to check&#xD;
           the status of the disease. If participant can become pregnant, this routine testing will&#xD;
           also include a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected over 24 hours for routine tests and to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;

             childbearing potential (i.e. who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as&#xD;
             azoospermic men do not require contraception)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients must be newly diagnosed and must not have received prior treatment directed&#xD;
             to multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have known central nervous system involvement with multiple myeloma will&#xD;
             be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they&#xD;
             often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of&#xD;
             neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with a known history of allergic reactions attributed to any compounds of&#xD;
             similar chemical or biologic composition to be used on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection requiring intravenous antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements, in the opinion of the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnant or lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with known active hepatitis A, B, and/or C infection are excluded. This is&#xD;
             due to the difficulty that would be faced in assessing the attribution of any events&#xD;
             of hepatic toxicity while on therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Ongoing graft-versus-host (GVHD) due to prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
             transplantation. Patients with prior history of acute GVHD or extensive chronic GVHD&#xD;
             requiring a minimum of 6 months or longer treatment since allogeneic hematopoietic&#xD;
             stem cell transplantation are also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients should be excluded if they have an active, known or suspected autoimmune&#xD;
             disease. Subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes&#xD;
             mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone&#xD;
             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to&#xD;
             recur in the absence of an external trigger.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with&#xD;
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or&#xD;
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents&#xD;
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Additionally, patients will&#xD;
             be excluded if they have required therapy for control of GVHD within 4 weeks of study&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients should be excluded if they have had prior systemic treatment with an&#xD;
             anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug&#xD;
             specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients should be excluded if they have known history of testing positive for human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).&#xD;
