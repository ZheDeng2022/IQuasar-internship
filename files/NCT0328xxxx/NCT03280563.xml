  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of several&#xD;
      immunotherapy-based combination treatments in participants with inoperable locally advanced&#xD;
      or metastatic HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who have progressed during or&#xD;
      following treatment with a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor in the first- or&#xD;
      second-line setting, such as palbociclib, ribociclib, or abemaciclib. The study will be&#xD;
      performed in two stages. During Stage 1, participants will be randomized to fulvestrant&#xD;
      (control) or an atezolizumab-containing doublet or triplet combination. Those who experience&#xD;
      disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, or unacceptable toxicity may be eligible to&#xD;
      receive a new triplet combination treatment in Stage 2 until loss of clinical benefit or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. New treatment arms may be added and/or existing treatment arms may be&#xD;
      closed during the course of the study on the basis of ongoing clinical efficacy and safety as&#xD;
      well as the current treatments available.&#xD;
