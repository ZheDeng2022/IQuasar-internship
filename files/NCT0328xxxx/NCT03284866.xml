  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine therapy&#xD;
      works in reducing high-grade cervical lesions in patients with human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
      (HIV) and HPV. Vaccines made from HPV peptides or antigens may help the body build an&#xD;
      effective immune response to kill the HPV virus and prevent cervical lesions from developing&#xD;
      or coming back after being removed.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At screening, potential participants will be tested for cervical human papillomavirus (HPV)&#xD;
      infection (GeneXpert hrHPV assay and HPV DNA PCR) and undergo cervical colposcopy to confirm&#xD;
      the absence of cervical cancer. If eligible, the participant will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either the 9-valent HPV vaccine or saline placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return 4 and 26 weeks later for the second dose of vaccine or placebo. At&#xD;
      week 4, participants will have cervical colposcopy and undergo cryotherapy or loop&#xD;
      electrosurgical excisional procedure (LEEP) as appropriate. Participants undergoing cervical&#xD;
      cryotherapy will have cervical biopsies before the treatment. Participants will be followed&#xD;
      with HPV testing (Gene Xpert and HPV DNA PCR) at weeks 26, 52, 78, and 104, and will have&#xD;
      cervical cytology and colposcopy with biopsies at weeks 26, 52, and 104.&#xD;
