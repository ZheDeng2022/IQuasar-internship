  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the clinical non-inferiority of 1 month (short-term) vs 6 months&#xD;
      (long-term) of dual anti-platelet therapy in patients undergoing percutaneous intervention&#xD;
      implanted sirolimus -eluting stent with abluminal grooves containing a biodegradable polymer&#xD;
      in High Bleeding Risk patients with coronary artery disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double -blind,multi-center,randomized controlled trial. Approximately&#xD;
      1,720 subjects in high bleeding risk with coronary artery disease will be enrolled in no more&#xD;
      than 40 research centers in China. All participants met the inclusion criteria will be 1:1&#xD;
      randomized to 1 month or 6months of DAPT after implanting Firehawk™ coronary stent. Clinical&#xD;
      follow-up will be carried out at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months, 2 years after index&#xD;
      procedure.The primary study endpoint is Net Adverse Clinical and Cerebral Events (NACCE), a&#xD;
      composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), cerebral vascular accident (CVA)&#xD;
      and major bleeding ([BARC] definition) at 12 months. Subjects that complete of 12 months&#xD;
      follow-up will be regarded as having completed the primary endpoint. The secondary study&#xD;
      endpoints contain cost-effectiveness at 12 months, ARC defined stent thrombosis (ST) ; NACCE&#xD;
      ;major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE),major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events&#xD;
      (MACCE),target lesion revascularization (TLR),target vessel failure(TVF) , major bleeding at&#xD;
      30 days,6,12 and 24 months of follow-up.&#xD;
