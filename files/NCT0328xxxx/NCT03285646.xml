  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of fasinumab in relieving&#xD;
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) as compared to placebo in participants with a clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      of moderate-to-severe non-radicular CLBP and Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee or hip when&#xD;
      treated for up to 16 weeks. The secondary objectives of the study are: To evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of fasinumab compared to placebo when participants with a clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      of moderate-to-severe non-radicular CLBP and OA of the knee or hip are treated for up to 16&#xD;
      weeks; To characterize the concentrations of fasinumab in serum over time when participants&#xD;
      with a clinical diagnosis of moderate-to-severe non-radicular CLBP and OA of the knee or hip&#xD;
      are treated for up to 16 weeks; To evaluate the immunogenicity of fasinumab when treated for&#xD;
      up to 16 weeks in participants with a clinical diagnosis of moderate-to-severe non-radicular&#xD;
      CLBP and OA of the knee or hip.&#xD;

    <description>Average daily low back pain (LBP) was assessed on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) and was defined as the average of the non-missing daily LBPI NRS scores for the 7 days before and including nominal visit. Participants described their average low back pain during the past 24 hours on a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), where higher scores indicate higher pain.</description>

    <description>The RMDQ is a self-administered, health status measure for lower back pain (LBP). It measures pain and function using 24 items describing limitations to everyday life that can be caused by LBP. The score of the RMDQ is the total number of items checked from a minimum of 0 (no disability) to a maximum of 24 (maximum disability), where lower scores are indicative of better function.</description>

    <description>Average daily low back pain (LBP) was assessed on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) and was defined as the average of the non-missing daily LBPI NRS scores for the 7 days before and including nominal visit.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 16 in the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-sf) Pain Interference Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire for participants to rate the severity of their pain and the degree to which their pain interferes with common dimensions of feeling and function. With a recall period of 24 hours, the questionnaire contains the front and back body diagrams, the 4 pain severity items and 7 pain interference items rated on 0-10 scale; total interference score ranges from 0-10 (0, does not interfere; 10 completely interferes), and the question about percentage of pain relief by analgesics. The BPI pain interference is typically scored as the mean of the 7 interference items.</description>

Treatment emergent - post-dose positive result when baseline results were negative. Persistent - A positive result detected in at least 2 consecutive post baseline samples separated by at least a 16-week post baseline period, with no negative results in-between.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were screened for study eligibility across the US. Of the 377 participants screened, 63 met eligibility criteria. The most frequently reported reason for non-randomization was inclusion criteria not met and/or exclusion criteria met (224 participants):139 did not meet inclusion criteria, 86 participants met exclusion criteria.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study consisted of a screening period of up to 30 days and a 7 (+3 day) day pre-randomization period during which all pain medication except study-provided rescue medication was discontinued.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 16 in the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) Total Score</title>
        <description>The RMDQ is a self-administered, health status measure for lower back pain (LBP). It measures pain and function using 24 items describing limitations to everyday life that can be caused by LBP. The score of the RMDQ is the total number of items checked from a minimum of 0 (no disability) to a maximum of 24 (maximum disability), where lower scores are indicative of better function.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 16 in the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) Total Score</title>
          <description>The RMDQ is a self-administered, health status measure for lower back pain (LBP). It measures pain and function using 24 items describing limitations to everyday life that can be caused by LBP. The score of the RMDQ is the total number of items checked from a minimum of 0 (no disability) to a maximum of 24 (maximum disability), where lower scores are indicative of better function.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 16 in the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-sf) Pain Interference Score</title>
        <description>The BPI-sf is a self-administered questionnaire for participants to rate the severity of their pain and the degree to which their pain interferes with common dimensions of feeling and function. With a recall period of 24 hours, the questionnaire contains the front and back body diagrams, the 4 pain severity items and 7 pain interference items rated on 0-10 scale; total interference score ranges from 0-10 (0, does not interfere; 10 completely interferes), and the question about percentage of pain relief by analgesics. The BPI pain interference is typically scored as the mean of the 7 interference items.</description>
