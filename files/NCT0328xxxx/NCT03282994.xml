      Prospective, non-randomized, open-label study to evaluate the dermal cooling system for&#xD;
      cryotherapy of common skin conditions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish that controlled localized cooling with the Dermal&#xD;
      Cooling System will elicit an improvement in the cosmetic appearance of benign superficial&#xD;
      lesions associated with common skin conditions that are currently being treated with&#xD;
      cryosurgical methods.&#xD;

             amenable to cryosurgical treatment including, for example, psoriasis, acne, rosacea,&#xD;
             and sebaceous hyperplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is willing to have up to 40 test sites treated.&#xD;

             months (e.g., photodynamic therapy, intense pulsed light therapy, laser surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Dermatological conditions (e.g. vitiligo, open wounds, infection, pre-cancerous or&#xD;
             malignant lesions) in the location of the treatment sites that would, in the&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. History of melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known history of illness or adverse reaction to cold insult (e.g., cryoglobulinemia,&#xD;

          8. Subject is lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Current enrollment in a clinical study of any other unapproved investigational drug or&#xD;
             device.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any other condition or laboratory value that would, in the professional opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, potentially affect response or participation in this clinical study, or&#xD;
             would pose an increased or unacceptable risk to the subject.&#xD;
