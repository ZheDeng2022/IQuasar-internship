    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ATA188 as a&#xD;
      monotherapy in Parts 1 and 2, to determine the recommended Part 2 dose (RP2D) of ATA188 as&#xD;
      monotherapy in Part 1, and to evaluate the effect of ATA188 treatment on clinical disability,&#xD;
      as assessed by sustained Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) improvement at 12 months in&#xD;
      Part 2 in participants with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) (primary progressive&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis [PPMS] and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis [SPMS]).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, 2 part study in adult participants with progressive forms of MS&#xD;
      (PPMS/SPMS) with an open-label, single-arm, sequential dose-escalation period (Part 1) and a&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled dose-expansion period (Part 2) and open-label&#xD;
      extension (OLE) period. Part 2 and the OLE have been initiated by the sponsor's discretion&#xD;
      based on a review of data from the dose-escalation cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of ATA188 administered by intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      infusion. ATA188 will be selected for each participant based on matching at least 2 human&#xD;
      leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles shared between ATA188 and the participant including at least&#xD;
      1 HLA-restricting allele.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, participants received 2 cycles of ATA188 and entered 12 months follow-up period&#xD;
      after the last dose of ATA188. Participants who completed at least the first year of the&#xD;
      dose-escalation period and were active in the study have entered in OLE period. In OLE&#xD;
      period, participants will receive the same RP2D assigned to Part 2 participants at the time&#xD;
      of the Part 1 participant's first dose in each year of the OLE. In OLE period, participants&#xD;
      will receive 1 cycle of ATA188 treatment every 12 months (Q12M) for up to 4 years (ie, Years&#xD;
      2 to 5). Otherwise, end of study (EOS) visit will be conducted at 24 months after Cycle 1 Day&#xD;
      1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, participants will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive ATA188 at the RP2D or&#xD;
      matching placebo, stratified by progressive MS diagnosis (PPMS vs SPMS) and any prior&#xD;
      exposure to anti-CD20 therapy (yes vs no). Initially 80 participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      ATA188 or placebo. Randomization of additional participants into the study will be based on&#xD;
      the results of the interim analysis. Participants will receive 2 cycles of ATA188 at the RP2D&#xD;
      or matching placebo and will be followed for at least 12 months after the first dose of study&#xD;
      drug (ie, Year 1). In second year (Year 2), participants who received placebo in Year 1 will&#xD;
      receive 2 cycles of ATA188 at the RP2D assigned at randomization and participants who&#xD;
      received ATA188 at the RP2D in Year 1 will receive 1 cycle of ATA188 (at the RP2D assigned at&#xD;
      randomization) and 1 cycle of placebo to maintain the blind. Participants who complete Year 2&#xD;
      will enter in OLE period to receive ATA188 Q12M for up to 3 years (ie, Years 3 to 5) at the&#xD;
      RP2D that was last selected by the sponsor for Part 2. The end of study visit will be&#xD;
      scheduled at 5 years (60 months) after the first dose of study drug (ie, Cycle 1 Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of the study recruitment has completed, Part 2 continues to recruit participants.&#xD;
