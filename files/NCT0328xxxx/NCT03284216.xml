  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether exposure to short-term high blood glucose levels impairs&#xD;
      exercise-induced adaptations in glucose tolerance, and whether the pattern of high blood&#xD;
      glucose levels plays a role.&#xD;

      Healthy male volunteers will undergo a screening visit and four experimental trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit: Having read the participant info sheet, a study investigator will discuss&#xD;
      the project with the potential participant who will have the chance to ask any questions.&#xD;
      Informed consent will be sought and a General Health Questionnaire will be completed. Body&#xD;
      weight, height, and skinfold measurements will be taken. Participants will also complete an&#xD;
      exercise test to measure VÌ‡O2max test along with heart rate and blood pressure measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals eligible for inclusion in the study will then return to the lab for four&#xD;
      experimental trials, each separated by ~1 week. Trials will be completed using a randomised,&#xD;
      counter-balanced, cross-over design. Between experimental trials, participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to maintain their normal diet and activity habits. During the 48 hours prior to&#xD;
      each experimental trial participants will be instructed to refrain from vigorous exercise and&#xD;
      alcohol. For 3 days prior to each experimental trial, participants will record their dietary&#xD;
      intake, and wear an accelerometer and a continuous glucose monitor to measure physical&#xD;
      activity levels and glucose control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Trials: Participants will arrive at the laboratory in the morning (~8 am)&#xD;
      following an overnight (~10 hour) fast from food and drink (except water) since 10pm the&#xD;
      previous evening. Upon entering the laboratory, body composition (height, weight, waist&#xD;
      circumference) will be assessed and a cannula will be placed into a vein in each arm (one for&#xD;
      infusion of glucose, one for blood sampling). Resting cardiovascular measures (heart rate,&#xD;
      blood pressure, oxygen saturation) will be collected followed by an assessment of cognitive&#xD;
      function followed immediately by one of the four 3.5 hour interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trial A (normoglycaemia prior to exercise): This will involve no glycaemic intervention&#xD;
           and the participant will remain in a rested, normoglycaemic state throughout all&#xD;
           subsequent procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trial B (steady hyperglycaemia prior to exercise): This will involve a continuous&#xD;
           constant-rate glucose infusion to establish a steady hyperglycaemic profile.&#xD;
           Specifically, 1.2g/kg glucose will be infused at a constant infusion rate across 3.5 hrs&#xD;
           (equivalent to 5.71 mg/kg/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trial C (fluctuating hyperglycaemia prior to exercise): This will involve repeated&#xD;
           glucose injections so as to cause multiple fluctuations in glycaemia. Specifically, 1.2&#xD;
           g/kg glucose will be infused via 8 equal boluses every 30 minutes across 3.5 hrs (the&#xD;
           equivalent of 0.15 g/kg per bolus infused over 3.5 minutes at a rate of 42.86 mg/kg/min)&#xD;
           interspersed with periods of no infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trial D (normoglycaemia, no exercise): This will be identical to trial A, except there&#xD;
           will be no exercise bout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3.5 hours, the above-described glycaemic intervention will stop, and be followed&#xD;
      immediately by the collection of post-intervention blood samples, assessment of&#xD;
      cardiovascular response and assessment of cognitive function. Participants will then complete&#xD;
      an exercise bout consisting of 45 minutes of moderate intensity (70% HRmax) continuous&#xD;
      cycling, during which energy expenditure will be measured by indirect calorimetry.&#xD;
      Post-exercise blood samples will be collected, and catheters will be removed. Participants&#xD;
      will be fed a meal. Before leaving the lab, they will also be provided with an evening meal&#xD;
      to be consumed at home at 7 pm, and a breakfast and lunch meal for the following day (to be&#xD;
      consumed at 7 am and 12 pm, respectively). Participants will then return to the laboratory&#xD;
      for 5 minutes the afternoon after the trial day (~3 pm) to remove the accelerometer and&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitor, marking the end of the trial.&#xD;
