      Sarcopenia, the loss in muscle mass with age, is associated with several negative health&#xD;
      outcomes including cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This loss of muscle&#xD;
      mass remains relatively steady following 50 years of age however it can be accelerated with&#xD;
      periods of disuse associated with hospitalization, fracture or surgery of the hip or simply&#xD;
      influenza. Also associated with periods of disuse, is a lack of energy intake as&#xD;
      hospitalizations often result in undernourishment. The consumption of protein has been shown&#xD;
      to stimulate muscle growth and therefore the investigators are wondering whether it is able&#xD;
      to offset the loss of muscle mass associated with disuse. Therefore, the purpose of the study&#xD;
      is to examine the effects of protein consumption combined with mild caloric restriction on&#xD;
      changes in muscle mass and function during a period of disuse as well as during a period of&#xD;
      recovery .&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass, termed sarcopenia, is associated with a host&#xD;
      of metabolic disease states including, but not limited to, cancer, stroke, microvascular&#xD;
      disease, type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Moreover, declines in skeletal muscle&#xD;
      mass also are accompanied by an even more precipitous reduction in skeletal muscle strength,&#xD;
      known as dynapenia, which is a predisposition for disability and falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenia begins in the 5th decade of life and proceeds, at least based on population-&#xD;
      derived estimates, at a ~0.8% loss annually, with strength losses being greater and more&#xD;
      variable at 2-5% year past the age of 50. However, these rates of muscle and strength loss&#xD;
      are not linear. Rather, the steady decline in muscle mass loss is punctuated by short-term&#xD;
      periods of muscle disuse, which accelerate strength and muscle loss and from which older, as&#xD;
      compared to younger, persons have a difficult time recovering. These acute periods of muscle&#xD;
      disuse have been shown to result in a transient accelerated decline in strength and skeletal&#xD;
      muscle mass effectively accelerating sarcopenia. Such episodes of muscle inactivity manifest&#xD;
      from a variety of circumstances such as hospitalization requiring short-term bed rest,&#xD;
      immobilization of limbs due to fracture or surgery, and periods of inactive convalescence&#xD;
      from illnesses. For example, influenza is the second most common cause of short-term&#xD;
      hospitalization in persons 65y with an average hospital stay of 3-4d in duration during which&#xD;
      substantial muscle disuse occurs. In addition, many surgeries in older persons (e.g.,&#xD;
      cholecystectomy), are followed by a hospital stay averaging 3d with a 6-9d period of&#xD;
      recovery, or an average of ~10 d of convalescence and minimal activity before a return to&#xD;
      normal activity. Given that physical strength is a predictor of all-cause mortality,&#xD;
      strategies that prevent the decline in, or enhance the recovery of, skeletal muscle strength&#xD;
      and functional mass following periods of inactivity in the elderly are critical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from our lab and others have shown that reduced ambulation (i.e., reduced daily steps),&#xD;
      a model of a remarkably common but seemingly benign state of muscle disuse, leads to a&#xD;
      significant loss of skeletal muscle in both young and older individuals. The investigators&#xD;
      propose that a period of disuse induced through step reduction provides an excellent model by&#xD;
      which to study disuse-induced dynapenia and atrophy. In older persons, 2wk of reduced&#xD;
      activity has been shown to decrease leg lean mass by 3.9% and increase in trunk adipose&#xD;
      tissue by 7.3%. Interestingly, others have demonstrated that older individuals lose the same&#xD;
      amount of muscle with only 10d of bed rest as compared to that lost with 28d of bed rest in&#xD;
      young persons. During the same 10d period there is shocking loss of lower extremity strength,&#xD;
      power, and aerobic capacity, and a reduction in physical activity. These data demonstrate&#xD;
      just how susceptible older persons are to even short-term periods of disuse. Different&#xD;
      results were observed by Suetta et al, who reported, in response to 14d of leg casting, an&#xD;
      8.9% and a 5.2% decline in quadriceps femoris muscle volume in young (n=9) and old men (n=9),&#xD;
      respectively. What needs to be appreciated, however, is that the older subjects had an 11%&#xD;
      lower muscle volume prior to immobilization (i.e., sarcopenia) so the loss in muscle mass may&#xD;
      have even more dire consequences for the older subjects . More importantly, older men showed&#xD;
      recovery of only 63% of their muscle mass and ~78% of their strength with 4wk of intensive&#xD;
      resistance training (which is not standard rehabilitation), versus a complete recovery in&#xD;
      young men. The investigators also have preliminary data that shows 2wk of step reduction&#xD;
      results in a significant decline in skeletal muscle strength in older men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One potential strategy to alleviate disuse-induced muscle atrophy that occurs during physical&#xD;
      inactivity would be to increase dietary protein intake. Indeed, some studies show that high&#xD;
      doses of amino acid ingestion slow the rate of disuse atrophy during bed rest. However, more&#xD;
      recently, Dirks et al reported that increasing protein intake from 1.1g/kg/d to 1.6g/kg/d,&#xD;
      using a twice daily supplement of 20g of protein, had no impact on skeletal muscle disuse&#xD;
      atrophy during 5d of immobilization by means of a full leg cast. The lack of agreement&#xD;
      between studies has been highlighted as being related to differences in the protein intake&#xD;
      between the control groups. Indeed, in the studies that did show attenuation in muscle mass&#xD;
      loss during bed rest, the control groups were consuming protein at a rate no higher than&#xD;
      0.8g/kg/d whereas in the latter study participants in the control group consumed 1.1g/kg/d&#xD;
      and it is also hypothesized that the protein dose used by Dirks et al was suboptimal since&#xD;
      our work shows that higher protein doses of whey protein are required by older men to&#xD;
      optimally stimulate protein synthesis. The investigators have recently showed, using a&#xD;
      retrospective pooled analysis of muscle protein synthetic rates, that older men had a higher&#xD;
      per meal protein requirement to optimally stimulate protein synthesis. Importantly, this work&#xD;
      also showed that with a sufficiently high dose of whey protein (~30g) older men had rates of&#xD;
      muscle protein synthesis not different from those in young men. Thus, while it is appreciated&#xD;
      that twice daily consumption of a 30g supplement would substantially elevate protein intake,&#xD;
      this intake would still be well within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges and&#xD;
      appropriate for older individuals who are inactive and hypoenergetic. Moreover, the study by&#xD;
      Dirks et al was conducted in a 'free-living' setting insofar as diet was concerned. The&#xD;
      investigators propose that during periods of hospitalization and convalescence, elderly&#xD;
      individuals often experience an energy deficit and are undernourished, specifically with&#xD;
      respect to protein intake . Indeed, a study of 102 hospital patients demonstrated that 21%&#xD;
      were consuming only 50% of their daily energy requirements and this under-nutrition was&#xD;
      associated with a higher incidence of in-hospital and 90d post-discharge mortality. Similar&#xD;
      findings have been corroborated by other reports that also show that under-nutrition is&#xD;
      largely driven by inadequate protein intake. This latter point is highly relevant to our&#xD;
      application as during times of energy deficit up to 25% of body mass loss can be accounted&#xD;
      for by losses of lean body mass. Taken together, these data show that periods of muscle&#xD;
      disuse are often accompanied by periods of energy deficit in the elderly. This situation also&#xD;
      is highly likely to be the case during, for example, wintertime in Northern regions of Canada&#xD;
      and the US when older adults, particularly those who live in single occupancy households, may&#xD;
      be homebound and thus drastically reduce their activity levels and are less likely to walk to&#xD;
      retail outlets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanistic basis of the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function Losses of&#xD;
      skeletal muscle mass are underpinned by an imbalance between rates of muscle protein&#xD;
      synthesis (MPS) and muscle protein breakdown (MPB). In healthy humans it is known that the&#xD;
      change in the rate of MPS in response to contractile activity and protein feeding is the&#xD;
      primary locus of control for human muscle mass. In this regard, the investigators have&#xD;
      recently shown that postprandial MPS in response to protein ingestion is reduced by&#xD;
      approximately ~20% following 14d of step reduction in older men and women, and this reduction&#xD;
      in postprandial MPS - coined 'anabolic resistance' - was associated with a ~3.9% loss in fat&#xD;
      free leg mass over the 14d period. Thus, it is proposed that reduced anabolic sensitivity to&#xD;
      protein ingestion is primarily responsible for skeletal muscle disuse atrophy in humans.&#xD;
      Relevant to the setting of hospitalization, short-term energy deficits also reduce&#xD;
      postprandial MPS in young and the investigators have preliminary data to show that 14d of a&#xD;
      controlled hypoenergetic diet also reduces MPS by approximately ~9% in middle-aged men and&#xD;
      women. It therefore appears that both reduced ambulation and a state of energy restriction&#xD;
      independently (and possibly synergistically) have a deleterious impact on MPS in response to&#xD;
      protein ingestion that may explain the rapid and punctuated losses of skeletal muscle mass&#xD;
      and strength that can occur with advancing age. Our laboratory has published data to show&#xD;
      that increased consumption of dairy foods and protein during diet and exercise-induced weight&#xD;
      loss results in lean mass gain whilst concomitantly promoting fat mass loss in overweight and&#xD;
      premenopausal women. Yet, how increasing dietary dairy-based protein intake during, and in&#xD;
      recovery from, a period of combined reduced ambulation and hypoenergetic diet influences&#xD;
      muscle anabolism in older men and women remains unknown. Another discerning feature of&#xD;
      protein metabolism with aging is that although there are no apparent differences in protein&#xD;
      turnover between young healthy males and females, older females demonstrate elevated rates of&#xD;
      resting MPS versus older males (&gt;70y) but are less sensitive to the anabolic effects of&#xD;
      protein feeding and exercise. The implication of this phenomenon is that elderly women may be&#xD;
      at even greater risk from disuse atrophy during periods of physical inactivity and&#xD;
      sub-optimal protein intake compared with men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of the aforementioned studies that assessed acute changes in rates of MPS in response to&#xD;
      protein intake did so by infusing a labeled amino acid tracer and calculating the&#xD;
      incorporation of that tracer into skeletal muscle over a period of hours (for extended&#xD;
      discussion see). While this approach provides important information, especially when coupled&#xD;
      with quantitative measures of changes in muscle mass such a MRI, the assessment of&#xD;
      tracer-infusion measured MPS is limited to ~5-6h. More recent developments of analytical&#xD;
      techniques have enabled the use of a deuterated water methodology that enables assessment of&#xD;
      MPS with much longer periods of incorporation i.e., days-to-weeks. Indeed, this method has&#xD;
      been recently validated and its use is now becoming the interest of many researchers.&#xD;
      However, only a few laboratories have demonstrated the ability to competently perform this&#xD;
      measurement. In fact, the investigators have recently conducted two studies using this&#xD;
      methodology, and the MPS values that have been obtained are entirely consistent with&#xD;
      published reports. It is proposed that the use of the deuterated water methodology, which&#xD;
      allows measurement of MPS in a free-living situation and incorporates all dietary and&#xD;
      activity measures, would be a substantial advance in determining mechanisms underpinning&#xD;
      disuse-mediated muscle protein loss. Thus, the investigators aim to build on these findings&#xD;
      by using the deuterated water methodology to study how increasing dietary protein intake&#xD;
      during, and in recovery from, a period of combined reduced ambulation and energy deficit,&#xD;
      influences long-term rates of MPS in older men and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The molecular mechanisms that underpin MPS in response to stimulation are complex,&#xD;
      multifactorial and remain largely unknown. However, what is known is that proteins contained&#xD;
      within the Akt-mTORC1-p70S6K1 signalling axis appear key. In a study conducted by the&#xD;
      investigators involving reduced steps, it demonstrated a reduction in Akt phosphorylation as&#xD;
      well as a ~12% reduction in insulin sensitivity. Thus, the investigators propose to examine&#xD;
      how the content of proteins contained within the Akt-mTORC1-p70S6K1 signalling axis change&#xD;
      during our intervention. The investigators will also will examine changes in the DNA-protein&#xD;
      ratio (an indicator of cell size) as well as mRNA expression of myogenin, MAFBx and MuRF1,&#xD;
      some of which have been shown to change in response to a period of disuse atrophy, using&#xD;
      real-time PCR. Thus, our molecular analysis coupled with the use of the deuterated water&#xD;
      methodology, and a real-world model of disuse atrophy and negative energy balance, provides a&#xD;
      mechanism-based clinical approach to study the impact of increased protein intake on&#xD;
      age-related myopenia and dynapenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously shown that 14d of reduced steps induces a reduction in&#xD;
      postprandial MPS by approximately ~20% following in older men and women, and this reduction&#xD;
      in postprandial MPS was associated with a ~3.9% loss in fat free leg mass. It has been&#xD;
      demonstrated that increased consumption of dairy foods and protein during diet and&#xD;
      exercise-induced weight loss results in lean mass gain whilst concomitantly promoting fat&#xD;
      mass loss in overweight and premenopausal women. Building on these findings, the&#xD;
      investigators have recently generated pilot data to show that 14d of step reduction results&#xD;
      in a significant decrease in muscle strength. In addition, it showed an ~18% reduction in&#xD;
      postprandial MPS in response to 3 separate 25g servings of whey protein over an 11 h periods&#xD;
      following 14d of mild energy restriction (-300 kcal) in healthy older males (~65y). Moreover,&#xD;
      the investigators have preliminary data to show that 14 d of a hypoenergetic diet (-750&#xD;
      kcal/d) induces a significant decrease of 9% in postprandial MPS in obese, overweight men and&#xD;
      women aged 35-65y . Finally, the investigators have just successfully completed a complex&#xD;
      human trial in older men (65-75y) who completed a single bout of either resistance exercise;&#xD;
      high-intensity interval exercise or traditional low-intensity aerobic exercise aimed that&#xD;
      utilized the D2O tracer methodology to directly assess MPS over a 24h and 48h period. These&#xD;
      MPS values are entirely consistent with previously published data.&#xD;
