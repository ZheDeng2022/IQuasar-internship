  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in four Veterans is affected by diabetes and will develop a diabetic foot ulcer. Diabetic&#xD;
      ulcers are very challenging to manage and are the most common cause of leg amputation. Many&#xD;
      advanced treatments are expensive and difficult to use in the clinic or at home. Those newer&#xD;
      therapies have shown little success in healing diabetic foot wounds. The investigators'&#xD;
      laboratory and animal work has suggested that a safe medication, currently used as an eye&#xD;
      drop for treatment of glaucoma, can heal these ulcers. The investigators are proposing to&#xD;
      test this drop (timolol) directly on the surface of the foot ulcer to see if can improve&#xD;
      healing faster than the current standard of care. To do this, the investigators propose a&#xD;
      &quot;randomized controlled trial&quot; with two groups of patients with diabetic foot ulcers: one will&#xD;
      receive standard of care with timolol while the other will receive standard of care with a&#xD;
      gel (hydrogel, as placebo medicine).&#xD;

      The trial is designed as a prospective, randomized, double-blinded controlled study of&#xD;
      subjects presenting with diabetic foot ulcers. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      superiority of Timoptic-XE therapy in conjunction with standard of care (SOC) treatment&#xD;
      (Group A: Timoptic-XE + SOC) versus SOC (Group B: SOC + plus a non-biologically active gel,&#xD;
      i.e., hydrogel, as placebo medication) in the clinical effectiveness in promoting wound&#xD;
      healing and closure.&#xD;
