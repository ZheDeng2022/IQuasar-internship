  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pivotal investigation is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      Cutera truSculpt™ radiofrequency (RF) Device for Wrinkle Reduction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an Open-label, Prospective, Multicenter Pivotal Study of approximately 40 male or&#xD;
      female subjects, age 25 to 65 years who desire RF treatment for wrinkle reduction and&#xD;
      improvement in skin quality. Subjects will receive two RF treatments (performed 4 to 6 weeks&#xD;
      apart) with the Cutera truSculpt™ radiofrequency (RF) device. Subjects will return to the&#xD;
      site after study treatments have been delivered for two follow-up visits: 4 weeks (± 2 week)&#xD;
      and 12 weeks (± 2 week) post-final treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint as the correct Identification of 12 weeks post final treatment&#xD;
           photographs from baseline as assessed by two of the three blinded assessors in at least&#xD;
           75% of the patients, and an improvement of ≥ 1 point on the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle&#xD;
           Classification System (FWCS.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints as the:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Principal Investigator's assessment of improvement at 12 weeks post-final treatment&#xD;
                (Physician's Global Assessment.)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Principal Investigator's assessment of improvement at 12 weeks post-final treatment&#xD;
                using the Alexiades Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subject satisfaction level at 12 weeks post-treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Safety Endpoint as the incidence and severity of adverse events during the study period&#xD;
           and at follow ups.&#xD;
