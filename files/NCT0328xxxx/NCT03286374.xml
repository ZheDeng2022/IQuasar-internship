  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this Cohort trial is to get more information about how life style changes&#xD;
      affect work participation for people with BMI above 30. The information can contribute to&#xD;
      improving the quality of occupational rehabilitation programs in the specialized health care&#xD;
      services and for others who work with weight loss programs and work related rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of rehabilitation, in general, is to help people to reach and maintain their optimal&#xD;
      function and copying capabilities and to promote independence and participation in society.&#xD;
      For occupational rehabilitation is the goal also to increase function and work ability to&#xD;
      prevent the individuals permanent to fall out of working life. People with high BMI needs&#xD;
      beside work rehabilitation also focus on life style changes to reduce consequences of&#xD;
      obesity. The Central Norway Regional Health Authority (HMN RHF) has initiated action to&#xD;
      reduce work absence and consequence of obesity by introducing a work related rehabilitation&#xD;
      program for people with BMI above 30. This program combines work participation and life style&#xD;
      changes and exists only in two institutions in Norway. The goal of the program is to increase&#xD;
      function and work ability and weight loss. The program is new, and few documents exist on the&#xD;
      effect and the correlation between life style changes and work ability. There is also need to&#xD;
      question whether obesity is the reason for work absence or is there other factors that affect&#xD;
      work ability. This trial wants to follow-up a group of people who have been participating&#xD;
      occupational rehabilitation at Muritunet.&#xD;
