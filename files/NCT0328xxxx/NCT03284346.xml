  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies how well circuit, interval-based aerobic and&#xD;
      resistance exercise works in targeting metabolic dysregulation in stage I-III breast or&#xD;
      prostate cancer survivors. Circuit, interval-based aerobic and resistance exercise may help&#xD;
      to improve cardiovascular fitness, weight loss, healthy lifestyle behaviors, and muscle&#xD;
      strength in breast or prostate cancer survivors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effects of a 4-month circuit, interval-based aerobic and resistance&#xD;
      exercise (CARE) intervention on metabolic dysregulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effects of a 4-month CARE intervention on sarcopenic obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effects of a 4-month CARE intervention on skeletal muscle strength,&#xD;
      physical fitness, and quality of life (QOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the effects of a 4-month CARE intervention on vascular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Patients undergo supervised exercise sessions comprised of CARE over 50 minutes 3 days&#xD;
      weekly for 16 weeks. Patients receive a Polar heart rate monitor to monitor heart rate during&#xD;
      the CARE sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: Patients undergo a standard stretching program 3 days weekly for 16 weeks. After 16&#xD;
      weeks, patients may undergo supervised exercise sessions comprised of CARE as in Arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients undergoing CARE are followed up for 4 months.&#xD;
