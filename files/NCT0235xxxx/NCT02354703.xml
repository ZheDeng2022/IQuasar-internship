      The primary study objective is to determine the efficacy of ondansetron (0.33 mg twice daily)&#xD;
      administered orally for a period of 16 weeks in reducing risky drinking among currently&#xD;
      drinking subjects with alcohol use disorder who have selected genotypes at the serotonin&#xD;
      transporter and receptor genes. The secondary objective is to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of ondansetron in subjects with alcohol use disorder who have selected genotypes&#xD;
      at the serotonin transporter and receptor genes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a heterogeneous and chronic relapsing disorder that includes&#xD;
      both acute (binge drinking) and chronic (frequent heavy drinking) dimensions. Perhaps because&#xD;
      of this heterogeneity, the therapeutic effect size of the approved medicines for the&#xD;
      treatment of AUD has been small. In an effort to overcome the heterogeneity of response to a&#xD;
      particular medication, recent studies have instituted a personalized approach to therapy.&#xD;
      Major breakthroughs in pharmacogenetics have made it possible to identify discrete subgroups&#xD;
      of the AUD population according to genetic profiles in order to target the subjects who are&#xD;
      most likely to respond to treatment with a particular agent. In addition, genetic variation&#xD;
      contributing to the risk of alcohol dependence may be differentially associated with&#xD;
      treatment response Thus a successful personalized medicinal approach should ensure that&#xD;
      targeted subgroups achieve an optimal treatment response with high predictability. Such an&#xD;
      approach holds the potential to identify not only robust responders to treatment but also&#xD;
      those who might have minimal or modest adverse effects from the putative therapeutic&#xD;
      medication. From a practical clinical standpoint, a personalized medicine approach starts&#xD;
      with a genetic screen to identify the &quot;right&quot; subject, who can then be treated with the&#xD;
      appropriate medication, with a high probability of a positive treatment outcome and,&#xD;
      therefore, a substantial impact on public health.&#xD;
