    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to see if serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate&#xD;
      (SBI) is safe and well tolerated in pediatric patients with IBS-D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Hypothesis :Pediatric patients with IBS-D, who take SBI, will have no significant&#xD;
      adverse events at 4 and 8 weeks and their quality of life will be better than the patients&#xD;
      who receive placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of four phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Phase: screen the patients for 2 weeks prior to enrollment in the study to&#xD;
      establish objective criteria of disease presence and severity. Patients will maintain a daily&#xD;
      symptom dairy. At the end of screening phase, we will calculate their quality of life and&#xD;
      symptom severity scores based on the information provided by the patients and their family.&#xD;
      Patients with an average score of 1 or greater over 14 days for abdominal pain and stool&#xD;
      consistency will be selected for the open label trial of SBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open Label Treatment Phase: patients enrolled will receive 4 weeks of SBI along with QOL&#xD;
      questionnaires to complete. If the patient's global assessment is that they have improved, or&#xD;
      if review of their diaries shows an improvement in symptom severity scores (decrease in&#xD;
      symptom severity score by &gt; 30% from baseline), they will be eligible for the randomization&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, who do not have any improvements during the first 4 weeks of SBI therapy, will not&#xD;
      be randomized. If non-responders have worsening of symptoms, they will be prescribed rescue&#xD;
      medications as per standard of care. If non-responders choose to continue to take SBI, they&#xD;
      will be so allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Phase: Patients who qualify for this phase will be randomized either to SBI or&#xD;
      placebo. They will take their medication for 4 more weeks and complete their questionnaires,&#xD;
      symptom as well as QOL. After this 4 week phase all patients will be offered the Open Label&#xD;
      Extension Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open Label Extension Phase: All patients who enter this phase will be treated with SBI for&#xD;
      another 16 weeks.&#xD;
