      The purpose of this study is to determine whether dendritic cells collected via leukapheresis&#xD;
      and incubated with antisense DNA oligonucleotides and then injected back into the same&#xD;
      subject will serve as modulators of the immune system in a manner that disrupts the&#xD;
      autoimmune process responsible for the destruction of pancreatic beta cells in subjects with&#xD;
      new onset type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross study designed to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of autologous immunoregulatory dendritic cells (iDC) in patients with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes. To do this, a total of 24 subjects with recent onset (&lt;100 days from diagnosis)&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes will have circulating dendritic cells harvested via leukapheresis. The&#xD;
      harvested dendritic cells will then be incubated in vitro with antisense DNA oligonucleotides&#xD;
      targeting the primary transcripts of cluster of differentiation antigen 40 (CD40), cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation antigen 80 (CD80) and cluster of differentiation antigen 86 (CD86). These&#xD;
      engineered dendritic cells will then be given as autologous intradermal injections (4&#xD;
      injections administered at 2 week intervals) in the subject' peri-umbilical region. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the injected cells will generate immunoregulatory cells that suppress the&#xD;
      autoimmune process responsible for the development of type 1 diabetes via destruction of the&#xD;
      subject's pancreatic beta cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Employing a cross-over design, all subjects will undergo leukapheresis at the outset. Twelve&#xD;
      subjects will be randomly assigned to receive cell injections at the outset while the other&#xD;
      12 subjects will receive sham injections and serve as controls. At the end of 12 months, all&#xD;
      subjects will cross-over to the alternative treatment and continue to be followed for an&#xD;
      additional 12 months. (Note: The subjects assigned to receive the cell therapy for this&#xD;
      segment will receive injections of their autologous cells harvested and engineered at the&#xD;
      time of the leukapheresis performed at study entry. The engineered cells will be stored&#xD;
      frozen until needed for administration. This design will test whether treatment later (&gt;1&#xD;
      year after diagnosis) is as effective as immediate treatment (&lt;100 days from the diagnosis of&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an added safety measure, the first 6 subjects randomized will all be over the age of 18.&#xD;
      When the last of these 6 subjects complete 3 months of observation following the initiation&#xD;
      of therapy, the age for enrollment will be lowered to age 16 for the next 6 subjects unless&#xD;
      safety observations dictate otherwise. When all subjects in this cohort have been enrolled,&#xD;
      the age for enrollment will be lowered to age 14 unless advised otherwise by the independent&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Board. When all subjects in this cohort have completed observation for&#xD;
      3 months, the age for enrollment will be lowered to age 12 following clearance by the Data&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this therapy is successful, the subjects' remaining beta cell mass will be preserved and&#xD;
      hopefully expanded once the autoimmune process is slowed or stopped. This outcome will be&#xD;
      assessed indirectly using plasma c-peptide concentrations following ingestion of a&#xD;
      standardized mixed meal at the end of 12 and 24 months of therapy. If the treatment is&#xD;
      successful, glucose control should improve and be detectable via measurement of hemoglobin&#xD;
      A1c (measure of long-term control), fasting plasma glucose concentrations and the plasma&#xD;
      glucose concentrations following ingestion of the standardized mixed meal. In addition, the&#xD;
      total daily insulin requirements should decrease. These measures of glucose control will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline and then at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune markers will also be profiled at 3 month intervals to assess potential tolerogenic&#xD;
      effects of the therapy. To this end, numbers of potentially tolerogenic/regulatory T-cells,&#xD;
      B-cells and dendritic cells in the circulating peripheral blood monocyte population will be&#xD;
      assessed. In addition, analysis of selected populations of T-cells, B-cells and dendritic&#xD;
      cells will be conducted over the entire study period in an attempt to identify molecular&#xD;
      signatures correlated with the clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, in addition to the routine safety laboratory measurements, all reported adverse&#xD;
      events will be examined in detail to characterize the safety aspects of the therapy. The&#xD;
      review of these safety data will be guided by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board&#xD;
      which will meet at least semi-annually to review the accrued data.&#xD;
