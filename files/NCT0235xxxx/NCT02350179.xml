&#xD;
      The Research Hypothesis The TXA could be able to reduce blood loss during and after elective&#xD;
      Caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Caesarean Section (C.S) is the most common major surgical procedure performed on women&#xD;
      worldwide and its rates continue to rise steadily in both developed and developing countries&#xD;
      (Gibbons et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caesarean Section is associated with more blood loss than vaginal delivery; there is a trend&#xD;
      for increasing rates in both developed and developing countries (Betra´n, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National US Caesarean section rate leveled off at 32.8% in 2010 and 2011 (Hamilton et&#xD;
      al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caesarean Section accounts for 20-25% of all deliveries in the UK (Fairley Dundas, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.S rates have increased to as high as 25-30 % in many areas of the world, in Pakistan the&#xD;
      (C.S) rate is 25% (Najmi, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many areas of China the (C.S) rate is as high as 40-50% (Zhang, 2008). The main causes of&#xD;
      death following a (C.S) are infection, hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, and anesthesia -&#xD;
      associated complications, caesarean section has been an important underlying cause of death&#xD;
      in Norway and contributed to the increased maternal death ratio in the last decade (Vangen&#xD;
      and Bergsjo, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery by (C.S) can cause more complications than normal vaginal delivery and one of the&#xD;
      most common complications is primary or secondary postpartum hemorrhage up to 20% (Lu et al.,&#xD;
      2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstetric hemorrhage can be life threatening, therefore to reduce the morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      due to obstetric hemorrhage we need to reduce the bleeding at C.S (Bingham, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postpartum hemorrhage is a major cause of maternal mortality, especially in under-resourced&#xD;
      countries, accounting for nearly one - quarter of all maternal deaths worldwide (WHO, 2007).&#xD;
      Recent studies from developed countries reported an increase in the rate of postpartum&#xD;
      hemorrhage, which has been attributed (at least in part) to arise in the rate of C.S (Bateman&#xD;
      et al., 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the incidence of Caesarean Section is increasing, and the average blood loss during&#xD;
      Caesarean Section is (1000 ml) is double the amount of lost during vaginal delivery (500 ml)&#xD;
      (Magann, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hematocrit falls by 10 % and blood transfusion is required in 6% of woman undergoing&#xD;
      Caesarean Section, Compared with 4% of woman who have a vaginal birth (RCOG, 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine that exerts its&#xD;
      anti-fibrin lytic effect through the reversible blockade of lysine binding sites on&#xD;
      plasminogen molecules. It has been in used for many years for reducing the blood loss in&#xD;
      surgeries (Astedt, 1987).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TXA has been shown to be very useful in reducing blood loss and incidence of blood&#xD;
      transfusion in many surgeries.In gynecology and obstetrics, TXA is most commonly used to&#xD;
      treat idiopathic menorrhagia and is an effective and well - tolerated treatment when&#xD;
      administered orally. Bleeding associated with pregnancy (placental abruption, placenta&#xD;
      previa) has also been treated with TXA (Dunn, 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, some randomized controlled studies have shown that TXA reduces blood loss after&#xD;
      C.S (As et al., 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No large randomized controlled trail of the efficacy of TXA in controlling blood loss during&#xD;
      C.S has been reported, This randomized double blind, placebo controlled study will evaluates&#xD;
      the efficacy of TXA in reducing blood loss during and after C.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the Work The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of tranexamic acid in&#xD;
      reducing blood loss during and after elective C.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Research Question Is Tranexamic acid effective in reducing blood loss during and after&#xD;
      elective Caesarean section?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Research Hypothesis The TXA could be able to reduce blood loss during and after elective&#xD;
      Caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis will therefore state that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no difference between TXA and placebo in reducing blood loss during and after&#xD;
      elective Caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods This will be a prospective, randomized controlled trial that will be&#xD;
      carried at Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, Ain Shams Maternity Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 100 pregnant women with singleton fetus 38 or more weeks gestation who&#xD;
      will be divided in to two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group will include 50 women and control group will include 50 women. Women assigned to&#xD;
      the study group will receive 1 gr of TXA injection (Kapron, AMOUN Pharmaceutical co.) given&#xD;
      slowly I.V over 10 minutes before the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive 30ml of 5% glucose. Both provider and patient will be&#xD;
      double-blinded until the conclusion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type of anesthesia will be decided by the surgeon and anesthetist after counseling the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria for the trial include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant women aged 20-40 with singleton fetus 38 or more weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncomplicated pregnancy, up to 3rd parity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women undergoing scheduled elective C.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Causes of uterine over-distention such as polyhydramnios or macrosomia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grand multi parity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous PPH (3 x risk) or previous history of retained placenta&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-eclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maternal hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-existing maternal hemorrhagic conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maternal diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abnormal placenta&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sensitivity to TXA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women taking anticoagulant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the intraoperative blood loss will be started after the uterine incision by&#xD;
      collection of the suctioned blood and by weighing surgical towels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative blood loss will be assessed during the first 24 hour by weighingthe pads. HB&#xD;
      level &amp; Hematocrit will be investigated before and 24 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The weight of the dry towels will be subtract from the weight of wet towels and the weight of&#xD;
      the blood will be change in to volume using the formula {density of blood is 1060/m3;&#xD;
      slightly denser then water so volume of the blood = weight multiply 0,9}).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size determination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a rate of intraoperative blood loss ranging between 650ml in group 1 &amp; 450ml in&#xD;
      group 2 with a SD of 300ml, a sample size of 48 patients in each group is enough to detect&#xD;
      such difference, if true, at 0,05 alpha error and 0,09 power of the test (Kemal, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and allocation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional randomized controlled trial will be conducted using systemic random sampling&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dark sealed envelopes containing the intervention and taken from a table of numbers, created&#xD;
      by a third party not involved in the allocation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed by picking one envelope for each patient from sequentially&#xD;
      numbered envelopes on the day of intervention initiation, by a nurse not involved in the&#xD;
      study and the patient will informed about the allocation arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: This will be a randomized double blind trial, both the provider and researcher will&#xD;
      be blinded to reduce bias; double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, neither the&#xD;
      provider nor the researchers know who is getting a placebo and who is getting the treatment&#xD;
      to avoid information and calculation bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration and informed consent This clinical trial will be proposed to the&#xD;
      ethical and review committee of Ain Shams University for approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An informed consent explaining the clinical trial and possible side effects of TXA will be&#xD;
      obtained from each patient included in the trial.&#xD;
