  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to evaluate a novel treatment approach for performing continuous real-time&#xD;
      glucose sensing and insulin delivery at the same subcutaneous tissue site.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of type 1 diabetes usually comprises the measurement of glucose in blood&#xD;
      obtained by finger pricking and the administration of insulin via subcutaneous bolus&#xD;
      injection or continuous subcutaneous infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to test a new treatment approach where glucose sensing and insulin&#xD;
      administration are combined and performed at a single subcutaneous tissue site (single-port&#xD;
      treatment approach). A single-port device consisting of a continuous glucose sensor and an&#xD;
      insulin infusion cannula is inserted into the subcutaneous tissue of 10 type-1 diabetes&#xD;
      patients and used for insulin infusion and simultaneous glucose sensing over a 7-day period.&#xD;
      The performance of the single-port device is assessed by comparing the obtained glucose&#xD;
      readings with those of a blood glucose meter and an additionally worn control sensor.&#xD;
