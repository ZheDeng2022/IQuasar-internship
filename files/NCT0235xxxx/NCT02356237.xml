    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to evaluate the influence of episiotomy on various maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      outcomes. Half of the participants will undergo selective episiotomy (according to routine&#xD;
      delivery management at the particular hospital), while the other half will not undergo&#xD;
      epitiotomy at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that no differences in maternal and neonatal outcomes will be demonstrated&#xD;
      between these two groups.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Episiotomy is one of the most prevalent surgical interventions at the delivery room, ranging&#xD;
      in frequency from about 10% and up to 75%. The presumed benefits of this procedure include&#xD;
      prevention of advanced (3rd and 4th degree) perineal tears, facilitation of fetal distress,&#xD;
      easier suturing compared to that of spontaneous perineal tears, decreased postpartum pelvic&#xD;
      organ injury including reduced risk of urinary and anal incontinence, and facilitation of&#xD;
      labor in cases of shoulder dystocia. However, the cumulative evidence in the recent decades&#xD;
      strongly points to the lack of episiotomy efficiency. Moreover, many studies indicate that&#xD;
      episiotomy may be associated with increased maternal morbidity in terms of postpartum&#xD;
      bleeding and pain, urinary incontinence and severe perineal tears. Cochrane Collaboration&#xD;
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials has shown that selective episiotomy&#xD;
      significantly decreases the risk of advanced perineal tears (relative risk of 0.67) and the&#xD;
      overall need for perineal suturing (relative risk of 0.71), compared to routine episiotomy&#xD;
      use. In addition, there is no uniform definition for the indications for episiotomy&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with literature evidence, we hypothesized that avoidance of episiotomy is not&#xD;
      associated with increased risk of maternal and neonatal complications, compared to selective&#xD;
      episiotomy use. Thus, the objective of our study is to compare maternal and neonatal outcomes&#xD;
      in the group with no episiotomy performed to selective episiotomy use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted in seven Northern public Israeli&#xD;
      Hospitals from February 2015 to February 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following study protocol was constructed using consultation with experienced&#xD;
      epidemiologist and several senior obstetricians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women fitting the inclusion criteria will receive a detailed explanation about the trial from&#xD;
      one of the approved investigators and will carefully read the relevant forms. In case of&#xD;
      agreement for participation in the study, informed consent form will be signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will undergo randomization into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group - in which the decision to perform episiotomy will be based on routine&#xD;
           delivery care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study group - in which no episiotomy will be performed. Deviation from protocol and&#xD;
           episiotomy performance in this group will be allowed only at the discretion of the&#xD;
           obstetrician in charge of the delivery, only in cases of unequivocal benefit to the&#xD;
           fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization will be carried out using computer software creating random numbers.&#xD;
      Allocation to one of the two groups will be done at second stage of labor by opening of&#xD;
      sealed opaque envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mediolateral or lateral episiotomy (according to the accepted management in each medical&#xD;
      center) will be performed during the crowning stage. The incision will be cut at an angle of&#xD;
      45-60º, for 3-4 cm of length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidural anesthesia during labor will be administered in accordance with patient's request.&#xD;
      Artificial rupture of membranes, augmentation of the contractions by oxytocin, the decision&#xD;
      to perform vacuum extraction or a cesarean birth will be done at the discretion of the&#xD;
      attending accoucher, in accordance with the accepted delivery management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be obtained for each participant:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic and obstetric characteristics, including maternal age, weight, height and&#xD;
           race, gestational age and pregnancy complications, clinical and sonographic estimated&#xD;
           fetal weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delivery and neonatal parameters, including oxytocin use for labor augmentation and&#xD;
           epidural anesthesia administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary and secondary outcome measures (described elsewhere).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation was performed by a certified statistician with an extensive&#xD;
      experience in clinical trials. It was based on the assumption that the worldwide rate of&#xD;
      advanced perineal tears in the control group is 1.6% (according to the latest data reported&#xD;
      at the annual Israeli Maternal and Fetal Medicine society meeting at November 2014), and that&#xD;
      the rates of these tears in the study group is 1.072% (based on the above mentioned report of&#xD;
      Cochrane Collaboration analysis, demonstrating relative risk of 0.67 with selective vs.&#xD;
      routine episiotomy use). Given the confidence level of 95% and power of 80%, the required&#xD;
      sample size is 14,842 (i.e. 7,421 women in each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A year after the trial initiation an interim analysis will be carried out, calculating the&#xD;
      up-to-date rate of advanced perineal tears. Sample size will be recalculated based on this&#xD;
      rate. In case of statistically significant difference in the primary outcome measure&#xD;
      (advanced perineal tears) with a confidence level of 0.003, discontinuation of the trial will&#xD;
      be considered due to demonstrated efficacy. Otherwise, the trial will be continued, and the&#xD;
      required confidence level at the final statistical calculations will be 0.049.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of data acquisition, statistical analysis will be carried out. Primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures will be compared between the two groups. In addition, the&#xD;
      association between episiotomy characteristics (incision angle, length and distance from the&#xD;
      initiation point to midperineum) to other outcome measures will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), in&#xD;
      accordance with &quot;intention to treat&quot; concept. Data will be presented to the statistician in a&#xD;
      blinded way, as groups &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;, with non-disclosure of the number interpretation.&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be presented as mean ± SD and compared using Student's t-test or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test, as appropriate. Categorical data will be expressed as numbers&#xD;
      (percentages) and compared using the Chi square test or Fisher's exact test, when&#xD;
      appropriate. Relative risks with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. A two tailed&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant for all comparisons.&#xD;
