  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the possible effect of an unsupervised water-exercise program, on the&#xD;
      intensity of low back pain and the number of days spent on sick leave, among healthy pregnant&#xD;
      women Our hypothesis is, that 45 minutes of water exercise twice a week for a period of 12&#xD;
      weeks during pregnancy, will reduce the intensity of low back pain and the days spent on sick&#xD;
      leave.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain occurs frequently during pregnancy. Studies show prevalence from 50 to 70% of&#xD;
      all pregnant women indicating a general problem. Low back pain increases with gestational age&#xD;
      and has been shown to be an important contributing factor to sick leave during pregnancy. Low&#xD;
      back pain also has a negative impact on the ability to perform daily chores. It is therefore&#xD;
      important to focus on how to prevent or reduce low back pain in pregnant women. Some studies&#xD;
      suggest that exercise decreases the pain intensity of low back pain during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, most women reduce the intensity of exercise and time spent exercising during&#xD;
      pregnancy, and many women do not exercise, despite both national and international&#xD;
      recommendation advising pregnant women to be physically active at a moderate intensity level&#xD;
      for at least 30 minutes per day. The reason for this reduction in physical exercise level can&#xD;
      be attributed to the growing body, pregnancy complications or a sense of insecurity while&#xD;
      exercising. Exercise such as swimming and exercising in water have been shown to be&#xD;
      increasingly used during pregnancy, because pregnant women feel comfortable and safe&#xD;
      performing exercises in water. Two randomized intervention studies found that water-exercise&#xD;
      during pregnancy can diminish low back pain and reduce the number of days spent on sick&#xD;
      leave. In both studies, the intervention was supervised in groups and took place during the&#xD;
      day at a scheduled time. These results indicate that supervised water-exercise may have a&#xD;
      beneficial effect on healthy pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark, an unsupervised water exercise program for healthy pregnant women, AquaMama, was&#xD;
      implemented in public swimming pools in 2011. However, there is no evidence on the effect of&#xD;
      unsupervised water exercise programs on the intensity of low back pain and the number of days&#xD;
      spent on sick leave. We therefore developed an unsupervised individual water exercise program&#xD;
      on the basis of AquaMama supplemented with supportive components to be tested in a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Pregnant women are recruited from the Department of Obstetrics, Rigshospitalet,&#xD;
      Copenhagen, Denmark. The women are selected on the basis of their due date to time the water&#xD;
      exercise intervention from the 20th to 32nd weeks of gestation. The women eligible for&#xD;
      participation are invited to participate by a mailed invitation send by post with an enclosed&#xD;
      description of the project. After one week the women are contacted by telephone or email and&#xD;
      invited to an interview, a physical examination of the pelvic and to fill out a baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One introduction session&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unsupervised water-exercises, of a duration of 45 min, twice a week for 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A weekly supportive email&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      General statistical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary data analysis will be performed based on the intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data (parity, previous low back pain) for the two groups will by compared: For&#xD;
      quantitative data a t-test will be applied if the data are sufficiently normal, otherwise the&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis test will be applied. Categorical data will be compared by the Fisher or&#xD;
      chi-square test, the latter being applied if the condition of the expected values being&#xD;
      larger than 5 is fulfilled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A t-test will be applied to compare the mean of the primary outcome in the two groups.&#xD;
      Similarly secondary outcomes will be compared using t-tests. For the secondary outcomes, the&#xD;
      p-values will be adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction&#xD;
      method. If the data are not sufficiently normally distributed, a transformation will be&#xD;
      applied if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the impact of parity and previous low back pain score on the outcomes, additional&#xD;
      linear regression analyses of the outcomes will be performed&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of influential observations (probably only relevant for number of days on sick&#xD;
      leave), robust regression techniques will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per- protocol analysis will be performed of the pregnant women who perform ≥ 75% of all&#xD;
      training sessions. The significance level will set at 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation was based on the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 points reduction on a numerical pain scale of 0-10, for the patient experiencing a&#xD;
           reduction in pain as clinically important.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Average highest pain at baseline is 5.8 and SD = 3 (3; 35). -A total of 70% of all&#xD;
           pregnant women who experience low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We assume that the effect of the intervention is 2.0 points if all participants complete&#xD;
           the full program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is estimated that 50% of participants follow the program for at least 75% of the&#xD;
           sessions (high participation, 19-24 sessions) while 35% follow 50-75% (moderate&#xD;
           participation, 12 -18 sessions) and 15% follow less than half of the program (low&#xD;
           participation). We estimate that the effect of high participation in the training course&#xD;
           is a reduction of 2 points, the effect of moderate participation in the training course&#xD;
           is a reduction of 1 point, while low participation does not result in a reduction. This&#xD;
           gives an overall reduction in the intervention group of 1.35 points (0.50 * 2 + 0.35 * 1&#xD;
           + 0.15 * 0 = 1.35). A difference in pain level of 1.35 (SD = 3.0) will be available with&#xD;
           a power of 90% and a significance level of 5% (two-sided) with 150 participants in each&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy in case of missing outcomes For outcomes with less than 5 percent missing data,&#xD;
      complete case analyses will be reported. If the percentage of missing data exceeds 5, a&#xD;
      sensitivity analysis based on worst-best and best-worst imputation will be applied (in the&#xD;
      experimental arm imputing the worst / best outcomes observed in the control arm to the&#xD;
      missing outcomes and vice versa for the control arm). In case these analyses give rise to the&#xD;
      same conclusion as the complete case analyses, the latter will be reported. Otherwise data&#xD;
      will be assumed Missing At Random (MAR) and analyses will be performed using&#xD;
      Maximum-Likelihood or Inverse Probability Weighting.&#xD;
