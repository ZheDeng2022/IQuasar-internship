  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate an improvement of vascular function, and&#xD;
      particularly dependent vasodilation flow and micro-vasculature, by STENDO for diabetic&#xD;
      patients compared to a control period in crossover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Action by shear stress causing vasodilation away from the microcirculation, STENDO should&#xD;
      have a beneficial effect on vascular function in type 2 diabetics. These effects could be&#xD;
      both treble just after the completion of a session with the device, and chronic with a&#xD;
      potentiating effect of different sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to study the different vascular function evaluation parameters we&#xD;
      have, to highlight these acute and chronic changes. The investigators will also study the&#xD;
      physical abilities to change topics and behavioral changes (spontaneous physical activity in&#xD;
      particular) and impact on subject quality of life.&#xD;

      Patients will be screened during a visit V0. A collection of consent (informed consent form),&#xD;
      clinical examination and a fasting blood test will be carried out during this visit.&#xD;
      Laboratory tests run-in will be composed of: Cell Blood Count (CBC) platelets, renal function&#xD;
      tests (serum electrolytes, urea and creatinine), liver function tests, fasting blood glucose&#xD;
      levels and Lipid Profile). Measurement of blood Pressure (2 successive measurements at&#xD;
      intervals of 5 min) and an electrocardiogram will be realized. The different information&#xD;
      collected at enrollment will allow stratification of cardiovascular risk by reference&#xD;
      integrators scores (ESC-SCORE (European Society of Cardiology Score) and Framingham Heart&#xD;
      Study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of measures for study criteria (functional measurements and assays) will be&#xD;
      tested fasting during this visit as the blood test.&#xD;
