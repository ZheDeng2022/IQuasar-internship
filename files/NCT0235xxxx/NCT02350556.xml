  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For several years, the postural disorders assessment in hemiplegic patients was conducted&#xD;
      through force plate, using the center of plantar pressure displacement in a static position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These are widely used in physical therapy both for assessment and rehabilitation of patients&#xD;
      with balance disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For hemiplegic patients, an asymmetric distribution support on each foot and an increased&#xD;
      surface area of postural sways (more marked on the medio lateral axis) are observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies, based on the study of plantar pressure ,are not enough to providea full&#xD;
      description of the spatio-temporal organization of postural components in hemiplegic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, postural stabilometric evaluation is based on a simplification of the human skeleton&#xD;
      by considering it as a simple inverted pendulum swinging on his ankles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This simplified model can't be used in dynamic assessment because of the simultaneous&#xD;
      contributions of several joints during movement. This restricts its clinical interest because&#xD;
      patients are more exposed to imbalances and falls in dynamic situations. Thus, the hip&#xD;
      angular movement results in a center plantar pressure displacementwhich is impossible to&#xD;
      discriminate from the ankle axis movement using stabilometric signal only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, it seemed interesting to study another variable valid in dynamic conditions : the&#xD;
      displacement of center of mass during a dynamic balancing task. This variable is obtained&#xD;
      through 3D motion capture of the different segments of the human body. The dynamic test is a&#xD;
      dynamic postural assessment following ball avoidance from three different directions. The&#xD;
      center of mass displacement will be compared with a functional test known to be&#xD;
      representative of dynamic balance of the individual capacities: The Timed Up and Go test&#xD;
      (TUG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of this data aims to improve the hemiplegic postural assessment for physical therapy and&#xD;
      to help develop new rehabilitative approaches.&#xD;
