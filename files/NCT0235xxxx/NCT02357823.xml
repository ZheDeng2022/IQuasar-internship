  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus pneumoniae is a cause of high morbidity and mortality in HIV-positive subjects,&#xD;
      representing the leading etiological agent of severe bacterial pneumonia. International&#xD;
      guidelines recommend that HIV positive patients aged &gt;=19 years, who are 13-valent conjugate&#xD;
      vaccine (PCV13) na√Øve, should receive a single dose of PCV13. Pneumococcal polysaccharide&#xD;
      vaccine 23-valent (PPV23) should be given &gt;=8 weeks after indicated dose of PCV13, and a&#xD;
      second dose of PPV23 should be given 5 years later. For those who previously received PPV23,&#xD;
      PCV13 should be administered &gt;=1 year after the last PPV23 dose. HIV infection affects&#xD;
      humoral immunity both through reduced T-cell help and changes in the B-cell compartment.&#xD;
      Neither amount of circulating memory B cells nor their functions are restored by&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy: this may affect antibody mediated immunity, even in well-treated HIV&#xD;
      patients. In asplenic childrens a single dose of PCV13 seems sufficient to restore the pool&#xD;
      of anti-pneumococcal polysaccharides IgG memory B cells. In adults, it has been reported that&#xD;
      a single dose of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine induces significant increases in&#xD;
      serotype-specific memory B-cell populations, conversely, immunization with PPV23 seems to&#xD;
      decrease memory B-cell frequency. However, data on immunological response after PCV13 in HIV&#xD;
      positive adults are still scanty and the optimal pneumococcal prophylaxis strategy needs&#xD;
      further investigation. Number of PCV13 doses is actually demanded to clinical judgment for&#xD;
      each patient; also current Italian indications recommend at least one dose, but till 3 doses&#xD;
      seem to be suggested for immunocompromised patients. Present study aims to investigate short&#xD;
      and long term immunological response after different standard vaccine schedule and to&#xD;
      evaluate pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization in vaccinated patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be divided in 3 main aims; in the first, the long term immunological response&#xD;
      to PCV13 and PPV23 in HIV+ adults will be evaluated. In a previous clinical trial (PRIN 2009&#xD;
      study, Clinicaltrials: NCT02123433) a cohort of HIV positive adults had been vaccinated&#xD;
      either with 2 doses of PCV13 8 weeks apart or 1 dose of PPV23 (last enrollment: December&#xD;
      2012). Immunoglobulins G (IgGs) against 12 common pneumococcal serotypes included in PCV13&#xD;
      and PPV23 were quantified by ELISA at baseline (BL), 8, 24 and 48 weeks: analysis are still&#xD;
      ongoing; preliminary data revealed that both vaccines were safe and well tolerated and showed&#xD;
      similar immunogenicity. The present study aims to evaluate persistence of long term (&gt;= 3&#xD;
      years) serological and memory B cells response in those previous vaccinated groups. In this&#xD;
      phase, population will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria to entire study&#xD;
      conduction. Once obtained informed consent, patients will be enrolled. Together with the&#xD;
      collection of blood samples for routine purposes, an additional blood sample will be taken so&#xD;
      to run immunological tests (ELISA, ELISpot). It is important to underline that no invasive&#xD;
      procedures are needed for the study, apart from routine clinical practice: blood specimens&#xD;
      will be obtained as part of routine investigations, blood will be hence taken for CD4+ cell&#xD;
      count, viraemia analysis and anti-HIV drug monitoring; enrolled patients will agree just to&#xD;
      donate a blood sample for research purposes. Blood samples will be collected from all&#xD;
      previously PCV13 or PPV23 vaccinated HIV+ subjects and serum antibodies and B cells isotypes&#xD;
      will be analyzed at baseline (BL), that is &gt;= 3 years after a previous PCV13 or PPV23&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objective of this study aims to evaluate short and long term immunological&#xD;
      response with different combined vaccine strategies in HIV+ adults. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited if they'll have needed to receive antipneumococcal vaccines (primary or booster)&#xD;
      according to clinical standard indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elicited immunological response (serum antibodies and B cells isotypes) will be explored at&#xD;
      BL, 8, 24, 48 and 96 weeks after additional different received pneumococcal vaccine&#xD;
      strategies. At BL, after collecting blood samples as previously described for Aim1, every&#xD;
      patient will be assigned to a specific Group on the basis of the received vaccine schedule,&#xD;
      prescribed by clinicians according to individual clinical indications. Short- (30 minutes),&#xD;
      medium- (&lt;=5 days) and long-term adverse reactions will be reported, by clinical evaluation&#xD;
      within 30 minute post-vaccine, phone call at day 5 and anamnestic data collection during&#xD;
      follow up 8, 24, 48 and 96 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be analyzed at 8, 24, 48 and 96 weeks to evaluate serum antibodies and B&#xD;
      cells isotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the third aim of the study will lead an epidemiological and microbiological survey&#xD;
      in vaccinated HIV+ adults. At BL, 8, 24, 48 and 96 weeks all clinical-anamnestic data will be&#xD;
      updated, together with blood sample analysis to title IgG towards each vaccinal pneumococcal&#xD;
      polysaccharides and to evaluate B cells isotypes and nasopharyngeal swab for S. pneumoniae&#xD;
      culture, in vitro chemosusceptibility tests, serotyping, clonal analysis by Multilocus Locus&#xD;
      Sequence Typing (MLST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carriage will be defined as S. pneumoniae isolation from one or more of the nasal swabs, in&#xD;
      absence of any clinical signs or symptoms; a 12 months clinical follow up will be performed&#xD;
      in colonized patients. All patients developing infections will be followed until resolution.&#xD;
