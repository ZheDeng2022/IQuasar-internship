    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is for transfemoral amputees to walk with an experimental robotic&#xD;
      prosthesis. Electric signals will be measured from their muscles and used to help control an&#xD;
      artificial leg. The investigators will record from sensors placed on a prosthesis and&#xD;
      electric signals measured from muscles in the participants leg to see if the investigators&#xD;
      can develop better computer programs to help predict subject actions and prostheses function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to use a powered knee-ankle prosthesis that is not yet commercially&#xD;
      available. The hierarchical control framework the investigators are developing will be&#xD;
      equally applicable to any prosthetic leg that needs to be transitioned between ambulation&#xD;
      modes, including microprocessor-controlled passive devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective is to develop and evaluate an adaptive framework for controlling lower&#xD;
      limb prostheses that compensates for changes in EMG signals. When a participant walks on a&#xD;
      lower limb prosthesis, the output of the high-level controller (or ambulation mode predictor)&#xD;
      directly influences patterns generated by the participant. After the participant has&#xD;
      completed the subsequent stride, a gait pattern estimator (GPE), will provide a label of what&#xD;
      the participant actually did. This may differ from the ambulation mode predictor output if&#xD;
      there was a misclassification. The label will then be used to update the ambulation mode&#xD;
      predictor algorithm such that future steps are predicted with higher accuracies. Finally, the&#xD;
      resulting system will be transferred to an embedded system and tested in real-time with&#xD;
      transfemoral amputees and compared to a non-adaptive system.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Assessed at approximately 2 months and 6 months after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Pattern recognition algorithms have been used to allow seamless and automatic transitioning between ambulation modes. Classification errors result in the prosthesis predicting the wrong ambulation mode. A decrease in errors results in improved mode prediction by the prosthesis. EMG from the participant and mechanical sensor data from the prosthesis are processed with the use of a phase-based-dependent pattern recognition classification method. The data collection will yield three groups of 10 real-time trials. The investigators primary analysis will be a repeated measures ANOVA with a planned contrast between the groups. The investigators will also complete a secondary analysis using the data collected while the participants ambulated outside of the laboratory. The total number of misclassifications will be computed. This will allow the investigator to evaluate the rate at which the overall classification system adapted.</description>

    <description>The prosthesis will be tuned, for each subject: level-ground walking, walking up and down slopes and walking up and down stairs. We anticipate that participants will visit the laboratory approximately 6-9 times over 2 months (2-3 visits for socket duplications and modifications, 2-3 visits for control system tuning, and an additional 2-3 visits for practice using the tuned system). By the end of these visits, the goal is to have a properly fitting socket and for the subjects to ambulate proficiently with the powered prosthesis. After tuning, the subjects will complete 20 ambulation circuits (level ground walking, walking up and down slopes, up and down stairs). This will provide training data for our pattern recognition control systems.</description>
