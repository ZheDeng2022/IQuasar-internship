      This study aims at evaluating the consequences of a 3 weeks high protein diet on the large&#xD;
      intestine ecosystem (microbiota, metabolites and gene expression in rectal mucosa). Those&#xD;
      parameters will be analysed with technics including OMICs methods. After a run-in period, 42&#xD;
      volunteers will receive either soy or milk protein or maltodextrin as a placebo control. This&#xD;
      trial is double blind randomized placebo-controlled paralleled design (3 arms). Longitudinal&#xD;
      sampling will allow the comparison of parameters during the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High protein diets are widely used for their slimming effect. Those diets increase the&#xD;
      quantity of undigested protein and peptides reaching the large intestine. Microbiota utilizes&#xD;
      protein and peptides as substrates and produces amino-acid derived metabolites such as short&#xD;
      chain fatty acids, branched chain fatty acids, lactate, formate, succinate, ammonium,&#xD;
      hydrogen sulfide and phenolic compounds. Some of those metabolites have been shown to be&#xD;
      beneficial to the host whereas other could be deleterious. High protein diets may have&#xD;
      different effects whether based on animal or plant proteins since those two kinds of protein&#xD;
      have different amino acids composition and slightly different digestibility. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate in overweight volunteers the consequences of high protein diets&#xD;
      (animal vs vegetal) vs isocaloric-normoproteic diet at the level of the large intestine and&#xD;
      metabolism. Firstly, composition and activity of the microbiota and the metabolites produced&#xD;
      in the large intestine lumen will be determined. Then, to evaluate the consequences of the&#xD;
      tested diets on mucosal physiology, gene expression will be analyzed in rectal biopsies and&#xD;
      fecal water will be tested on colonocytes cell lines. Lastly, the consequences of the diets&#xD;
      on host metabolism will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study, volunteers (n=42) will provide a 3 day food record that will be utilized by&#xD;
      a dietician to calculate their usual energy intake. The study will start with a 2 weeks&#xD;
      normalization period during which the volunteers will have to eat according to menus (Fig.&#xD;
      1). The diet will provide to the volunteer their usual individual energy intake; and protein,&#xD;
      carbohydrates and fat will respectively provide 15, 50 and 35 % of the energy intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of this standardization period, volunteers will be randomly assigned into 3 groups&#xD;
      (n=14) for 3 weeks (intervention period) (Fig. 1). Volunteers of the 3 groups will follow a&#xD;
      diet with a reduced digestible carbohydrates intake (15% of energy intake) while undigestible&#xD;
      carbohydrate intake will remain unchanged. The volunteers will consume 3 times per day a&#xD;
      dietary supplement powder that they will dissolve in water and then drink. This supplement&#xD;
      will provide them 15% of their energy intake. The first group will receive a casein (animal&#xD;
      protein) supplement so that they will have a high protein diet (protein, carbohydrates and&#xD;
      fat will respectively provide 30, 35 and 35 % of the energy intake). The second group will&#xD;
      receive a soy protein(vegetal) supplement so that they will also consume a high protein diet&#xD;
      (protein, carbohydrates and fat will respectively provide 30, 35 and 35 % of the energy&#xD;
      intake). The third group will receive a maltodextrin (digestible carbohydrate, placebo&#xD;
      control) supplement so that they will ingest a normoproteic diet, similar in macronutrient&#xD;
      composition to the standardization diet (protein, carbohydrates and fat will respectively&#xD;
      provide 15, 50 and 35 % of the energy intake). The dietary supplement will be given in a&#xD;
      double-blinded protocol. There will be no energy restriction between the standaridization and&#xD;
      intervention periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily, the volunteers will measure their body weight and record their food consumption and&#xD;
      physical activity. Once a week, they will have a phone call with a dietician to ensure&#xD;
      dietary compliance (Fig. 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the normalization period, 13 days after the beginning of the study (D13),&#xD;
      volunteers will collect 24h urine samples. Stool samples will be collected from the evening&#xD;
      of D13 to the morning of D14 . A cooler will be provided to the volunteer for storage and&#xD;
      transport of samples. After one night fasting, in the morning of D14, the volunteers will&#xD;
      come to the hospital and will bring their samples that will be immediately conditioned for&#xD;
      storage. Blood samples will be collected. Then, rectal biopsies will be recovered. Every week&#xD;
      during the intervention period, urine stool and blood will be sampled (D21, D28, D35). At the&#xD;
      end of the intervention period, rectal biopsies will be recovered (D35). Body weight and&#xD;
      blood pressure will be measured at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses All measured parameters will be expressed relatively to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary intake will be evaluated by dietician based on food records.&#xD;
