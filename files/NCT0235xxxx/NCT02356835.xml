  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 10-week, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      APT001 plasma and nitric oxide treatment in subjects with a diabetic foot ulcer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 80 subjects will be randomized by computer to receive equally either sham&#xD;
      therapy or plasma / nitric oxide treatments topically. The nitric oxide / plasma treatment&#xD;
      will be delivered from 11.5 to 15 centimeters from the wound surface for 10 seconds per cm2&#xD;
      of wound size. Subjects will be evaluated for efficacy and safety on a regular basis with&#xD;
      clinical observations. The wounds of both groups will be treated with sharp debridement as&#xD;
      determined by the site Investigator. A collagen dressing, a non-adherent dressing, and an&#xD;
      absorptive dressing will be applied to the wound after either the study therapy or the sham&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For an initial safety evaluation in patients with DFU, the first ten patients randomized will&#xD;
      be limited to wound size of 7 cm2 or less and their wounds will be assessed 2-4 days after&#xD;
      each treatment session. Following completion of the final assessment in these 10 patients,&#xD;
      data will be submitted to FDA for review and approval before opening the enrolment for the&#xD;
      remaining patients.&#xD;

    <description>The APT001 is a medical device that generates a plasma flow containing nitric oxide intended to be applied topically to wound sites. The nitric oxide / plasma flow will be directed at the wound site and surrounding skin at a distance of 11.5 to 15 centimeters from the skin surface. Dose will be 10 seconds / cm2 wound surface area. Administration of the therapy will include a 2 cm border around the defined edges of the wound site.</description>
