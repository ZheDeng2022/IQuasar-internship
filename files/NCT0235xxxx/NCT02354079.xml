      The aim of this study is to identify new targets in cholesterol metabolism thanks to a&#xD;
      genetically-based strategy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to recruit 400 subjects: 200 adult subjects with familial hypobetalipoproteinemia&#xD;
      (FHBL) (index cases) plus 200 additional related subjects in at least 10 large informative&#xD;
      FHBL families, in which there is no known mutation in FHBL genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient care is modified: patient will have an Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD)&#xD;
      questionnaire (focus on depressive syndrome), a food diary, and some additional blood&#xD;
      analysis (including genetic analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main issue to recruit FHBL patients is the fact that they are asymptomatic and&#xD;
      that FHBL is not identified as a serious illness by their general physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step-1. Excluding mutations in selected candidate genes As a first approach to screen&#xD;
      candidate genes and exclude patients with known mutations, the investigators developed a&#xD;
      custom design based on the Haloplex™ technology (Agilent® Technologies) to perform&#xD;
      high-throughput sequencing of the coding regions of 10 genes, including those previously&#xD;
      described in FHBL (apolipoprotein B (APOB), Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9&#xD;
      (PCSK9)), Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP or ABL), chylomicron retention&#xD;
      disease (CMRD), Secretion associated, Ras related GTPase (SARA2 gene), as well as 6&#xD;
      additional candidate genes in cholesterol metabolism (low density lipoprotein receptor&#xD;
      (LDLR), Sortilin (SORT1), Inducible Degrader of the LDL receptor (IDOL), Cholesteryl ester&#xD;
      transfer protein (CETP), Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and Angiopoietin-like Protein 3 (ANGTPL3)).&#xD;
      All the recruited index cases (n=200) will be genotyped to select only those without&#xD;
      mutations in previously described genes, being approximately 50% of our index case cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step-2. Identification of informative families and exome sequencing In patients without&#xD;
      identified mutations, the investigators will conduct a familial screening in order to&#xD;
      identify other cases of FHBL among proband relatives. An analysis of fasting plasma lipid&#xD;
      parameters (total cholesterol (TC), High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), Low-Density&#xD;
      Lipoproteins (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG)) will be performed for each related. Affected&#xD;
      subjects will be determined by a spontaneous LDL-C &lt; 80 mg/dl and/or apoB &lt; 50 mg/dl. In&#xD;
      contrast, non-affected subjects will display LDL-C &gt; 80 mg/dl and/or apoB &gt; 50 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For large families, the investigators will then combine whole-exome sequencing and linkage&#xD;
      analysis to identify any novel genetic variant likely explaining FHBL. Depending on family&#xD;
      pedigree, whole-exome sequencing (WES) will be performed on 2 to 5 patients per family. All&#xD;
      relatives will be genotyped for linkage analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel to this genetic approach, a regional epidemiological analysis will be performed&#xD;
      to identify some geographical clusters with a high prevalence of the disease, as developed in&#xD;
      the project named VaCaRMe (for Vascular and Cardiac, Respiratory and Metabolic overcome&#xD;
      diseases)&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional aim, based on an exhaustive phenotyping of FHBL patients, is to investigate the&#xD;
      safety of very low LDL-C and to perform some genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with&#xD;
      FHBL population.&quot;&#xD;
