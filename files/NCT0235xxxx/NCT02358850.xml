      This is a randomized prospective study to determine the optimal postoperative pain medication&#xD;
      regimen for adults (18 years old and older) undergoing tonsillectomy with or without&#xD;
      adenoidectomy for chronic tonsillitis and/or snoring and/or obstructive sleep apnea. All&#xD;
      participants will undergo the same tonsillectomy surgical technique (with or without&#xD;
      adenoidectomy) under general anesthesia and be randomized to one of three postoperative pain&#xD;
      control regimens (all of which are commonly used pain medications for post-tonsillectomy&#xD;
      pain):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Norco (Hydrocodone and Acetaminophen)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Percocet (Oxycodone and Acetaminophen)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dilaudid and Tylenol (Acetaminophen)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be discharged home the day of surgery and will be sent home with&#xD;
      questionnaires to assess their daily pain level, oral intake, amount of nausea/vomiting, and&#xD;
      amount of pain medications taken for the 14 days following their surgery. Data will be&#xD;
      collected and analyzed to determine if there is a difference in pain levels or oral intake or&#xD;
      nausea/vomiting in the different pain regimen groups. Secondary endpoints will include weight&#xD;
      change from preoperative weight to weight at 2-3 weeks after surgery in addition to&#xD;
      postoperative complications including visits to the Emergency Department and&#xD;
      post-tonsillectomy bleed rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be seen 1-2 weeks following their surgery in the ENT (Ear, Nose and Throat)&#xD;
      clinic per normal postoperative protocol and will not require any specific clinic visits&#xD;
      related to this study.&#xD;

      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is an optimal pain control regimen for post-tonsillectomy pain control in adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-tonsillectomy pain levels in adults peak around postoperative day number seven&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-tonsillectomy adults return very slowly to normal (pre-surgery) oral intake and&#xD;
           diet&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess daily post-tonsillectomy pain level in adults for the two weeks after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if there is an optimal post-tonsillectomy pain control regimen in adults&#xD;
           for the two weeks after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine oral intake levels in post-tonsillectomy adults for the two weeks after&#xD;
           surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine daily amounts of nausea/vomiting in post-tonsillectomy adults for the two&#xD;
           weeks after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the change in weight in the two to three weeks after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Background Tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy) is a very common procedure in&#xD;
      children and adults. The most common indications for tonsillectomies include chronic&#xD;
      tonsillitis and/or obstructive sleep apnea. While many studies have examined the optimal&#xD;
      postoperative pain control regimen in children, the optimal pain control regimen in adults&#xD;
      remains poorly studied and understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature regarding post-tonsillectomy pain in adults has primarily focused on the specific&#xD;
      tonsillectomy surgical technique (there are many) rather than the exact medications used for&#xD;
      pain control. Interestingly, some of these aforementioned studies did not include the name,&#xD;
      type or quantity of pain medications given to their patients when the primary study endpoint&#xD;
      was pain. Additional studies have examined the role of steroids, antibiotics, and/or pain&#xD;
      medications given by Anesthesia while a patient is anesthetized and undergoing tonsillectomy&#xD;
      to determine if this can reduce postoperative pain. IV steroids given perioperatively to&#xD;
      adults undergoing tonsillectomy have less pain, nausea, and vomiting in the first few days&#xD;
      after tonsillectomy. IV steroids are now routinely given before tonsillectomy by most&#xD;
      practicing Otolaryngologists, including our senior authors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a limited number of studies looking at actual postoperative pain control regimens&#xD;
      in adults. Most of these studies are limited in that they only looked at the first 24 hours&#xD;
      following surgery rather than trending pain levels for the first week or two after surgery.&#xD;
      Additional studies are limited because they are observational or prospective without&#xD;
      comparative pain regimen groups (i.e. they gave all patients the same medications asked them&#xD;
      their daily pain levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, a majority of studies involving postoperative pain control used a &quot;cold steel&quot;&#xD;
      technique tonsillectomy, which is uncommonly practiced in the United States by&#xD;
      Otolaryngologists, who prefer the use of electrocautery devices for tonsillectomy. It is well&#xD;
      known and accepted that cautery causes more postoperative pain due to thermal tissue injury,&#xD;
      however it allows for a straightforward surgery with better intraoperative control of&#xD;
      bleeding. Furthermore, randomized prospective studies for postoperative pain control&#xD;
      following cautery tonsillectomy are lacking in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that the expected recovery period for adults is 2-4 weeks, during which they&#xD;
      cannot work or do any strenuous activity. We would argue that the first 24 hours after&#xD;
      tonsillectomy is actually better tolerated by adults because they have received high potency&#xD;
      narcotics (usually through their IV) during and right after surgery. Therefore a more&#xD;
      meaningful time period to study would be postoperative day number 1 - 14, when the patient is&#xD;
      at home and the pain is most severe (most patients state that their pain peaks around&#xD;
      postoperative number 5-7). Pain control is incredibly important issue in the&#xD;
      post-tonsillectomy patient. If they have too much pain, they will not drink or eat enough to&#xD;
      stay hydrated and nourished. This can lead to electrolyte abnormalities and dehydration&#xD;
      requiring visits to the Emergency Department with or without admission to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate post-tonsillectomy pain control in adults using&#xD;
      three randomized medication regimens. All patients would undergo the same surgical technique&#xD;
      to avoid confounding variables. Surgeries would be performed by Otolaryngology - Head and&#xD;
      Neck Surgery Residents under the direct supervision of Otolaryngology staff attending&#xD;
      surgeons. All of the proposed pain regimens are commonly accepted regimens used by practicing&#xD;
      Otolaryngologists for adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients would be asked to complete a questionnaire that numerically evaluates their daily:&#xD;
      pain level, amount of oral intake, amount of nausea/vomiting, and amount of pain medications&#xD;
      used. They would asked to mail in their results or return the clinic. Additional information&#xD;
      would be collected from the patients and/or their medical records including visits to the&#xD;
      emergency department, readmissions to the hospital, and postoperative complications including&#xD;
      post-tonsillectomy bleeding. Data would be compiled and analyzed to determine the typical&#xD;
      postoperative pain levels, daily oral intake level, and to compare the different pain&#xD;
      regimens to determine if one is superior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to note that there are accepted risks of general anesthesia and undergoing&#xD;
      tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. Participation in this study would not change any&#xD;
      of the accepted risk of undergoing the surgical procedure. The risks commonly discussed with&#xD;
      patients before tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy include failure to resolve&#xD;
      chronic throat infections, failure to resolve obstructive sleep apnea, voice changes after&#xD;
      surgery, damage to lips/teeth/tongue, taste changes, dehydration, need to return to the&#xD;
      emergency department, need for admission to the hospital, and 3-5% risk of post-tonsillectomy&#xD;
      bleeding that may result in need for additional surgical procedures and/or blood&#xD;
      transfusions.&#xD;
