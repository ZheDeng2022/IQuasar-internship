    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial involving 100 treated&#xD;
      subjects undergoing endonasal trans-sphenoidal (ENTS) resection of pituitary lesion. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized into two groups: 50 treated in the opioid-sparing arm and 50 treated in&#xD;
      the standard post-operative medication arm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative pain control is a common concern patients have when they consider undergoing a&#xD;
      surgical procedure. Although effective for treating acute pain, opioid analgesics are also&#xD;
      associated with dose-dependent adverse effects, including constipation, nausea and vomiting,&#xD;
      altered mental status, and respiratory depression, all of which have been shown to increase&#xD;
      patient length of stay. The use of non-opioid analgesics with different mechanisms of actions&#xD;
      for acute pain control via a multi-modal approach is efficacious in reducing opioid&#xD;
      consumption, decreasing the incidence of adverse effects, improving patient satisfaction and&#xD;
      recovery time, and decreasing hospital costs.Certain minimally invasive procedures may afford&#xD;
      many patients the opportunity to achieve adequate post-operative pain control with minimal to&#xD;
      no requirement of opioid analgesics, thereby sparing the patient known adverse effects that&#xD;
      can increase length of stay and costs. The ENTS approach for resection of pituitary tumors is&#xD;
      the standard surgical procedure for these lesions, and is associated with pain that is more&#xD;
      easily managed post-operatively, making it an ideal procedure for an opioid-sparing&#xD;
      post-operative pain regimen. Anecdotally, the investigators note that in the investigator's&#xD;
      post-operative pituitary patient population that post-operative pain can frequently be&#xD;
      adequately managed with scheduled non-opioid analgesics, often without requiring breakthrough&#xD;
      opioid doses. Another safe and effective non-opioid analgesic that is widely used in&#xD;
      multi-modal pain management for moderate pain is IV Caldolor (ibuprofen). After literature&#xD;
      review, the investigators were unable to find a study that had attempted to use an&#xD;
      opioid-sparing analgesic regimen for post-operative pain control following ENTS approach for&#xD;
      resection of pituitary tumors.&#xD;
