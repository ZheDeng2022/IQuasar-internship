      PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that can arise at any&#xD;
      site in the gastrointestinal tract, that are known by their ability to over express&#xD;
      somatostatin receptors. Originally called carcinoid tumours, these tumours are rising in&#xD;
      incidence. In patients with incurable disease, several systemic options have demonstrated&#xD;
      activity but few have been compared in prospective, randomised controlled trials (RCTs).&#xD;
      177Lu-Octreotate peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and CAPTEM have shown promising&#xD;
      activity in initial single arm trials. Prospective RCTs are needed to build on these early&#xD;
      trials to determine the optimal role of these therapies in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTROL NETs is a parallel group phase II randomised open label trial of Lutetium-177&#xD;
      Octreotate (177Lu-Octreotate (Lutate)) peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and&#xD;
      capecitabine (CAP)/temozolomide (TEM) chemotherapy (chemotherapy): (i) versus CAPTEM alone in&#xD;
      the treatment of low to intermediate grade pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs); (ii)&#xD;
      versus PRRT alone in the treatment of low to intermediate grade midgut neuroendocrine tumours&#xD;
      (mNETs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      General aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) To determine the relative activity of CAPTEM/PRRT in biopsy-proven, low to intermediate&#xD;
      grade, unresectable, metastatic 68Ga-octreotate PET-avid NETs in the following parallel phase&#xD;
      II studies: Group A: pNETs and Group B: mNETs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) To inform future comparative phase III RCTs to determine the optimal therapies in pNETs&#xD;
      and mNETs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two parallel non-comparative group randomised, controlled, multi-centre phase II, 2 arm&#xD;
      open-label controlled trials with 2:1 allocation (experimental : control)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study A: pNETs: PRRT/CAPTEM vs. CAPTEM (control)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study B: mNETs: PRRT/CAPTEM vs. PRRT (control)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be performed using the method of minimisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous systemic therapy regimens (0,1 v 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WHO tumour grade: Low Grade - G1 (Ki67&lt;3% (mitotic count &lt;2)) vs. Intermediate Grade -&#xD;
           G2 (Ki67 3-20% (mitotic count 2-20))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  visceral only vs. visceral with bone metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treating institution&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population for this study is consenting adult patients with advanced, unresectable&#xD;
      low or intermediate grade (Ki-67&lt;20%) midgut neuroendocrine tumours (mNETs) or pancreatic&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs ), who have received â‰¤ 2 prior systemic therapies for advanced&#xD;
      unresectable disease (including long acting somatostatin analogues).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be assessed at each treatment cycle for toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT including a 3 phase contrast CT of the liver will be undertaken at baseline, then&#xD;
           every 2 months (pNET) or every 4 months (pNET) until radiologic progression by RECIST&#xD;
           v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  68Ga-DOTATATE PET CT Scan will be undertaken at baseline, then every 4 months until&#xD;
           radiologic progression by RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18F-FDG PET Scan may be performed at the discretion of treating clinician at baseline,&#xD;
           then every 2 months until radiologic progression by RECIST v1.1) for G2 NETS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-h whole-body planar gamma imaging will be undertaken on the day after administration&#xD;
           of PRRT (every 2 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum biomarkers will be undertaken every 4 months until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life assessments will be undertaken at every 2 months until disease&#xD;
           progression using QLC C30 and QLQ-GINET21.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health utilities will be evaluated with EQ-5D-5L every 2 months until completion of&#xD;
           study follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both studies are based on a Simon's two-stage design and are randomised using a 2:1&#xD;
      randomisation (Experimental: Control). A mix of approximately 30% G1 patients and 70% G2&#xD;
      patients is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study A, pNETs (n=90) will have 80% power with 95% confidence interval to exclude a 12 months&#xD;
      PFS of 60% in favour of a more interesting rate of 77% in the experimental arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Study B, mNETs (n=75), the PFS at 24 months in the control arm is expected to be 52%.&#xD;
      Thus study B will have 80% power with 95% confidence interval to demonstrate a PFS rate at 24&#xD;
      months of 70% in experimental arm, a result that would warrant further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total sample size of 165 patients for the two studies will be accrued over 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for a minimum of 2 years.&#xD;
