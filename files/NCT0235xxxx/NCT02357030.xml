      The Gulf War Synergy Trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a currently available&#xD;
      medication, methylphenidate (Ritalin®), combined with a GWI Nutrient Formula (K-PAX Synergy)&#xD;
      to treat Gulf War Illness (GWI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a currently available medication,&#xD;
      methylphenidate (Ritalin®), combined with a mitochondrial support nutrient formula (K-PAX&#xD;
      Synergy) to treat Gulf War Illness (GWI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nutrient formula to be used in this trial is a broad-spectrum micronutrient supplement.&#xD;
      This nutrient formula provides GWI patients with vitamins, minerals, and other cofactors&#xD;
      (amino acids, antioxidants, and mitochondrial cofactors) to complement the low-dose Central&#xD;
      Nervous System (CNS) stimulant (methylphenidate). The low-dose CNS stimulant provides the&#xD;
      necessary catalyst to augment the metabolism of cellular fuel and the production of cellular&#xD;
      energy.Therapeutic dosages of micronutrients are provided to support the functioning of the&#xD;
      nervous, endocrine, and immune systems to a level at which a lower than customary dosage of&#xD;
      methylphenidate can produce positive clinical effects on GWI symptoms and also be well&#xD;
      tolerated without further depleting or degrading these systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of methylphenidate (Ritalin®) being tested in this study is relatively low (5-10mg&#xD;
      twice daily). This drug has been in clinical use for over 50 years for the treatment of&#xD;
      Narcolepsy and Attention Deficit Disorder and has a well-described safety profile when used&#xD;
      as recommended. GWI and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) share a high degree of symptom&#xD;
      overlap. They have both been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Methylphenidate alone has&#xD;
      been studied as a treatment for CFS in the past and has been shown to produce mild benefits&#xD;
      and be well-tolerated. When provided as innovative therapy, methylphenidate plus this CFS&#xD;
      Nutrient Formula has produced substantial improvements in CFS symptoms in a limited number of&#xD;
      patients, and demonstrated excellent tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of low dose methylphenidate coadministered with a mitochondria support nutrient formula&#xD;
      has not been previously evaluated in a controlled clinical study. The risk to patients using&#xD;
      this combination is believed to be low, especially in the context of a well-controlled&#xD;
      clinical study. Furthermore, this combination is not expected to increase the incidence or&#xD;
      severity of adverse events associated with methylphenidate.&#xD;
