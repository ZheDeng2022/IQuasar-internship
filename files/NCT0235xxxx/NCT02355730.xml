  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to further develop and optimise the design and manufacturing process of a&#xD;
      handheld device to monitor and manage Warfarin (blood thinning anticoagulation drug) therapy.&#xD;
      The device comprises of a handheld instrument and a disposable test strip and reports how&#xD;
      blood coagulation is working in terms of standardised units called International Normalised&#xD;
      Ratio (INR). A single drop of fresh whole blood and plasma will be added to the strip and the&#xD;
      INR result displayed on the instrument. Blood samples are to be collected from patients&#xD;
      attending a hospital based INR clinic who are on Warfarin Therapy. The samples are to be used&#xD;
      in a series of experiments in the laboratory to test the Microvisk POC INR Monitors accuracy,&#xD;
      precision, stability and robustness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of patients receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin and other vitamin K&#xD;
      antagonists has been rising in recent years. Increasing life expectancy is increasing the&#xD;
      proportion of the population having conditions such as Atrial Fibrillation and venous&#xD;
      thrombosis, where primary and secondary prevention of thromboembolic complications are best&#xD;
      achieved with anticoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unpredictable pharmacokinetics, widespread interactions with drugs and food and the narrow&#xD;
      therapeutic window make closely monitoring Vitamin K antagonists a necessity. Portable point&#xD;
      of care (POC) coagulometers which measure PT from capillary whole blood and provide an INR&#xD;
      reading within a few minutes are already widely available throughout North American and&#xD;
      Europe. They give comparable results when compared to laboratory based systems are popular&#xD;
      with patients and significantly shorten the duration of clinics. In addition, the United&#xD;
      Kingdom Department of Health has been encouraging the use of anticoagulation services in&#xD;
      Primary Care Trusts the aim being to provide INR monitoring in community clinics and General&#xD;
      Practice surgeries relieving pressure on hospital services and reducing inconvenience for&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although coagulometers are now commercially available the Microvisk INR Testing System has&#xD;
      been designed to have advantages, particularly in terms of test robustness, user comfort,&#xD;
      ease of use and reduction of user error. The present trial has been designed to develop the&#xD;
      second generation Microvisk INR Test System; blood samples will also be used to optimise&#xD;
      manufacturing processes and verify the quality of Test Strip Lots.&#xD;
