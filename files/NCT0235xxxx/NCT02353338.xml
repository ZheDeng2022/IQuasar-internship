      Background: Wrist fractures are a common injury among people aged 55-70. The radius is one of&#xD;
      the bones making up the wrist joint, and is typically the site of injury in a broken wrist.&#xD;
      Methods of treating a broken radius include placing the wrist in a cast for 6 weeks&#xD;
      (conservative management) or receiving surgery. Surgery allows for earlier movement of the&#xD;
      wrist and return to activity, while being placed in a cast is less invasive than surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery to fix these fractures has become more common; however there is little agreement&#xD;
      about who should receive surgery and who should be placed in a cast to heal. The goal of this&#xD;
      study is to compare outcomes between people aged 55-70 who have broken their wrist and had&#xD;
      surgery, and those who received a cast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of two study groups&#xD;
      within 1 week of injury at their first clinic visit with the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Group A (surgical management) will continue with casting for a total of 6 weeks,&#xD;
      as indicated by the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Group B (conservative management) will receive surgery, and the attending surgeon&#xD;
      will determine the best fracture fixation method for the wrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research coordinator will assess the injured wrist at 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months after&#xD;
      the initial injury. At each assessment, the wrist will be examined and participants will be&#xD;
      asked to fill in some questionnaires about health, pain, wrist function, and satisfaction&#xD;
      with the wrist. An X-ray will also be performed on the wrist to assess bone healing.&#xD;
      Information from each visit will be used to determine how participants are doing and to&#xD;
      compare the 2 study groups.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distal radius fractures (DRF) are the most common upper extremity fractures in late&#xD;
      middle-aged patients. This injury creates significant disability rendering a person without&#xD;
      full use of the affected hand and wrist for 6 weeks or more with potential long-term&#xD;
      consequences of post-traumatic wrist arthritis and contracture. Over the past 20 years,&#xD;
      surgical management of DRF has increased substantially. Despite the frequency of these&#xD;
      fractures, there is little comparative evidence to guide surgical decision-making for this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although surgical management improves radiographic outcomes, it does not appear that&#xD;
      radiographic outcomes correlate well with patient reported outcomes (pain and function). As&#xD;
      there are significant health resource implications of surgical versus conservative&#xD;
      management, it is imperative that we determine when operative fixation is needed. Further, as&#xD;
      our population is aging, the number of patients with DRF will increase substantially in the&#xD;
      late to middle-aged and elderly adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects under 55 years of age, surgical management is often undertaken to allow early&#xD;
      mobility and facilitate return to work and activity, even in the presence of equivocal&#xD;
      clinical outcomes between management approaches. Conversely, in those who are older than 70&#xD;
      years, conservative management is more common due to lower patient demands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons issued clinical practice guidelines that&#xD;
      could not make evidence based treatment recommendations for patients aged 55 to 70 years with&#xD;
      DRFs. Thus, there is no current available evidence comparing patient outcomes between&#xD;
      surgical and conservative management in this age group. The overall goal of RIST will be to&#xD;
      compare outcomes between patients aged 55-70 years who receive surgical or conservative&#xD;
      management. Our primary outcome will be a clinical measure (patient-reported or&#xD;
      performance-based) rather than radiographic alignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because evidence focused around this age group is sparse, we will first conduct a pilot trial&#xD;
      to clarify eligibility criteria, outcome measure selection, sample size requirements, and&#xD;
      recruitment and retention rates. In 2013, 610 patients aged 55-70 years with DRFs were seen&#xD;
      in Edmonton emergency departments and 314 inpatients aged 55-70 years with DRFs were&#xD;
      discharged from all hospitals in the greater Edmonton area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To determine the feasibility of conducting a definitive RCT comparing&#xD;
      surgical versus conservative management in 55-70 year old patients with DRF. This study will&#xD;
      examine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment and eligibility rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment fidelity (the ability to deliver the intervention in the way that it was&#xD;
           intended) through measurement of patient crossovers from non-operative management to&#xD;
           operative fixation within the first year of fracture&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Outcomes and outcome measures to determine most appropriate measure and sample size&#xD;
           required&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Retention rate at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: To compare clinical and radiographic outcomes of surgical and&#xD;
      conservative management for 55-70 year old patients with DRF over the first year&#xD;
      post-fracture using:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) Questionnaire - currently deemed primary outcome&#xD;
           measure&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient satisfaction regarding cosmesis using a visual analogue scale (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Grip strength using a hand-held dynamometer&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Wrist Range of Motion (ROM) using standardized goniometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Radiographic measures (dorsal angulation, ulnar shortening, articular steps and gaps.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Parallel RCT with stratification by surgeon using computer generated unequal&#xD;
      randomization blocks. Following screening, consent and baseline evaluation, the research&#xD;
      coordinator will open sequentially numbered envelopes assigned to the treating surgeon.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to operative fixation or cast treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection Criteria: This pilot RCT will enroll 55 to 70 year old subjects with isolated&#xD;
      intra- or extra-articular displaced DRFs who present to the Sturgeon Community Hospital (SCH)&#xD;
      for medical care under 1 of 5 fellowship-trained upper-extremity orthopaedic surgeons.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will present with the following radiographic findings before reduction:&#xD;
      dorsal angulation ≤20 degrees, ulnar shortening ≤5 mm relative to the contralateral side&#xD;
      (subjects will have contralateral wrist xrays), articular step ≤2 mm after initial post&#xD;
      reduction and gap ≤5 mm. These parameters were chosen as they meet accepted criteria for&#xD;
      distal radius fracture instability, but are still correctable by osteotomy if the fracture&#xD;
      heals with this degree of mal-alignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with volar Barton fractures, radiocarpal subluxation or dislocation, open fractures,&#xD;
      ipsilateral upper extremity injuries, bilateral fractures or multiple traumas will be&#xD;
      excluded. Those with previous injury or fracture to the contralateral wrist, or those not fit&#xD;
      for surgical management will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Enrollment: Patients will be screened for study eligibility at their initial&#xD;
      clinic visit by the attending surgeon and research coordinator within 1 week of injury. The&#xD;
      Research Coordinator will track reasons for refusal from patients who do not consent to&#xD;
      participate as well as exclusions by the surgeons based on patient or fracture&#xD;
      characteristics. Those patients who agree to participate will be consented and enrolled by&#xD;
      the Research Coordinator. The baseline evaluation will consist of completion of a&#xD;
      demographics/screening form form (age, gender, mechanism of injury, past and current medical&#xD;
      status, work and activity demands) and PRWE and DASH questionnaires. All data will be&#xD;
      collected using standardized forms and entered into a password-protected database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Following the baseline evaluation, the subject will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either surgical or conservative management. Those with conservative management will continue&#xD;
      with casting for a total of 6 weeks. For those randomized to operative fixation, the&#xD;
      attending surgeon will determine the optimal fracture fixation method for the fracture&#xD;
      pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each follow-up visit, the surgeon, in conjunction with the patient, will evaluate outcomes&#xD;
      in the conservatively managed group to determine if corrective osteotomy is indicated based&#xD;
      on the patient's pain, weakness and acceptance of clinical deformity. If a corrective&#xD;
      osteotomy is required at any time point in the study, this will be considered as failure of&#xD;
      non-operative treatment. This approach is being used in the feasibility trial to assess the&#xD;
      current selection criteria to determine if they require revision prior to the definitive RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Evaluations: Two weeks after randomization, the research coordinator will contact&#xD;
      participants by telephone to complete the PRWE and Dash questionnaires, and ask about any&#xD;
      complications related to their injury. Participants will return to clinical follow-up at 6&#xD;
      weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months at the SCH using the same validated measures.&#xD;
      Starting at the 6 week assessment, wrist ROM (flexion, extension, pronation, supination,&#xD;
      ulnar and radial deviation) using a goniometer and grip strength using a hand-held&#xD;
      dynamometer will also be evaluated by the research coordinator. Radiographic evaluation of&#xD;
      dorsal angulation, ulnar shortening, articular steps and gaps and complications and adverse&#xD;
      events will also be recorded at each visit. At 1-year follow-up, patient satisfaction with&#xD;
      their clinical outcome will be assessed using a PRWE and DASH questionnaires and a VAS for&#xD;
      determining satisfaction with wrist cosmesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and Outcome Measures: Although radiographic parameters will be collected and&#xD;
      measured, the primary outcomes will be the clinical measures: patient-reported wrist specific&#xD;
      outcomes (PRWE), patient reported upper extremity function (DASH) and wrist ROM and grip&#xD;
      strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) Questionnaire - The PRWE is a brief, reliable and&#xD;
           valid 15-item tool used to assess patient-rated wrist pain and disability during&#xD;
           activities of daily living. Subjects rate their pain and function from 0-10 in two&#xD;
           different subscales: pain subscale and function subscale. The minimally clinically&#xD;
           important difference (MCID) for the PRWE is 17 points on a 0-100 score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Questionnaire - The DASH is a valid&#xD;
           and reliable 30-item scale that assess physical function and symptoms in subjects with&#xD;
           upper limb musculoskeletal issues. It has three modules: disability and symptom&#xD;
           (mandatory), work (optional) and sports/performing arts (optional). The MCID for the&#xD;
           DASH is 13 points on a 0-100 score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient satisfaction - Patient satisfaction with their outcome is in part being answered&#xD;
           with the PRWE and DASH questionnaires, since both assess pain and function. However,&#xD;
           because we are comparing surgical versus conservative treatment, it is also important to&#xD;
           evaluate how satisfied the subjects are with the cosmesis of their wrist after&#xD;
           treatment. Conservative treatment may leave a mal-aligned wrist and surgical treatment&#xD;
           will leave scars and the acceptability of either may affect the willingness of the&#xD;
           subject to agree with either treatment choice. Therefore, we will use a visual analogue&#xD;
           scale to measure how satisfied the subject is with the cosmesis of the wrist after&#xD;
           treatment (0- not satisfied at all to 10- completely satisfied).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Grip strength - Peak values of grip strength in both hands will be measured with a&#xD;
           hand-held dynamometer. Absolute values and percentage of their contralateral side will&#xD;
           be compared between the two groups. The MCID for grip strength after DRF is 6.5&#xD;
           kilograms or 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Wrist Range of Motion (ROM) - Active and passive ROM of wrist flexion, extension, ulnar&#xD;
           deviation, radial deviation, pronation and supination will be assessed using goniometry.&#xD;
           Absolute values and percentage of their contralateral side will be compared between&#xD;
           groups. No MCID have been established for wrist ROM, so we will evaluate differences in&#xD;
           ROM and correlate those with both grip strength and patient reported outcomes to&#xD;
           determine what differences in ROM appear to affect outcomes, if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Radiographic Parameters: Dorsal angulation, ulnar shortening, articular steps and gaps&#xD;
           will be measured at initial presentation and when fracture is healed (6 weeks) and at&#xD;
           the end of the study period (12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: For this feasibility trial, 50 participants (25/group) will be enrolled. This&#xD;
      will allow us to assess subject recruitment, treatment fidelity and retention. Based on our&#xD;
      findings, we will refine our selection criteria as necessary for the definitive RCT. This&#xD;
      pilot evaluation will provide for calculation of the sample size for the definitive RCT based&#xD;
      on confirmation of the primary outcome measure. Although 50 participants will likely be&#xD;
      inadequate to detect significant group differences, it should be adequate to determine if&#xD;
      MCID occur in clinical outcomes between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: The analysis of this feasibility component of the RIST trial will be 2-pronged to&#xD;
      prepare for the definitive RCT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Process Evaluation: This process evaluation will be a descriptive analysis that will&#xD;
           assist us in refining eligibility criteria, recruitment rates, treatment fidelity and&#xD;
           determine study timelines prior to undertaking a large scale RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruitment, enrollment and retention rates: All 55-70 year old DRF patients presenting&#xD;
           at the SCH will be screened so that eligibility, recruitment and retention rates can be&#xD;
           assessed. We will also evaluate recruitment methods to determine the proportion of&#xD;
           patients 1) willing to participate and 2) appropriate for randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment Fidelity: We will assess failure of allocation to treatment by examining the&#xD;
           numbers of patients that withdraw post randomization or cross over to surgical&#xD;
           management within the first post-fracture year. This will determine if selection&#xD;
           criteria require further refinement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Evaluation: Our secondary objective is to compare outcomes between randomized&#xD;
      groups. T-tests and repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used with&#xD;
      continuous variables and chi square tests will be performed on categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Selection: We believe that the PRWE will be the most responsive measure as it is&#xD;
      patient-reported wrist specific pain and function. However, we will also evaluate the DASH,&#xD;
      cosmesis satisfaction (VAS) and the performance-based measures of grip strength and wrist&#xD;
      ROM. Radiographic parameters will not be considered as primary outcomes because previous work&#xD;
      has suggested the clinical and radiographic parameters are not well-correlated in DRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation: The intervention analysis will also allow us to determine if we&#xD;
      should perform a superiority or inferiority RCT. If there are no MCID detected in the pilot&#xD;
      study (expected), the definitive RCT will be powered as a non-inferiority trial (i.e. similar&#xD;
      clinical outcomes can be achieved with surgical or conservative management in this age&#xD;
      group). If MCID are found in clinical measures, the definitive RCT will be powered as a&#xD;
      superiority trial (e.g. surgical fixation is better than conservative treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcome: This proposed pilot study is important for assessing the feasibility of&#xD;
      conducting a definitive RCT so that potential challenges can be addressed prior to commencing&#xD;
      the larger-scale trial. The pilot data generated will be used to develop a grant proposal for&#xD;
      an adequately-powered definitive RCT. However, we believe that the pilot study will be&#xD;
      appropriate for presentation and publication in a peer-reviewed journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RIST pilot and ensuing RCT will lead to improved management of wrist fractures and will&#xD;
      address a gap in the current evidence base. The level 1 evidence generated from the&#xD;
      definitive RCT will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and&#xD;
      international meetings.&#xD;
