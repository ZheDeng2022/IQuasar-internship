      Part 1 (Phase 1): safety and tolerability of bevacizumab-Niraparib combination Part 2&#xD;
      (Randomized Phase 2): to compare Progression-Free Survival (PFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARP inhibitors are active as monotherapy to treat patients with recurrent ovarian cancer;&#xD;
      the strongest activity being observed in the platinum sensitive, gBRCAmut subgroup as well as&#xD;
      in gBRCAwt, HRD population but also in HRD negative disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the same population there is level one evidence that bevacizumab is beneficial. And a&#xD;
      phase two randomized study has indicated that combination of a PARP inhibitor with&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic drug is superior to PARP inhibitor alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is niraparib combined with bevacizumab superior to niraparib? The comparison of tolerability&#xD;
      and efficacy of niraparib-bevacizumab combination against niraparib.&#xD;

      Part 1: This is a single-centre, phase 1a, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of bevacizumab-niraparib combination and determine the RP2D in&#xD;
      patients with platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard 3+3 design will be used. Part 2: (n=94) This multicenter, prospective,&#xD;
      open-label, randomized phase 2 study is evaluating the efficacy of niraparib against&#xD;
      niraparib-bevacizumab combination in Women with platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian,&#xD;
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification: Patients are stratified according to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. HRD status (positive/negative)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment-Free interval to prior therapy (6-12 months &gt; 12 months) Randomization: 1:1&#xD;
           randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study arms: Patients are randomized to one of the two treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Niraparib monotherapy until progression. Arm 2: Niraparib-bevacizumab combination&#xD;
      therapy until progression.&#xD;
