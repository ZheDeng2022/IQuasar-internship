      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of irreversible&#xD;
      electroporation for unresectable Hepatic carcinoma in poor liver function, also Progress Free&#xD;
      Survival (PFS) and Over Survival (OS) will be recorded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic carcinoma is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and a large proportion of&#xD;
      patients are unsuitable for tumor resection because of factors such as poor hepatic&#xD;
      reserve(cirrhosis) which directly lead a poor liver function. Direct ablative treatments&#xD;
      include radiofrequency ablation, microwave (MW) ablation and cryotherapy and irreversible&#xD;
      electroporation had been used successful as a therapeutic choice for unresectable patients.&#xD;
      At the same time，Irreversible electroporation(IRE)，which was applied with a novel ablation&#xD;
      technology, can induce tissue necross by utilizing short pulses of high-voltage electrical&#xD;
      energy. The technique also had many advantages, including Short ablation time, preservation&#xD;
      of vital structures within IRE-ablated zone, avoidance of heat/cold-sink effect, complete&#xD;
      ablation with well-demarcated margin and real-time monitoring of IRE ablation.&#xD;
