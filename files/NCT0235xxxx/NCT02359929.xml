  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects in this study have had an allogeneic (blood or marrow cells from another person)&#xD;
      blood or marrow transplant to treat leukemia, lymphoma or other cancer of the blood, and have&#xD;
      now developed Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) that is not responding to standard treatment.&#xD;
      GVHD is when the graft (transplanted bone marrow or blood) attacks the recipient's body. GVHD&#xD;
      occurs early after transplant (acute) and/or sometimes months after transplant (chronic).&#xD;
      Both forms can be life threatening; chronic GVHD can be a lifelong disabling condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) exist in tissues throughout the body. One place they are&#xD;
      found is in the bone marrow and from here they can be obtained by needle aspiration, the same&#xD;
      way bone marrow samples are obtained to test for leukemia. This study uses autologous MSCs&#xD;
      obtained from the recipient with acute and/or chronic GVHD, which have a lower chance of&#xD;
      being rejected. These MSCs may promote tolerance, helping the donor immune cells accept the&#xD;
      recipient's body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is being conducted as a step toward testing the long-term hypothesis that freshly&#xD;
      cultured autologous MSC grown in platelet lysate-containing medium will modulate donor T-cell&#xD;
      immune responses and reduce GVHD in allo-HSCT recipients. As a phase I dose escalation trial&#xD;
      of autologous MSC in patients with acute and chronic GVHD, the main aim is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety of this therapy and its effects on GVHD biomarkers and T-cell phenotype&#xD;

      EPIC MSC2014-002 solution- Autologous Mesenchymal Stromal Cells expanded using pooled human&#xD;
      platelet lysate,is made up of autologous marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells ex vivo&#xD;
      expanded numerically for approximately 14 days using pooled human Platelet Lysate (phPL),&#xD;
      harvested from culture on the day of infusion and suspended at a concentration of 4 million&#xD;
      cells/ml in Plasmalyte A with 0.5% human serum albumin. This is a phase I dose-escalation,&#xD;
      open label, non-randomized, non-placebo controlled, single group assignment study to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of EPIC MSC2014-002. The product will be infused intravenously&#xD;
      and will be administered at one of three dose levels: (Dose level 1): Single Cell infusion 2&#xD;
      x 10^6 cells/kg, (Dose Level 2): Two weekly Cell infusions 2 x 10^6 cells/kg , (Dose level&#xD;
      3): Four weekly Cell infusion 2 x 10^6 cells/kg. This Phase I clinical trial will enroll&#xD;
      12-24 subjects with acute or chronic GVHD. The duration of this study for each patient is 1&#xD;
      year. The investigators anticipate that this study will be completed within 3 years of&#xD;
      commencement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of infusing escalating doses of autologous MSCs&#xD;
           for patients with acute or chronic GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the overall response rate of acute and chronic GVHD to autologous MSC&#xD;
           infusion. These data will be used to plan future, larger clinical trials to evaluate the&#xD;
           efficacy of autologous MSCs for the treatment of GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effect of MSC infusion on lymphocyte phenotype, inflammatory biomarkers&#xD;
           and GVHD specific biomarker levels&#xD;
