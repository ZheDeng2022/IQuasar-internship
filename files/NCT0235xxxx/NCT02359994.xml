  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, multidisciplinary, controlled clinical investigation&#xD;
      evaluating the safety and efficacy of PerClot in achieving intraoperative hemostasis compared&#xD;
      to a similar marketed hemostatic device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three hundred and twenty four subjects across a maximum of 25 investigational sites&#xD;
      undergoing open elective cardiac, general, or urological surgical procedures who meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be intraoperatively randomized to receive no more than the entire&#xD;
      contents of up to two 5 gram bellows of either the investigational device or a control&#xD;
      hemostatic agent on a bleeding site, whose anatomic site is smaller than or equal to 25cm²&#xD;
      and whose anatomic application site is smaller than or equal to 47cm², when bleeding is&#xD;
      within the pre-defined bleeding severity range after any applicable conventional means for&#xD;
      hemostasis are attempted as specified in the intraoperative procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each investigational site is expected to enroll approximately 13-40 subjects. All&#xD;
      investigational sites will be located in the U.S. Follow-up will occur at hospital discharge&#xD;
      and 6 weeks post-device application. For oncologic subjects, an additional follow up will&#xD;
      occur at 24 months post device application.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this clinical investigation is to demonstrate non-inferiority in the achievement of hemostasis of the treated bleeding site at 7 minutes in subjects receiving PerClot compared to those receiving a control hemostatic device. The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects achieving hemostasis of the treated lesion at 7 minutes in each treatment group.</description>

    <description>The secondary objective of this investigation is to compare the achievement of hemostasis of the treated bleeding site at 5 minutes for subjects receiving PerClot compared to those receiving a control hemostatic device. The secondary endpoint is the proportion of subjects achieving hemostasis of the treated bleeding site at 5 minutes in each treatment group.</description>

    <description>For cardiac procedures, the site of evaluation for satisfaction of intraoperative eligibility criteria will be any bleeding sites on the epicardium, along an aortic anastomotic suture line, or an aortotomy suture line. For example, the surgeon will perform dissection of adhesions per his or her conventional methods and bleeding will be controlled using means continually employed by the surgeon prior to surgical closure. Prior to application along an aortic anastomotic suture line or an aortotomy suture line, suture line gaps &gt; 2mm and large needle holes &gt; 2mm will be ligated prior to assessment of intraoperative eligibility criteria. Any bleeding site on the epicardium, or along an aortic anastomotic suture line, or an aortotomy suture line meeting the eligibility criteria will be evaluated for satisfaction. PerClot should be applied after drug reversal and the patient is taken off by-pass.</description>

    <description>For liver resection procedures, the resected liver surface will be the site of evaluation. The surgeon will perform resection of the diseased portion of the liver per his/her conventional methods. Bleeding from discrete vessels will be controlled using means conventionally employed by the surgeon. Vessels &gt; 2mm in diameter will be ligated and any observed bile leaks controlled prior to assessment of intraoperative eligibility criteria.&#xD;
For total splenectomy procedures, the site of evaluation for satisfaction of the intraoperative eligibility criteria will be the retroperitoneal surface. The surgeon will perform the splenectomy per his/her conventional methods. Vessels &gt; 2mm in diameter will be ligated prior to assessment of intraoperative eligibility criteria.&#xD;
Any bleeding site on the retroperitoneal surface/cavity or exposed parenchymal surface will be evaluated for satisfaction of the eligibility criteria.</description>

    <description>For on-clamp partial nephrectomies, the site of evaluation will be the kidney bed surface. The surgeon will perform resection of the kidney per his or her conventional methods. Vessels &gt; 2mm in diameter will be ligated and entries into the collecting system controlled prior to assessment of intraoperative eligibility criteria. Any bleeding site on the kidney bed will be evaluated for satisfaction of the eligibility criteria after clamp release.&#xD;
For radical nephrectomies, the site of evaluation will be the retroperitoneal surface/cavity. The surgeon will perform the procedure per his or her conventional methods. Vessels &gt; 2mm in diameter will be ligated prior to assessment of intraoperative eligibility criteria. Any bleeding site on the retroperitoneal surface/cavity will be evaluated for satisfaction of the eligibility criteria.</description>
