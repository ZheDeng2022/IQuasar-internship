      Bleaching protocol In each session, volunteers received prophylaxis with pumice powder and&#xD;
      water. Then, gingival tissue was protected using a light-cured resin gum barrier applied&#xD;
      according to the manufacturer's instructions (Lase Protect - DMC, São Carlos, SP, Brazil).&#xD;
      Both bleaching agents were prepared by mixing hydrogen peroxide and thickening compounds&#xD;
      according to the manufacturer's instructions (with 3 peroxide drops for 1 drop of thickener).&#xD;
      The resultant gels were distributed uniformly on the upper hemiarcade surfaces of the teeth.&#xD;
      A total of 8 teeth between the first premolars were bleached for each patient. In each&#xD;
      bleaching session, the bleaching gels were applied twice for 12 minutes each. In each&#xD;
      application, the surface of the gel was light activated with continuous irradiance for 12&#xD;
      minutes using LED/laser light with a total power of 1800 mW (Whitening Lase Plus - DMC&#xD;
      Equipamentos, São Carlos, SP, Brazil). Three bleaching sessions were completed for the&#xD;
      patients, and the interval between sessions was 7 days&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, triple-blinded (patients, evaluator, and statistician), and&#xD;
      split-mouth design (one hemiarcade was treated by 1 compound) following nonprobability&#xD;
      sampling. The patients were invited to participate in the study through posters posted around&#xD;
      the city or recruited from participants in other studies in the same department, who were&#xD;
      contacted by email or phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 131 patients were examined in a dental chair to check if they met the inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria. The patients included in this study were over 18 years old and&#xD;
      selected with the following inclusion criteria: anterior teeth without restorations, previous&#xD;
      bleaching procedures, cervical lesions, or dental pain. Patients who were pregnant or&#xD;
      lactating, had moderate or severe fluorosis, tetracycline stains, orthodontic treatment,&#xD;
      periodontal disease, orofacial tumors, trauma, or tooth malformation, or were taking&#xD;
      analgesic, anti-inflammatory, or antibiotic drugs were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two trained operators (restorative dentistry professors) performed the bleaching treatments.&#xD;
      A third participant that did not have contact with the patients was responsible for&#xD;
      conducting the randomization. The allocation of the hemiarcade in the groups was performed by&#xD;
      random drawing using Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA) from coding&#xD;
      assigned to each participant. There were two experimental groups: Group A acted as a control,&#xD;
      and hydrogen peroxide whitening compound was applied at a concentration of 35% to the upper&#xD;
      hemiarcade. Group B was the experimental group, in which the other upper hemiarcade was&#xD;
      treated with 6% compound catalyzed by titanium oxide nanoparticles and activated by blue&#xD;
      hybrid light and an infrared laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distribution of the operators was made by block randomization. To ensure triple blinding,&#xD;
      the following procedures were adopted: 1) labels, logos, packaging, and any other aspect that&#xD;
      could identify the products were removed, and procedures and instruments were standardized;&#xD;
      2) the bleaching protocol was performed in a different room from where the evaluator examined&#xD;
      the patients; 3) the randomization was alpha-numerically coded to ensure blinding of the&#xD;
      research team; and 5) a statistician received data tabulated in code that did not allow for&#xD;
      identification of the treatment applied to each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation The primary outcome of this study was the efficacy determined by&#xD;
      color alteration (ΔE). Previous studies showed that the use of in-office bleaching agent&#xD;
      containing 35% hydrogen peroxide (HP35) with or without LED/Laser light leads to a ΔE value&#xD;
      of 7.0-2.0 after two bleaching sessions. In order to have an 80% chance of detecting&#xD;
      significance at the level of 5%, and considering an increase in the primary outcome measure&#xD;
      from 7 in the control group to 5 in the experimental group, a minimum of 16 participants&#xD;
      would be required in each group. Due to a higher dropout rate in the last two clinical&#xD;
      studies of our research group, we decided to add 80% more patients, which led to 30 patients&#xD;
      in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleaching protocol In each session, volunteers received prophylaxis with pumice powder and&#xD;
      water. Then, gingival tissue was protected using a light-cured resin gum barrier applied&#xD;
      according to the manufacturer's instructions (Lase Protect - DMC, São Carlos, SP, Brazil).&#xD;
      Both bleaching agents were prepared by mixing hydrogen peroxide and thickening compounds&#xD;
      according to the manufacturer's instructions (with 3 peroxide drops for 1 drop of thickener).&#xD;
      The resultant gels were distributed uniformly on the upper hemiarcade surfaces of the teeth.&#xD;
      A total of 8 teeth between the first premolars were bleached for each patient. In each&#xD;
      bleaching session, the bleaching gels were applied twice for 12 minutes each. In each&#xD;
      application, the surface of the gel was light activated with continuous irradiance for 12&#xD;
      minutes using LED/laser light with a total power of 1800 mW (Whitening Lase Plus - DMC&#xD;
      Equipamentos, São Carlos, SP, Brazil). Three bleaching sessions were completed for the&#xD;
      patients, and the interval between sessions was 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy evaluation (E) Objective evaluation Two calibrated evaluators (Kappa=0.85) were used&#xD;
      to measure the tooth color for the baseline (T0), immediately after the first (T1), second&#xD;
      (T2), and third sessions (T3), and one week (T4) and one month after the third session (T5).&#xD;
      The color evaluation was obtained from an area of 6 mm located in the middle third of the&#xD;
      labial surface of the left and right central incisors. To standardize this evaluation, an&#xD;
      impression of the maxillary arch was taken to make a guide using high-putty silicone&#xD;
      (Zetaplus, Zhermack, Badia Polesine, Rovigo, Italy). A window was created on the labial&#xD;
      surface in the middle third of the central incisor using a device with well-formed borders&#xD;
      and a 3-mm radius corresponding to the reflectance of the spectrophotometer (Vita EasyShade&#xD;
      Compact, VITA Zahnfabrik, Bad Säckingen, Germany). The shade was determined using the&#xD;
      obtained parameters L*, a*, and b*. The color alteration after each session was given by the&#xD;
      differences between the values obtained at the session and the baseline (∆E). ∆E was&#xD;
      calculated using the following formula: ΔE = [(ΔL*)2 + (Δa*)2 + (Δb*)2]1/2 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective evaluation For the subjective evaluation, the 16 tabs of the shade guide (Vita&#xD;
      Classic, Vita Zahnfabrik) were arranged from the highest (B1) to the lowest (C4) value.&#xD;
      Although this scale is not linear in the truest sense, we treated the changes as continuous&#xD;
      with a linear ranking, as was done in several clinical trials of dental bleaching. Two&#xD;
      calibrated evaluators (Kappa=0.85) recorded the shade of the upper central left and right&#xD;
      incisors at baseline with the same periods as the objective evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We checked the color in the middle third area of the labial surface of the anterior central&#xD;
      incisor according to the American Dental Association guidelines. We calculated the color&#xD;
      changes from the beginning of the active phase through the individual recall times by the&#xD;
      change in the number of shade guide units (ΔSGU), which occurred toward the lighter end of&#xD;
      the value-oriented list of shade tabs. In the event that the operators disagreed on color&#xD;
      matching, a consensus was reached prior to dismissing the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tooth sensitivity evaluation (S) Tooth sensitivity was characterized by the variables&#xD;
      occurrence, intensity, and type. These data were obtained by self-completed form and clinical&#xD;
      evaluation during the session and immediately by VAS (Visual Analogue Scale). For the VAS, we&#xD;
      instructed the participants to place a line perpendicular to a 10-mm-long line with zero at&#xD;
      one end indicating ''no TS'' and the other end indicating ''unbearable TS.'' The occurrence&#xD;
      was analyzed according to whether sensitivity was reported. The intensity was measured at&#xD;
      four levels according to a verbal scale: 1=none, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=considerable, and&#xD;
      5=severe. The volunteers were instructed to fill out a form for each bleaching session and&#xD;
      for the following days between sessions in case of sensitivity in any of the bleached teeth&#xD;
      at any time.&#xD;
