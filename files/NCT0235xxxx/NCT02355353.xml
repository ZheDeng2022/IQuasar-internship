  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to correlate the percentage change in apparent&#xD;
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) between baseline and early therapy (at day 14) with tumor&#xD;
      regression grade (TRG) measured in the surgical resection specimen.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm imaging trial. Patients with resectable liver&#xD;
      metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) will undergo Diffusion Weighted Imaging- Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (DWI-MRI) scans at least at three separate occasions: at baseline, at 14&#xD;
      days (maximum +/- 1 days deviation is acceptable) after first administration of chemotherapy&#xD;
      and finally after up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy (one week prior to surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients registered in the study may participate to the test-retest analysis. This&#xD;
      analysis required a double baseline scans (called test-retest) to be done on two separate&#xD;
      occasions, separated from each other by from one hour to one week but both before start of&#xD;
      therapy. The repeated scan at baseline (retest) is optional as it will be used only for the&#xD;
      test-retest repeatability analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dedicated in-house developed software will be used to quantify ADC to assess tumor&#xD;
      characteristics and response to therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically proven CRC with metachronous or synchronous liver metastases considered&#xD;
             to be completely upfront resectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with at least one measurable liver lesion (&gt; 2 cm), measured by contrast CT&#xD;
             or MRI at baseline. At least one liver metastasis should be clearly identified and&#xD;
             provide a high likelihood of successful resection in the later surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be 18 years old or older.&#xD;

             months before inclusion in this study.&#xD;
