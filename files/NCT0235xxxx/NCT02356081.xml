  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy may cause distressing symptoms which can impact on patients' quality of life.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy is frequently given on an outpatient basis therefore patients are often required&#xD;
      to manage the symptoms they experience at home without direct supervision from healthcare&#xD;
      professionals. This study aims to evaluate the impact of a mobile phone based, remote&#xD;
      monitoring, symptom management system (ASyMS) on the delivery of care to people with&#xD;
      nonmetastatic breast, colorectal or haematological cancer during chemotherapy and for one&#xD;
      year following treatment. The study aims to compare a number of outcomes of patients using&#xD;
      the ASyMS intervention with outcomes of patients who receive normal care at their hospital.&#xD;
      For up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy treatment, once a day and any other time they feel unwell,&#xD;
      patients allocated to the mobile phone group will enter information on the phone regarding&#xD;
      any symptoms they are experiencing, take their temperature and enter this on the phone. The&#xD;
      information is sent via secure connection to a computer, which assesses the information and&#xD;
      sends an alert to their health care professional in the hospital, who will call the patient&#xD;
      at home if the patient has reported problematic symptoms. Patients in the normal care group&#xD;
      will receive care as normal at their hospital. Both groups of patients will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a series of questionnaires before they start treatment, after each chemotherapy&#xD;
      cycle (for a maximum of 6 cycles) and at 3 monthly intervals for up to one year thereafter (a&#xD;
      subset of patients will also be asked to complete midcycle symptom assessments). The study&#xD;
      will also evaluate the cost benefit of ASyMS, assess changes in clinical practice as a result&#xD;
      of ASyMS and develop a predictive risk model (statistical model) for use in future care of&#xD;
      patients receiving chemotherapy for these cancers. This multicentre study is taking place&#xD;
      across a number of European countries.&#xD;
