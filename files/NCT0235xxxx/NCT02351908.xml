  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe the safety of Truvada® (TDF/FTC) in relation to its&#xD;
      impact on kidney function combined with different Integrase Inhibitors (Dolutegravir, or&#xD;
      Elvitegravir/Cobicistat or Raltegravir), when given to patients who are commencing treatment&#xD;
      for HIV infection for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All three combinations (Raltegravir + Truvada®, Dolutegravir + Truvada® and Stribild®, a&#xD;
      single pill which contains Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Truvada®) are currently recommended by the&#xD;
      national guide-lines and used in standard clinical practice.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will monitor kidney function, and compare the safety and effectiveness of Truvada®&#xD;
      when taken with Dolutegravir, or Elvitegravir/Cobicistat or Raltegravir, over the first 48&#xD;
      weeks of treatment in HIV-1 antiretrovirals naïve patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and how well these drug combinations are tolerated will be determined based on&#xD;
      physical examinations, laboratory tests, and questions about any problems the participant&#xD;
      might experience during the study. As part of this trial, levels of HIV-1 in the blood and&#xD;
      urinary markers of kidney function and inflammatory markers will be measured at various times&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of participant involvement in the trial will be up to 48 weeks, with up to&#xD;
      45 days between the screening and baseline visits. Participants will need to visit the clinic&#xD;
      6 times within the 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants have been confirmed to be eligible to participate in the study,&#xD;
      participants will attend for a baseline visit (day 1) where they will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive one of the three treatments listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Arm 1: Stribild® (EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF) 1 tablet once a day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Arm 2: Isentress® (Raltegravir 400 mg) 1 tablet twice a day + Truvada® 1&#xD;
           tablet once a day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Arm 3: Tivicay® (Dolutegravir 50 mg) 1 tablet once a day + Truvada® 1 tablet&#xD;
           once a day&#xD;
