      Patients with cirrhosis present complex coagulation defects. Conventional coagulation tests&#xD;
      (INR, platelets count) can not predict bleeding or blood product requirements during liver&#xD;
      transplantation. Thromboelastometry (TEM)analyser measures the viscoelastic of the whole&#xD;
      blood coagulation generation and lysis. TEM results are available more rapidly than&#xD;
      conventional tests and give additional information regarding coagulation strengh, platelet&#xD;
      function, and fibrinolysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Historically, orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has been associated with major blood&#xD;
      loss and the need for massive blood product transfusion . The cause of bleeding during OLT is&#xD;
      multifactorial . The extensive surgical trauma plays a major role in the origin of bleeding.&#xD;
      This bleeding can be accelerated by defects of the hemostatic system. Hemostatic defects can&#xD;
      be divided into those present before the operation and those originating during the surgery.&#xD;
      The latter can be classified according to the 3 main systems of hemostasis: coagulation,&#xD;
      platelet function, and fibrinolysis. Hyperfibrinolysis is an important cause of non surgical&#xD;
      bleeding during OLT .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant decrease in blood loss and blood product requirements has been observed during&#xD;
      OLT over the past 10 years . This decrease can be explained by increase experience,&#xD;
      improvements in surgical and anesthetic techniques, and a better understanding of the various&#xD;
      hemostatic abnormalities encountered during OLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 10 years ago, Reyle-Hahn and Rossaint and Dupont et al stated that it is not&#xD;
      necessary to correct coagulation defects before the anhepatic phase. More recently, some&#xD;
      authors have a poor correlation between bleeding and the peripheral indices of coagulation in&#xD;
      patients with chronic liver disease . These patients with cirrhosis are investigated by means&#xD;
      of conventional tests for coagulation and primary hemostasis such as prothrombin time (INR),&#xD;
      activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), platelet count, and skin bleeding time. Two&#xD;
      important studies have raised serious questions about clinical use of INR in both measuring&#xD;
      liver disease prognosis and in estimating bleeding risk thus calling into question many&#xD;
      common and traditional clinical practices .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Now, it is cleat that conventional tests of coagulation (INR, platelet count, fibrinogen) are&#xD;
      not able to predict blood product transfusion requirements and bleeding during liver&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substantial body of evidence suggests that the use of blood products is associated with&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality . Because 33% of liver recipients had acquired their liver disease&#xD;
      through the transfusion of blood products , it is important to establish strategies aimed at&#xD;
      decreasing blood losses and consequently the need for transfusion. The ability to predict&#xD;
      intraoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements would be of great help to ensure&#xD;
      adequate blood products and to enable appropriate therapy for patients at high risk of&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ROTEM (TEM) thromboelastometry analyzer based on throboelastographic principles ,&#xD;
      measures the viscoelastic properties of whole blood coagulation generation and lysis. The&#xD;
      instrument provides important global hemostatic information about the&#xD;
      plasma-platelet-leucocyte interaction and clot tensile strength . TEM results are available&#xD;
      more rapidly than those from laboratory-based conventional coagulation testing and also&#xD;
      provide additional information regarding coagulation strength, platelet function, and&#xD;
      fibrinolysis. Kang et al 39 using thromboelastogram (TEG) showed a decrease in red blood&#xD;
      cells (RBC) use after the introduction of TEG monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ROTEM analysis includes plasmatic coagulation and fibrinolytic factors and inhibitors, as&#xD;
      well as all circulating blood cells and provides clinically important information about&#xD;
      quality of the final blood clot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this observational study was to determine if ROTEM parameters were able to predict&#xD;
      blood losses and transfusion of RBC during a liver transplantation.&#xD;
