      This is a single-blinded randomized control trial comparing the current perioperative care of&#xD;
      the investigators gynecologic oncology patients with a standardized perioperative &quot;enhanced&#xD;
      recovery&quot; pathway. Adult patients undergoing laparotomy by one of the gynecologic oncology&#xD;
      surgeons will be eligible to participate. The primary outcome will be length of&#xD;
      hospitalization including any days of readmission in the 30 days post-operatively. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will include 30-day readmission rate, complications, quality of recovery, and pain&#xD;
      control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to implement and evaluate an enhanced recovery pathway for&#xD;
      gynecologic surgery patients undergoing laparotomy and compare their outcomes to the current&#xD;
      standard of care perioperative management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients having a laparotomy for gynecologic disease have a shortened length of&#xD;
      hospitalization in the 30 days post-operatively when undergoing a perioperative enhanced&#xD;
      recovery protocol compared to the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized single-blinded control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes: Hospital days in first 30 days post-operatively (Length of stay of primary&#xD;
      hospitalization plus any days of readmission)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 30-day readmission rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Complications as assessed by the incidence of a composite of major complications and a&#xD;
           second composite of minor complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient reported quality of recovery and quality of life as determined by QoR-40 score&#xD;
           and RAND-36 score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pain control at assessed by daily mean pain scores (scale 0-10) as elicited and recorded&#xD;
           by nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women who meet inclusion criteria will be approached in the gynecologic oncology clinic&#xD;
      at the completion of their appointment. Eligible patients that agree to participate will be&#xD;
      provided written informed consent. The informed consent process will occur in a clinic exam&#xD;
      room. There will be no other recruitment methods or advertisements employed. Patients can&#xD;
      agree to participate at this time or at any time prior to their pre-operative teaching&#xD;
      appointment which is scheduled at some point between their initial surgical consult visit and&#xD;
      their surgery. The first study intervention will take place at their pre-operative teaching&#xD;
      appointment and so enrollment must occur prior to this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will occur at study entry. The participants will then be randomized to one of&#xD;
      two groups: &quot;standard care&quot; or &quot;enhanced recovery care.&quot; Randomization will be stratified by&#xD;
      disease type, age, and BMI. Given the longer length of hospitalization inherent in&#xD;
      ovarian/primary peritoneal cancer debulking surgery, the investigators want to stratify based&#xD;
      on the pre-operative suspected diagnosis in an attempt to balance these patients between&#xD;
      groups. Similarly, advanced age and increased BMI are risks factors for peri-operative&#xD;
      complications and increased length of hospitalizations and should be stratified between&#xD;
      groups. Within each stratum, randomization will be performed in blocks of 8 to ensure that&#xD;
      groups are balanced throughout the study in case recruitment goals are not reached. Two&#xD;
      hundred randomization assignments will be assigned to each stratum to ensure sufficient&#xD;
      assignments are available to each group in the event that more patients are recruited than&#xD;
      expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation will be revealed to the PI and the surgical team at the time of randomization.&#xD;
      This is necessary because the pre-operative counseling intervention for those patients in the&#xD;
      &quot;enhanced recovery&quot; intervention will need to occur at this time. Allocation will remain&#xD;
      concealed for the patient and for the members of the research team who are conducting the&#xD;
      post-discharge surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two survey instruments will be used to evaluate pre-operative and post-operative quality of&#xD;
      life as well as quality of recovery. The RAND-36 will be utilized as a pre-operative and 4&#xD;
      week post-operative assessment of health-related quality of life. This 36 item health-related&#xD;
      quality of life instrument includes eight dimensions: general health, physical functioning,&#xD;
      emotional wellbeing, social functioning, energy, pain, and physical and emotional role&#xD;
      functioning. While this is a generic assessment of quality of life and not designed to be&#xD;
      specific to surgical recovery-related quality of life, the investigators are including this&#xD;
      instrument in order to have a baseline health-related quality of life assessment of the&#xD;
      investigators patients and to allow for comparisons to other studies of perioperative&#xD;
      gynecology patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QoR-40 is a 40-question tool used to evaluate the quality of recovery. It incorporates 5&#xD;
      dimensions of health: patient support, comfort, emotions, physical independence, and pain.&#xD;
      The QoR40 is one of the most widely used measurements of patient-determined quality of&#xD;
      recovery. It has been extensively validated and has excellent reliability, responsiveness,&#xD;
      and clinical utility to a range of surgical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the RAND-36 and QoR-40 have been used to study post-operative recovery in women&#xD;
      undergoing gynecologic surgery and have been found to be valid. Furthermore, both surveys&#xD;
      have been validated for both self-administration and telephone administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Intervention Start of Study Interventions At their pre-operative teaching&#xD;
      appointment, all study participants will be asked to complete a health and quality of life&#xD;
      survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol-specific Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &quot;Standard of care&quot; group: Treating physicians will determine all aspects of patients'&#xD;
           perioperative care. Specifically, the individual surgeon, nurse, resident, fellow, and&#xD;
           anesthesiologist caring for the patient will determine the patients' pre-operative&#xD;
           counseling, bowel preparation, postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis, IV fluid&#xD;
           replacement, use of drains, timing of urinary catheter removal, mobilization,&#xD;
           post-operative nutrition, pain medication, and bowel stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &quot;Enhanced recovery&quot; group: Aspects of perioperative care will be standardized in terms&#xD;
           of the pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative management of issues such as&#xD;
           pre-operative counseling, bowel preparation, postoperative nausea and vomiting&#xD;
           prophylaxis, IV fluid replacement, use of drains, timing of urinary catheter removal,&#xD;
           mobilization, post-operative nutrition, pain medication, and bowel stimulation. Of note,&#xD;
           these interventions have previously been studied in isolation and in combination. They&#xD;
           are considered by many to be the standard perioperative management of surgical patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Interventions All participants will be surveyed post-surgery regarding their&#xD;
      quality of recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-discharge and Over-the-Phone Interventions Participants will be called 4 weeks after&#xD;
      their surgery and asked about any hospital readmissions and complications at this time. They&#xD;
      will also complete post-discharge surveys.&#xD;
