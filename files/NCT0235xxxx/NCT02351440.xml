      The objective of this study is to determine the effect of preoperative duloxetine on&#xD;
      postoperative quality of recovery after ambulatory surgery, specifically laparoscopic&#xD;
      gynecological surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that female patients have poor quality of surgical recovery compared&#xD;
      to male patients.1 Increased sensitivity to pain and increased susceptibility to&#xD;
      postoperative nausea and vomiting have been attributed as causal factors.2, 3 Currently, few&#xD;
      strategies have been shown to improve quality of recovery in female patients undergoing&#xD;
      laparoscopic hysterectomy.4 A better recovery in female patients undergoing outpatient&#xD;
      laparoscopy is particularly desirable since those patients do not have access to potent&#xD;
      intravenous medications and nursing support after hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, pain after ambulatory surgery remains an unsolved problem in The United States&#xD;
      and Europe.5,6 It is associated with delayed hospital discharge and it can result to an&#xD;
      increased opioid consumption with adverse side effects. The concept of multimodal analgesic&#xD;
      technique was introduced more than 15 years ago and several techniques have been studied over&#xD;
      the years including NSAIDs, acetaminophen, membrane stabilizers, ketamine, and local and&#xD;
      regional anesthetic techniques.7,8 Both serotonin and norepinephrine have involvement in&#xD;
      modulation of pain mechanisms in the central nervous system. Duloxetine is a selective&#xD;
      serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that has been used for mitigation of pain in&#xD;
      such conditions as chronic musculoskeletal pain, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain,&#xD;
      post-herpetic neuralgia, and fibromyalgia.9,10 Duloxetine was also found to reduce&#xD;
      postoperative morphine requirements in patients undergoing knee replacement surgery.11 The&#xD;
      MQOR 40 is a validated instrument that was specifically design to evaluate patient recovery&#xD;
      after anesthesia and surgery.12 This instrument can be particularly valid to examine&#xD;
      interventions which affect different spheres of patient recovery as is the case of&#xD;
      duloxetine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A suicidal behavior questionnaire (SBQ-R) will be used to screen for suicidal risk among&#xD;
      potential subjects. If any subject exhibits suicidal ideation as a result of scoring high on&#xD;
      the questionnaire, there surgeon and/or primary care provider will be notified by the&#xD;
      principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the effect of preoperative duloxetine on&#xD;
      postoperative quality of recovery after ambulatory surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Use of preoperative duloxetine may improve patient's quality of recovery,&#xD;
      decrease postoperative pain, opioid consumption and opioid related side effects after&#xD;
      ambulatory surgery.&#xD;
