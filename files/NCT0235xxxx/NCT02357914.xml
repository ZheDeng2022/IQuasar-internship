  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is very common in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). Persons with high-level&#xD;
      paraplegia have higher chances to suffer shoulder pain and injury than those with lower-level&#xD;
      paraplegia due to the shoulder muscle imbalance. As people with SCI overuse the shoulder&#xD;
      during routine daily activities, the onset of pain or injury lead to increased healthcare&#xD;
      expenses, limitation in activity, depression, decreased participation, and reduced quality of&#xD;
      life. One of the main reasons of shoulder pain is believed to have a altered scapular&#xD;
      movement. To clarify the mechanism of the shoulder pain and injury, comprehensive&#xD;
      understanding of three-dimensional scapular kinematics is required. Ultrasound is a low-cost&#xD;
      and non-invasive imaging system and has been used to diagnose the shoulder pain and injury in&#xD;
      individuals with SCI. A freehand ultrasound (FUS) combining ultrasound with motion capture&#xD;
      system to evaluate scapular movement was developed and presented favorable results in&#xD;
      able-bodied population. The purpose of this study is to compare the FUS and widely used&#xD;
      skin-based method against a radiographic based gold standard in people with paraplegia, and&#xD;
      to elucidate the relationship among scapular movement and shoulder pain, pathology. This&#xD;
      study will also allow us to gain more understanding of how level of injury influences the&#xD;
      scapular behavior during functional activities. The investigators believe more severe&#xD;
      shoulder pain and pathology will be associated with greater abnormal scapular movement. The&#xD;
      investigators also believe that people with high-level paraplegia will have greater scapular&#xD;
      abnormality than people with low-level paraplegia during arm elevation and weight relief&#xD;
      raise tasks. By completing this study, the investigators will expect to deliver a reliable&#xD;
      and valid tool to evaluate scapular movement and gain a better understanding how the altered&#xD;
      scapular movement is related to shoulder pain and pathology. The investigators will also&#xD;
      learn how the level of injury affects the scapular behavior during functional activities. The&#xD;
      results of this study may help the shoulder pain management leading to the improvement in the&#xD;
      quality of life of individuals with SCI.&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Compare the freehand ultrasound (FUS) and skin-based markers methods with a&#xD;
      well-established and accurate dynamic biplanar fluoroscopy combined with model-based tracking&#xD;
      techniques to evaluate scapular kinematics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Throughout the arm elevation and weight relief raise, FUS measurements will&#xD;
      have lower standard error of measurement, greater intra-rater repeatability, and better&#xD;
      agreement with biplanar fluoroscopy techniques than skin-based method for scapular tilting,&#xD;
      upward rotation, and external rotation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Establish the convergent validity of FUS and skin-based markers method by describing&#xD;
      the relationship between scapular kinematics and established measures of shoulder pain and&#xD;
      pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Individuals with paraplegia diagnosed with more severe shoulder pain and signs&#xD;
      of shoulder pathology will have reduced scapular posterior tilt, upward rotation, and&#xD;
      external rotation during arm elevation and weight relief raise tasks compared to those with&#xD;
      less shoulder pain and pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Characterize the effect of lesion level on scapular behavior during arm elevation and&#xD;
      weight relief raise tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: When compared to individuals with low-level paraplegia, individuals with&#xD;
      high-level paraplegia will have decreased posterior tilt, upward rotation, and external&#xD;
      rotation during arm elevation and weight relief raise tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Human Subjects Ten individuals with paraplegia aged from 18 to 65 years old will be&#xD;
           recruited for Aim 1, 2, and 3. An additional 30 individuals with paraplegia will be&#xD;
           recruited for Aim 2 and 3. The participants will be dichotomized between high-level&#xD;
           group (at T7 and above) and low-level group (below T7).[3] Inclusion Criteria include&#xD;
           the level of your spinal cord injury is determined as paraplegia more than one year ago.&#xD;
           Use the manual wheelchair as the primary means of mobility (&gt;80% of mobility). Subjects&#xD;
           do not have a history of fractures or dislocations in the shoulder from which they have&#xD;
           not fully recovered and do not have an implant/pacemaker in the torso and dominant arm,&#xD;
           Subjects with neurologic deficit in the arm will be excluded, as these would impact&#xD;
           scapular kinematics. Subjects with a history of traumatic injury to the upper limb that&#xD;
           has not fully recovered and those with syrinx or complex regional pain syndrome&#xD;
           involving the arms will be excluded as this could also affect our measures but be&#xD;
           unrelated to dynamic scapular movement. Subjects who have impaired cognition or&#xD;
           difficulty reading the informed consent will also be excluded. Based on literature and&#xD;
           our previous experience, we expect at least 50% of the SCI population to have shoulder&#xD;
           pain. We will determine the prevalence of shoulder pain as subjects are recruited.&#xD;
           Participants may be recruited through the research registry for the Center of&#xD;
           Rehabilitation Outcomes Research or Clinical Neuroscience Research Registry at&#xD;
           Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methods and Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      General questionnaire Basic demographics including age, gender, height, weight will be&#xD;
      recorded. We will also record disability type, lesion level, motor scores (using the&#xD;
      International Standards for Neurological Classification), date of injury, and handedness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motion capture Participants will transfer to a customized chair equipped with an adjustable&#xD;
      guide bar in the sagittal, coronal, and scapular plane. The chair is designed to ensure&#xD;
      consistency in arm movement from rest to elevated positions. Height and depth-adjustable pads&#xD;
      and adjustable straps will provide supports to isolate the scapular kinematics and minimize&#xD;
      trunk movement. Participants will wear a slim-fit white tank top or remove their shirt to&#xD;
      allow for placing the markers on the trunk and dominant arm. Marker placement, determined by&#xD;
      the International Society of Biomechanics,[4] will include the following bony landmarks: C7,&#xD;
      T8, anterior sternoclavicular (sternum), xyphoid, acromion, lateral epicondyle, medial&#xD;
      epicondyle, and greater trochanter. These markers allow measurement of trunk and upper arm&#xD;
      movement during trials. A custom designed orthogonal attachment with markers allows tracking&#xD;
      of the US probe through space during scanning. A custom-made triangular triad, with three&#xD;
      reflective markers, will be attached to the flat superior bony surface of the acromion&#xD;
      process. For each subject, a static capture of all markers will be collected in the standard&#xD;
      anatomical neutral position to create the reference trial between the triad coordinate system&#xD;
      and scapular coordinate system determined by the markers placed on the acromial angle, root&#xD;
      of the scapular spine, and inferior angle. After the static capture, the markers on the&#xD;
      acromial angle, root of the scapular spine, and inferior angle will be removed. Triad&#xD;
      attachment will remain on the acromion process during the dynamic trial. Movement of the&#xD;
      subject and ultrasound probe will be collected using a motion capture system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Freehand ultrasound technique One operator will perform all ultrasound scanning. Imaging will&#xD;
      consist of scanning of the scapula. Ultrasound video files will be collected during the&#xD;
      trial. Scapular scanning consists of positioning the ultrasound probe along the spine and&#xD;
      medial border of the scapula. The ultrasound probe will be fully contacted and manually held&#xD;
      on different points along the scapular spine and medial border during the dynamic trials.&#xD;
      Ultrasound gel is applied to the skin overlaying the scapula and the probe is oriented to&#xD;
      maintain visualization of the border of the scapula in the image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic biplanar fluoroscopy and model based tracking technique Study will take place at the&#xD;
      Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH) where equipped a number of Siemens/Philips bi-planar&#xD;
      fluoroscopic imaging systems, managed by Dr. Ellen Kruk. The equipments include Siemens Artis&#xD;
      Zee biplane, Siemens Neurostar biplane, Philips Allura FD20 fluoroscopic imaging systems&#xD;
      located at interventional radiology. 64-sliced Siemens Definition or Sensation computer&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scanners or Siemens 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner will also be&#xD;
      utilized to obtain the bone models of humerus and scapula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Ten participants will be tested for Aim 1, 2, and 3 in NMH and additional 30&#xD;
      participants will be tested for Aim 2 and 3 in Biodynamics and Muscle Fiber Laboratories at&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. For dynamic trial, each participant will perform arm&#xD;
      elevation (AE) and weight relief raise (WR) trials in a random order. For AE trial, subjects&#xD;
      will be in their own chairs. Subjects will elevate the arm from neutral to 150° in the&#xD;
      sagittal, coronal, and scapular plane (30° anterior to the frontal plane). Subjects will use&#xD;
      their own wheelchair during data acquisition for the WR trial, which entails lifting and&#xD;
      holding the buttocks off the seat with an elbow locked position.[5, 6] A metronome at a&#xD;
      frequency of 0.3 Hz will guide AE and WR trials. Once the subjects are on pace with the&#xD;
      metronome, the researcher will trigger the ultrasound and motion capture systems&#xD;
      simultaneously. Subjects will be given a rest period after each trial to prevent fatigue.&#xD;
      Three dynamic trials will be collected in each task. For testing Aim 1 in NMH, ten out of the&#xD;
      40 subjects will visit the department of interventional radiology at the NMH for the dual&#xD;
      fluoroscopy testing and a CT scan. The dual fluoroscopic imaging system may track the&#xD;
      shoulder joint while the subject performs arm elevation and weight relief push-up trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm elevation trials The participants may be in their own chair for performing the arm&#xD;
      elevation protocols. A guide bar will be placed in the sagittal, coronal, and scapular plane.&#xD;
      Prior to the start of the protocols, we will ask the participant to wear a slim-fit white&#xD;
      tank top or remove their shirt to allow for placing the motion sensors on the skin of the&#xD;
      participants' thorax, scapula, and upper arm. The participants will be asked to keep the&#xD;
      dominant arm by the side. Bony points of the shoulder will be marked. The ultrasound probe&#xD;
      will be used to sweep over the surface of the shoulder. The participants may be asked to stay&#xD;
      in this position while up to three readings (ultrasound scans). The participants will be then&#xD;
      asked to elevate the arm to a flexed position. Bony landmarks on the shoulder will be marked.&#xD;
      The ultrasound probe will be used to sweep over the surface of the shoulder while the&#xD;
      participants have risen and lowered the arm. The participants may also be asked to complete&#xD;
      similar motions while holding a weight. The participants can stop at any time if they&#xD;
      experience any pain. The participants will be provided rest periods to prevent fatigue. Video&#xD;
      cameras or photo cameras may be used to record scapular movement and the experiment setup.&#xD;
      The soft-tissue and bone surface around the glenohumeral joint and scapula will be monitored&#xD;
      with ultrasound during movement. These trials will take up to 60 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight relief push-up trials The participants will be asked to keep both arms straight while&#xD;
      you push-up in your own chair. The participants may be asked to repeatedly hold the push-up&#xD;
      position while up to three readings (ultrasound scans). The ultrasound probe will be used to&#xD;
      sweep over the surface of the shoulder while performing the push-up. The participants can&#xD;
      stop at any time if they experience any pain. The participants will be provided rest periods&#xD;
      to prevent fatigue. These trials will take up to 60 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will have the optional to examine the scapular movement measured using&#xD;
      bi-planar fluoroscopy ⎯ a dynamic X-ray imaging device. The participants' shoulder joint&#xD;
      movement will be recorded during arm elevation and weight relief push-up. Before or after the&#xD;
      bi-planar fluoroscopic imaging, a research staff will send the subjects to NMH Radiology for&#xD;
      CT scan or Center for Translational Imaging for MRI scan. The CT/MRI scan will be used to&#xD;
      construct the scapular and humeral models and provide the position and orientation of the&#xD;
      bones. If feasible the same visit/day will include dual fluoroscopy performed at NMH.&#xD;
      Otherwise a second visit will be arranged for the fluoroscopy. A qualified radiology staff&#xD;
      from Department of Interventional Radiology will perform the dual fluoroscopy. This study&#xD;
      will compare the in vivo scapular movement between the FUS and biplanar fluoroscopy. Entire&#xD;
      protocol will last up to three hours. A urine pregnancy test will be done for woman subject&#xD;
      before the fluoroscopy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoulder pain and pathology measures We will evaluate shoulder pain using Wheelchair Users&#xD;
      Shoulder Pain Index (WUSPI): The WUSPI is a 15-item self-report instrument that measures&#xD;
      shoulder pain intensity in wheelchair users during various functional activities of daily&#xD;
      living, such as transfers, wheelchair mobility, dressing, overhead lifting, and sleeping. [7]&#xD;
      Each item is scored using a 10 cm visual analog scale anchored at the ends with the&#xD;
      descriptors of &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain ever experienced.&quot; Individual item scores are summed&#xD;
      to arrive at a total index score. The WUSPI is valid and reliable - test-retest reliability&#xD;
      of the total index score was 0.99 and Cronbach's alpha (internal consistency) was 0.98.[8] A&#xD;
      standardized physical examination has been previously used in our study and consists of&#xD;
      common clinical test such as palpation over the bicipital groove/biceps tendon, Neer&#xD;
      impingement test, Hawkin's-Kennedy test, and O'Brien's test for the labrum and&#xD;
      acromioclavicular joint.[9] For each item, the sign/symptom of pain is scored as either&#xD;
      absent (0), equivocally present (1), or definitely present (2).[9] Items are summed to create&#xD;
      a total score.&#xD;
