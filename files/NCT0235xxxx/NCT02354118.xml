      The purpose of this study is to determine the safest and most effective flushing solution for&#xD;
      maintaining patency (unobstructed flow) in implanted port catheters. The complication rate in&#xD;
      patients whose ports are flushed with saline only will be compared to the complication rate&#xD;
      in patients whose ports are flushed with a combination of saline and heparinized saline.&#xD;

      patients whose ports are flushed with saline only will be compared to the complication rate&#xD;
      in patients whose ports are flushed with a combination of saline and heparinized saline.&#xD;
      These complications include partial or complete obstruction, infection of the central line,&#xD;
      and/or the onset of heparin induced thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
