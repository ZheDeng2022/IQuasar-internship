      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of lanreotide on locally evolving&#xD;
      and/or metastatic MCC in a national prospective multicentre phase II study (centres belonging&#xD;
      to the skin cancer task force of the French Society of Dermatology namely &quot;Groupe de&#xD;
      Cancérologie Cutanée de la Société Française de Dermatologie&quot;). This one-arm study, for which&#xD;
      the primary endpoint is overall response to lanreotide, will follow an A'Hern plan in one&#xD;
      step (A'Hern RP. Sample size tables for exact single-stage phase II designs. Stat Med 2001,&#xD;
      20:859-66) with main evaluation at 12 weeks on a population of 35 patients. The investigators&#xD;
      make assumption that a 40% success rate at 3 months would be desirable, but if it was 20% or&#xD;
      less the treatment would be unacceptable. It gives a trial size of 35 patients with a cut-off&#xD;
      of 12 patients. Over 12 patients lanreotide will be considered as effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lanreotide treatment (Somatuline LP 120 mg injected subcutaneously every 28 days) will be&#xD;
      provided by IPSEN Pharma laboratory. An ancillary immunohistochemistry study on somatostatine&#xD;
      receptors 2,3,5, dopamine receptors 1,2 and polyomavirus MCPyV will bring new data on this&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumour and potentially provide new therapeutic perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study may :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  determine whether somatostatin analogues may help to treat locally advanced and/or&#xD;
           metastatic MCC;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  address whether there is a correlation between positive SPECT-CT (octreoscan) assessment&#xD;
           and therapeutic response to lanreotide;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the place of TEP-CT and SPECT-CT for MCC evaluation/staging;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate in future studies, with the ancillary data, other analogues or hybrid&#xD;
           molecules;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  consider, if positive results are obtained from this study, somatostatin analogues as&#xD;
           adjuvant treatment after surgery of primary MCC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy will be considered as success if patient have a positive response to lanreotide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary criterion Positive response at 3 months will be defined according to the RECIST 1.1&#xD;
      criteria (clinical and TDM evaluation will be done at 3 months): complete response (CR) or&#xD;
      partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of the primary criterion at M6, M9, M12, M18 and M24&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of the overall survival and time to progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of the efficacy of the following radiological exams for staging the disease:&#xD;
           SPECT-CT and TEP-CT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of the correlation of SPECT-CT results (positivity or negativity) and&#xD;
           response to treatment, and the correlation of TEP-CT results and response to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of the safety and tolerability of lanreotide in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental plan French national prospective multicentre phase II one-arm study. This&#xD;
      one-arm study, for which the primary endpoint is overall response to lanreotide, will follow&#xD;
