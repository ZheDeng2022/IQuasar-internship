      This is a retrospective data collection on treatment of various disorders. This registry will&#xD;
      include a variety of different products, implants, technologies and procedures. The registry&#xD;
      will also collect any adverse events/complications that occur during or following treatment&#xD;
      of these conditions. The data may be utilized to develop strategic treatment pathways and/or&#xD;
      benchmarking that will improve patient care. Ultimately, the goal of the registry is to&#xD;
      enhance the understanding of healthcare and the treatment in these disease states.&#xD;

      The purpose is to collect data on patients with a variety of disorders. This includes point&#xD;
      of care (primary care, internal medicine, pain management providers, etc.) as well as a&#xD;
      variety of specialty providers including neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, oncologists, and&#xD;
      dermatologists. The retrospective data collection will consist of a core set of data if&#xD;
      available. The registry will attempt to collect data prior to surgery/treatment/procedures,&#xD;
      during surgery, and various time points following surgery/treatment/procedures. The data will&#xD;
      include, but is not limited to demographic data, past medical history, previous treatments,&#xD;
      time off of work, type of surgery performed, products/implants/procedures/technology used&#xD;
      during surgery, treatments/procedures/technology used for non-surgical conditions, anesthesia&#xD;
      used during surgery, complications/adverse events following surgery and or treatment, outcome&#xD;
      tools, imaging results, pain assessment, pain medication utilization, length of hospital&#xD;
      stay, unplanned hospital admissions, revision surgery, adjacent level disease, genetic&#xD;
      testing, urinary drug testing, other diagnostic or assessment testing, patient return to work&#xD;
      and patient return to normal activity. The data collected will vary depending on disease&#xD;
      state and treatment. This registry will also allow for comparisons on different treatments,&#xD;
      procedures, etc. with a goal of developing the best pathways for a variety of different&#xD;
      disease states.&#xD;
