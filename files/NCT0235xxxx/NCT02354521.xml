    <textblock>
      An observational, point-prevalence cohort study of nutrition therapies in critically ill&#xD;
      children in PICUs across the world. Baseline information will be collected including PICU and&#xD;
      hospital demographics and characteristics (e.g. age, diagnostic category, PRISM score,&#xD;
      weight, height) of critically ill children requiring mechanical ventilation in the PICU.&#xD;
      Nutrition practices such as route of nutrition, kilocalorie and protein levels prescribed and&#xD;
      received, interruptions, etc., will be collected on a daily basis from PICU admission&#xD;
      onwards, for a maximum of 10 days. Data on clinical outcomes (e.g. duration of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, PICU stay, hospital stay, acquired infections) will be collected up to 60 days&#xD;
      after admission to the PICU. The main objective of the study is to examine the association&#xD;
      between energy and protein intake adequacy (in relation to the prescribed goals for these&#xD;
      nutrients) and 60-day mortality in mechanically ventilated children.&#xD;

      Nutrition Support can prevent complications associated with malnutrition and when used&#xD;
      appropriately has a positive influence on clinically important outcomes, such as length of&#xD;
      stay, morbidity and mortality. Making decisions regarding the most effective and safe&#xD;
      nutrition support can be challenging, and consequently considerable variation exists in&#xD;
      nutrition support practices in PICUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter prospective cohort study of nutritional practices in mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated children from a representative sample of medium to large (at least 8 ICU beds)&#xD;
      PICUs in North America and participating centers across other countries. The investigators&#xD;
      will invite centers in all 9 US Census regions, at least 3 Canadian Provinces and PICUs with&#xD;
      8 or more beds from across the world. Participating sites will be recruited through the&#xD;
      PALISI network (of more than 66 PICUs), by disseminating study information through national&#xD;
      nutrition (e.g. ASPEN) and critical care societies (e.g. (SCCM), and e-mailing individual&#xD;
      healthcare providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection criteria: All children (ages 1month to 18 years) admitted to the PICU, who&#xD;
      require mechanical ventilatory support with anticipated duration of stay longer than 48 hours&#xD;
      will be eligible for data collection. Data collection for each eligible patient will be&#xD;
      continued for a total of 10 days or until discharge from the PICU (if earlier) until a&#xD;
      minimum of 15 patients (maximum 40 patients) are accrued per site. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate recruitment of 500 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trained dietitians (or a designated research nurse) at participating centers will use a&#xD;
      validated web-based remote data capture tool to record details of nutritional intake. An&#xD;
      instruction package describing data collection methods in detail will be provided. Following&#xD;
      a training period, beginning on the 'going live' date, the dietitian or designated&#xD;
      coordinator at participating centers will simultaneously enter relevant data online using a&#xD;
      secure website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional variables including the energy and protein goals prescribed by the local&#xD;
      nutrition team, actual daily macronutrient delivery achieved, route of delivery, frequency&#xD;
      and duration of feeding interruptions, and use of adjunctive drugs, will be recorded.&#xD;
      Prescribed protein goals for each subject will be compared to the recommended daily protein&#xD;
      in the 2005 DRI and the 2009 A.S.P.E.N. age-based guidelines. The end point for nutritional&#xD;
      data collection is 10 days or discharge from the PICU, whichever was sooner. The energy and&#xD;
      protein intake adequacy will be calculated as the percentage of the prescribed goal that was&#xD;
      actually delivered and an average adequacy over the PICU stay up to 10 days was derived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for this study is 60-day patient mortality.&#xD;
