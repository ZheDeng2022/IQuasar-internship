  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head injury is a frequent reason for consultation with pediatric emergencies, over 95% are&#xD;
      mild head injury defined by a Glasgow score greater than or equal to 13. In October 2009, the&#xD;
      Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network has published a rule clinical decision&#xD;
      support of mild head injury of the child with the aim to identify children at very low risk&#xD;
      for clinically severe intracranial lesions in order to avoid the use of CT and unnecessary&#xD;
      exposure to radiation ionizing. This clinical decision rule constructed from a multicenter&#xD;
      prospective cohort 42,412 American children allows on anamnestic and clinical elements to&#xD;
      guide medical decision for conducting brain imaging, hospital monitoring or discharge home&#xD;
      placing the child in three levels of risk of clinically severe intracranial lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since March 2012, the French Emergency Medicine Society recommends for the treatment of mild&#xD;
      head trauma the child's use of the clinical decision rule provided that it is the subject of&#xD;
      a validation study externally. Indeed, after the construction phase and before its daily&#xD;
      application, a clinical decision rule must be subject to an broad validation process so that&#xD;
      its predictive performance can be definitively established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' work aims to conduct this broad validation study prospective multicenter&#xD;
      way in a French pediatric population, as recommended by the French Emergency Medicine&#xD;
      Society, in order to confirm or deny its predictive performance and allow its application and&#xD;
      generalization. The investigators will check and if the Rule Clinical Decision is adapted or&#xD;
      not to the management of mild head injuries in the French pediatric population.&#xD;

        Will be included in the study all children under 16 years of age admitted to the emergency&#xD;
        room with mild head trauma with a Glasgow score greater than or equal to 14, occurred in&#xD;
        the previous 24 hours. The mild head injury is usually defined by a GCS ≥ 13, but the study&#xD;
        of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network was interested in the population&#xD;
        of children with TBI Glasgow score was greater than or equal to 14. Indeed the care of&#xD;
        children with head trauma with a Glasgow score below 14 is not controversial. The risk of&#xD;
        traumatic brain injury is at least 20%, achieving a brain scan is routinely recommended for&#xD;
        these children. The investigators will resume the same characteristics for the study&#xD;
        population as the study of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network.&#xD;
