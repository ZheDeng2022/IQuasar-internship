    <textblock>
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic metastases of colorectal cancer (MCC) is quite common and is a major source of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. There has been evidence to show that hepatic arterial&#xD;
      chemoembolisation using DC beads (drug eluting beads, 100-300μm) loaded with irinotecan&#xD;
      (DEBIRI) showed improved overall survival when compared to systemic therapy (FOLFIRI), but&#xD;
      being larger they have their limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New 70-150μm beads are recently available and currently there is limited data concerning its&#xD;
      use. Safety of these beads have not been tested in local patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis / Aim To study the safety and pharmacokinetics of the smaller 70-150μm DEBIRI in a&#xD;
      pilot study of 5 patients. The smaller 70-150μm beads will be able to deliver a more&#xD;
      consistent and higher dose to tumoral tissue with a smaller systemic dose. Being smaller and&#xD;
      less embolic, it will also be better tolerated. Patients will also be genotyped for their&#xD;
      UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*6 polymorphism status as the latter genotypes are associated with&#xD;
      decreased clearance of irinotecan and SN-38 in Asian patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Single centre, pilot study, prospectively recruiting 5 patients with unilobar&#xD;
      disease, refractory to systemic chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. establish safety and toxicity profile of the irinotecan loaded DEBIRI beads&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. establish pharmacokinetics and systemic exposure of irinotecan and its active&#xD;
           metabolite, SN-38.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the incidence and severity of adverse events, liver function parameters and laboratory&#xD;
           abnormalities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. response rate,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. progression free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      This treatment modality has the advantage of directly delivering irinotecan to the liver&#xD;
      metastases from colorectal cancer. This local mode of drug delivery may result in a higher&#xD;
      intratumoral drug concentration and rapid tumour shrinkage leading to downstaging of the&#xD;
      hepatic metastatic lesions. These therapeutic outcomes may also downstage patients to hepatic&#xD;
      resection.&#xD;

      1. Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Suitable potential subjects will be identified, namely those who have failed first or&#xD;
           second line chemotherapy agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Liver biopsy Right before the 1st transarterial chemoembolisation procedure, the liver&#xD;
           metastases will be biopsied under ultrasound or CT guidance by the IR with a 18G core&#xD;
           biopsy needle. Tissue will be sent for histological analysis as well as stored for&#xD;
           molecular studies with NCCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Transarterial chemoembolisation procedure (DEBIRI TACE):&#xD;
&#xD;
      100mg of irinotecan will be loaded into the DEB solution at least 2 hours before the&#xD;
      procedure by the pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic angiography (DSA) will performed under fluoroscopic guidance, most commonly via&#xD;
      right groin puncture. Using dedicated catheters, arterial supply of the liver and the tumour&#xD;
      involved segments will be determined. A solution of 75-150 μm DEBIRI mixed with non-ionic&#xD;
      contrast medium (1:1) will be injected into the artery feeding the metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For unilobar disease, two treatments will be planned, each of them with a maximum of 100mg&#xD;
      irinotecan loaded in into the DEB, separated by four weeks. Intravenous fentanyl will be&#xD;
      administered for procedural pain relief. Post procedural pain relief medications will be&#xD;
      given as deemed necessary by the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For bilobar disease, there will be four treatments planned, alternating between the right and&#xD;
      left lobe, separated by 2 weeks duration, each of them with a maximum of 100mg irinotecan&#xD;
      loaded into the DEB. Intravenous fentanyl will be administered for the procedural pain&#xD;
      relief. Post procedural pain relief will be given as deemed necessary by the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical success is defined as delivery of all the DEBIRI or when stasis has been reached in&#xD;
      the hepatic artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be expected to stay in the hospital for at least a day for monitoring of&#xD;
      adverse events, after which they will be followed up in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures will be delayed at the physician's discretion should:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver function tests and bilirubin 5-folds more than the normal values&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absolute neutrophil count of less than 1500 cells/µL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platelet count of less than 100,000/µL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should the patient development significant extrahepatic metastases at any time during the&#xD;
      course of the trial, the referring clinician may choose to stop the trial and/or offer&#xD;
      patients other treatment modalities e.g. radiotherapy or further lines of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4)Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be expected to stay in the hospital for at least a day for monitoring of&#xD;
      adverse events, after which they will be followed up in the clinic. All patients will be seen&#xD;
      in the clinical 1 week after each procedure with FBC and LFT determinations being performed.&#xD;
      They will then be seen in the clinic 1 week prior to their next procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up 3 months after the last procedure. Serum drug levels and adverse&#xD;
      events will be monitored. Imaging response will be determined by modified RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A CT scan will be performed 1 month and 3 months after completion of the procedure to&#xD;
      evaluate treatment response. Tumor response will be determined using modified RECIST criteria&#xD;
      (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5)Pharmacokinetics of irinotecan Blood samples (3 mL) for pharmacokinetic analyses will be&#xD;
      collected at the following time points after administration of the first dose on day 1: 0&#xD;
      minutes (pretreatment blank), 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h and 24h hours postinfusion. Blood will be&#xD;
      immediately centrifuged at 2000 g for fifteen minutes, and the plasma transferred to a 1.5 mL&#xD;
      polypropylene tube and stored at -20°C. Irinotecan and its metabolites, SN-38 and SN-38G will&#xD;
      be assayed using LC-MS/MS method. The purpose of performing pharmacokinetics would be to&#xD;
      quantitate the AUC of irinotecan, SN-38 and SN-38G in plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6)Pharmacogenetics Analysis Pharmacogenetic analyses for UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*6 will be done&#xD;
      in all patients prior to administration of irinotecan in accordance with previously published&#xD;
      studies by our laboratory (6-9). All participating patients will have venous blood samples (3&#xD;
      mL) drawn for genomic DNA collection in EDTA tubes and labeled with the patient's&#xD;
      identification number, date of collection, age, ethnic group and sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unused DNA samples from patients enrolled in the genotyping arm will be stored at -20°C for&#xD;
      future pharmacogenetic investigations related to irinotecan research. Patients will be&#xD;
      informed and written consent will be taken from them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8)Potential Risks and benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduction in the size of the liver lesions hence prolonging survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Meeting criteria for liver resection for metastases&#xD;

      days duration, neutropenic fever, grade 4 anemia or grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia that occurs&#xD;
      during the first cycle of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9)Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using Health Science Authority's Safety Reporting for Clinical Trials (June 2011), a serious&#xD;
      adverse event (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Results in death&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is life-threatening&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A congenital anomaly/birth defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse event is defined as: Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical&#xD;
      investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a&#xD;
      causal relationship with this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events related to procedure include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Access site injuries&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hepatic artery injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Non target embolization resulting in acute cholecystitis, peptic ulcer, pancreatitis&#xD;
           etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Post embolization syndrome, manifested by fever, malaise, right upper quadrant pain,&#xD;
           nausea, and vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Hepatic abscess and biloma&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Biliary strictures&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Liver failure&#xD;
&#xD;
      All chemotherapeutic toxicities will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute&#xD;
      Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC version 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematological Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined as follows: grade 4 neutropenia of &gt;7&#xD;
      days duration, neutropenic fever, grade 4 anemia or grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia that occurs&#xD;
      during the first cycle of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-hematologic DLT is defined as any grade 3 or grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity that occurs&#xD;
      during the first cycle of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicities will be classified as related to the study drug unless they were attributable to&#xD;
      either underlying tumour progression, concurrent medical condition or a concomitant&#xD;
      medication. Any unusual toxicities must be reported to the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10)Safety Monitoring Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The principle and co-investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The medical practitioner performing the procedure will be overall responsible for the&#xD;
           patient prior to, during and after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The monitoring nurse in the recovery area and the circulating nurse during the procedure&#xD;
           will assist the medical practitioner in recording and monitoring the patient's&#xD;
           parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All complications and adverse events will be recorded in the CRFs and the patient will&#xD;
           be followed up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of any SAE's regardless of the causality of the event, the investigator will&#xD;
      notify to the IRB of SingHealth. The reporting timelines are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urgent Reporting: All problems involving local deaths should be reported immediately within&#xD;
      24 hours after first knowledge by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expedited Reporting: All other SAE must be reported as soon as possible but not later than 7&#xD;
      calendar days after first knowledge by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Data &amp; Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) comprising of co-principal investigators from the&#xD;
      participating centres, will monitor the safety data .&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the DSMC have any safety concerns, they may make written recommendations to the primary PI&#xD;
      and the IRB of SingHealth to modify or terminate the study following discussions with the&#xD;
      primary PI. The final decision on the termination of the study will be made by SGH after&#xD;
      consulting with IRB and HSA about the safety findings or concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11)Confidentiality of Data and Patient Records&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data required according to the protocol will be recorded on the CRFs as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Entries must be made with a ballpoint pen and written legibly. No pencils or correction&#xD;
           fluids will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relevant information will be documented into the patient's hospital files (either paper&#xD;
           or electronic records).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Necessary corrections will be entered by the investigator or, if appropriate, by an&#xD;
           authorized member of the investigator's staff in the following manner: The wrong entry&#xD;
           will be crossed out, although it must remain legible, and the correct entry will be&#xD;
           placed next to it. All corrections will be initialed and dated. For corrections&#xD;
           concerning adverse events or the primary variable, a reason for any alteration must be&#xD;
           provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any documents related to the study must be archived at the study site or in a central&#xD;
           archive. This includes the careful listing of the identities of the patients involved in&#xD;
           the study. This list and the signed informed consent statements are key documents in the&#xD;
           files to be stored by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient (hospital) files will be archived according to local regulations. All documents&#xD;
           related to the study must be retained until at least 15 years after the end of the&#xD;
           study. At the end of this period, the investigator is to obtain permission from the&#xD;
           relevant authorities (IRB) before any documents are destroyed.&#xD;
