  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy is one of the most frequent surgical operations performed in children [1-4]. It&#xD;
      is usually associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) with an incidence ranging&#xD;
      from 23% to 73% [2]. Dexamethasone has been shown to be effective in reducing PONV after&#xD;
      tonsillectomy using standardized anesthetic technique [2, 5-7]. Previous studies utilizing a&#xD;
      different technique, the pre-incision infiltration of local anesthesia, had shown to decrease&#xD;
      post-tonsillectomy pain, reduce analgesic consumption and provide a rapid return to normal&#xD;
      activity [8, 9]. Given the effectiveness of dexamethasone and the pre-incision infiltration&#xD;
      anesthetic technique, it would be beneficial to compare the effect of each on PONV.&#xD;

      Objective The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of dexamethasone versus the&#xD;
      pre-incision infiltration of local anesthesia in pediatric tonsillectomy procedures. The&#xD;
      primary outcome parameter of the study is the incidence of early PONV in the post-anesthesia&#xD;
      care unit (PACU) and late PONV on the floor and 5 days after discharge. The secondary outcome&#xD;
      is postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Definitions Nausea is difficult to assess in children since they are not able to&#xD;
      verbalize their feelings. Retching, which is the unproductive effort to vomit (no expulsion&#xD;
      of gastric content), is considered an indicator of nausea. Therefore, for the purpose of this&#xD;
      study, PONV is defined as vomiting and/or retching. Early PONV is defined as vomiting and/or&#xD;
      retching in the PACU. Late PONV is defined as vomiting and/or retching on the floor and 5&#xD;
      days after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The study will be conducted prospectively, using a randomized double-blinded&#xD;
      placebo-controlled design. Thus, neither the surgeon nor the anesthesiologist will be aware&#xD;
      of the injected solution content and they will not be involved in data collection. The&#xD;
      patients and the residents who will collect the data will also be unaware of the patient's&#xD;
      assigned group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for total or partial tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy starting&#xD;
      from January 2015, whose ages range between 2 to 13 years will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria consisted of patients who received antiemetics, steroids, antihistaminics,&#xD;
      or psychoactive drugs within 24 hours before surgery. Patients who are suspected to have&#xD;
      malignant neoplasm and signs of acute pharyngeal infection will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
      Moreover, patients who have asthma, diabetes mellitus, bleeding problems, and allergy towards&#xD;
      bupivacaine are excluded as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon meeting the eligibility criteria and signing the consent form, patients will be&#xD;
      allocated randomly into two equal groups using the sealed envelope method. Both groups will&#xD;
      have general anesthesia (GA) and endotracheal intubation. Then, one group will receive&#xD;
      dexamethasone 0.5 mg/kg IV with placebo pre-incision infiltration. The other group will&#xD;
      receive pre-incision infiltration of 1.5 ml local anesthesia mixture in each tonsil and an&#xD;
      equivalent volume of IV saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic techniques General anesthesia General anesthesia will be induced by intravenous&#xD;
      fentanyl (1.5 µg kg-1) and propofol (2.5 mg kg-1) followed by endotracheal intubation&#xD;
      facilitated by atracurium (0.5 mg kg-1). Anesthesia will be subsequently maintained with&#xD;
      sevoflurane 1-3%, fentanyl (1-2 µg kg-1), nitrous oxide 70% and oxygen 30%. The sevoflurane&#xD;
      concentration will be adjusted with the intention of keeping the heart rate and blood&#xD;
      pressure within 25% of pre-induction values [8, 9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified infiltration technique The infiltration will be performed by the anesthetist using a&#xD;
      25G- 3.5cm curved needle. A total of 1.5 ml of local anesthetic mixture will be used for each&#xD;
      tonsil. The mixture will contain: 3 ml lidocaine 2%, 3 ml lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 1/200&#xD;
      000, 3 ml of bupivacaine 0.5%, 0.5 ml fentanyl 50 µg ml-1, and 0.3 ml clonidine 150 µg ml-1&#xD;
      [8, 9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical techniques The tonsillectomy techniques were monopolar electrocautery or cold&#xD;
      dissection. The degree of tonsillar enlargement was graded as follows: tonsils within&#xD;
      tonsillar folds; tonsils just outside tonsillar folds; tonsils well outside tonsillar folds&#xD;
      but not reaching uvula; tonsils reaching uvula or past uvula [3]. Towards the end of the&#xD;
      surgery, gastric contents of all patients will be suctioned via an orogastric tube prior to&#xD;
      extubation [10]. Patients were extubated when fully awake. Systemic IV paracetamol (15 mg/kg)&#xD;
      was given to all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Pre- and intraoperative data include: patient's demographics, surgical&#xD;
      technique, amount of fentanyl consumed, heart rate, mean arterial pressure and oxygen&#xD;
      concentration in addition to surgery duration. Data to be collected postoperatively in the&#xD;
      PACU (by PACU nurse) and floor included: frequency of PONV, pain scores, antiemetic and&#xD;
      analgesic consumption as well as patients' and surgeons' satisfaction. PONV will be assessed&#xD;
      using questions adopted from Rhodes Index of Nausea, Vomiting and Retching (RINVR) but was&#xD;
      modified for pediatrics [11, 12]. For children aged five years and older, pain will be&#xD;
      measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) with a score of 0 denoting no pain and 10&#xD;
      maximum possible pains. For children less than five years of age, the Wong-Baker faces pain&#xD;
      scale will be used. Pain will be assessed at rest in addition to when opening the jaw,&#xD;
      swallowing, eating soft and ordinary food. The parents will be told that they will be&#xD;
      contacted through phone calls after their hospital discharge on a daily basis and will be&#xD;
      asked about the pain intensity and analgesic consumption of their child. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed-up by anesthesiology resident for five postoperative days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents' satisfaction will be based on quality of communication and care provided by the&#xD;
      anesthesiologists and nurses, in addition to parental opinion of the child's recollection and&#xD;
      the overall experience. Surgeon satisfaction will be assessed using patients' comfort and&#xD;
      number of phone calls made by parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the study is double-blind, neither the surgeon nor the anesthesiologist are aware of&#xD;
      the injected solution content and were not involved in data collection. The patients and the&#xD;
      trained nurses who collect the data are also unaware of the patient's assigned group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain management For pain scores &gt;5, 1-2 mg/kg of tramadol hydrochloride (Tramal&#xD;
      drops, Laboratoire, Grunenthal, Aachen-Germany) would be given. If pain score is between 4&#xD;
      and 5, 15mg/kg intravenous propacetamol hydrochloride (Pro-Dafalgan Laboratoires, UPSA, Agen,&#xD;
      France) will be provided. Paracetamol suppository 350 mg (Tylenol CILAG SA, Schaffhouse,&#xD;
      Switzerland) will be administered for children with pain scores &lt;4. Paracetamol suppository&#xD;
      350 mg is prescribed systematically two to four times a day as needed to all discharged&#xD;
      children. If they experience pain with a score &gt;5, tramadol hydrochloride will be prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Data will be statistically analyzed by chi-square test and t-test&#xD;
      (two-tailed). P-value &lt; 0.05 is considered significant. Results will be reported as mean and&#xD;
      standard deviation (SD), or frequency and percentage as appropriate.&#xD;
