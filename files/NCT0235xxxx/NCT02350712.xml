  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a study drug called patritumab. Patritumab may work when&#xD;
      combined with other medications that are approved in the UK for treating Squamous Cell&#xD;
      Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN), called cetuximab, cisplatin or carboplatin. It is&#xD;
      hoped that patritumab may have some benefit in treating patients with cancer. This study will&#xD;
      help identify how much patritumab can be given in combination with cetuximab, and cisplatin&#xD;
      or carboplatin. This study will show how safe and how well tolerated patritumab is when these&#xD;
      medications are given together.&#xD;

      The trial will be performed in two &quot;phases&quot; (Periods):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 1: Initial phase in which the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 2: Extension phase in which participants who are deriving benefit (stable disease or&#xD;
      better) will have the opportunity to continue treatment at the discretion of the Investigator&#xD;
