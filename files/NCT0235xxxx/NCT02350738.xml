  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of Multimodal Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (MCET) for&#xD;
      people with mild cognitive impairment and early stage dementia by a randomized, controlled&#xD;
      (mock-therapy), double-blind, cross-over trial&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multimodal Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (MCET) was developed for cognitive rehabilitation of&#xD;
      mild cognitive impairment or ealy dementia. MCET consists of cognitive training, cognitive&#xD;
      stimulation, reality orientation, physical therapy, reminiscence therapy and music therapy&#xD;
      that obtained 'A' grade of recommendation by SIGN(Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines&#xD;
      Network) for their efficacy (one of the followings: global cognition/specific cognitive&#xD;
      domain/mood/activities of daily living/behavioral and psychological symptoms/quality of life)&#xD;
      based on the systematic review and meta-analysis performed by our research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigated the efficacy of MCET compared with mock-therapy that consisted of&#xD;
      random activities that were not based on clinical evidences (e.g., watching TV, conversation&#xD;
      etc.).&#xD;
