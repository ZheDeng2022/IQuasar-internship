      This is a randomized, double-blinded, double placebo-controlled trial. Patients undergoing&#xD;
      saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) will be recruited and randomized into three groups to&#xD;
      receive (a) 3ml of 2% lidocaine gel on the cervix and 5ml of intrauterine normal saline; (b)&#xD;
      3ml of KY jelly on the cervix and 5ml of 2% intrauterine lidocaine or (c) 3ml of KY jelly on&#xD;
      the cervix and 5mL of intrauterine normal saline prior to SIS. Pain levels will be recorded&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy of local lidocaine gel and intrauterine lidocaine infusion in&#xD;
      reducing pain during the SIS.&#xD;

      Trial objectives and purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of local lidocaine gel and intrauterine lidocaine infusion in&#xD;
      reducing pain during saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, double placebo-controlled trial. Patients undergoing&#xD;
      SIS will be recruited and randomized into three groups to receive (a) 3ml of 2% lidocaine gel&#xD;
      on the cervix and 5ml of intrauterine normal saline; (b) 3ml of KY jelly on the cervix and&#xD;
      5ml of 2% intrauterine lidocaine or (c) 3ml of KY jelly on the cervix and 5mL of intrauterine&#xD;
      normal saline prior to SIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Before the procedure, each patient will be randomized into three groups with a&#xD;
      predetermined computer-generated randomization code prepared by a research nurse to receive&#xD;
      (a) 3ml of 2% lidocaine gel on the cervix and 5ml of intrauterine normal saline; (b) 3ml of&#xD;
      KY jelly on the cervix and 5ml of 2% intrauterine lidocaine or (c) 3ml of KY jelly on the&#xD;
      cervix and 5mL of intrauterine normal saline prior to SIS. Demographic data will be collected&#xD;
      from all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding The test gel (2% lidocaine gel) and KY jelly are both colourless. They will be&#xD;
      prepared by the research nurse and will not be labeled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study syringes containing test solution (lidocaine or normal saline) will also be&#xD;
      prepared by the research nurse. Lidocaine and normal saline are identical in appearance&#xD;
      (i.e., a clear colourless solution) and will be contained in identical 5-mL disposable&#xD;
      syringes with labeled with numbers only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient and the physician will not know the group allocation and what test gel and test&#xD;
      solution are given. Only the research nurse responsible for the preparation knows about what&#xD;
      the gel/solution are, but she will not be involved in the patient care, the procedure and the&#xD;
      assessment of pain levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the SIS, a sterile bivalve speculum will be introduced into the vagina for&#xD;
      visualization of the cervix. The cervix and vagina will be cleansed with antiseptic solution.&#xD;
      3mL of test gel (2% lidocaine gel or KY jelly) will be applied to the surface of the cervix&#xD;
      using a gauze according to group allocation. An infant feeding tube will be inserted into the&#xD;
      uterine cavity through the endocervical canal. Test solution (2% lidocaine 5mL or normal&#xD;
      saline 5mL) will be instilled into the uterine cavity through an infant feeding tube&#xD;
      according to group allocation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Lidocaine gel group: the subjects will receive local application of 2% lidocaine gel 3mL&#xD;
      to the cervix (study drug) and intrauterine infusion of normal saline 5mL (placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Intrauterine lidocaine group: the subjects will receive local application of KY jelly 3mL&#xD;
      to the cervix (placebo) and intrauterine infusion of 2% lidocaine 5mL (study drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Placebo group: the subjects will receive local application of KY jelly 3mL to the cervix&#xD;
      and intrauterine infusion of normal saline 5mL (double placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The speculum will then be removed. After five minutes, the transvaginal ultrasound probe will&#xD;
      be inserted into the vagina and 5 to 10 mL of sterile saline solution will be instilled into&#xD;
      the uterine cavity. The volume of normal saline used depends on the distension of the uterine&#xD;
      cavity, which should provide a clear visualization of the uterine cavity. After ultrasound&#xD;
      examination, the transvaginal probe and the infant feeding tube will be removed, and the&#xD;
      procedure is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of pain levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to rate their pain levels during and after the procedure on a visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS), marking an &quot;X&quot; on a 10-cm line (0cm: no pain, 10cm: unbearable pain).&#xD;
      Ratings will be done at different times:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. just after speculum insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. just after test solution (lidocaine or placebo) instillation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. during normal saline infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. immediately after the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 20 minutes after the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Overall pain score throughout the procedure The physician will also record and score&#xD;
           visible signs of the women's distress during the procedure (moaning, body movement,&#xD;
           grabbing the table, expressing about pain) using a 3-point observer scale for each of&#xD;
           the parameters in which 0 is no response, 1 is mild response, and 2 is severe response.&#xD;
           If the patient require additional analgesics, oral mefenamic acid 500 mg would be given&#xD;
           and will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Apart from assessment of pain levels, we will also record patient&#xD;
      characteristics including age, parity, ethnicity, history of chronic pelvic pain, history of&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea, prior curettage, menopausal status, education, socioeconomic status, indication&#xD;
      of SIS, use of tenaculum, volume of saline solution infusion and presence of uterine&#xD;
      pathologies. Any need for additional analgesics and side effects experienced by the subjects&#xD;
      will be recorded. Blood pressure and pulse will be measured and recorded before and after the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up No routine follow-up visits will be arranged solely for the study unless considered&#xD;
      necessary by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the pain level during the SIS procedure as assessed by the visual&#xD;
      analog scale. Other outcome measures include the patients' distress during, immediately and&#xD;
      after the procedure as evaluated by the physician with a 3-point observer scale, the need for&#xD;
      additional analgesics and side effects experienced by the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIS is a well-established procedure to detect abnormalities of the uterus and endometrial&#xD;
      cavity. It is a very safe procedure. It may cause cramping, spotting and vaginal discharge.&#xD;
      Some women may experience severe pain and cramping. Pelvic infection occurs in less than 1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lidocaine is a commonly used anaesthetic agent. Local application to the cervix and&#xD;
      intrauterine use of lidocaine during various gynaecological procedures have been evaluated in&#xD;
      several studies and no severe side effects were reported.&#xD;
