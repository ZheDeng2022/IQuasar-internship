  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized single arm interventional&#xD;
      investigation with the TSP Crosser Transseptal Access System, a new complete solution for&#xD;
      transseptal puncture and left atrial access and catheter navigation, for patients with atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation ablation referred for radiofrequency catheter ablation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transseptal (TS) catheterization is a critical step for left atrial (LA) interventions&#xD;
      (atrial fibrillation ablation, LA appendage closure, mitral valve interventions). The&#xD;
      availability of suitable tools and techniques is essential to safely perform the TS puncture,&#xD;
      effectively deliver radiofrequency lesions, deploy LA devices, and anticipate difficult&#xD;
      procedural situations in which complications may arise. This study is intended to assess the&#xD;
      safety, performance and usability of the TSP Crosser System in facilitating access to the&#xD;
      left atrium and catheter navigation to the pulmonary veins (PV) during catheter based&#xD;
      ablation procedures for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). Moreover, the study will&#xD;
      assess the impact of the TSP Crosser System on procedural times, including time to achieve&#xD;
      left atrial accesses, total procedure times, total fluoroscopy time, left atrial mapping time&#xD;
      and radiofrequency isolation times. The study is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized&#xD;
      single arm interventional investigation. Enrolled subjects who meet the study&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated during the catheter mapping and ablation&#xD;
      procedures and followed until release from hospital post procedure per institutional standard&#xD;
      of care. After 30 days, patient will be contacted by telephone to obtain information on their&#xD;
      clinical condition and any adverse events; if necessary, a clinic visit may be performed when&#xD;
      required by the physician.&#xD;
