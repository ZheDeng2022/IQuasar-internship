    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if pazopanib when given in&#xD;
      combination with topotecan can help to control sarcomas. The safety of this drug combination&#xD;
      will also be studied. Pazopanib hydrochloride and topotecan hydrochloride may stop the growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine progression free rate at week 12 for patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS)&#xD;
      treated with pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride) plus oral topotecan (topotecan&#xD;
      hydrochloride).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate for patients with STS treated with combination&#xD;
      pazopanib and topotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the clinical benefit rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] +&#xD;
      stable disease [SD]) for patients with STS treated with combination pazopanib and topotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine median progression-free rate (PFR) for patients with STS treated with&#xD;
      combination pazopanib and topotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate overall survival (OS) for patients with STS treated with combination&#xD;
      pazopanib and topotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess safety and tolerability for patients treated with combination pazopanib and&#xD;
      topotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To estimate the PFR for patients with osteosarcoma treated with combination pazopanib and&#xD;
      topotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To estimate the PFR for patients with liposarcoma treated with combination pazopanib and&#xD;
      topotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the correlation of PFR and OS to levels of soluble vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor receptor 2 (sVEGFR2) and phosphatidylinositol-glycan biosynthesis class F (PIGF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and&#xD;
      topotecan hydrochloride PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or until discontinuation per patient&#xD;
      preference or physician recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 or 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

    <measure>Progression Free Survival at 12 Weeks for Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS) Treated With Pazopanib and Oral Topotecan</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 weeks from treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>PFS will be defined from the time of enrollment to the study until progression of disease or death from any cause, as assessed by RECIST 1.1 and measured at 12 weeks after treatment initiation for patients with STS. PFS estimates will be calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods&#xD;
Progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the Longest Diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Progression must also involve an increase in size of measurable lesions by at least 5 mm, to minimize the possibility that small changes in a small number of target lesions is falsely interpreted as progression.</description>

             have elapsed between anti-hypertensive medication initiation or adjustment and BP&#xD;
             measurement; these three values should be averaged to obtain the mean diastolic blood&#xD;
             pressure and the mean systolic blood pressure; the mean SBP / DBP ratio must be &lt;&#xD;
             140/90 mmHg (or 150/90 mm Hg, if this criterion deemed safe by principal investigator&#xD;
             [PI] and the quality assurance monitor [QAM]) in order for a patient to be eligible&#xD;
             for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic&#xD;
             attack (TIA), pulmonary embolism, or untreated deep venous thrombosis (DVT); patients&#xD;

             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery or trauma within 28 days prior to first dose of investigational product&#xD;
             and/or presence of any non-healing wound, fracture, or ulcer (procedures such as&#xD;
             catheter placement not considered to be major surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active bleeding or bleeding diathesis&#xD;

                  however, endobronchial lesions in the segmented bronchi are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Lesions extensively infiltrating the main or lobar bronchi are excluded; however,&#xD;
                  minor infiltrations in the wall of the bronchi are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent hemoptysis (&gt;= 1/2 teaspoon [2.5 mL]) of red blood within 8 weeks before first&#xD;
             dose of study drug&#xD;

             could interfere with patient's safety, provision of informed consent, or compliance to&#xD;
             study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable or unwilling to discontinue use of inducers and inhibitors of cytochrome P450&#xD;
             (CYP450) listed for at least 14 days or five half-lives of a drug (whichever is&#xD;
             longer) prior to the first dose of study drug and for the duration of the study;&#xD;
             cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) substrates can be&#xD;
             administered, but investigators will need to be aware of possible increased or&#xD;
             decreased effectiveness of the non-study drug and this should be recorded in&#xD;
             concomitant medications; breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and p-glycoprotein&#xD;
             (PgP) inducers and inhibitors will be also prohibited&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any of the following anti-cancer therapies:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiation therapy, surgery or tumor embolization within 14 days prior to the&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, investigational therapy or&#xD;
                  hormonal therapy within 14 days or five half-lives of a drug (whichever is&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Administration of any non-oncologic investigational drug within 30 days or 5&#xD;
             half-lives whichever is longer prior to receiving the first dose of study treatment&#xD;

             that is progressing in severity (exceptions include alopecia, fatigue, and hematologic&#xD;
             toxicities)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs&#xD;
             chemically related to pazopanib or topotecan&#xD;

        <title>Progression Free Survival at 12 Weeks for Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS) Treated With Pazopanib and Oral Topotecan</title>
        <description>PFS will be defined from the time of enrollment to the study until progression of disease or death from any cause, as assessed by RECIST 1.1 and measured at 12 weeks after treatment initiation for patients with STS. PFS estimates will be calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods&#xD;
Progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the Longest Diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Progression must also involve an increase in size of measurable lesions by at least 5 mm, to minimize the possibility that small changes in a small number of target lesions is falsely interpreted as progression.</description>

      <time_frame>Adverse Events (AE) data was collected for each patient from treatment initiation until 30 days post last treatment, at the beginning of each cycle where 1 cycle=28 days. Range of cycles completed by patients 1-33 cycles. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) data is collected from the time of consent (regardless of if a patient initiates treatment) until 30 days post last treatment. All cause mortality was collected for patients who initiated treatment, and up to 5 years post treatment discontinuation.</time_frame>
      <desc>Data entry is currently being completed for the most recent patients - this Section will be updated with final adverse event data at the end of the study. Due to data collection methods some SAE data may also be included in Other AE as well as in Serious Adverse Event Section. Patients who signed consent/did not initiate treatment are included as at risk for SAE but not at risk for other AEs due to 5 out of 26 screenfail patients experiencing an SAE.</desc>
