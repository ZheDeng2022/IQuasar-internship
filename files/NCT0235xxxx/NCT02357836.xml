  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacodynamics effects of itraconazole in&#xD;
      early-stage non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 0 clinical trial. While clinical data including safety will be recorded, the&#xD;
      principal outcomes are pharmacodynamic endpoints. Specifically, the investigators seek to&#xD;
      identify: (1) effects of itraconazole on tumor angiogenesis, (2) effects of itraconazole on&#xD;
      the Hh pathway, (3) biomarker predictors of these effects, (4) the correlation between&#xD;
      itraconazole pharmacokinetics and these effects, (5) the correlation between different&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 15 eligible patients with previously diagnosed or suspected NSCLC planned for resection&#xD;
      will undergo a study-specific core needle biopsy, imaging (dynamic contrast enhanced [DCE]-,&#xD;
      diffusion weighted imaging [DWI]-, and arterial spin labeling [ASL] magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging [MRI]), skin punch biopsy, and collection of peripheral blood. Subjects will then&#xD;
      receive itraconazole 600 mg PO daily for 7-10 days, following which they will undergo repeat&#xD;
      imaging, skin biopsy, and blood collection. Subsequently they will undergo surgical&#xD;
      resection. Due to the safety profile of itraconazole when used as an antifungal agent , all&#xD;
      histologic subtypes of NSCLC will be eligible for the trial. The itraconazole dose of 600 mg,&#xD;
      higher than an anti-angiogenic dose, has been shown to inhibit the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway.&#xD;

    <description>Once on study, itraconazole will be taken twice daily for a total of 10-14 days. After being on itraconazole for 7-10 days, &quot;Post-treatment&quot; assessments will include a skin biopsy, blood draw for the PK (pharmacokinetics) analyses and the cytokine panel, and also MRI evaluations (anticipated to last 45-50 minutes). Toxicity assessments and laboratory checks will also be conducted during that time. Following these assessments, itraconazole will be continued until the day of surgery. At the time of surgical resection, a tissue sample (with adjacent normal tissue as per standard resection technique) will be obtained to complete the analysis. Following resection, subjects will be followed per standard post-operative procedure.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically or cytologically proven NSCLC planned for surgical resection. All NSCLC&#xD;
             histologic subtypes are eligible. Alternatively, patients in whom a diagnosis of NSCLC&#xD;
             is highly suspected based on history and imaging studies and who are, therefore,&#xD;

             screening, enrollment, and study treatment if they meet all additional eligibility&#xD;
             criteria. In the event that biopsies do not confirm NSCLC, such patients will be&#xD;
             removed from study but monitored for any adverse events resulting from study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;

             anti-convulsants, corticosteroids). See 3.5 Drug Interactions in protocol.&#xD;

          7. Current evidence of hyperthyroidism (which would increase metabolism of itraconazole).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pregnant or lactating female or any female trying to get pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Claustrophobia that would interfere with MRI studies anticipated to last 45-50&#xD;
             minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Metal implants deemed at risk for migration during MRI studies.&#xD;

Itraconazole: Once on study, itraconazole will be taken twice daily for a total of 10-14 days. After being on itraconazole for 7-10 days, &quot;Post-treatment&quot; assessments will include a skin biopsy, blood draw for the PK analyses and the cytokine panel, and also MRI evaluations (anticipated to last 45-50 minutes). Toxicity assessments and laboratory checks will also be conducted during that time. Following these assessments, itraconazole will be continued until the day of surgery. At the time of surgical resection, a tissue sample (with adjacent normal tissue as per standard resection technique) will be obtained to complete the analysis. Following resection, subjects will be followed per standard post-operative procedure.</description>

Toxicity assessments and laboratory checks will also be conducted during that time. Following these assessments, itraconazole will be continued until the day of surgery. At the time of surgical resection, a tissue sample (with adjacent normal tissue as per standard resection technique) will be obtained to complete the analysis.
