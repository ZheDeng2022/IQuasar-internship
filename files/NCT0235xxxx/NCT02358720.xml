      This study is a prospective, randomized, monocentre, controlled explorative study in the&#xD;
      parallel-group design to determine the pain relief after RT of patients with spinal bone&#xD;
      metastases. Thereby two different techniques were evaluated: single fraction IMRT with 1 x 24&#xD;
      Gy versus fractionated RT with 10 x 3 Gy. Prior to their enrolment into the study, the&#xD;
      patients will undergo a staging of the vertebral column in connection with their&#xD;
      radiation-planning computed tomography (CT) and MRI to measure the myelon dimension. After&#xD;
      the baseline results have been recorded, the patients will be randomized into one of the two&#xD;
      groups: single-fraction IMRT 1 x 24 Gy (n = 30) or fractionated RT 10 x 3 Gy (n = 30). The&#xD;
      target parameters will be measured and recorded at baseline, at the end of RT (t1) and twelve&#xD;
      weeks (t2) and six months following the end of the irradiation period (t3).&#xD;

      The patients will be given information on the study by the medical personnel of the&#xD;
      Radiotherapy Department in connection with the planning of the RT schedule (approximately 1-2&#xD;
      weeks prior to the start of RT). If they are interested in participating in the study, the&#xD;
      potential study candidates will be given the Patient Information sheet including the&#xD;
      Declaration of Informed Consent, with the request that they reread the information carefully&#xD;
      and if they consent to the conditions return the signed declaration when they attend the next&#xD;
      appointment. The patients will be given the opportunity to ask the study staff further&#xD;
      questions. Among the preconditions for participation in the study is the condition that no&#xD;
      metastatic spinal cord compression (tumor distance &gt; 3 mm to myelon) of the metastasized&#xD;
      vertebral body is detected in MRI recorded in the course of planning procedure. A block&#xD;
      randomization procedure shall be used to ensure the even distribution of the patients into&#xD;
      the two intervention groups, stratified to baseline pain level. The patients shall then be&#xD;
      assigned 1:1 to one of the two treatment groups on the basis of the baseline measurements.&#xD;
      The randomization procedure shall be carried out by a central office. The study personnel&#xD;
      responsible for the recruitment and baseline measurements shall have no access to the&#xD;
      randomization list, and the study director no influence on the recruitment of the patients.&#xD;
      The recruitment phase shall be concluded with the attainment of the planned number of&#xD;
      patients (60 patients in total). It shall last twelve months, and is scheduled to start in&#xD;
      December 2014. Regular study participation shall end six months after enrolment into the&#xD;
      study or, where applicable, with the respective patient's death. The aim of the trial was to&#xD;
      evaluate the pain relief after RT of patients with spinal bone metastases. Thereby two&#xD;
      different techniques were evaluated: single fraction IMRT with 1 x 24 Gy versus fractionated&#xD;
      RT with 10 x 3 Gy. The primary endpoint was defined as pain relief &gt; 2 points according to&#xD;
      visual analog scale (VAS) measured at the irradiated region up to three months after the end&#xD;
      of RT (t2). Secondary endpoints were quality of life (QoL), fatigue, pain, overall survival,&#xD;
      bone survival, local control, pathological fracture, and neurological deficit. The baseline&#xD;
      examination shall be carried out on the first day of radiotherapy prior to the start of&#xD;
      therapy and is scheduled to comprise the comprehensive recording of the sociodemographic&#xD;
      data, the recording of the current pain situation, the fear of suffering fractures, the&#xD;
      quality of life, and the current degree of fatigue. The follow-up examinations shall take&#xD;
      place after the end of radiotherapy (day of the last fraction) and twelve weeks and six&#xD;
      months after radiotherapy, measuring those parameters recorded at the baseline examination.&#xD;
      The further follow-up examinations shall correspond to those carried out as standard&#xD;
      after-care investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints such as fatigue, quality of life, and anxiety shall be recorded using&#xD;
      validated questionnaires (EORTC QLQ FA13 (11), EORTC QLQ BM22 (12) and the questionnaire to&#xD;
      record stress in cancer patients (FBK) according to Book et al. (13). All patients will also&#xD;
      be asked to record their pain history using a pain diary (documentation of medication daily&#xD;
      during treatment, once weekly after the end of treatment, VAS pain scale). Furthermore, the&#xD;
      local control was assessed by means of CT images taken prior to, three and six months after&#xD;
      RT. The pain response was documented on the VAS (range 0-10). Complete response (CR) was&#xD;
      defined as VAS = 0 after three and six months, partial response (PR) as an improvement by at&#xD;
      least two score points after three and six months, according to the international consensus&#xD;
      response categories by Chow et al. (14). Overall survival (OS) was defined as time from&#xD;
      initial diagnosis until death, bone survival as time from initial diagnosis of spinal bone&#xD;
      metastasis until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy Immobilization was assessed with Aquaplast head mask®, vacuum mattress and&#xD;
      Wingstep®. On the basis of the planning-CT risk organs and clinical target volume (CTV) were&#xD;
      contoured. CTV confirmed planning target volume (PTV). The dose of PTV occured at the&#xD;
      80%-isodose, encircling the PTV. The RT procedure in group A was conducted as IMRT&#xD;
      (Tomotherapy or Step-and-shoot IMRT) 24 Gy in a single-fraction occured at the 80%-isodose.&#xD;
      In group B, RT was performed as irradiation of the involved vertebral body as well as the&#xD;
      ones immediately above and below to a total-dose of 30 Gy with a single daily dose of 3 Gy&#xD;
      using 6 MV individually-formed beams (Linac, multileaf collimator) after CT-scan based 3D&#xD;
      planning. The tolerance doses of organs at risk were used according RTOG 0631 study.&#xD;
