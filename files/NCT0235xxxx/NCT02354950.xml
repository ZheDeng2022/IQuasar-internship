  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, open-label, parallel group, two-part, single-dose adaptive study in&#xD;
      adults with moderate and mild (if needed) hepatic impairment and matched, healthy control&#xD;
      subjects with normal hepatic function. In Part 1, healthy control subjects (n=8) matched to&#xD;
      subjects with moderate (n=8) hepatic impairment will be enrolled. If the geometric mean total&#xD;
      plasma area under the concentration-time curve from time zero (pre-dose) extrapolated to&#xD;
      infinite time (AUC[0-infinity]) of GSK1265744 is increased by &gt;2-fold in moderately impaired&#xD;
      subjects relative to matched controls, Part 2 will be conducted to evaluate GSK1265744 PK in&#xD;
      subjects with mild hepatic impairment (n=8) and matched, control subjects (n=8). All subjects&#xD;
      will receive a single 30 milligram (mg) oral dose of GSK1265744. The primary objective of the&#xD;
      study is to compare plasma PK parameters of GSK1265744 in subjects with hepatic impairment to&#xD;
      healthy controls matched in gender, age, and body mass index (BMI).&#xD;
