  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a retrospective, observational study. A group of 5 subjects with the&#xD;
      AttuneTM cruciate retaining (CR) fixed bearing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are analysed&#xD;
      during level walking, a deep knee bend, sitting down onto a chair, standing up from a chair&#xD;
      and stair descent at least 12 months post-operatively, in terms of 3D fluoroscopic assessed&#xD;
      tibio-femoral TKA motion as well as simultaneous skin marker assessed whole leg motion and&#xD;
      ground reaction forces. The obtained information helps the manufacturer (DePuy) to evaluate,&#xD;
      bring to market and advance the implant. Furthermore the information will be integrated in a&#xD;
      model, which will be developed at the Center for Orthopaedic Engineering, University of&#xD;
      Denver. By means of this model, different conditions such as the use of an advanced&#xD;
      prosthesis design can be simulated and tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is in a first step to demonstrate the capability of data&#xD;
      collection and analysis of level gait, deep knee bend, sitting down onto a chair, standing up&#xD;
      from a chair and stair descent on a limited sample size of five subjects. Secondly to&#xD;
      quantify and describe the three-dimensional kinematics for the cruciate retaining (CR), fixed&#xD;
      bearing AttuneTM TKA during daily activities such as those mentioned.&#xD;

        Prof. Dr. med. Carsten Perka will do the recruitment, since he is the surgeon that worked&#xD;
        the most with this implant and therefore also has the biggest population of possibly&#xD;
        eligible patients. Furthermore the patients already know and trust him, which could lead to&#xD;
        a greater success in the recruitment as well. For these reasons the financial source DePuy&#xD;
        Synthes, Johnson and Johnson, requires that the clinical collaborator Prof. Dr. med.&#xD;
        Carsten Perka will do the recruitment. He works in the Charité in Berlin, Germany, where he&#xD;
        does the recruitment.&#xD;
