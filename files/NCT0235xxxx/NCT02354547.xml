    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the dose limiting toxicities and recommended phase&#xD;
      2 dose of SGT-53 alone and in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide in pediatric&#xD;
      patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The p53 is a vital human tumor suppressor gene. Loss of p53 suppressor function is present in&#xD;
      the majority of human cancers. The p53 protein has a diverse range of functions including&#xD;
      regulation of cell cycle checkpoints, cell death (apoptosis), senescence, DNA repair,&#xD;
      maintenance of genomic integrity, and control of angiogenesis. Abnormalities of the p53 gene&#xD;
      may impact the efficacy of standard anticancer treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy.&#xD;
      P53 mutation and pathway dysfunction are associated with poor clinical outcomes and the&#xD;
      presence of the p53 mutation correlates with resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. The&#xD;
      development of somatic gene therapy has created the potential to restore wild type function&#xD;
      of p53. SGT-53 is a complex of cationic liposome encapsulating a normal human wild type p53&#xD;
      DNA sequence in a plasmid backbone. This complex has been shown to efficiently and&#xD;
      specifically deliver the p53 cDNA to the tumor cells. Introduction of the p53 cDNA sequence&#xD;
      is expected to restore wtp53 function in the apoptotic pathway. P53 restoration has been&#xD;
      shown most effective in enhancing cytotoxicity in combination with an agent which results in&#xD;
      DNA damage or initiates apoptosis. Though mutated p53 is uncommon in childhood cancer,&#xD;
      children with adrenocortical tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma have been found to have p53&#xD;
      mutations. Additionally, wild type p53 may be suppressed in tumors through pathway crosstalk.&#xD;
      For example, in sarcomas, a common childhood solid tumor, activation of MDM2 effectively&#xD;
      inactivates p53. Thus, the treatment proposed in this trial to reintroduce p53 may offer&#xD;
      benefit even in patients with p53 wild-type tumors. Moreover, the SGT-53 treatment can&#xD;
      significantly sensitize pediatric cancer cell lines to the killing effect of the standard&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents, topotecan and cyclophosphamide. Thus, we propose to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of this combination therapy in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid&#xD;
      tumors. This phase I clinical trial is to determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLT),&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SGT-53 (if reached) alone and&#xD;
      in combination with conventional chemotherapy in pediatric patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      refractory solid tumors. In addition, pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of SGT-53 is&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;

    <description>There will be 4-6 cycles (21 days/cycle) of therapy in this trial. In cycle 1, SGT-53 will be given as a single agent twice weekly starting at 1.4 mg/m² of DNA per infusion to evaluate single-agent toxicity. Pharmacokinetic studies will be performed. In the absence of dose limiting toxicity, patients will proceed to cycle 2 even if they have progressive disease. Starting in cycle 2, SGT-53 will be administered twice-weekly in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide administered daily for 5 days, days 1-5 of each cycle. Day 1 of each combination cycle is the first day on which topotecan and cyclophosphamide are administered with SGT-53. If a subject has at least stable disease after four cycles of therapy and is tolerating protocol therapy, two additional cycles may be considered.</description>

    <description>The starting dose of SGT-53 will be 1.4 mg DNA/m² (dose level 1). If MTD is reached at dose level 1, subsequent cohort will be treated at 0.7 mg DNA/m² (dose level -1). If MTD is not reached at 2.1 mg DNA/m² (dose level 2), additional dose level(s) may be added. Intra-patient escalation is not allowed. Topotecan/cyclophosphamide will not be administered in cycle 1. In cycle 2, SGT-53 will be administered in combination with 0.6 mg/m² topotecan and 200 mg/m² cyclophosphamide IV daily for 5 days. Beginning in cycle 3, if no DLTs in cycle 2, topotecan and cyclophosphamide will be escalated to 0.75 mg/m² and 250 mg/m², respectively. No further dose escalation is permitted. If DLT develops at the higher doses, the doses should be decreased back to those in cycle 2.</description>
