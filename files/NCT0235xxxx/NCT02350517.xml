      This phase Ⅱ study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of endostar combined with&#xD;
      paclitaxel and nedaplatin as first-line therapy in treating patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic esophageal squamous cell cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell cancer is poor. However,&#xD;
      there is still no standard chemotherapy regimen recommended for this disease because of the&#xD;
      lack of trails. Currently, anti-angiogenesis therapy had been proved to improve the survival&#xD;
      successfully in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, glioma and&#xD;
      kidney cancer. Recent studies showed that the high level of VEGF was negative correlated with&#xD;
      the prognosis of esophageal cancer. Endostar, as a novel endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors,&#xD;
      was proved to significantly inhibited the proliferation and metastasis in esophageal cell&#xD;
      lines and animal models. A retrospective study also reported the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      combination therapy of paclitaxel liposome and recombinant human endostatin. Based on the&#xD;
      basis above, we designed this phase Ⅱ study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of endostar&#xD;
      combined with paclitaxel and nedaplatin as first-line therapy in treating patients with&#xD;
      recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell cancer.&#xD;
