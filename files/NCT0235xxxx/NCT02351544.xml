  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the peripheral trigger theory of migraine headaches, nociceptive inputs from&#xD;
      irritated or compressed cranial nerve branches can lead to neurovascular changes in the brain&#xD;
      that cause migraine headaches. Advanced treatments aimed at deactivating the peripheral&#xD;
      trigger points can be administered to patients who have failed medical management of&#xD;
      migraines. Those accepted advanced treatments include botulinum toxin A injection in order to&#xD;
      temporarily paralyze muscles causing nerve compression, and surgery to release those&#xD;
      compression points permanently. An advantage of surgery is the ability to release&#xD;
      non-muscular causes of nerve compression, such as fascial bands or intersecting arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin A injection into trigger sites has been shown in multiple studies to be&#xD;
      effective at reducing the frequency and severity of migraine headaches, and is a very&#xD;
      commonly administered treatment for refractory migraines. It is approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic migraines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, surgical decompression of trigger sites has previously been shown to have superior&#xD;
      clinical outcomes to medical management, through a randomized, blinded controlled-trial&#xD;
      performed at Case Western Reserve in 2009. Patients either received actual decompression of&#xD;
      the trigger sites, or sham surgery (exposure and visualization of the trigger sites, without&#xD;
      decompression). At one-year follow-up, the group who underwent actual surgery demonstrated a&#xD;
      statistically higher proportion with significant improvement in their migraines (83.7% vs.&#xD;
      57.7%, p=0.014), and with complete elimination of their migraines (57.1% vs. 3.8%, p&lt;0.001).&#xD;
      Several other reports have confirmed the good clinical outcomes of surgery demonstrated in&#xD;
      this trial, and surgical decompression is now commonly performed by several surgeons around&#xD;
      the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prognostic factors predicting the success of surgical decompression in migraine headache&#xD;
      treatment include older age of migraine onset, visual symptoms/aura, and 4-site&#xD;
      decompression. Factors predicting failure of surgery include excessive operative blood loss,&#xD;
      and surgery on only one or two trigger sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One criticism of the studies on peripheral trigger decompression surgery for migraines has&#xD;
      been that most of the results have originated from the same institution (Case Western&#xD;
      Reserve), and from the same author (Guyuron). While several studies at other institutions&#xD;
      have demonstrated positive outcomes of peripheral trigger decompression, these have only&#xD;
      included a small number of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the sham surgery randomized-controlled trial has been criticized for not&#xD;
      clarifying any prior treatments that patients had undergone before peripheral trigger&#xD;
      deactivation, and for not showing how medication use patterns changed after surgery. Another&#xD;
      criticism of that study was the fact that patients were examined by neurologists before the&#xD;
      study but not after the study, and that surgery was performed on some patients with episodic&#xD;
      migraines, who are known to not benefit from botulinum toxin. It is unclear what migraine&#xD;
      types are most likely to benefit from surgical decompression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' goal is to perform a multi-center, prospective trial to demonstrate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of peripheral trigger decompression in the treatment of migraine headaches,&#xD;
      which would address the criticisms mentioned above. The main aim is to demonstrate that the&#xD;
      positive results demonstrated by Guyuron et al are reproducible at other institutions and by&#xD;
      other surgeons using similar techniques on different patient populations.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with migraines related to a trigger site at the location of a branch of a&#xD;
             cranial nerve (frontal, temporal, occipital)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with chronic migraine (≥15 days per month) as dictated by the FDA indication&#xD;
             for botulinum, and as diagnosed by a board-certified neurologist&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with episodic migraines&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Those patients are included because there is no consensus whether surgical&#xD;
                  decompression is effective for chronic migraines only, or for chronic and&#xD;
                  episodic migraines. One of the goals of this trial is to determine this.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who respond to diagnostic botulinum toxin injection or to a diagnostic&#xD;
             anesthetic block&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have failed 2 of 3 classes of preventative migraine medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients deemed by the authors or the neurologist to not have migraine headaches, but&#xD;
             an alternative diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with systemic conditions that make them poor candidates for surgery (coronary&#xD;
             artery disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, etc…)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with migraines related to inferior turbinate hypertrophy or septal deviation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a frontal, temporal or occipital trigger point who do not respond to a&#xD;
             diagnostic botulinum toxin injection or to a diagnostic anesthetic block&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to any botulinum toxin preparation or to any of the components in the&#xD;
             formulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infection at the proposed injection site for botulinum&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with trigger points at minor trigger sites (lesser occipital nerve, third&#xD;
             occipital nerve)&#xD;
