      This study plans to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of [68Ga]-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide&#xD;
      ([68Ga]-DOTATOC) as an accurate imaging technique for diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of&#xD;
      response to treatment in patients with Somatostatin receptor expressing tumors who undergo&#xD;
      imaging with a clinical indication. The investigators will conduct a study for 68Ga-DOTATOC&#xD;
      as a diagnostic PET/CT imaging agent for the detection of NETs, mainly carcinoid tumors.&#xD;
      68Ga-DOTATOC will be used in diagnostic assessment of patients with known or suspected NETs&#xD;
      for whom there is an appropriate standard clinical indication for 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT either&#xD;
      at staging or during follow up.&#xD;

      Rationale and overall study design This study is planned to demonstrate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of [68Ga]-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide ([68Ga]-DOTATOC) as an accurate imaging technique for&#xD;
      diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of response to treatment in patients with Somatostatin&#xD;
      receptor expressing tumors who undergo imaging with a clinical indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are rare neoplasms of neuroendocrine origin. Neuroendocrine&#xD;
      tumors are solid malignant tumors that arise from dispersed neuroendocrine cells found&#xD;
      throughout the body. They are well known for their heterogeneity which makes it difficult to&#xD;
      obtain uniform clinical data and establish universal guidelines for the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of NETs. NETs are characterized by overexpression of somatostatin receptors, which&#xD;
      can be visualized and targeted by radiolabeled somatostatin analogues.&#xD;
      111In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-octreotide scintigraphy (111In-Octreotide) with&#xD;
      single photon emission tomography (SPECT) is currently the standard imaging modality for&#xD;
      evaluating patients with NETs. 111In Octreotide is the only FDA approved radiopharmaceutical&#xD;
      available on the market for assessing the extent of involvement by NETs at both staging and&#xD;
      follow up periods. However, the sensitivity of this imaging modality is lower compared to the&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer 68Ga-DOTA0-Tyr3]octreotide (68Ga-DOTA-TOC).&#xD;
      Based on the improved sensitivity, 68Ga DOTATOC PET leads to significant changes in 30% of&#xD;
      patients. Importantly, the radiation exposure of 68Ga-DOTATOC PET is lower than that of 111In&#xD;
      Octreotide and also the imaging with 68Ga-DOTATOC PET scan yields fast read-outs on the same&#xD;
      day compared to 24-48 hour read-outs with 111In Octreotide scan. These advantages make the&#xD;
      68Ga labeled somatostatin analog more attractive from both the patient and management&#xD;
      perspectives. The improved resolution and quantitation of uptake obtained with Ga-68 DOTATOC&#xD;
      PET should provide a more accurate assessment of somatostatin receptor density, which will&#xD;
      lead to a more accurate prediction of treatment response to somatostatin analogues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the investment costs for the scanner, the radiochemistry equipment are higher for&#xD;
      68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT compared with 111In-DTPA-octreotide scintigraphy and SPECT, with the&#xD;
      provision of this imaging molecule by an established commercial radiopharmaceutical company&#xD;
      that in with compliance to FDA 21 CFR Part 212 IBA Molecular Inc, NJ, USA, this will not pose&#xD;
      a limitation for the Mount Sinai Medical Center. In this setting, 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT&#xD;
      production and personnel costs will be borne by the commercial entity, however, Mount Sinai&#xD;
      Medical Center will purchase the 68Ga-DOTATOC based on a per patient schedule. Since this&#xD;
      imaging modality does not have a quote for reimbursement by the insurance carriers, the&#xD;
      imaging cost is considered a potential burden on the patient until it is approved by the U.S.&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA). There is significant amount of European based clinical&#xD;
      data (&gt;1000 patients) to prove the safety and efficacy of this imaging agent, therefore, a&#xD;
      phase II or III clinical trial in the US is redundant and will only delay the approval of&#xD;
      this imaging probe. Recently, Ga-68 DOTATOC has been designated as an orphan drug by the FDA&#xD;
      for the management of NET. This designation will probably lead to faster approval of the&#xD;
      agent, which would greatly benefit NET patients in the US. Currently, there are only several&#xD;
      small U.S.-based clinical trials for Ga-68 labeled NET PET agents available for patients;&#xD;
      otherwise they must travel out of the country if the scan is required to manage their&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators, therefore, aim to provide this superior imaging technique to NET patients&#xD;
      for better disease management by the referring physicians, however, this objective cannot be&#xD;
      attained unless at least a partial funding mechanism exists to make it affordable by the&#xD;
      patients until the approval of this superior imaging probe. In this regard, the investigators&#xD;
      are aiming at recovering the cost of the radiotracer from the local insurance carrier through&#xD;
      the cost recovery system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Enrollment Participants will be recruited from the Mount Sinai Medical Center.&#xD;
      Participants who will be approached regarding the study are those individuals who are being&#xD;
      seen for known or suspected malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may remain on their somatostatin therapies throughout the study with no management&#xD;
      change merely based on the 68Ga -DOTATOC PET/CT imaging findings. The management of these&#xD;
      patients will be based on the standard of care and any change will be at the discretion of&#xD;
      the referring physician. All pertinent dosing information must be collected and reported.&#xD;
