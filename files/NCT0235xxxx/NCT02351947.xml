      The purpose of this research study is to improve methods for evaluation of brain changes&#xD;
      during motor learning for patients with stroke, who have difficulty performing daily tasks&#xD;
      with their arm and hand. The methods for evaluation of brain changes will consist of the&#xD;
      combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A third of American Veterans is left with moderate to severe motor deficits after stroke.&#xD;
      Intensive rehabilitation can resolve some of these deficits. Motor function restoration is&#xD;
      associated with and dependent on reorganization of neuronal networks (i.e. plasticity).&#xD;
      However, our understanding of human brain plasticity during functional recovery is&#xD;
      incomplete. Furthermore, it is unknown what patterns of structural brain changes are&#xD;
      associated with greater gains in motor function as a result of motor learning therapy. The&#xD;
      main objective of the study is to characterize the reorganization of brain structure and&#xD;
      function that is associated with greater gains in motor function following restorative&#xD;
      rehabilitation for chronic survivors. This will further our understanding of recovery after&#xD;
      brain injury and subsequently assist in more accurately directing rehabilitation therapies to&#xD;
      produce the best possible outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two hypotheses are: I. There is reorganization of both movement control brain regions and&#xD;
      pathways between regions that is associated with functional motor recovery in response to&#xD;
      intensive motor learning after stroke; and II. For stroke victims with upper extremity&#xD;
      deficits, motor recovery is associated with changes in the sequential timing of activity&#xD;
      across cortical regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Methods. A cohort of chronic stroke survivors with upper extremity deficits will&#xD;
      be treated by our intensive multimodal 12-week motor learning program. Brain imaging&#xD;
      (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)) and&#xD;
      neurophysiological (Electroencephalogram (EEG)) studies as well as functional motor tests&#xD;
      (Arm Motor Activity test and Fugl-Meyer Coordination test) will be obtained before and after&#xD;
      the treatment. Age-matched control subjects will be evaluated as well. DTI/fMRI and EEG/fMRI&#xD;
      combination techniques will be used to determine changes in brain structure and function as a&#xD;
      result of the treatments. A regression analysis will determine which brain structure&#xD;
      parameters can predictor greater motor function gains.&#xD;
