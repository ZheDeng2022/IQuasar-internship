  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modern antiretroviral therapeutic regimens offer a vast array of choice that permits tailored&#xD;
      therapy for HIV patients. While modern regimens have improved the rates of virologic&#xD;
      suppression overall and reduced adverse effects of antiretroviral treatment, an important&#xD;
      sub-group of HIV infected persons is unable to maintain adherence to their treatment&#xD;
      regimens, fail to achieve long term virologic control and remain at risk for HIV related&#xD;
      disease progression and transmission of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: switching from current cART regimen to a Triumeq based regimen combined with&#xD;
      adherence support will improve the rate of HIV suppression in vulnerable populations&#xD;
      non-adherent to the their current cART as determined by the achievement of HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50&#xD;
      copies/mL at Week 24 post randomization.&#xD;

      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if switching from current cART regimen to a Triumeq based regimen combined with&#xD;
      adherence support will improve the rate of HIV suppression in vulnerable populations&#xD;
      non-adherent to the their current cART as determined by the achievement of HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50&#xD;
      copies/mL at Week 24 post randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vulnerable populations non-adherent to their current cART:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) To determine if switching from current cART to a Triumeq based regimen will improve the&#xD;
      average adherence of patients compared to maintaining current cART, measured at 24 weeks post&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) To determine if adherence is maintained over the long term (up to 72 weeks) in subjects&#xD;
      receiving Triumeq (iii) To evaluate the effect of switching to Triumeq on control of HIV&#xD;
      infection (as measured by HIV viral load and CD4 cell counts) up to 72 weeks (iv) To&#xD;
      determine the safety of using Triumeq with respect to risk for the emergence of HIV drug&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (vi) To assess the safety and tolerability (including hepatic function and metabolic&#xD;
      profiles) of switching from current cART regimen to Triumeq up to 72 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (vi) To evaluate if switching to Triumeq will be cost effective from a societal prospective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit from 14 CTN-affiliated sites across Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients recruited into the trial will be adults aged over 18 years old with documented&#xD;
      HIV infection (ELISA with western blot confirmation) and with negative HLA-B5701 testing.&#xD;
      Prescribed ART may include any DHHS recommended or alternative regimens, which the treating&#xD;
      physician considers, is appropriate for their patient (except dolutegravir) for at least 6&#xD;
      months. Subjects will have evidence of non-adherence to current ART regimen defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV RNA â‰¥400 copies/ml at least once in last 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of evidence of resistance to any component of the current regimen or Triumeq&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Viremia not explained by normal viral decay after initiating ART We anticipate that many&#xD;
           of recruited subjects will comprise people who inject drugs, Aborginal persons and&#xD;
           persons from ethnocultural communities however recruitment will not be limited to these&#xD;
           groups as others may be enrolled provided they meet the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, prospective, open-label study. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to switch to&#xD;
      Triumeq vs. to remain on current cART. Both groups will receive adherence support. Those&#xD;
      randomized to maintain current cART will be permitted to switch to Triumeq after 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      N = 100 100 patients (50/arm) will provide 80% power to detect a 25% difference in virologic&#xD;
      suppression rates between the two arms at 24 weeks. While this difference is large, for the&#xD;
      population we are targeting we consider that an improvement in virologic suppression rates of&#xD;
      at least this amount would be required to be clinically meaningful.&#xD;

    <description>To determine if switching from current cART to a Triumeq based regimen will improve the average adherence of patients compared to maintaining current cART, measured at 24 weeks post randomization. We will use a set of questionnaires:&#xD;
HIV treatment knowledge questionnaire: this questionnaire will help to identify any patients that may need psycho-education regarding HIV treatment (patients who failed to answer to any knowledge item)&#xD;
Experience of Close Relationships (ECR-short)&#xD;
