  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine if participation in a core stability physiotherapy group&#xD;
      programme can improve the balance of children with cerebral palsy. It is hypothesised that&#xD;
      teaching the children how and when to activate their deep core stabilising muscles may help&#xD;
      improve their body awareness and their ability to control their alignment and therefore&#xD;
      positively affect their balance. Children with cerebral palsy from the ages of 7 to 17, who&#xD;
      can walk independently, will be randomly selected to join either the control group or&#xD;
      intervention group, after completion of their baseline balance assessments. Each group will&#xD;
      be re-assessed after completion of their 4 week intervention or control period.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'Core Muscles' are defined as '29 pairs of muscles that support the lumbo-pelvic hip&#xD;
      complex in order to stabilize the spine, pelvis and kinetic chain during functional&#xD;
      movement'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core stability refers to the control, co-ordination and synergism required by the core&#xD;
      muscles for the maintenance of functional stability and balance. The role the core&#xD;
      musculature plays in movement and postural control is long established. The understanding&#xD;
      that our core muscles work in a feed-forward manner, laying the foundation of distal limb&#xD;
      movement, formed the basis for studies into the use of core stability training programmes,&#xD;
      such as pilates, core control training and spinal stability training, for improved postural&#xD;
      control and balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature is replete with studies investigating the use of core stability programmes for&#xD;
      varied populations from the adult population for chronic back pain to elite athletes for&#xD;
      injury prevention and performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies investigating its use in adults with postural control impairment due to upper motor&#xD;
      neuron lesions (UMN) from Multiple Sclerosis and Stroke showed positive effects on balance&#xD;
      and mobility. The randomised controlled trial, by Chung et al, looked at the effects of a 4&#xD;
      week core stability exercise class on Dynamic Balance and Gait Function of 16 stroke&#xD;
      patients. It showed a significant improvement of Timed-Up-And-Go (TUG) scores from 33.06&#xD;
      +-18.39sec to 27.64+- 13.73 sec (p=0.057) in the intervention group. Gait velocity (from&#xD;
      44.83+- 18.83 cm/s to 58.91 +- 18.21 ; p=0.024) and cadence ( from 74.55+- 13.85 steps/min to&#xD;
      84.07 +- 14.00 steps/min ; p=0.041) also showed significant improvement in the intervention&#xD;
      group. To date there are no studies investigating the use or potential benefit of specific&#xD;
      core stability intervention in the Cerebral Palsy (CP) population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CP describes a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture,&#xD;
      causing activity limitation, that are attributed to non- progressive disturbances that&#xD;
      occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain. It has been suggested that poor postural&#xD;
      control may underlie delays and deviations in motor skill acquisition and development&#xD;
      observed in children with CP. Therefore, it is important that treatment of children with CP&#xD;
      tries to improve postural control and the evidence suggesting postural control mechanisms in&#xD;
      school-age children with CP are modifiable signifies that this goal is achievable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young children with CP have been shown to use excessive, non-reciprocal trunk and hip muscle&#xD;
      activation during walking. It has been hypothesized that one reason for this may be their&#xD;
      need to compensate for poor control of their core deep stabilising muscles, thus limiting&#xD;
      their ability to control changes in their body's centre of mass (COM) during dynamic&#xD;
      movements. To understand this further we must look closer at the different functions of the&#xD;
      core muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The core muscles can be separated into large-lever, superficial global muscles, including the&#xD;
      rectus abdominis and psoas major, that function as primary movers and smaller, deep, local&#xD;
      muscles, including the Transverse Abdominis and Internal oblique, that function as primary&#xD;
      stabilisers. It is postulated that if the deep stabilisers are not adequately functioning,&#xD;
      then postural control is assisted by secondary compensatory activation of other muscles that&#xD;
      typically function as primary movers like the hip flexors, knee flexors and spinal extensors.&#xD;
      When a primary mover is being used to compensate for deep stabilisers, it becomes less&#xD;
      efficient in its role in mobilizing and posturally adjusting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ineffective deep stabilizing system also limits the ability of the body to maintain the&#xD;
      joints in a position where muscles are at a mechanical advantage. This can have an added&#xD;
      'weakening' effect on muscles that are essential for postural control, like the gluteus&#xD;
      medius, as it reduces their force-generating capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure changes in performance on a series of static, anticipatory and reactive&#xD;
           balance tasks using three dimensional motion analysis in children who participate in&#xD;
           core stability (intervention group) compared to children who continue their usual care&#xD;
           (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare changes in functional balance tests of the intervention group to the control&#xD;
           group&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To analyse qualitative data from a post intervention questionnaire to determine the&#xD;
           broader effects of the 'Core stability' group intervention on the child's real life&#xD;
           function, participation and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to investigate the effects of a treatment intervention on children with&#xD;
      Cerebral Palsy (CP). It is best research practice to choose a homogenous group of&#xD;
      participants for meaningful results. It has been shown that in relation to balance of&#xD;
      ambulatory children with spastic CP, a functional classification system (Gross motor Function&#xD;
      Classification System-GMFCS level) can be used to group children more homogenously than&#xD;
      traditional classification by diagnosis. On this basis, it was decided to include children&#xD;
      with GMFCS levels I and II. Ambulatory children with a GMFCS classification level III were&#xD;
      excluded as most studies showed a large gap in balance abilities between levels II to III.&#xD;
      This would lead to a much greater variance in the participant sample.The Central Remedial&#xD;
      Clinic (CRC) database of clients attending Clondalkin or Clontarf physiotherapy services will&#xD;
      be used to generate a list of clients aged 7 to 17, with spastic CP diplegia or hemiplegia&#xD;
      GMFCs level I or II for each centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study inclusion/exclusion criteria will then be applied to this list. The clients not&#xD;
      meeting the inclusion criteria or those meeting the exclusion criteria will be removed. The&#xD;
      remaining clients will be invited to participate in the study and a list will be generated of&#xD;
      participants who agree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resulting list will be split into 2 separate age groups (Age 7-12 years and Age 13-17&#xD;
      years) and unique identifying numbers will be assigned to each client on the day of their&#xD;
      initial baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clients will be assessed in groups of a minimum of 6 and maximum of 12 and will be&#xD;
      randomised according to the procedure detailed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated in Stata IC 13 (StataCorp, Texas, USA) using step length as&#xD;
      the primary outcome measure. A previous study comparing gait in CP and typically developing&#xD;
      children over level and uneven ground found a mean difference of 9cm (standard deviation 9cm)&#xD;
      in step length between groups (Malone et al 2014, submitted for publication). With a power of&#xD;
      0.9 and significance level of 0.05, a sample size of 22 in each group was derived, giving a&#xD;
      total of 44. To allow for a 10% drop out, it was decided to enroll 48 participants to the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomisation procedure will be carried out by an individual blinded to both the treatment&#xD;
      and assessment procedure. The unique identifying number of the individual and their group&#xD;
      will be in-putted into an electronic randomisation tool. Group assignment will be known to&#xD;
      the treating therapists but not to the assessing therapist to ensure a single-blind design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be allocated based on randomisation to either Intervention (I) or&#xD;
      control (C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research question is whether core stability classes improve movement and function&#xD;
      in the intervention group (I) compared to the control group (C). Data will be plotted&#xD;
      graphically and described in the first instance using means, medians, standard deviations.&#xD;
      Normality will be assessed using the Shapiro Wilk test. Groups will be inspected for baseline&#xD;
      comparability. Quantitative parametric data from movement analysis assessment will be&#xD;
      compared for (I) and (C) groups using analysis of co-variance including baseline levels of&#xD;
      the outcome and adjusting for any baseline imbalances. Non-normally distributed data, e.g.&#xD;
      Functional Walk Test, will be compared using Poisson regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed with Stata IC 13. Statistical assistance will be&#xD;
      available from the Department of Epidemiology in RCSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Approval&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval has been obtained from the CRC Ethics committee&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent A written explanation of the study and core control group will be provided&#xD;
      for the parent/guardian and participant. The information will be presented in a manner that&#xD;
      is easy to understand and outline the risks and benefits of the study clearly. Each parent&#xD;
      and participant will be given the opportunity to ask questions in writing or verbally and the&#xD;
      parent/guardian will then sign a consent form. Refusal to participate in the study will not&#xD;
      affect the client's general physiotherapy care from the CRC in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants The control group will not work on focused balance specific core stability work&#xD;
      in physiotherapy over the four-week control period. They will receive all other usual&#xD;
      physiotherapy care during this period. Participants who are initially assigned to the control&#xD;
      group will then be offered to participate in a Core Stability group after the control period&#xD;
      assessments are completed. Therefore, all study participants (intervention and Control&#xD;
      groups) will be given the opportunity to avail of the 'Core Stability' physiotherapy group&#xD;
      programme. Each group will have to attend the same number of assessments (1 pre assessment&#xD;
      and 1 post assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Protection All data collected from the study will be restricted to the&#xD;
      circumstances listed on the signed consent form. The procedures in place in relation to data&#xD;
      storage and processing in the Gait Laboratory and the Physiotherapy Department in the CRC&#xD;
      will be followed. Identifying information will only be stored in the CRC secure server.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks During the Balance assessment in the gait laboratory, markers will be placed&#xD;
      on the skin with adhesive tape. Taking these off may cause very slight discomfort. To&#xD;
      alleviate this adhesive removal spray can be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gait lab balance assessment is designed to be a measure of dynamic balance. Therefore,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to do some tasks that may be challenging to them. They will be&#xD;
      supervised at all times when carrying out the assessment by the independent assessor. Stand&#xD;
      by assistance will be provided if required for safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'Core Stability' physiotherapy group intervention programme may be both mentally and&#xD;
      physically challenging for the participants. It will involve concentration and repetition of&#xD;
      activities. The group will be carried out under the supervision of two paediatric senior&#xD;
      physiotherapists who work regularly with this CP population. These physiotherapists will have&#xD;
      a strong knowledge base of this population's physical limitations. They are also experienced&#xD;
      in how to encourage and motivate paediatric clients to carry out challenging activities.&#xD;
