  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a 2nd generation EGFR-TKI that irreversibly binds to EGFR receptors, afatinib showed the&#xD;
      possibility of superior effects to 1st generation TKIs such as erlotinib and gefitinib. In a&#xD;
      phase III study LUX-lung 3 in patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung&#xD;
      cancer, afatinib monotherapy showed longer progression-free disease survival time of 11.1&#xD;
      months than that (6.9 months) of pemetrexed/cisplatin combination therapy. Based on such the&#xD;
      results, it is currently recommended as the standard first-line treatment for EGFR&#xD;
      mutation-positive lung cancer, and clinical studies are also being actively conducted in&#xD;
      other types of carcinomas characterized by EGFR gene mutation and overexpression. Thirty (30)&#xD;
      solid cancer patients were included in a phase I trial of afatinib, and of them, a patient&#xD;
      with esophageal cancer had partial response. Taken together, based upon the results from&#xD;
      clinical trials of afatinib conducted so far, 7 out of 15 esophageal cancer patients achieved&#xD;
      clinical responses of 3 months or longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the overall results from previous studies of gefitinib and erlotinib as EGFR TKIs and&#xD;
      our study of dacomitinib, as well as from preceding studies of afatinib - a 2nd generation&#xD;
      EGFR TKI - suggest the possibility of an effective therapy in esophageal cancer characterized&#xD;
      by well-known EGFR overexpression. In this phase II trial, afatinib shall be administered to&#xD;
      patients with squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus to evaluate its effects and toxicity.&#xD;
      Also, biomarkers to predict responses to afatinib shall be explored through further studies.&#xD;
