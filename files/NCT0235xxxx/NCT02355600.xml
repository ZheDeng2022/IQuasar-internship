  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survival in young patients with cancer has increased and also have increased the adverse&#xD;
      long-term side effects of chemotherapy, there is a large number of women who experience loss&#xD;
      of ovarian function without accomplishing their reproductive desire due to gonadotoxic&#xD;
      treatment. The ovarian reserve determine the response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation&#xD;
      in fertility preservation treatments as well as in assisted reproduction techniques.&#xD;
      Improving this reserve by avoiding its depletion during the process could result in increase&#xD;
      fertility rates after cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collecting follicles during tamoxifen treatment would increase the number of cryopreserved&#xD;
      oocytes and thus rise the potential ovarian reserve in these patients, which is reduced due&#xD;
      to age, chemotherapy and length of treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to retrieve viable mature oocytes during adjuvancy with tamoxifen in&#xD;
      breast cancer patients to improve the probability of subsequent pregnancy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New chemotherapy regimens and management options developed during the last 20 years have&#xD;
      yielded increased survival rates in cancer patients but they also cause side effects such as&#xD;
      premature ovarian failure and infertility due to their gonadotoxicity. Hormone therapy also&#xD;
      increases survival rates in breast cancer patients; tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor&#xD;
      modulator, has been proven to reduce the risk of recurrence and mortality due to breast&#xD;
      cancer when administered during 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of premature ovarian failure depends not only on the gonadotoxicity of chemotherapy&#xD;
      but also on the age of the patient, therefore although tamoxifen is not gonadotoxic itself,&#xD;
      it can compromise fertility because of the long length of treatment and the subsequent delay&#xD;
      in childbearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, tamoxifen is a drug that can be used in assisted reproduction techniques&#xD;
      to induce ovarian stimulation, therefore, the tamoxifen treatment followed by breast cancer&#xD;
      patients represent somehow a way of continuous ovarian stimulation. If viable oocytes could&#xD;
      be retrieved during the long-term hormonal treatment with tamoxifen, there will be an option&#xD;
      to use them to restore fertility afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the study who have normal menstrual periods will be monitored by&#xD;
      sonography (antral follicle count) and serum hormonal levels: E2 (oestradiol), P4&#xD;
      (progesterone), FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) from the&#xD;
      second day of their cycle. Patients without spontaneous menstruations will perform periodic&#xD;
      visits every 15 days until images corresponding with antral follicle definition will be seen,&#xD;
      this will be considered day 2 of the cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of the antral follicles will be done with sonography and serum hormonal levels&#xD;
      according to the protocols of the investigators in vitro fertilization unit. When a follicle&#xD;
      of more than 18 mm is seen, 250 µg of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) will be administered&#xD;
      and 36 hours after, transvaginal oocyte retrieval will be performed. Oocyte and embryo&#xD;
      quality assessment will be performed according to morphological ASEBIR (association for the&#xD;
      study of reproduction biology) classification on day +2 and +3. Grade 1 and 2 embryos on day&#xD;
      +3 will be cryopreserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients requiring assisted reproduction technologies to get pregnant after completion of&#xD;
      their oncologic treatment will have their embryos thawed and subsequently transferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the time oocytes retrieved are being used or until the end of gestation in case the&#xD;
      patient become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bearing in mind that most of the patients in our center undergo 5 year of tamoxifen&#xD;
      treatment, it will be assumed a maximum follow-up of 6 years.&#xD;
