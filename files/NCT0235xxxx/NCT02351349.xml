    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease is a common diagnosis in the elderly population and it is associated&#xD;
      with significant morbidity and health care costs. The prevalence rates increase with age to&#xD;
      about 40% for adults aged &gt; 65 years. In the elderly population (age 65 and over), CKD is&#xD;
      associated with a higher burden of comorbid conditions and frailty. The prevalence of frailty&#xD;
      is higher in CKD patients with rated being double in early stages and nearly 6 times higher&#xD;
      beyond stage 3b. Previously reported frailty mortality rates of 18% at 3 years and 47% at 7&#xD;
      years comparing with mortality rates in non frail individuals of 3% and 12% respectively. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators investigate the effect of multidisciplinary interventions upon&#xD;
      frail elderly patients with CKD not yet on dialysis. This interventions include best medical&#xD;
      care, nutrition, physiotherapy, and social, psychological and spiritual support.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multilevel, multidisciplinary intervention is required to assist frail CKD patients given&#xD;
      the complexity of their condition. However, the optimal methods for this intervention are not&#xD;
      very well defined in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was previously described that dialysis does not improve (and often times can worsen) the&#xD;
      outcomes of frail patients with renal disease (41). The nowadays trend is to try to optimise&#xD;
      and decrease frailty before initiation of dialysis. If that is not possible, a more&#xD;
      conservative and palliative approach is envisaged. Regardless, a combined geriatric and&#xD;
      nephrological expertise may help to identify patients at high risk of early death for whom&#xD;
      this approach is indicated (42).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major medical societies have regularly reviewed and published their guidelines for medical&#xD;
      management of chronic kidney disease. Most reputable such guidelines are KDIGO 2012 Clinical&#xD;
      Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (43) and The&#xD;
      National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF KDOQI, (44)). In&#xD;
      Canada, field experts reviewed current evidence and provided similar recommendations (45). In&#xD;
      summary, all this guidelines provide expert opinion on treatment and targets of treatment in&#xD;
      CKD patients with an accent on controlling cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension,&#xD;
      diabetes, dyslipidemia), lifestyle management, control of CKD complications (proteinuria,&#xD;
      anemia, mineral metabolism), and initiation of renal replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle management is probably one of the most important intervention in CKD population.&#xD;
      First and foremost, it empowers the patients to take control of their lives and become an&#xD;
      active partner in their treatment. Smoking cessation, weight reduction, dietary protein&#xD;
      control, alcohol intake, exercise, and controlling salt intake are proven to improve outcomes&#xD;
      and are part of current guidelines. Regular physical exercise improves physical fitness,&#xD;
      walking capacity, cardiovascular parameters (e.g. blood pressure and heart rate),&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, and nutritional parameters (48). Physical activity is also&#xD;
      protective against depression (49). In the case of frail patients, usually sedentary, with&#xD;
      multiple cardiac risk factors, it is recommended to begin with gradual exercise and under&#xD;
      supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrition must be targeted in the frail elderly with CKD because decreasing energy intake is&#xD;
      associated with higher stages of CKD (50). Though in the CKD non dialysis population,&#xD;
      nutrition supplementation has not been formally assessed, the general population of frail&#xD;
      elderlies have been evaluated with protein supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tieland et al (51) randomized 65 frail elderly in protein versus placebo supplementation&#xD;
      groups for 24 weeks. January 11, 2015 revised The protein supplementation group had no&#xD;
      benefit with respect to weight gain or muscle strength. However, when resistive exercise&#xD;
      training was coupled with protein supplementation, body weight gain was achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, Tieland et al (52) randomized 62 frail elderly in two groups, both who received&#xD;
      exercise training but only one group received protein supplements. A 0.7 kg weight gain was&#xD;
      recorded in the protein supplement but none in the control group. The sustainability and the&#xD;
      benefit in survival of such weight gain has not been determined, especially in the CKD non&#xD;
      dialysis patients. Thus, the investigators propose that exercise with protein supplementation&#xD;
      will benefit the CKD frail older population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frail patients with or without CKD are at risk of experiencing psychological distress.&#xD;
      Acknowledging one's own limitations, inability to perform up to certain social standards,&#xD;
      losing function when comparing with friends or family members within same age group,&#xD;
      depending on other's support can all be envisage as high risk factors for depression and/or&#xD;
      other psychological ailments. Psychological distress is associated decrease quality of life&#xD;
      of worse outcomes. Anxiety and depression are 2 major compounds of psychological distress.&#xD;
      Patients can be screened with two easy to use scales: GAD-7 (for anxiety) and PHQ-9 (for&#xD;
      depression). Were identified, these conditions should be treated by Psychiatry or Geriatrics&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disability is best assessed using the standard ten variables addressed in the Barthel scale&#xD;
      (56) are: presence or absence of fecal incontinence, presence or absence of urinary&#xD;
      incontinence, help needed with grooming, help needed with toilet use, help needed with&#xD;
      feeding, help needed with transfers (e.g. from chair to bed), help needed with walking, help&#xD;
      needed with dressing, help needed with climbing stairs, and help needed with bathing. The&#xD;

&#xD;
      Interventions targeted to improve frailty are limited by the patient's ability to collaborate&#xD;
      and work with the treating team. Severe cognitive impaired patients lack insight and capacity&#xD;
      and they are limited in their capacity to rehabilitated. MoCA (57) is a well validated tool&#xD;
      at identifying cognitive impairment, it is widely available in many languages, and it is&#xD;
      recommended by The Canadian Consensus Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia for&#xD;
      detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's disease. A cut-off of &gt; 17 is&#xD;
      generally used to exclude severe dementia. A language specific MoCA and instructions to&#xD;
      administer the test are available online at http://www.mocatest.org/. The original English&#xD;
      version is reproduced in Appendix 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the proposed study is to assess the effect of intensive&#xD;
      multidisciplinary interventions on survival, hospitalization and need to start dialysis.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include the assessment of the intervention in different stages of&#xD;
      sarcopenia and measurement of physical functioning and nutritional parameters to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of such interventions among the frail CKD population.&#xD;
