  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are both supply and demand gaps in our understanding of how best to implement MMC&#xD;
      services. In terms of supply of MMC services, there is a need to better understand what the&#xD;
      best way is of efficiently accessing mature men(25-49 years old) . The investigators also&#xD;
      want to understand the type of service delivery approach and environment that would make&#xD;
      mature men(25-49 years old) feel more comfortable when attending an MMC clinic. Demand of MMC&#xD;
      requires identifying messaging that works to address mature men's (25-49 years old) issues so&#xD;
      that they might be willing to undergo MMC. To further advance HIV prevention and advocacy of&#xD;
      male circumcision the investigators also need to consider the perspectives of women on what&#xD;
      approach MMC messaging should take. A combination of male and female viewpoints could inform&#xD;
      MMC outreach messaging where IEC materials are tailored to address the barriers to MMC.&#xD;

      Part I (Formative Period) Given these issues, in addition to establishing a baseline estimate&#xD;
      of the ages and risk behaviours of males currently undergoing MMC at the Aurum clinic over a&#xD;
      six month period, we include a qualitative research component. We conducted research in 2014&#xD;
      to establish a baseline estimate of the ages and risk behaviours of males undergoing MMC at&#xD;
      the Aurum clinic over a six month period. The baseline estimate (Ethics reference number&#xD;
      M130711) will be referred to as the formative Part I. The formative Part I includes a&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative research component. The qualitative component will include both&#xD;
      genders and be used to develop MMC recruitment messaging tailored to mature men(25-49 years&#xD;
      old) . Men will provide their opinion on circumcision and on what type of marketing message&#xD;
      they feel will encourage mature men (25-49 years old) to be circumcised. Women will also&#xD;
      provide their perspectives on male circumcision and what messaging could be used to encourage&#xD;
      their partners or male family members to be circumcised. During this study, we explored if&#xD;
      women have a role in promoting male circumcision to their partners, family and the community.&#xD;
      These qualitative findings will be used to develop interventions to increase the ratio of men&#xD;
      (25-49 years old) mature, or at least of higher risk men, undergoing MMC at the clinic. These&#xD;
      interventions and the outcomes related to them will be presented as an amendment to this&#xD;
      protocol after the baseline and qualitative data are collected and analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II (Intervention Period) Findings from the formative period will be used to develop&#xD;
      interventions to increase the ratio of men (25-49 years)mature, or at least of higher risk&#xD;
      men, undergoing MMC at the clinic. During this proposed intervention period we would like to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of those interventions and the outcomes related to them. These&#xD;
      proposed interventions will directly address the barriers to MMC that challenge uptake of MMC&#xD;
      among mature men (25-49 years). Additionally, epidemiologic research will be conducted among&#xD;
      men attending our MMC clinic to evaluate whether mature men (25-49 years) exhibit, as is&#xD;
      presumed, higher risk profiles for HIV. We will also explore the cost-effectiveness of this&#xD;
      strategy.&#xD;
