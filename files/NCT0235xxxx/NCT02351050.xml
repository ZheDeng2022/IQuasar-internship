      The aim of the project is to demonstrate a fibrinolytic effect of sonothrombolysis (continual&#xD;
      transcranial Doppler monitoring) using 2 MHz diagnostic probe on the reduction of risk of&#xD;
      brain infarctions due to the activation of endogenous fibrinolytic system during angioplasty&#xD;
      and stenting of coronary arteries. 120 patients indicated for coronary angioplasty and&#xD;
      stenting will be enrolled into the study in order to demonstrate a twenty-percent risk&#xD;
      reduction of number and volume of brain infarctions detected using MRI examination 24 hours&#xD;
      after cardiac endovascular treatment in 5% level of significance. Patients will be randomized&#xD;
      - subgroup 1 will undergo a 40-240 minute non-diagnostic TCD monitoring during endovascular&#xD;
      procedure, subgroup 2 will undergo interventions without TCD monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmation of our hypothesis that sonothrombolysis is able to activate endogenous&#xD;
      fibrinolytic system during coronary angioplasty and stenting with consecutive reduction of&#xD;
      the number and volume of brain infarcts, can lead to the increase of the safety these&#xD;
      patients. We can presume that up to 50% of patients indicated for endovasular heart treatment&#xD;
      can be treated using these methods in the future.&#xD;

      AIM OF THE PROJECT The aim of the project is to demonstrate an effect of continual TCD&#xD;
      monitoring using 2 MHz diagnostic probe with maximal diagnostic energy on the reduction of&#xD;
      risk of brain microinfarctions due to the activation of endogenous fibrinolytic system and&#xD;
      mechanical effect on emboli during coronary stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS Sonothrombolysis lead to activation of fibrinolytic system in both healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and acute stroke patients. In acute stroke patients, mechanical effect of&#xD;
      sonothrombolysis is the second effect leading to acceleration of occluded artery&#xD;
      recanalization. We hypothesize that combination of mechanical effect and activation of&#xD;
      fibrinolytic system during sonothrombolysis (TCD monitoring) during coronary stenting will&#xD;
      lead to recanalization of small arterial occlusions caused by microembolization during&#xD;
      intervention. The result will be reduction of volume and the number of brain infarctions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      120 patients indicated for coronary stenting will be enrolled into the study in order to&#xD;
      demonstrate a twenty-percent risk reduction of number and volume of brain infarctions&#xD;
      detected using MRI examination 24 hours after procedure in 5% level of statistical&#xD;
      significance. Patients will be randomized into 2 subgroups. Subgroup 1 will undergo&#xD;
      non-diagnostic bilateral TCD monitoring during coronary stenting. Subgroup 2 will undergo&#xD;
      coronary stenting without TCD monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients: 120 patients indicated for coronary angioplasty and stenting&#xD;
      will be enrolled into the study during a 3-year period. All 120 patients will be randomized&#xD;
      for standard coronary angioplasty and stenting and TCD monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examinations: Physical and neurological examinations including evaluating of&#xD;
      neurological impairment of neurological deficit in NIHSS scale, modified Rankin scale and&#xD;
      cognitive testing (Mini Mental State Examination, Clock drawing test) will be performed&#xD;
      before and 24 - 72 hours after coronary angioplasty and stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Randomization using computer generated random allocation will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sonothrombolysis: In patients randomized into sonothrombolysis subgroup, bilateral MCA&#xD;
      segment in depth 55 mm will be monitored for 40 - 240 minutes using a diagnostic 2 MHz probe&#xD;
      with maximal diagnostic energy. Non-diagnostic TCD monitoring will be performed without&#xD;
      detection of microembolic signals or detection of changes in blood flow. The second (control)&#xD;
      subgroup will undergo a standard coronary angioplasty and stenting without sonothrombolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI protocol will consists of 4 sequences: 1. Localizer; 2. T2TSE; 3. FLAIR; 4. DWI.&#xD;
      Sequences 1-3 will be applied in the same level, they will have the same slice thickness and&#xD;
      the same cut number. The slice thickness comprises its own cut thickness (5 mm) + distant&#xD;
      factor (30%). Standard number of slices is 19. Standard slice level is considered to be a&#xD;
      modified level of skull base due to the minimalization of distant artifacts EPI sequence.&#xD;
      T2TSE: TR=4000/TE=99/ETL=9, FOV 230, FOV ph. 75%, matrix 256x256. FLAIR: 8050/112/ETL=21/2&#xD;
      conc., FOV 230, FOV ph. 76,6%, matrix 256x151. EPI-DWI: 4200/139/EPI f.=96/6 av., FOV 230,&#xD;
      FOV ph. 100%, phase enc. direction A-P, matrix 128x96 with interpolation, phase partial&#xD;
      Fourier 6/8, Bw 1346 Hz/Px, echo spacing 0.83 ms, TA. Sequence called &quot;trace&quot; with three&#xD;
      types of MR pictures in every slice: (a) T2*EPI b=0; (b) DWI b=500; (c) DWI b=1000. The&#xD;
      fourth type of images automatically created an ADC map (in-line postprocessing). DWI show a&#xD;
      middle (average) diffusivity of every point of examined brain tissue when b value is 500 and&#xD;
      1000. This sequence is applied in order to assess hemorrhage (T2*EPI) and monitor sites of&#xD;
      reduced diffusion (DWI, b=500 and 1000). New infarctions will be evaluated in the all of&#xD;
      brain territories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse effects: All adverse effects during 1 month after UM will be registered, especially&#xD;
      all causes for new admissions to the hospital, worsening of neurological symptoms (&gt;4 points&#xD;
      in NIH stroke scale), brain edema, symptomatic and asymptomatic intracranial bleeding&#xD;
      detected in control brain MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committees in accordance with the principles&#xD;
      and guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, 1975.&#xD;
