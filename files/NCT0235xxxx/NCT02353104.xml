      This open-label, adaptive-design, pilot study was designed to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      Onion-Pumpkin Extract in supporting healthy blood pressure as assessed by the change in&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The effect of the product on glucose metabolism,&#xD;
      lipid levels, and antioxidant levels would also be determined. Tolerability and safety of the&#xD;
      study product would also be investigated.&#xD;

      Hypertension has become one of the most common diseases in the world and considered a public&#xD;
      health challenge due to its association with morbidity and mortality and increased cost to&#xD;
      society. Hypertension is the most important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as&#xD;
      coronary heart disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease.&#xD;
      One fourth of adults in the United States have high blood pressure and among these, the&#xD;
      blacks and the elderly have higher incidence of hypertension. This condition is characterized&#xD;
      by abnormally high blood pressure with the systolic greater than 140 mmHg and diastolic&#xD;
      greater than 90 mmHg (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lowering blood pressure has been linked to 35% to 40% reductions in the incidence of stroke,&#xD;
      20%-25% in myocardial infarction, and 50% in heart failure. Management of hypertension&#xD;
      includes lifestyle modifications and pharmacological therapy and antihypertensive drugs.&#xD;
      Lifestyle modifications such as weight reduction in overweight and obese individuals, 8-week&#xD;
      diet of fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grain, poultry fish and nuts with&#xD;
      limited fats, red meat and sweets, reduction in dietary sodium, physical activity, and&#xD;
      moderation of alcohol consumption have been shown to lower blood pressure. There are several&#xD;
      classes of antihypertensive drugs, including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,&#xD;
      angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) β-blockers (BBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and&#xD;
      the thiazide-class diuretics. Among these, the diuretic based therapy was more effective than&#xD;
      other treatments in preventing cardiovascular diseases as demonstrated by the&#xD;
      Antihypertensive and Lipid-lowering Treatment to prevent Heart Attack (ALLHAT) trial (1, 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure can be lowered without using prescription drugs. Nutraceuticals have found&#xD;
      their application in the treatment of hypertension. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids,&#xD;
      omega-9 fatty acids, garlic, seaweed, and various vitamins and minerals have been shown to&#xD;
      reduce blood pressure significantly (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal studies have demonstrated the potential benefits of onion in hypertensive rats. In one&#xD;
      study involving rats fed with a control diet or a high-fat high-sucrose diet with or without&#xD;
      Welsh onion for 4 weeks, lower blood pressure was observed in rats with onion diet,&#xD;
      especially the green-leafy type. In addition, these rats have higher levels of nitric oxide&#xD;
      (NO) metabolites in the urine and plasma, lower activity of NADH/NADPH oxidase in the aorta,&#xD;
      and suppressed angiotensin II production (4). The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of&#xD;
      onion probably involves increased saving of NO (4, 5). A randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blind trial also demonstrated significant decrease in arterial blood pressure and&#xD;
      reduction in plasma viscosity five hours after administration of a formulation containing&#xD;
      onion and olive oil (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pumpkin has been used as a traditional medicine and it is known for its antidiabetic,&#xD;
      antitumor, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antihypertensive properties (7). Animal&#xD;
      studies confirmed that pumpkin seed oil supplementation resulted in lower systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure as well as improvements in lipid profile in both non-ovariectomized&#xD;
      and ovariectomized rats (8). Using enzyme assays, it was demonstrated that pumpkin have&#xD;
      moderate to high alpha-glucosidase and ACE inhibitory activities (9). A recent clinical trial&#xD;
      involved postmenopausal women and the effects of supplemented pumpkin seed oil in cholesterol&#xD;
      levels. The results of this trial showed that 12-week administration of 2g/day pumpkin seed&#xD;
      oil led to a significant increase in HDL cholesterol and significant decrease in diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure. Pumpkin seed oil also improved menopausal symptom scores by decreasing hot&#xD;
      flushes, headaches, and joint pains (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open-label, adaptive-design, pilot study was designed to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      Onion-Pumpkin Extract in supporting healthy blood pressure as assessed by the change in&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The effect of the product on glucose metabolism,&#xD;
      lipid levels, and antioxidant levels would also be determined. Tolerability and safety of the&#xD;
      study product would also be investigated.&#xD;
