  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early accurate diagnosis is one of the first crucial steps in care for infants born to&#xD;
      HIV-infected mothers. Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) relies upon early&#xD;
      diagnosis and results in significant reductions in infant morbidity and mortality. The&#xD;
      investigators recently concluded a successful randomized controlled trial in Kenya entitled,&#xD;
      &quot;Improving uptake of early infant diagnosis of HIV for prevention of mother-to-child HIV&#xD;
      transmission (PMTCT): a randomized trial of a text messaging intervention&quot;&#xD;
      (ClinicalTrials.gov # NCT01433185). In this study, text messages developed using a behavioral&#xD;
      theoretical framework significantly improved maternal attendance at post-partum clinic&#xD;
      appointments and rates of testing to facilitate early infant diagnosis of HIV in a selected&#xD;
      population and controlled setting. Understanding the effectiveness of this intervention (and&#xD;
      its limitations) in a real-world, routine-care setting represents the next step in the&#xD;
      translational pathway to public health impact. The investigators therefore now propose a&#xD;
      cluster randomized, stepped wedge trial in 20 clinics operated by the Kenyan Ministry of&#xD;
      Health in the Nyanza region of Kenya and use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,&#xD;
      Implementation, and Maintenance (REAIM) framework to understand the effectiveness of the text&#xD;
      messaging to improve testing (TextIT) intervention. Our specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effect of TextIT on maternal attendance at postpartum clinic visits&#xD;
           during the randomized stepped-wedge rollout of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 1: A greater proportion of women at health facilities implementing TextIT&#xD;
           will attend clinic within eight weeks postpartum compared to women at health facilities&#xD;
           implementing standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effect of TextIT on virological infant HIV testing within eight weeks&#xD;
           after birth during the randomized stepped-wedge rollout of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 2: Infants of women at health facilities implementing TextIT will be more&#xD;
           likely to have virological HIV testing compared to infants of women at health facilities&#xD;
           implementing standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the costs and cost-effectiveness of TextIT. The investigators will estimate&#xD;
           the cost per patient and per health gain achieved (disability-adjusted life year, DALY)&#xD;
           comparing TextIT to current standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: The TextIT intervention will be more cost-effective than current standard care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The 2011 United Nations General Assembly Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS set a target to&#xD;
      eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV by 2015. The continuum of care for women living&#xD;
      with HIV and their babies includes retention in care and early infant diagnosis of HIV.&#xD;
      Timely initiation of infant antiretroviral therapy (ART) requires HIV-positive women to be&#xD;
      retained in care through the postpartum period and to bring their children for HIV testing.&#xD;
      However, a high proportion of pregnant HIV-positive women in sub-Saharan Africa are lost to&#xD;
      follow-up after delivery. The World Health Organization recommends infant HIV testing at six&#xD;
      weeks using DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, the overall proportion of children&#xD;
      who undergo early infant diagnosis by PCR remains low. In Kenya, the overall proportion of&#xD;
      eligible children undergoing PCR testing in 2011 was 39%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low rates of infant HIV testing are an indirect indication of a large number of infants who&#xD;
      may not benefit from early determination of HIV status, antiretroviral prophylaxis for&#xD;
      HIV-negative breastfeeding infants, and infant feeding counseling and support. For HIV&#xD;
      positive infants, failure to undergo testing is a critical barrier to receiving life-saving&#xD;
      ART. There is an urgent need to investigate efficacious, cost-effective, and sustainable&#xD;
      interventions to improve maternal retention in HIV care and increase the proportion of&#xD;
      exposed infants tested for HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the exponential increase in the number of mobile phones in sub-Saharan Africa, the use&#xD;
      of mobile technology to support HIV programs has shown promise. The United Nations Children's&#xD;
      Fund is encouraging HIV programs to take advantage of high levels of mobile phone access&#xD;
      among enrolled mothers by reminding them to return for critical appointments. Active&#xD;
      follow-up of pregnant HIV positive women in resource-limited settings using mobile phones is&#xD;
      feasible, and may be effective in improving postnatal retention and uptake of early infant&#xD;
      diagnosis across different sub-Saharan African settings.&#xD;
