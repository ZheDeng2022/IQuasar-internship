  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent with the rising prevalence of childhood obesity, the co-morbid condition of&#xD;
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the leading cause of chronic liver&#xD;
      disease among children. NAFLD is characterized by accrual of excess triglycerides (TG) in the&#xD;
      liver that leads to inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. One-third of the pediatric&#xD;
      population has NAFLD, a disease strongly associated with insulin-resistance and&#xD;
      metabolic-syndrome (Met-S). NAFLD is predicted to become the leading cause of liver&#xD;
      transplantation in adults by 2030.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current understanding of NAFLD indicates that presence of excess TG in liver is an absolute&#xD;
      requirement for disease progression. First-line therapy for NAFLD is focused on decreasing&#xD;
      adiposity and improving insulin sensitivity through diet and exercise. Recent adult data&#xD;
      indicate that dietary carbohydrate-restriction is more effective at reducing hepatic&#xD;
      TG-content than traditional calorie-restriction. Few studies have been conducted to establish&#xD;
      resolution of hepatic steatosis by any intervention. Such studies in pediatrics are primarily&#xD;
      limited by a need for liver biopsy. However, hepatic proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy&#xD;
      (H-MRS) is a new innovative tool used to quantitatively measure hepatic TG content in a&#xD;
      non-invasive manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to compare the impact of dietary weight loss via carbohydrate-restriction&#xD;
      and calorie-restriction on hepatic TG-content quantified by H-MRS in obese children with&#xD;
      biopsy-proven NAFLD and Met-S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This IRB approved protocol is a randomized control study. The investigators will recruit&#xD;
      subjects from the Center for Obesity and its Consequences in Health and the pediatric&#xD;
      gastroenterology clinics between the ages of 11-17 years who meet criteria for NAFLD and&#xD;
      Met-S. A H-MRS will be obtained in each subject prior to the start of dietary intervention.&#xD;
      Fifty-four subjects will be randomized to either a carbohydrate-restricted or&#xD;
      calorie-restricted diet for 6 months with no change in baseline activity. A repeat H-MRS will&#xD;
      be compared to baseline to determine the whether dietary carbohydrate-restriction is superior&#xD;
      to calorie-restriction for reducing hepatic TG content. The investigators believe that&#xD;
      subjects on the carbohydrate-restricted diet will have marked decrease in hepatic TG content&#xD;
      compared to those in the calorie-restricted diet given the same degree of reduction in body&#xD;
      mass index.&#xD;

      Specific Aims and Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary aim is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the impact of dietary weight loss via carbohydrate-restriction and&#xD;
      calorie-restriction on hepatic TG content quantified by H-MRS in obese children with&#xD;
      biopsy-proven NAFLD and Met-S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Secondary aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare BMI z-score, ALT (analine transaminase) and cytokeratin 18 in obese patients with&#xD;
      NAFLD and Met-S after a 6 month dietary weight loss via either carbohydrate or calorie&#xD;
      restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Obese children with biopsy-proven NAFLD and Met-S will experience a reduction in&#xD;
      liver TG content, assessed by H-MRS, concurrent with 6 months of dietary weight loss;&#xD;
      however, we anticipate that subjects undergoing carbohydrate restriction will experience a&#xD;
      greater reduction in hepatic fat than those undergoing calorie restriction due to the&#xD;
      limiting of precursors for lipid synthesis inherent to the diet (CHO) and the expected&#xD;
      increase in hepatic oxidative metabolism (TG accrual is attenuated while disposal is&#xD;
      enhanced).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is a 6 month prospective randomized controlled trial with outcomes assessment&#xD;
      monthly for the first 6 months and a follow up visit at 10- 12 months after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and data collection will be completed at University of Texas Southwestern Medical&#xD;
      Center and Children's Health, Dallas TX by study personnel. All patients who agree to&#xD;
      participate will give informed written consent and assent. A study staff member will explain&#xD;
      the study and review the consent and HIPAA forms with each patient. A copy of each signed&#xD;

      Concise Summary of Project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 6-month prospective, randomized control trial enrolling patients referred to the&#xD;
      Children's Medical Center COACH Program. The COACH Program is a medical weight management&#xD;
      clinic, which serves obese children in order to diagnose and treat associated co-morbid&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects meeting all enrollment criteria will be randomized to either a carbohydrate- or&#xD;
      calorie-restricted diet. They will be committed to this fixed meal plan for 6 months and&#xD;
      dietary education by a certified dietician will be provided. This will include the allowed&#xD;
      caloric intake and content, which is calculated by a bioelectric impedance meter (GE In Body&#xD;
      520) specific to patient's age, gender, and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The carbohydrate-restricted diet is composed of 20% carbohydrates, 35% protein and 45% fat.&#xD;
      The calorie-restricted diet is composed of 50%carbohydrate, 15-20% protein and 30-35% fat.&#xD;
      Patients will be seen by a psychologist to help with goal setting, self-monitoring and&#xD;
      problem solving. Dietary compliance will be followed regularly by weekly phone calls for the&#xD;
      first 3 months and then monthly afterwards by the research personnel. A 72-hour dietary&#xD;
      recall will be conducted by our dietician every other month. Subjects will be followed in the&#xD;
      COACH clinic monthly. A detailed schedule will be outlined and provided to the families at&#xD;
      each visit. Any missed appointments will be rescheduled within 3 to 7 days, and the families&#xD;
      will be contacted immediately to offer assistance for the next visit. During this study,&#xD;
      subjects will be monitored with urine tests and blood tests to ensure safety while undergoing&#xD;
      the prescribed diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first proton hepatic magnetic spectroscopy (H-MRS) will be done prior to initiating the&#xD;
      dietary intervention. A second H-MRS will be obtained after 2 months (at visit 3) on the&#xD;
      assigned dietary therapy. The final H-MRS will be performed after completion of the 6 month&#xD;
      dietary intervention. At the 6 month completion, the subjects will be seen in clinic and&#xD;
      blood work with urine testing will be done. Their final visit will be 4 to 6 months post&#xD;
      dietary intervention to assess weight maintenance.&#xD;
