      The aim of this research is to evaluate the effect of early invasive therapy and appropriate&#xD;
      revascularization compared with conservative management and selective revascularization among&#xD;
      women with an acute coronary syndrome.&#xD;

      This study aims to enroll 1,000 women who present with AcuteCoronarySyndorme ( ACS). Patients&#xD;
      will be identified through screening of all women admitted for chest pain, and those women&#xD;
      with positive cardiac enzymes after operative procedures. After receiving permission to&#xD;
      approach the potential subjects, trained and delegated study personnel will present the study&#xD;
      to the patient. The informed consent process will be completed by the study coordinator, PI&#xD;
      or co-investigator. The patient will have all procedures, risks and benefits explained and&#xD;
      offered time to read and review the informed consent form. They will be given adequate time&#xD;
      to ask questions, consult with family members or primary physicians. Specifically, written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained in the emergency department or in the cardiology ward/unit&#xD;
      before the patient is sedated/in the catheterization laboratory. . When a patient consents to&#xD;
      participate in the study, their treatment assignment will be randomly determined by opening a&#xD;
      sealed envelope that contains one of two treatment strategies. The blinding envelopes will be&#xD;
      created by the Biostatistics group and will be sealed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once informed written consent is obtained (see accompanying flow chart), each patient will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to early invasive therapy versus conservative management. All patients will&#xD;
      be administered aspirin 325 mg, clopidogrel 600 mg, and atorvastatin 80 mg. Anti-thrombin&#xD;
      therapy (unfractionated heparin or bivalirudin according to physician discretion) will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously. If anti-thrombin therapy was administered prior to randomization,&#xD;
      this agent will be continued through catheterization and titrated if necessary to achieve&#xD;
      desired effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to an early invasive strategy will undergo coronary angiography within 48&#xD;
      hours and have percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting&#xD;
      performed as soon as possible during the initial hospitalization if deemed appropriate. The&#xD;
      choice of intervention or surgery will be determined by the operator according to coronary&#xD;
      anatomy and consistent with current practice guidelines. For example, disease of the left&#xD;
      main trunk, or multi-vessel disease would generally be expected to be referred for surgical&#xD;
      revascularization. Patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention can receive a&#xD;
      glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (i.e. abciximab bolus by intra-coronary or intra-venous route&#xD;
      (0.25 mg per kg), followed by infusion (0.125 µg per kg per minute for 12 hours). Upfront use&#xD;
      of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors is discouraged. Eptifibatide or tirofiban can be used&#xD;
      instead of abciximab according to operator discretion. Elective percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention on non-culprit vessels, in either study arm, can take place sometime after the&#xD;
      index procedure with the goal to achieve complete revascularization. Such staged procedures&#xD;
      will not be adjudicated as an urgent need for revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to conservative management will be treated with anti-anginal medications,&#xD;
      as well as aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and other guideline recommended medicines.&#xD;
      Anti-thrombin therapy will be continued for no more than 48 hours. Conservative therapy will&#xD;
      continue during this time, unless the patient has refractory angina, hemodynamic or&#xD;
      electrical instability, left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;&#xD;
      45%), or significant ischemia on predischarge stress testing. Patients will have an&#xD;
      echocardiogram to determine left ventricle function. Stress testing will be performed by&#xD;
      adenosine SPECT if there is no left ventricular dysfunction by echocardiography. Patients&#xD;
      with any high risk findings, such as refractory chest pain, left ventricular ejection&#xD;
      fraction &lt; 45%, or a large burden of ischemia on stress testing will remain in the hospital&#xD;
      to undergo cardiac catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will be treated with lifelong aspirin, 12 months of clopidogrel, in&#xD;
      addition to atorvastatin and other guideline recommended therapies. A shorter duration of&#xD;
      clopidogrel can be recommended in select cases according to treating physician discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific data for acquisition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protected health information will be accessed by the practitioners normally involved in the&#xD;
      patient's care during their hospitalization. Research demographics will be obtained by the&#xD;
      research coordinator by interviewing the patient and by chart review. After hospital&#xD;
      discharge, the research coordinator will contact the patient at specified intervals to&#xD;
      determine if an endpoint has been met. Evidence that an endpoint occurred would require&#xD;
      additional supplemental chart review by the research coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient demographics: age, height, weight, body mass index, medications at randomization,&#xD;
      pertinent medical/surgical/family/social history: for example hypertension,&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, current tobacco use, history of: prior myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting. This data&#xD;
      will be gathered by the research coordinator through patient reporting and chart review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedural: Duration of ischemic symptoms from onset until randomization,&#xD;
      electrocardiographic changes, elevated cardiac biomarkers, elevated NT-pro-BNP, procedural&#xD;
      success defined as Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow 3, drug-eluting stent use,&#xD;
      glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor use, intra-procedural activated clotting time, closure&#xD;
      device, sheath size, micropuncture access.&#xD;
