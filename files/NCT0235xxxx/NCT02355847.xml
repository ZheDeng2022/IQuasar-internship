      Introduction: Patient safety, risk management, and cultural competency are essential topics&#xD;
      for healthcare provider mastery in a high stakes, urban academic Labor and Delivery Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A prospective cross sectional pilot study was performed with IRB exempt status to&#xD;
      examine the effect of an internet based educational curriculum on topics including patient&#xD;
      safety, risk management and cultural competency over 6 months amongst OB/GYN and Family&#xD;
      Medicine medical students, nurses, and physicians. 76 healthcare providers participated.&#xD;
      Assessments took place before and after curriculum implementation. Primary outcome measures&#xD;
      were cultural competency as measured by the Tucker-Culturally Sensitive Health Care Inventory&#xD;
      (TCSHCI) Provider Form, Pascal Metrics of Patient Safety survey for healthcare providers,&#xD;
      patient satisfaction measured by the Press Ganey patient survey scores, and poor Labor and&#xD;
      Delivery Outcomes. The curriculum intervention included five online lectures lasting 30-60&#xD;
      minutes pertaining to cultural competency, risk management, patient safety, and Team STEPPS&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
