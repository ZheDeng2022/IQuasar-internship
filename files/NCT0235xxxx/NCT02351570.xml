    <textblock>
      By the health reform GKV in 2000 as well as by the competitive strengthening law GKV in 2007&#xD;
      in §20 SGB V the health insurance schemes have received an enlarged action frame in the&#xD;
      primary prevention and the operational health support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through these paragraphs arises the possibility for citizens to let refund health-supporting&#xD;
      programmes or health training of the health insurance schemes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctor's recommendation is one of the most important predictors by therapy decisions of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, primary prevention takes a very small part of the working hours of general&#xD;
      practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, is the aim of the present study to examine whether and how general practitioners could&#xD;
      be incorporated in the mediation of prevention's offers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reach this aim, must be grasped first, to what extent general practitioners are already&#xD;
      integrated into in the mediation of the primary prevention courses. There is up to now no&#xD;
      information about whether general practitioners know about the GKV-improved prevention&#xD;
      programmes for GKV-insured person and whether they are involved in their mediation. This&#xD;
      research project will close this gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to explore the roll of primary prevention in the general practitioner's consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to analyse which social institutions are responsible for primary prevention according to&#xD;
           the general practitioner's opinion&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to explore which primary prevention's programmes do general practitioners in their&#xD;
           consultation recommend&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to analyse which factors play a role in the mediation&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to explore whether general practitioners with §20 are familiar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a mixed methods study which combines a mail survey of all general practitioners in&#xD;
      Berlin with focus groups of 25 general practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study all general practitioners of Berlin (n=1300) will be mailed. Participants for&#xD;
      the focus groups are invited from the pool of teaching doctors of the Institute for General&#xD;
      Medicine at the Charite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After both methods are analyzed on their own, the triangulation of the interpretation of both&#xD;
      data sets will be done to find possible answers of the study questions. Bi-directionality of&#xD;
      results will contribute to find possible interpretations of the survey responses in the&#xD;
      results of the focus group discussions, as well as the results of the focus groups&#xD;
      discussions could be explained by the results of the survey (Flick).&#xD;

      Background In Germany 70% of the men and 50% of the women are overweight or obese. On account&#xD;
      of the frequency of overweight, diabetes and other life style-related risk factors and the&#xD;
      raised risk linked with it for chronic illnesses it has been initiated preventive measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the health reform GKV in 2000 as well as by the competitive strengthening law GKV in 2007&#xD;
      in §20 SGB V the health insurance schemes have received an enlarged action frame in the&#xD;
      primary prevention and the operational health support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through these paragraphs arises the possibility for citizens to let refund health-supporting&#xD;
      programmes or health training of the health insurance schemes. Moreover programmes count to&#xD;
      the support of physical activity, nutrition consultation, smoke weaning programmes or also&#xD;
      learning of relaxation techniques. About two to three percent of all GKV insured person take&#xD;
      part in primary-preventive courses and seminar offers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctor's recommendation is one of the most important predictors by therapy decisions of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, primary prevention takes a very small part of the working hours of general&#xD;
      practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, is the aim of the present study to examine whether and how general practitioners could&#xD;
      be incorporated in the mediation of prevention's offers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reach this aim, must be grasped first, to what extent general practitioners are already&#xD;
      integrated into in the mediation of the primary prevention courses. There is up to now no&#xD;
      information about whether general practitioners know about the GKV-improved prevention&#xD;
      programmes for GKV-insured person and whether they are involved in their mediation. This&#xD;
      research project will close this gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to explore the roll of primary prevention in the general practitioner's consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to analyse which social institutions are responsible for primary prevention according to&#xD;
           the general practitioner's opinion&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to explore which primary prevention's programmes do general practitioners in their&#xD;
           consultation recommend&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to analyse which factors play a role in the mediation&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to explore whether general practitioners with §20 are familiar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a mixed methods study which combines a mail survey of all general practitioners&#xD;
           in Berlin with focus groups of 25 general practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The design arises from the study question, so that we grasp from the mail survey to what&#xD;
           extent primary prevention in the general practitioner's practice a role plays and&#xD;
           whether §20 is known among general practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the focus groups will be analyzed which role can or want general practitioners in the&#xD;
           primary prevention take and to what extent they can perceive themselves as mediators&#xD;
           with regard to the offer of §20 programms. Barriers as well as the role of the general&#xD;
           practitioner in the primary prevention will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study population In this study all general practitioners of Berlin (n=1300) will be&#xD;
           mailed. Participants for the focus groups are invited from the pool of teaching doctors&#xD;
           of the Institute for General Medicine at the Charite (see characteristics below) which&#xD;
           are also part of the mail survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Characteristics of teaching doctors of the general medicine Charité Berlin:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Aptitude and joy in teaching&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Specialist in general medicine, general practice internist or active internist&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Duration of establishment &gt; 3 years&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  More than 500 GKV-Versicherte / quarter&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Typical general practitioner spectrum without one-sided practice&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Regular house visits&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Separate space for students&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Guarantee of the necessary number of hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Procedure Survey For the data collection a standardized questionnaire was developed. A&#xD;
           literature research as well as the objective of the study led the questionnaire&#xD;
           development. After its completion the comprehensibility of the questionnaire was checked&#xD;
           with cognitive interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection All 1300 general practitioners in Berlin are written up by the service&#xD;
           provider Data-B through the Berlin medical association.&#xD;
&#xD;
           General practitioners will receive the validated questionnaire, a franked envelope and a&#xD;
           franked postcard. The survey is conceived pseudonym. There will be no possibility to&#xD;
           connect the questionnaire with personal data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The response rate by physician's survey rises if the survey is supported by professional&#xD;
           associations or other prominent representatives of the field. Hence, the survey is&#xD;
           supported by Professor Braun the Director of the Institute of General Medicine at the&#xD;
           Charite Medical University in Berlin.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Also the length of the questionnaire has influence on the response rate. This was&#xD;
           considered in the development of the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To raise further the response rate, we will apply the Dillman Method. This meant that we&#xD;
           will send after three weeks a postcard reminder to the non-responders. Other two weeks&#xD;
           later, we will send again, to those who have not answered, the questionnaire as well as&#xD;
           the franked postcard. Those general practitioners that after 4 weeks haven't sent the&#xD;
           postcard will be considered as non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The franked postcard is to have an overview of which doctors have responded to the&#xD;
           questionnaire. An identification number on the postcard allows the service provider&#xD;
           Data-B to identify the doctor's address or practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We collect for the service provider the identification number of the postcards. Data-B&#xD;
           will send within two weeks a reminder to those whose number is not on the list.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This procedure is carried out after two weeks once again, but this time with the&#xD;
           questionnaire. Because this is the third and last contact, no postcard is included in&#xD;
           this last mailing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data of the questionnaire are administered by the BSPH and the address file by&#xD;
           Data-B. With it is the pseundonymity of the survey guaranteed. For the BSPH is not&#xD;
           possible to identify which physician has responded to which questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study-staff will enter the date of the questionnaires in an Access data bank. To&#xD;
           carry out the data analysis, the data bank will be then export to SPSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Focus Groups In addition, five focus groups with five participants will be carried out.&#xD;
           The focus groups are so structured that the different practice forms, group practice,&#xD;
           practice with additional offers or practice with private patients are enclosed in the&#xD;
           focus groups equally.&#xD;
&#xD;
           So far possibly single focus groups will be composed from participants with different&#xD;
           practice characteristic as well as age-mixed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before the discussion, the participants of the focus groups are asked to fill out the&#xD;
           questionnaire, so that it will be possible to get in contact the questionnaires with the&#xD;
           focus groups. The questionnaires are filled and collected without personal data. Hence,&#xD;
           it will not be possible to know which participant filled which questionnaire out.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To be able to draw conclusion on the generalizability of the focus group's results, it&#xD;
           will be possible to compare aggregated data of the focus groups with regard to the&#xD;
           questionnaires with the data of the general practitioners in Berlin.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A moderator will guide the group in the discussion and a coworker will be the observer,&#xD;
           documenting the meeting. The focus-group process will be conducted based on a catalog of&#xD;
           guiding questions (Annex) that will be given to the moderator at the beginning of the&#xD;
           meeting. The Observer and the Moderator will write up a complete protocol immediately&#xD;
           after the meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The discussions will be audio-recorded digitally. After the focus-group meeting, names&#xD;
           and other person identifiable content will be erased from the audio-recording (by&#xD;
           deleting or new recording) and the final audio-documents will be saved on a secure&#xD;
           Charité Server. For each focus-group, characteristics of the practice, age structure and&#xD;
           gender will be documented and assigned. Names of participants will not be saved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire A descriptive statistical analysis of the collected data will be conducted&#xD;
      using SPSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus group discussion The content of the focus groups will be analyzed based on the&#xD;
      catalogue of guiding questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analytical procedure includes assignment of codes and application of Grounded Theory.&#xD;
      This open process of the analysis is chosen to allow identifying topics and relationships&#xD;
      that might not be identified with a pure content analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triangulation After both methods are analyzed on their own, the triangulation of the&#xD;
      interpretation of both data sets will be done to find possible answers of the study&#xD;
      questions. Bi-directionality of results will contribute to find possible interpretations of&#xD;
      the survey responses in the results of the focus group discussions, as well as the results of&#xD;
      the focus groups discussions could be explained by the results of the survey (Flick).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data confidentiality For the quantitative part of the study no person data or contact&#xD;
      information (name, birthdates, address, phone number, email) will be collected. (see previous&#xD;
      section). Gender and categories-based age are collected. The survey is anonymous at all&#xD;
      stages of data collection, analysis and publication. Publications will include statistical&#xD;
      analysis of conglomerated data. Adherence to German legislation of confidentiality is granted&#xD;
      at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent The response of completed questionnaires in the quantitative part of the&#xD;
      study is valued as the informed consent. The postal card with the stamp of the practice&#xD;
      allows Data-B to compare these with the Databank of names and addresses of physicians. There&#xD;
      is impossible to identify questionnaire and practice at any time. The appearance for the&#xD;
      focus group meeting is valued as the acceptance of participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires and the digital recordings of the focus groups will be kept for 10 years&#xD;
      at the Charité.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethic Committee In case that the &quot;Datenschutzbeauftragte&quot; of the Charity requires it, the&#xD;
      approval of the ethic committee will be obtained. In any case the Ethic Committee will be&#xD;
      informed of the study intended.&#xD;
