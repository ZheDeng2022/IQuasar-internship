  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to confirm that oral progesterone is an effective way&#xD;
      to manage bothersome bleeding; thus increasing the rate of continuation of the etonogestrel&#xD;
      contraceptive implant in adolescents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a prospective study of adolescents using the etonogestrel&#xD;
      contraceptive implant. Participants will be recruited from the Kosair Children's Hospital&#xD;
      Gynecology Specialists practice in Louisville, Kentucky. This practice provides care to a&#xD;
      diverse population of females, from a wide range of socioeconomic statuses, age birth to 25&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient presenting and choosing to have an implant placed will be offered participation.&#xD;
      All enrollments will be voluntary. Participants will not receive compensation for their&#xD;
      participation. After obtaining informed consent and assent, participants will provide&#xD;
      baseline demographic information, including: age, race/ethnicity, zip code of residence,&#xD;
      health insurance provider, number of current and past partners, use of prior contraceptive&#xD;
      methods, concomitant condom use, sexually transmitted infection history,smoking status,&#xD;
      weight and height. The date of etonogestrel implant insertion will be confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients using etonogestrel contraceptive implants will receive daily SMS texts in the&#xD;
      evening via the Qualtrics SMS program asking them to respond with their bleeding pattern that&#xD;
      day. The investigators will record responses according to the World Health Organization&#xD;
      definitions of bleeding: (a) bleeding day, (b) spotting day, (c) bleeding--- free day [see&#xD;
      Table I for WHO bleeding definitions]. At their initial follow---up visit 3 months after&#xD;
      Nexplanon insertion, the investigators will identify those who report &quot;bothersome&quot; bleeding&#xD;
      patterns. For the purpose of this study, &quot;bothersome&quot; bleeding will be defined as prolonged&#xD;
      and/or frequent bleeding, as characterized by World Health Organization---recommended&#xD;
      definitions of bleeding. The definitions are listed in Table I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleeding day Any day with vaginal discharge containing blood that required more than 1&#xD;
      sanitary pad or tampon per day&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spotting day Any day with vaginal discharge containing blood that required at most one&#xD;
      sanitary pad or tampon per day Bleeding---free day A day during which neither bleeding nor&#xD;
      spotting was reported&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleeding--- spotting episode One or more consecutive days during which bleeding or spotting&#xD;
      was entered in the diary, bounded by bleeding---free days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amenorrhea No bleeding or spotting days throughout the 90---day reference period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infrequent bleeding Less than three bleeding---spotting episodes in a 90---day reference&#xD;
      period, excluding amenorrhea&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal frequency Three to five bleeding---spotting episodes in a 90---day reference period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequent bleeding More than five bleeding---spotting episodes in a 90---day reference period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolonged bleeding Any bleeding---spotting episode (uninterrupted) lasting more than 14 days&#xD;
      in the 90---day reference period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table I: WHO bleeding descriptions and patterns&#xD;
&#xD;
      Norethindrone acetate (aygestin) will be used to manage bothersome bleeding. Patients will be&#xD;
      prescribed aygestin 5 mg by mouth twice daily for one month, followed by aygestin 5 mg by&#xD;
      mouth once daily for two months. Medication will then be discontinued. Patients will be&#xD;
      evaluated in the office three months after medication initiation, and then again six months&#xD;
      after medication initiation. If the patient is unable to take norethindrone acetate&#xD;
      (aygestin) due to medical contraindications or cost, they will receive medroxyprogesterone&#xD;
      acetate (provera) 10 mg once daily as alternate oral progesterone. Figure 1 below highlights&#xD;
      the study design.&#xD;

&#xD;
      During the aygestin administration, patients will again receive daily SMS texts in the&#xD;
      evening via the Qualtrics SMS program asking them to respond with their bleeding pattern that&#xD;
      day. The investigators will record responses according to the World Health Organization&#xD;
      definitions of bleeding: (a) bleeding day, (b) spotting day, (c) bleeding--- free day.&#xD;
      Patients not reporting bothersome bleeding after the initial 90 days will continue to record&#xD;
      bleeding via SMS texts for the next 6 months to serve as the control group (normal bleeding&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All completed demographic data collection forms and electronic menstrual calendars will be&#xD;
      kept in a database, de---identified, and stored on a password--- protected computer. Study&#xD;
      size will be a convenience sample. Based on the current rate of etonogestrel implant&#xD;
      insertions in our practice, it is anticipated that 30 participants can be recruited over a&#xD;
      six---month period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who meet the inclusion criteria and enroll in the study will be sent a text&#xD;
      message daily for 90 days (3 months). The daily message will prompt the participant to&#xD;
      indicate the bleeding level for the day. This single question will have 4 options:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bleeding Day&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Spotting Day&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bleeding Free Day&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Prefer not to answer today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 90, descriptive tallies of the responses will be done. Using SPSS v20, an algorithm&#xD;
      will count the number of bleeding days, spotting days, and bleeding free days and prefer not&#xD;
      to answer (PNA) days; the data record for each participant will contain four count variables&#xD;
      (bleeding, spotting, free, PNA). Secondly, the algorithm will identify and tally -according&#xD;
      to WHO guidelines in Table 1 --- bleeding---spotting episodes (BSE),amenorrhea (AM),&#xD;
      infrequent bleeding (IF), normal frequency of bleeding (NF), frequent bleeding (FB), and&#xD;
      prolonged bleeding (PB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who have at least a single episode of FB or PB will be assigned the label of&#xD;
      &quot;bothersome bleeding&quot;. Those without a single episode of FB or PB will be labeled &quot;normal&#xD;
      bleeding&quot;. Participants in the Bothersome Bleeding group will be offered aygestin to control&#xD;
      the bothersome bleeding. Participants in the Normal Bleeding group will continue as before,&#xD;
      with no additional medications. Following the principle of intent---to---treat, data from&#xD;
      those in the Bothersome Bleeding group will be assigned to the aygestin group, despite that&#xD;
      they are not taking it. During the first month, participants in the Bothersome Bleeding group&#xD;
      will take one 5 mg tablets of aygestin twice daily (morning and evening). After 30 days, the&#xD;
      dose of aygestin will be halved, such that only one 5 mg tablet is taken daily. Sixty days&#xD;
      later, the Bothersome Bleeding group will discontinue aygestin. Ninety days later, both the&#xD;
      normal group and the Bothersome Bleeding group will be re-evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive table will be used to sort participants into Normal Bleeding and Bothersome&#xD;
      Bleeding. Non---parametric and parametric statistics will be used to compare the demographics&#xD;
      of these two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dose---response curve covering six months will be plotted for the Bothersome Bleeding group&#xD;
      to visually reveal the impact of one month of 10 mg of aygestin vs. two months of 5 mg&#xD;
      aygestin vs. three months 0 mg of aygestin. Plotted on the curve will be the group averages&#xD;
      of the daily bleeding value (1 for no bleeding, .5 for spotting, 0 for bleeding). A second&#xD;
      no---dose curve will be added to the X---Y plot for the six months of data from the Normal&#xD;
      Bleeding group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated Measure Multivariate Analysis of Variance (RM---ANOVA) with a Between--- Subjects&#xD;
      variable included, will be conducted (assuming sufficient data is available - e.g., low PNA&#xD;
      rates) to compare the first 30 day average bleeding value, the 90 day bleeding average, and&#xD;
      the 180 day bleeding average between the two groups. Planned post---hoc comparisons will&#xD;
      evaluate changes between the control group and intervention group at the three time points.&#xD;
      Additional analyses may also include regression analysis to assess for predictive factors&#xD;
      related to response to aygestin.&#xD;
