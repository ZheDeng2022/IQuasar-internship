  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lip hemangiomas are at higher risk than those located in other sites. However, studies about&#xD;
      clinical characteristics of lip hemangiomas have not been enough. The investigators want to&#xD;
      conduct a prospective study on the clinical features of lip hemangiomas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemangiomas involving lip are of special concern, since they occur in a prominent location on&#xD;
      the face and can distort lip anatomy and lead to disfunction. Infantile hemangiomas in lip&#xD;
      had significantly higher incidence than the others. It is often difficult to decide which&#xD;
      patient with an lip hemangioma is at higher risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are interested in conducting a study on the clinical features of lip&#xD;
      hemangiomas. The investigators are collecting medical records and photos of lip hemangiomas,&#xD;
      including demographic information, maternal process, birth, location, size and complication.&#xD;
      Based on the data, sum up the main points of clinical characteristics and complication.&#xD;
