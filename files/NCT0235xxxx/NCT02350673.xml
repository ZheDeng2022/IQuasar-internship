  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, Phase Ib clinical study of cergutuzumab amunaleukin, in&#xD;
      combination with atezolizumab, to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic&#xD;
      activity in participants with locally advanced and/or metastatic carcinoembryonic antigen&#xD;
      (CEA)-positive solid tumors, whose disease has progressed on or who are intolerant to the&#xD;
      standard of care therapy. Enrolled participants who continue treatment will be treated until&#xD;
      loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent. The study will&#xD;
      include 2 parts: a dose-escalation Part I and a dose expansion Part II. The anticipated&#xD;
      treatment period is 24 months for both cergutuzumab amunaleukin and atezolizumab and may be&#xD;
      modified if emerging data suggest a benefit.&#xD;

Cergutuzumab amunaleukin will be escalated from a starting dose of 6 milligrams (mg) and dosing schedules of every week (qw) and every 2 weeks (q2w) may be explored. Atezolizumab will be administered in fixed flat doses of either 840 mg q2w or 1200 mg every 3 weeks (q3w). Treatment will be continued until loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicities, or withdrawal of consent for a maximum treatment period of 24 months for both cergutuzumab amunaleukin and atezolizumab and may be modified if emerging data suggest longer treatment period is needed.</description>
