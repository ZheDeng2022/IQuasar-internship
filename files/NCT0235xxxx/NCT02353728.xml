  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label phase 2 clinical and translational trial designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of nilotinib on the leukemic stem cell population in subjects with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML in CP). Nilotinib is FDA-approved to treat&#xD;
      subjects with Ph+ CML in CP. Subjects on study will be monitored according to accepted&#xD;
      National Cancer Comprehensive Network [NCCN] clinical guidelines for 24 months. After 24&#xD;
      months, if continued therapy is needed subjects will be transitioned to commercial supply of&#xD;
      study drug.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase will be eligible for enrollment in&#xD;
      this trial. Prior treatment with nilotinib for less than 2 weeks and hydroxyurea is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before therapy and during therapy, peripheral blood and bone marrow samples will be obtained&#xD;
      for cytogenetic and molecular evaluations. During study, blood will be collected at&#xD;
      approximately month 1, month 3, and every 3 months thereafter; aspirate samples will be&#xD;
      collected at approximately month 1, month 3, and month 12. These samples will be collected to&#xD;
      analyze the quantitative and qualitative changes in the leukemic stem cell population before&#xD;
      and during therapy with nilotinib. The study is intended as a hypothesis finding analysis in&#xD;
      order to establish whether in response to nilotinib therapy, defined differences in the&#xD;
      baseline or therapy-induced changes in the characteristics of the stem cell population will&#xD;
      be predictive of the ability to successfully discontinue therapy in subjects with CML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine the effect of nilotinib in stem and progenitor populations we will&#xD;
      evaluate 40 newly diagnosed CML subjects undergoing treatment with nilotinib at different&#xD;
      time points. We will evaluate the levels of expression of Breakpoint Cluster Region-Abelson&#xD;
      protooncogene (BCR-ABL) in purified stem cell populations during the course of treatment. In&#xD;
      addition, we will compare the stem and progenitor populations present during the course of&#xD;
      treatment in peripheral blood and bone marrow. We will perform transcriptional profiling of&#xD;
      such populations to determine changes in signaling pathways driving survival, self-renewal or&#xD;
      proliferation. Whole exome sequencing will be also performed in all diagnostic samples to&#xD;
      determine whether there are novel cooperating mutations.&#xD;
