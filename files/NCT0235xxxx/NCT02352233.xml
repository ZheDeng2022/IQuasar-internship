  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the &quot;gold standard&quot; technique for diagnosis and treatment of colonic lesions.&#xD;
      Moreover, high definition colonoscopes (HD) associated to digital chromoendoscopy had shown&#xD;
      better results regarding adenoma and polyps detection when compared to standard non HD&#xD;
      scopes. However, evidence shows that during standard colonoscopy many lesions could be&#xD;
      missed, including polyps, cancer and other kind of lesions. This could be correlated to many&#xD;
      factors and recently reports show evidence that lesions behind the folds could be missed&#xD;
      because the limitation of a forward view examination. Until know, a new auxiliary imaging&#xD;
      device called &quot;Third Eye Retroscope&quot; had demonstrated more lesions detection during&#xD;
      colonoscopy using a retro view, but with some limitations as absence of HD vision, the need&#xD;
      of additional equipment and the fact the device occupies the accessory channel, limiting&#xD;
      therapeutic efficiency. Recently a new HD colonoscope called &quot;RETROVIEW&quot; (PENTAX Medical) has&#xD;
      been developed. It permits visualization of colonic mucosa in forward view, in retroflex view&#xD;
      and allows for performance of diagnostic and therapeutics in a single colonoscope.&#xD;

      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety and feasibility of the retro view during colonoscopy using RETROVIEW&#xD;
      colonoscope. Safety was measured by the number of bleeding or perforation rates as adverse&#xD;
      event during the procedure. Feasibility was measured by the number of cases that is possible&#xD;
      to achieve a retroflexion in the colon Secondary outcome: withdrawal phase time and total&#xD;
      procedure time.&#xD;
