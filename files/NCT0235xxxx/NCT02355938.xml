  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of cure and recurrence&#xD;
      of Clostridium difficile infection in spinal cord injured patients who are treated with oral&#xD;
      Fidaxomicin vs. oral Vancomycin. The secondary aim of this study is to compare the overall&#xD;
      costs of treatment of Clostridium difficile infection in the two study groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent clinical trials, comparing oral Vancomycin versus oral Fidaxomicin to treat&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile, oral Fidaxomicin was shown to be the same in effectiveness as oral&#xD;
      Vancomycin, but showed a decrease in recurrence of Clostridium difficile by ten percentage&#xD;
      points. Based on experience with patients in our 40-bed spinal cord injury unit at the&#xD;
      Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC), Clostridium difficile infection is more&#xD;
      problematic in patients with spinal cord injury than in the general hospitalized patient&#xD;
      population. Compared to the general population of hospitalized patients, patients with spinal&#xD;
      cord injury are more likely to have: (1) a higher transmission of Clostridium difficile from&#xD;
      one patient to another often via the health care worker due to their having a neurogenic&#xD;
      bowel (2) a longer and more complicated course of Clostridium difficile infection-associated&#xD;
      diarrhea since neurogenic bladder may delay excretion of toxins and predispose to bowel&#xD;
      accidents; and (3) a higher overall cost of treatment in terms of extended hospitalization&#xD;
      (most patients with spinal cord injury who suffer from Clostridium difficile infection do not&#xD;
      get discharged from the hospital until the symptoms of course of Clostridium difficile&#xD;
      infection are resolved. Fidaxomicin is the first in a new class of narrow spectrum&#xD;
      macrocyclic antibiotic drugs. It is a non-systemic, meaning it is minimally absorbed into the&#xD;
      bloodstream, and it is bactericidal, meaning it attacks and kills the bacteria it comes in&#xD;
      contact with. It has demonstrated selective eradication of pathogenic Clostridium difficile&#xD;
      with minimal disruption to the numerous species of bacteria that make up the normal, healthy&#xD;
      intestinal flora. The maintenance of normal physiological conditions in the colon can reduce&#xD;
      the probability of recurrence of a Clostridium difficile infection. Since clearance of&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile infections is problematic in the spinal cord injured patients, this&#xD;
      antimicrobial agent may show a trend for clinical superiority and a reduction in recurrence&#xD;
      of infection within the spinal cord injury population resulting in a shorter hospital stays&#xD;
      and reduced costs.&#xD;
