    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate an intervention that aims to reduce&#xD;
      alcohol-related HIV sexual risk behaviors among HIV-negative men in Namibia. The objectives&#xD;
      of the study are to determine the effectiveness of an individual counseling intervention in&#xD;
      reducing alcohol-related HIV sexual risk behaviors among men, and in reducing harmful and&#xD;
      hazardous alcohol use among men.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study involves a randomized controlled trial of 550 HIV-negative adult men recruited&#xD;
      from a single Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) center for HIV in Windhoek, Namibia who&#xD;
      report harmful or hazardous alcohol consumption and more than one sex partner in the previous&#xD;
      three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving standard counseling at the VCT center, all men who test HIV-negative will be&#xD;
      invited to be screened for eligibility for the study, and if eligible, to consent to enroll.&#xD;
      Personnel hired for the study will then administer a baseline survey via Personal Digital&#xD;
      Assistant to all enrolled men. Enrolled participants will then be randomized to either an&#xD;
      intervention arm, and receive an additional one-hour counseling session and take-home&#xD;
      materials plus general alcohol information materials or to a control arm, and receive general&#xD;
      alcohol information materials alone. All men enrolled in the study will receive the general&#xD;
      alcohol information materials, consisting of a booklet with alcohol health information and a&#xD;
      brochure detailing alcohol abuse support services in the local community. Men in the&#xD;
      intervention arm will also receive two cellphone text messages one month and four months&#xD;
      following enrollment to boost the risk reduction counseling. Follow-up surveys of all&#xD;
      participants will be conducted three months and six months after enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes measured include self-reported data at baseline, three months and six months&#xD;
      post-enrollment regarding: 1) Number, proportion of sex acts preceded by alcohol use; 2)&#xD;
      Number, proportion of sex acts protected by condoms; 3) Number of sex partners; and 4)&#xD;
      Quantity and frequency of alcohol use; 5) Condom use demonstration scores.&#xD;
