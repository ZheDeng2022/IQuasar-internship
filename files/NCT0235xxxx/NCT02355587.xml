  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EXPAND Registry Study follows patients with cutaneous melanoma who have had the&#xD;
      DecisionDx-Melanoma gene expression assay performed as part of their clinical care. Data will&#xD;
      be collected through review of medical records from clinical visits with physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to document the clinical application of results obtained from the DecisionDx-&#xD;
      Melanoma multi-gene assay and to track outcomes of patients for whom DecisionDx-Melanoma&#xD;
      testing has been completed. Additionally the study will assess the health economic impact of&#xD;
      DecisionDx-Melanoma testing as it relates to the Melanoma population.&#xD;
