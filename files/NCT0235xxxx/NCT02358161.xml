  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 5 year survival of patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer is less&#xD;
      than 5 %. Since the introduction of gemcitabine, further advances in therapy in the&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic setting have been extremely slow. Numerous phase III studies have&#xD;
      evaluated different gemcitabine-based regimens as first-line therapy, but in most cases, any&#xD;
      observed benefits have been small and restricted to patients with a good performance status&#xD;
      (PS). Recently two new chemotherapy combination schedules, FOLFIRINOX and Gemcitabine +&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel demonstrated a significant survival improvement compared to gemcitabine alone.&#xD;
      Nab-paclitaxel is especially interesting because it is able to break-down the tumor matrix&#xD;
      and increases the concentration of cytotoxic drugs in the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will explore the modification of the desmoplastic reaction seen in pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer using two approaches, targeting tumor stroma by nab-paclitaxel and the hedgehog&#xD;
      inhibitor LDE225 and targeting the tumor cells with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Growing body of evidence suggests that the stroma is not only a mechanical barrier that may&#xD;
      prevent efficient delivery of various anticancer therapies to the tumor, but also constitutes&#xD;
      a dynamic compartment of pancreatic tumors that is critically involved in tumor formation,&#xD;
      progression and metastasis. Thus, targeting both tumor stroma and cancer cells could be a&#xD;
      lucrative strategy to increase the efficacy of our therapeutic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study we want to explore the safety and activity of the chemotherapy&#xD;
      combination: Gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel + LDE225. LDE225 is a hedgehog inhibitor with&#xD;
      promising antitumor activity in several cancer models, including pancreatic cancer. One of&#xD;
      the main activities is also the degradation of the tumor matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer will be treated with fixed&#xD;
      doses of gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel, the same doses used in the recently presented phase&#xD;
      III study (von Hoff American Society of Clinical Oncology ASCO 2013). In the phase I part of&#xD;
      the study LDE225 will be added according to standard dose escalation strategy for phase I&#xD;
      studies, and at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) patients will be treated in the phase II&#xD;
      part of the study.&#xD;
