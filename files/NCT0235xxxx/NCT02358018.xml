  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use a new type of scan, called 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT scan,&#xD;
      instead of OctreoScan, the standard scan, to diagnose, monitor and manage your tumor.&#xD;
      68Ga-DOTATOC is an improved imaging agent being routinely used in many centers outside the&#xD;
      USA, with better tumor detection than with OctreoScan.&#xD;

    <description>Study participants will undergo the 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT after informed consent. The nominal injected dose will be up 3-5.5 mCi containing approximately 10 - 50 microgram of 68Ga-DOTATOC and will be injected via IV access lines. CT scans will be performed with our standard oral contrast agent (typically Omnipaque and/or barium) in accordance with our standard FDG practice unless some contraindication is present. Uptake period following injection will be 0.75-1hour. Acquisition time will be approximately ~1 hour. In patients who may not be able to lie still, anesthesia will be provided as per routine standard clinical practice.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients diagnosed or suspected NET requiring 111In-pentetreotide imaging for clinical&#xD;
             indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  High risk of NET because of familial predisposition with clinical findings requiring&#xD;
             radiolabeled somatostatin imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other somatostatin positive tumor for which 111In-pentetreotide has been used&#xD;
             successfully (for example adult meningioma).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) (if the patient is&#xD;
             deemed by the treating physician to be cognitively impaired or questionably impaired&#xD;
             in such a way that the ability of the patient to give informed consent is&#xD;
             questionable) to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the&#xD;
             effects of 68Ga-DOTATOC in pregnancy are not known; exceptions may be performed if&#xD;
             expected risk outweighs the benefit. Pregnancy testing will follow MITS procedure for&#xD;
             diagnostic reagents. Patients self report pregnancy status. If pregnant the test will&#xD;
             not be performed unless in the clinical opinion of the attending physician the gain of&#xD;
             the test is likely to outweigh the risk (this will be rare). If unsure whether&#xD;
             pregnant or not then a urine or serum pregnancy will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to administration of 68Ga-DOTATOC in the mother, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued for at least one day if the mother receives 68Ga-DOTATOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that have contraindications for 111In-pentetreotide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known severe allergy or hypersensitivity to oral contrast will preclude administration&#xD;
             of such contrast (will preclude receiving oral contrast only).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a body weight of 400 pounds or more or not able to enter the bore of the&#xD;
             PET/CT scanner due to BMI, because of the compromise in image quality with CT, PET/CT&#xD;
             and MRI that will result.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any additional medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating&#xD;
             circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may significantly interfere&#xD;
             with study compliance.&#xD;
