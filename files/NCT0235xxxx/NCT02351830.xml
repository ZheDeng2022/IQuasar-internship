  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EEU has proven effective in multiple studies evaluating various aspects of seasonal&#xD;
      allergic rhinitis. All previous EEU clinical trials have utilized ragweed or grass pollen as&#xD;
      the allergen of choice for dispersal, due to the local population, but many emerging&#xD;
      treatments for allergic rhinitis are allergen specific, thus it is desirable to expand the&#xD;
      repertoire of pollen selection for use in the EEU. Ragweed, grass and birch pollen have&#xD;
      differing appearances and sizes but essentially, both have characteristics which promote the&#xD;
      ability to keep the pollen grains suspended and hence, the ability to maintain proper&#xD;
      concentrations within the EEU. Preliminary validation studies conducted in the EEU, absent of&#xD;
      human volunteers, have confirmed our ability to release, disperse and maintain birch pollen&#xD;
      concentrations in the EEU using the existing technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to validate the use of birch pollen on a clinical scale. By adding non-&#xD;
      allergic participants into the EEU, the investigators hope to determine if non-allergic&#xD;
      persons exhibit differences at baseline in their &quot;epigenetic biomarkers&quot; from those who have&#xD;
      pre-existing and established allergic airways inflammation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Environmental Exposure Unit (EEU) is a controlled allergen challenge model of allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis ('hayfever') that has been used extensively to study various anti-allergic&#xD;
      therapies. The EEU is a unique, internationally recognized research facility that allows for&#xD;
      the exposure of groups of as few as 5 to as many as 150 volunteers simultaneously to ambient&#xD;
      levels of airborne allergens such as ragweed pollen and provides a unique study environment&#xD;
      ideally suited to evaluate efficacy and onset of action of various anti-allergic medications.&#xD;
      This specialized facility, located within Kingston General Hospital, allows for the tight&#xD;
      regulation of environmental variables such as air quality, temperature, humidity and CO2&#xD;
      levels as well as the precise maintenance of allergen concentration within this specialized&#xD;
      room. Thus the EEU provides a closed environment in which participants are exposed to a&#xD;
      predetermined, controlled, constant level of airborne pollen. All previous studies have used&#xD;
      either ragweed or grass pollen, and the investigators have not clinically validated the use&#xD;
      of birch pollen in the EEU. This study will confirm that the birch pollen circulated in the&#xD;
      EEU can generate allergic rhinitis symptoms similar to those seen in the 'real world', and&#xD;
      will also provide an opportunity to collect blood from participants before and after allergen&#xD;
      challenge in order to better understand allergic inflammation, to hopefully someday identify&#xD;
      novel therapies in allergic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of a Screening Visit and one pollen exposure visit. The duration of&#xD;
      each participant's participation in the study from Screening to End of Study (EOS) will be&#xD;
      approximately 3 weeks. The study population will consist of healthy, ambulatory male and&#xD;
      female volunteers, 18-65 years of age with either a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis or&#xD;
      a history of no allergic reactions. Approximately 55-75 participants will be screened to&#xD;
      ensure 50 eligible participants are enrolled into the study (40 allergic, 10 non-allergic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will give written informed consent prior to any study procedures being&#xD;
      performed. Participants who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria during the screening&#xD;
      process will be asked to return to the EEU for their pollen exposure visit. At the Screening&#xD;
      visit participants will provide a full medical history and undergo a physical examination.&#xD;
      They will have their height/weight and vitals measured and skin testing will be performed to&#xD;
      confirm allergic response to a panel of common aeroallergens (or lack of response for the&#xD;
      non-allergic individuals). Women of child bearing potential will undergo a urine pregnancy&#xD;
      test to rule out pregnancy. Eligible participants will be asked to return to the research&#xD;
      site for one 4 hour exposure to birch pollen in the Environmental Exposure Unit (EEU).&#xD;
      Peripheral blood samples will be collected before and after pollen exposure for measurement&#xD;
      of potential biomarkers.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will assess their symptoms every 30 minutes during the 4-hour pollen exposure session and the sum of the 4 nasal symptoms (runny nose, stuffy nose, sneezing and itchy nose) which create the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS)</description>
