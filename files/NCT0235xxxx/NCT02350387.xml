      The purpose of this study is to determine if there are differences in balance, strength,&#xD;
      functional performance and self-reported outcomes for subjects with knee osteoarthritis who&#xD;
      complete a low intensity, long duration eccentric training program compared to those who&#xD;
      complete a high intensity, short duration eccentric training program. This study will be&#xD;
      utilizing the Eccentron (manufactured by BTE Technologies) for the performance of all&#xD;
      eccentric exercise.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in the United States. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the&#xD;
      most common type of arthritis and affects nearly 27 million Americans. Knee OA is the most&#xD;
      common type of osteoarthritis and is estimated to affect 42.1% of women and 31.2% of men over&#xD;
      the age of 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis is most likely multi-factorial with several underlying causes. It is no longer&#xD;
      considered &quot;a degenerative joint disease&quot; but rather a process that involves dynamic&#xD;
      biomechanical, biochemical, and cellular processes. It not only involves degeneration of the&#xD;
      articular cartilage, but also inflammation of the synovium, changes to the underlying&#xD;
      subchondral bone, and the development of osteophytes. Currently, it appears that numerous&#xD;
      systemic factors can lead to the initiation of OA through different causal pathways . These&#xD;
      systemic causes can then be amplified by local factors such as trauma or increased loading&#xD;
      caused by obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no &quot;cure&quot; for OA and attempts to find a disease modifying drug have been&#xD;
      unsuccessful. Thus, treatment currently focuses on mitigating factors that are known to&#xD;
      affect the radiographic progression of the disease as well as lead to activity limitation and&#xD;
      participation restriction.9,10 Decreases in lower extremity strength are a major cause of&#xD;
      activity limitations given the vital role of strength in activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One method that is used to mitigate progressing factors is through the use of an exercise&#xD;
      program. Many types of exercise have been used successfully in the literature including&#xD;
      resistance training. Resistance training can take many different forms such as isometric,&#xD;
      isotonic (concentric and/or eccentric) or isokinetic with various intensities. Presently,&#xD;
      there is little evidence for the use of eccentric training interventions for patients with&#xD;
      knee OA. This study aims to further examine this type of resistance training for the OA&#xD;
      population. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the effects of low intensity,&#xD;
      long duration eccentric resistance training and high intensity, short duration eccentric&#xD;
      resistance training in individuals with knee OA. Ideally, this study will allow us to&#xD;
      determine the overall effects of eccentric resistance training as well as the potential&#xD;
      differences of the two types of eccentric resistance training.&#xD;
