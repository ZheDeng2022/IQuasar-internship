    <textblock>
      The Dose Escalation Phase will determine the MTD of MPT0E028 and evaluate its safety and&#xD;
      tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical effects; the subsequent Dose Confirmation&#xD;
      Phase will be a cohort expansion at or below the MTD (i.e., an RP2D) of MPT0E028.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study that will evaluate MPT0E028 in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced solid malignancies. Subjects will be treated with oral doses of&#xD;
      MPT0E028 in consecutive, 28-day cycles, and will be evaluated regularly for safety. Subjects&#xD;
      who tolerate the drug and who do not experience progressive disease may continue to receive&#xD;
      MPT0E028 at the discretion of the principal Investigator for up to 6 cycles. The Sponsor will&#xD;
      keep providing drug for extension cycles to subjects whose disease is controlled at the end&#xD;
      of 6th cycle until the end of the study or until the early study termination determined by&#xD;
      sponsor. Subjects will return for a follow-up visit 28 days after completion of the end of&#xD;
      Study.&#xD;
