      Phase Ib study in 90 healthy adults,18 years to 65 years of age, to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and immunogenicity of the VRC-EBOADC069-00-VP (cAd3-EBO) and VRC-EBOADC076-00-VP&#xD;
      (cAd3-EBOZ) investigational Ebola vaccines in Part 1 and boosting with the&#xD;
      VRC-EBOMVA079-00-VP (MVA-EbolaZ) investigational Ebola vaccine in Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Randomizations to cAd3-EBO or cAd3-EBOZ at two different dose levels within Group 1&#xD;
      will include at least 60 volunteers who have never received an investigational Ebola vaccine.&#xD;
      Randomizations to cAd3-EBO at two different dose levels within Group 2 may include up to 30&#xD;
      eligible participants who previously participated in the RV247 vaccine clinical trial and&#xD;
      received the investigational VRC-EBODNA023-00-VP (Ebola DNA WT) vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Participants in Part 1 may receive a booster vaccination with the MVA-EbolaZ vaccine&#xD;
      at the same dose level.&#xD;

      Study Design: This Phase 1b, open-label study to examine safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of investigational Ebola vaccines is conducted in two Parts. In Part 1&#xD;
      subjects are randomized to receive either the cAd3-EBO or cAd3-EBOZ vaccine at two different&#xD;
      dose levels. In Part 2, participants from Part 1 may receive a booster injection with the&#xD;
      MVA-EbolaZ vaccine; all at the same dose level. The hypotheses are that the study vaccines,&#xD;
      cAd3-EBO, cAd3-EBOZ and MVA-EbolaZ, will be safe and will elicit immune responses to Ebola&#xD;
      glycoprotein (GP). The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      study vaccines administered as intramuscular (IM) injections. The secondary objectives are&#xD;
      related to immunogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Products Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRC-EBOADC069-00-VP (cAd3-EBO) is composed of two recombinant cAd3 vectors in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      that express Ebola WT GPs from Zaire and Sudan strains. It is formulated at 2x10(11) particle&#xD;
      units (PU)/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRC-EBOADC076-00-VP (cAd3-EBOZ) is composed of a cAd3 vector that expresses Ebola WT GP from&#xD;
      the Zaire strain. It is formulated at 1x10(11) PU/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRC-DILADC065-00-VP (diluent) is the vaccine formulation buffer and will be used when needed&#xD;
      to prepare the correct dosage of cAd3-EBO or cAd3-EBOZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRC-EBOMVA079-00-VP (MVA-EbolaZ) is composed of a MVA vector that expresses Ebola WT GP from&#xD;
      the Zaire strain. It is formulated at 3.2x10(8) PFU/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 Study Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: 60 volunteers will be randomized: 15 in each of the two dosage groups for&#xD;
      VRC-EBOADC069-00-VP [2x10(10) PU or 2x10(11) PU] and 15 in each of the two dosage groups for&#xD;
      VRC-EBOADC076-00-VP [1x10(10) PU or 1x10(11) PU].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: up to 30 volunteers that previously participated in the RV 247 clinical trial who&#xD;
      received the investigational product VRC-EBODNA023-00-VP will be randomized to receive one of&#xD;
      the two dosage groups for VRC-EBOADC069-00-VP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups will be enrolled simultaneously. If less then 30 participants enroll into&#xD;
      Group 2, additional participants may be enrolled into Group 1 for a total of 90 participants&#xD;
      overall. Participants will be evaluated by 9 clinic visits over 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 Study Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 participants who received a study vaccination and have completed at least 36 weeks of&#xD;
      follow-up, who are eligible and consent may receive a booster injection with the&#xD;
      VRC-EBOMVA079-00-VP vaccine at 1x10(8) particle forming units (PFU). Participants will be&#xD;
      evaluated by 11 clinic visits over 48 weeks after beginning Part 2.&#xD;
