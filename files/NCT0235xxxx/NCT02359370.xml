    <textblock>
      Justification and Objectives: The hemodynamic response to stimuli of the airways is a common&#xD;
      phenomenon and its control is important to decrease systemic repercussions. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to compare the effects of intravenous administration of Magnesium Sulphate&#xD;
      versus Lidocaine in the hemodynamics of this reflex after laryngoscopy and tracheal&#xD;
      intubation. Methods: This double blind, randomized, single center, and prospective study&#xD;
      evaluated 56 patients, ASA 1 or 2, aged between 18 and 65 years, scheduled for elective&#xD;
      surgeries under general anesthesia with tracheal intubation. Patients were divided into two&#xD;
      groups. Group M received 30mg/kg of Magnesium Sulphate, and group L 2 mg/kg of Lidocaine&#xD;
      through continuous infusion, immediately before induction of anesthesia. The values for blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and bispectral index (BIS) were measured in both groups at six&#xD;
      distinct moments related to the administration of the drugs under study.&#xD;

      This double-blind, randomized, single center, prospective study was approved by the Local&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee (FEPECS/SES-DF) under the report number 799.112 and has been&#xD;
      identified on the Plataforma Brasil (http://aplicacao.saude.gov.br/plataformabrasil) under&#xD;
      CAAE (Certificate of Presentation for Ethical Consideration) number 33365114.7.0000.5553.&#xD;
      After written informed consent, 56 patients, ASA P1 or P2, aged between 18 and 65 years,&#xD;
      scheduled for elective surgeries with orotracheal intubation (OTI), were assessed regarding&#xD;
      their eligibility between the months of September and November, 2014 Of the 56 patients&#xD;
      selected for the study according to the inclusion criteria, 7 were excluded during the&#xD;
      evaluations, four from group M because of: frequent ventricular extrasystoles, introduction&#xD;
      of nasal swab of adrenaline before the end of evaluations, intubation with video-laryngoscope&#xD;
      and lack of sevoflurane in the vaporizer not checked during the evaluations. Three more&#xD;
      patients were excluded from group L: one because of leakage of drugs (poorly secured venous&#xD;
      access), another because of vomiting with consequent aspiration during ventilation with mask,&#xD;
      and another for failed intubation in the first laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When arriving in the surgery room, the patient was first identified, followed by standard&#xD;
      monitoring with cardioscope (ECG), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), noninvasive blood&#xD;
      pressure (NIBP) and bispectral index (BIS). Venoclysis was performed at the discretion of the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist, in accordance with the scale of the surgery/anesthesia (&quot;Admission&quot; time).&#xD;
      Next, the pre-anesthetic medication was administered with midazolam (MDZ) in the dose of&#xD;
      0.05mg/kg. After two minutes (Time &quot;2' after-MDZ&quot;), the infusion with the drug under study&#xD;
      was started, with a dose of 2mg/kg for lidocaine or 30mg/kg for magnesium sulphate, both&#xD;
      diluted in 15mL of solution and infused in 10 minutes through a continuous infusion pump&#xD;
      (CIP). After finishing the infusion (Time &quot;End-CIP&quot;), pre-oxygenation and anesthetic&#xD;
      induction with intravenous fentanyl 2mcg/kg was performed, followed by propofol 2 mg/kg and&#xD;
      rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg (Time &quot;after-Ind&quot;). The laryngoscopy was performed three minutes after&#xD;
      the end of the rocuronium injection and if the BIS value was equal to or less than 50 (Time&#xD;
      &quot;after-OTI&quot;). If the BIS value was not reached, a venous increment of 1mg/kg of propofol was&#xD;
      administered. After orotracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained through inhalation with&#xD;
      sevoflurane 2%, and new measurements were taken after 3 and 6 minutes of intubation (Times&#xD;
      &quot;3' after-OTI&quot; and &quot;6' after-OTI&quot;). Hypertension was considered when the BP values were 20%&#xD;
      above baseline values or if Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) &gt; 140 mmHg. Hypotension was&#xD;
      considered when the Blood Pressure (BP) values were 20% below baseline values or if SBP &gt; 90&#xD;
      mmHg. Tachycardia was considered when the Heart Rate (HR) values were 20% above baseline&#xD;
      values or if HR &gt; 100 mmHg. Bradycardia was considered for HR values under 50 bpm.&#xD;
