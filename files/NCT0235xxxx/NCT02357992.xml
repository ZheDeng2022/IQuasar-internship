      The goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate the outcome of a standard radiation&#xD;
      treatment called stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, researchers want to learn if standard SRT has as good of an outcome at 3 years&#xD;
      after the procedure. The safety of the study treatment will also be analyzed.&#xD;

      The Study Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment being used in this study is considered standard, but researchers want to see&#xD;
      its outcome in early-stage NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiation (SRT) in this study is designed to kill tumor cells by using beams of radiation&#xD;
      aimed directly at the tumor from different angles. The doctor uses computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      scans to plan exactly where to direct the beams to go. A computer is used to show the&#xD;
      location, size, and shape of the tumor. SRT is designed to cause less damage to normal tissue&#xD;
      than surgery, and it also may allow a higher dose of radiation to be given to the tumor than&#xD;
      if other forms of radiation therapy were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SRT in this study will be performed using a radiation machine called Linear Accelerator&#xD;
      (Linac).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive SRT (as an&#xD;
      out-patient) once a day for 3-4 days in a row. You will be asked to hold still during the&#xD;
      entire treatment (for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours each time). The machine will move around you,&#xD;
      but you will not see or feel anything (similar to getting an x-ray).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment period, you will be seen by a doctor and/or research nurse in order to&#xD;
      check for any side effects. A physical exam will be performed, and your medical history will&#xD;
      be recorded. These follow-up procedures will be done once on any day of your SRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A physical exam will be performed and your medical history will be recorded at 6 and 12&#xD;
      months, then at 1 1/2, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after your SRT. If the doctor decides it is&#xD;
      necessary, you will have a chest x-ray to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 to 12 months after SRT, you will have either a PET-CT scan or CT scan to check the&#xD;
      status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 1 year after SRT, you will have breathing tests to check your lung function. You will also&#xD;
      have a CT scan to check the status of your disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 1 1/2 year and then at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after SRT, you will have a CT scan to check&#xD;
      the status of your disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible Re-Treatment On Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If one of your follow-up CT scans shows that the tumor has come back in the same location or&#xD;
      very close, you will have a PET scan and a tumor biopsy. The purpose is to confirm the status&#xD;
      of the disease. To collect a tumor biopsy, the affected area is numbed with anesthetic, and a&#xD;
      small amount of tissue is withdrawn through a large needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As soon as the results of the scan and biopsy come back, the study doctor will discuss with&#xD;
      you the different treatment options. You may receive surgery, radiation therapy, or&#xD;
      chemotherapy, depending on the status of the disease. You will receive a separate consent&#xD;
      form that describes the treatment in more detail, as well as the risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this &quot;re-treatment&quot;, you will stay on the same schedule for study follow-up visits as&#xD;
      you were following before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this study will be over after the 5-year follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The treatment is commercially available and considered&#xD;
      standard for early-stage NSCLC. This includes the use of the Linac radiation machine, which&#xD;
      is FDA approved and commercially available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 80 treated patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
