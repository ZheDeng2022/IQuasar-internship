    <textblock>
      This study will offer the first formal assessment for sexual violence (SV) in the college&#xD;
      student health center setting, developed for a high risk group of college students, and is&#xD;
      designed to facilitate patient and provider comfort in discussing sexual violence and related&#xD;
      abusive experiences (including the role of alcohol) via semi-scripted screening tools. The&#xD;
      intervention specifically involves the training of all clinical staff (health educators,&#xD;
      counselors, medical assistants, nurses, and clinicians) to deliver a universal education and&#xD;
      brief counseling intervention titled GIFTSS (Giving Information for Trauma Support and&#xD;
      Safety) to all clients seeking college health services integrated into usual clinical&#xD;
      practice, provide universal education about SV regardless of disclosure, counsel clients on&#xD;
      harm reduction strategies to reduce risk for SV, and provide supported referrals to sexual&#xD;
      assault advocates, with the goal of reducing SV among college students.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a stakeholder-engaged longitudinal study to test, via a 2-armed cluster randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial , a brief harm reduction intervention to reduce risk for sexual violence&#xD;
      among male and female college students ages 18-24 receiving care from college student health&#xD;
      services (K = 28 colleges; baseline N = 2295). Sexual violence (SV) (including sexual&#xD;
      coercion, non-consensual sexual contact, and rape) is common among college women, and over&#xD;
      three quarters of women who have been sexually assaulted report that the first of such&#xD;
      experiences occurred before the age of 25. Alcohol-related SV, in particular, is highly&#xD;
      prevalent on college campuses, with about half of sexual assault cases occurring in the&#xD;
      context of victim and/or perpetrator intoxication. Multiple pathways have been implicated in&#xD;
      this association between alcohol and SV, with social norms regarding alcohol consumption and&#xD;
      expectations for SV facilitating both the occurrence and underreporting of such violence.&#xD;
      College student health centers remain an untapped setting to reach youth for both SV&#xD;
      prevention and intervention. This study draws on several intervention studies by the&#xD;
      investigative team, integrating successful components from each: 1) the bystander approach in&#xD;
      which individuals are taught skills as active interveners in SV prevention rather than&#xD;
      responding with apathy or tolerance is an effective strategy for promoting change within&#xD;
      social contexts; 2) universal education about SV regardless of disclosure in the clinical&#xD;
      setting can result in increased recognition of SV and use of relevant services; and 3) harm&#xD;
      reduction strategies introduced by clinicians can increase intentions to use strategies to&#xD;
      help oneself and friends that increase safety. The brief counseling intervention uses a&#xD;
      palm-size educational card with information about SV and harm reduction given to all patients&#xD;
      during clinical encounters. GIFTSS (Giving Information for Trauma Support and Safety)&#xD;
      provides (a) patient education and assessment regarding SV; (b) discussion of harm reduction&#xD;
      behaviors to reduce risk of SV for self and peers (including bystander intervention); and (c)&#xD;
      supported referrals to victim services. Interventions effective in reaching more college-age&#xD;
      young adults who either witness or experience SV are needed. College student health centers&#xD;
      randomized into the GIFTSS intervention arm will receive training in this brief intervention&#xD;
      integrated into routine college health visits. The control sites will receive a brief alcohol&#xD;
      intervention. Compared to controls, male and female clients receiving the GIFTSS intervention&#xD;
      are expected to have greater recognition of what constitutes SV and alcohol-related sexual&#xD;
      risk (primary outcome), recognition of sexual coercion, self-efficacy to obtain sexual&#xD;
      consent, self-efficacy to enact harm reduction strategies, intentions to intervene, and&#xD;
      knowledge of and self-efficacy to use SV-related services (Aim 1). Among participants who&#xD;
      have witnessed peer SV, those receiving GIFTSS will be more likely to report interventions to&#xD;
      interrupt peer's harmful behaviors (Aim 2). Clients with SV victimization history who receive&#xD;
      GIFTSS are expected to be more likely to disclose SV during their clinic visit, report&#xD;
      greater use of SV-related services, and report less recent SV victimization at follow up&#xD;
      compared to control clients (Aim 3).&#xD;
