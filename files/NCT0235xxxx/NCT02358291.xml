  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our study, a multicenter randomized controlled，single blind trial will be performed to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these three procedures for the treatment of&#xD;
      symptomatic lumbar disc herniation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most common diseases in the department of&#xD;
      orthopedics, which produced medical and economic burdens to families and society. In spite,&#xD;
      the majority of the patients with disc herniation can be relieved or even cured via&#xD;
      conservative treatment; there are still a considerable number of invalid patients who&#xD;
      eventually still need to be undergoing a surgical operation treatment. Three main methods for&#xD;
      intervertebral disc surgery are adopted in our routine work. One procedure is Open Discectomy&#xD;
      (OD), which has been always a gold standard for treatment of LDH. And the other two&#xD;
      procedures are Microendoscopic Discectomy (MED) and Transforaminal Endoscopic Lumbar&#xD;
      Discectomy (TELD) respectively. MED and TELD have been developed as alternatives to OD. OD&#xD;
      can compress the nerve root or spinal cord through removal of the protrusion. However, it&#xD;
      destroys the rear structure of spine, causing segmental instability and long-term distress.&#xD;
      Compared with OD, MED and TELD procedures are smaller incisions or less dissection (or both),&#xD;
      lower blood loss, less postoperative pain, shorter hospitalisation and earlier return to&#xD;
      work. However, the steep learning curves of MID inhibit the development of surgery&#xD;
      specialists; for example, optimal surgical management requires many years of experience.&#xD;
      These deficiencies need more educational effort at a higher priority than accorded so far.&#xD;
      There are inconsistent outcomes about the efficacy and safety in the previous studies; all of&#xD;
      the recent researches do not yield conclusive results.&#xD;

    <description>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) -&gt; The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is one of the principal condition-specific outcome measures used in the management of spinal disorders. The ODI is the most commonly outcome measures in patients with low back pain. Each of the 10 items is scored from 0 - 5. The maximum score is therefore 50.

    <description>The open discectomy, will be performed under general anesthesia in the prone position with horizontal. The level of the spine indicated for surgical treatment will be identified with the aid of fluoroscopy. An incision is made about the dorsal disc level involved with dissection of the paravertebral muscles on the side of disc herniation. After laminectomy and resection of part of the yellow ligament, partial discectomy is done under direct vision.</description>
