      What is heart failure with normal ejection fraction? The heart contracts (pumps) and relaxes&#xD;
      with each heartbeat. In some people with heart failure, the heart contracts normally but&#xD;
      there is reduced relaxation of the heart. As a result, people notice a feeling of&#xD;
      breathlessness, ankle swelling and fatigue especially on exertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators feel that patients with reduced or impaired relaxation of the heart have&#xD;
      less heart filling time and poor energy utilisation during exercise. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators are conducting a study to more thoroughly understand the disease condition by&#xD;
      giving a drug called ivabradine to reduce the heart rate and hence to increase the heart&#xD;
      filling time in these patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE About 50% of patients with heart failure have a normal ejection&#xD;
      fraction (HFNEF). Although traditionally considered a more benign disorder than the related&#xD;
      heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF), the mortality figures for patients with&#xD;
      HFNEF and HFREF are now known to be comparable. Surprisingly, despite HFNEF's importance as a&#xD;
      major health concern, the pathophysiological basis of HFNEF's remains poorly understood with&#xD;
      some commentators even suggesting that HFNEF's pathophysiology is a variant of HFREF. Further&#xD;
      confounding the understanding of HFNEF, existing studies included heterogenous patients of&#xD;
      stratified ethnicities and ages who were assessed at rest. Such patients may not exhibit the&#xD;
      same physiology as the typically elderly female HFNEF patients who experience symptoms during&#xD;
      exertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elucidating the mechanisms underlying HFNEF is pressing as there is a paucity of evidence to&#xD;
      even begin to guide therapy. In the absence of supportive trial evidence, clinical practice&#xD;
      has been predicated on assumptions made regarding the physiology of diastolic (dys)function.&#xD;
      For example, rate limitation is often advocated in HFNEF based on the 19th century&#xD;
      observations by Lewis Katz that at higher heart rates, shortening of diastolic filling period&#xD;
      impairs cardiac filling and results in lower stroke volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such empirical practices are beset by HFNEF's complexity. A consistent feature of HFNEF is&#xD;
      reduced chronotropic reserve. In one study HFNEF patients were assessed invasively using&#xD;
      pressure-volume loops during basal conditions and handgrip exercise with atrial pacing at&#xD;
      120bpm. It was concluded that at higher heart rates, there was a significant blunting of&#xD;
      frequency-dependent ventricular relaxation and that rate-related diastolic chamber stiffness&#xD;
      compromised stroke volume explaining exertional limitation. Other investigators have disputed&#xD;
      the aberrancy of diastolic filling limitation, questioning the potential benefits of heart&#xD;
      rate limitation using beta-blockers and raising the potential for pacing as a treatment for&#xD;
      HNEF. We confirmed the impaired chronotropic reserve in HFNEF. We also demonstrated dynamic&#xD;
      slowing of LV relaxation during exercise that was associated with and potentially&#xD;
      attributable to impaired cardiac energetics (albeit at rest)9. However, to determine the&#xD;
      pertinence of heart rate to inadequate exertional reserve in HFNEF, heart rate needs to be&#xD;
      manipulated in the complex neurohormonal, autonomic and haemodynamic context of exercise. The&#xD;
      fundamental limitation of existing studies, including those utilizing pacing and handgrip, is&#xD;
      that exercise physiology was not recapitulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac MR is the most accurate and versatile method for phenotyping the heart in research&#xD;
      studies, and can assess cardiac volumes and mass with unparalleled accuracy and&#xD;
      reproducibility. 31P MRS is the only technique that allows non-invasive measurement of&#xD;
      cardiac high-energy phosphate metabolism in vivo. Our department has developed a 31P-MRS&#xD;
      protocol which allows for measuring high energy phosphate molecules at rest and during&#xD;
      exercise Cardiopulmonary exercise testing with peak oxygen consumption measurement has been&#xD;
      shown to be a reliable mechanistic readout of integrated cardiac function in heart failure&#xD;
      with preserved ejection fraction9,. It is also safe and reliable in elderly patients with&#xD;
      heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, chronotropic incompetence could either be a compensatory phenomenon serving to&#xD;
      limit cardiac energetic depletion on exercise and also increasing diastolic filling in the&#xD;
      context of an abbreviated diastolic filling time due to dynamic slowing of active relaxation.&#xD;
      Alternatively it might contribute to exercise limitation by limiting cardiac output&#xD;
      augmentation on exercise (since cardiac output is the product of heart rate and stroke&#xD;
      volume). In order to investigate this LV filling and cardiac output pathophysiology in HFNEF,&#xD;
      we will employ Ivabradine, that reduces heart rate but has no direct effect on&#xD;
      contractile/lusitropic function or on vascular tone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ivabradine is indicated in symptomatic chronic stable angina patients who are unable to&#xD;
      tolerate or with a contra-indication to the use of beta-blockers. It can be used in&#xD;
      combination with beta-blockers whose heart rate is &gt; 60 bpm. We will use ivabradine as a&#xD;
      pharmacological tool to investigate diastolic filling/function and hence its effect on&#xD;
      cardiac function and metabolism of energy. Ivabradine dose has been extensively validated and&#xD;
      deemed safe in the a previous study (Beautiful study). The common side effects are transient&#xD;
      enhanced brightness in a limited area of the visual field, usually triggered by sudden&#xD;
      variations in light intensity and blurred vision. Other common side effects are bradycardia,&#xD;
      headache and dizziness possibly related to bradycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ivabradine is metabolised by CYP3A4 and the concomitant use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such&#xD;
      as azole antifungals (ketoconazole, itraconazole), macrolide antibiotics (clarithromycin,&#xD;
      erythromycin, josamycin, telithromycin), HIV protease inhibitors and nefazodone is&#xD;
      contraindicated. The combination of ivabradine with the heart rate reducing agents diltiazem&#xD;
      or verapamil is not recommended. Other drugs which combination with ivabradine is not&#xD;
      recommended are QT prolongation drugs (quinidine, disopyramide, bepridil, sotalol, ibutilide,&#xD;
      amiodarone, pimozide, ziprasidone, sertindole, mefloquine, halofantrine, pentamidine).&#xD;
      Combination of ivabradine with beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists,&#xD;
      diuretics, short and long acting nitrates, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, fibrates, proton&#xD;
      pump inhibitors, oral antidiabetics, aspirin, and other anti-platelet agents has been found&#xD;
      to be safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although not a clinical trial, we will assess the impact of lowering heart rate on exercise&#xD;
      in patients with HFNEF and in matched patients with hypertension but no exercise limitation&#xD;
      in order to begin to understand the role of heart rate in diastolic physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection Through our HFNEF community screening programme, and via heart failure&#xD;
      clinics in Oxford we will identify 30 patients with HFNEF who meet ESC criteria and&#xD;
      additionally have peak VO2 ≤ 85% with a cardiac pattern of exercise limitation during CPEX;&#xD;
      30 matched hypertensive controls without HFNEF (no subjective complaint of breathlessness and&#xD;
      peak V02 &gt; 90% of age and gender predicted) will be recruited and studied in Aberdeen by a&#xD;
      research team led by Professor Michael Frenneaux. 20 matched healthy subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited in Oxford to provide normal reference values for study examinations at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN Summary of study design This research project has 3 groups and will be done in 2&#xD;
      different centres, Oxford and Aberdeen. Both HFNEF and hypertensive controls (positive&#xD;
      controls) will participate in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      crossover design consisting of two experimental periods (Ivabradine 7.5mg bd vs placebo each&#xD;
      for two weeks with two weeks washout in between). Normal controls (negative controls) will&#xD;
      only undergo baseline assessments and will not be given Ivabradine or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (University of Oxford) This will be done by a research team led by Dr Houman&#xD;
      Ashrafian and Prof S Neubauer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients with HFNEF, who are at least 60 years old will be recruited from the heart&#xD;
      failure clinic at the John Radcliffe Hospital or the HFNEF community screening programme in&#xD;
      Oxford over a 24-month period. Only those with VO2max of ≤ 85% with a cardiac pattern of&#xD;
      exercise limitation during CPEX at screening will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of screening visit, all eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the&#xD;
      possible experimental sequences. Each subject will receive either Ivabradine 7.5mg bd or&#xD;
      matching placebo tablets (Period 1), followed by a 2-week washout period, and then placebo or&#xD;
      Ivabradine 7.5mg bd for the final 2-week period (Period 2). The subject and study&#xD;
      investigators will be blind to the randomization schedule. Patients will be evaluated at&#xD;
      baseline and at the end of the two experimental periods in John Radcliffe hospital. All the&#xD;
      evaluation days will last approximately 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderly participants will be allowed to perform MRI/MRS on the next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (University of Aberdeen) This will be done by a research team led by Professor&#xD;
      Michael Frenneaux. 30 matched hypertensive controls, without heart failure symptoms who are&#xD;
      at least 65 years old will be recruited in Aberdeen over a 24-month period. Only those with&#xD;
      VO2max of &gt; 90% predicted during CPEX at screening will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elderly participants will be allowed to perform nuclear study or MRI/MRS on the next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 (Normal Subjects) 20 matched normal controls, who are at least 18 years old will be&#xD;
      recruited in Oxford over a 24-month period. All participants will only undergo Visit 1 tests&#xD;
      and will not be given Ivabradine or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures Eligibility of patients will be checked by predefined inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria at the time of attendance to the heart failure clinic (Oxford), cardiology clinics,&#xD;
      cardiac investigation department and other relevant clinics in John Radcliffe hospital (such&#xD;
      as hypertension, diabetes e.t.c.) or hypertension/cardiology clinic (Aberdeen Royal&#xD;
      Infirmary) by the clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
