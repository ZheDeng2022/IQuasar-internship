      This study is a multicenter, prospective, control study. Patients with acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
      who meet inclusion criteria would be enrolled in the study. If the patient or patient's&#xD;
      legally authorized representative decides that the patient should receive the intervention&#xD;
      operation and signs the informed consent of intervention operation, the patient will be&#xD;
      assigned to the intervention group. If the patient participates in the EAST study but refuses&#xD;
      intervention after notified of all the benefits and risk of intervention and conservative&#xD;
      treatment, the patient will be assigned to the control group.There will be 150 patients&#xD;
      enrolled in each group. Patients in the intervention group will be treated with mechanical&#xD;
      recanalization using Solitaire plus standard medical therapy. Patients in the control group&#xD;
      will receive standard medical therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were followed up for 90 days upon enrollment. During the trial, multiple&#xD;
      indicators will be assessed in all patients at baseline, 24hours,14days (or at discharge,&#xD;
      whichever occurs first) and 90 days. Primary efficacy endpoint will be functional&#xD;
      independence as defined by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≤ 2 at 90 days or function&#xD;
      improvement by mRS shift analysis.Primary procedure efficacy endpoint will be arterial&#xD;
      recanalization of the occluded target vessel measured by Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction&#xD;
      (TICI) score equal or superior to 2b right following the use of the Study Device. Primary&#xD;
      safety endpoint is systematic ICH with 24 ±3hrs post procedure.The secondary endpoints&#xD;
      include: rate of device-related and procedure related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) at 14&#xD;
      days or discharge; volume of cerebral infarction as measured by a CT scan at 24 ±3hrs post&#xD;
      procedure; arterial reperfusion measured by reperfusion ratio on CT scan 24 ±3hrs post&#xD;
      procedure; infarction in subjects who achieved TICI 2b-3 reperfusion without intracranial&#xD;
      hemorrhage;death due to any cause at 14days or discharge and at 90 days; change in NIHSSat&#xD;
      24±3hrs post procedure;change in NIHSS at 14 days or discharge post procedure; change in&#xD;
      NIHSSat 90 ± 7days; quality of life at 90± 7days; the proportion of patients who suffer a&#xD;
      Safety Outcome : the proportion of patients with the composite of: (i) symptomatic&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhage (ii) major bleeding due to femoral artery access complications&#xD;
      including groin hematoma, retroperitoneal hematoma (iii) contrast nephropathy;economic&#xD;
      (cost-effectiveness) analysis;evaluation of waiver/deferral of consent process; the total&#xD;
      radiation dose (CT, CTA, angiography) reported as a continuous measure;the proportion of&#xD;
      patients with malignant MCA infarction;the proportion of patients undergoing hemicraniectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because a substantial number of patients are expected to have intracranial atherosclerosis,&#xD;
      subgroup analysis will also be carried out on this group of patient. The clinical outcomes,&#xD;
      the final TICI score after angioplasty and possible stenting, and symptomatic ICH (including&#xD;
      SAH) and immediate re-thrombosis rate will be included in the subgroup analysis.&#xD;
