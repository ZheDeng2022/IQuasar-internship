      The investigators will apply 129Xenon and/or 3He image acquisition and analysis methods in&#xD;
      120 asthma patient volunteers in order to characterize and probe the relationship between&#xD;
      lung structure and function using imaging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory, longitudinal study with no medication evaluated. 120 asthma patients&#xD;
      will visit the Clinical Imaging Research Laboratories at Robarts Research Institute two times&#xD;
      over three years: at baseline, and at three years. For the first 60 subjects there will be 3&#xD;
      additional visits - two visits within 4 weeks of baseline (BL+2 weeks; BL+4 weeks; BL+78&#xD;
      weeks) in order to help generate reproducibility data and temporal maps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all subjects, the Baseline visit will include 129Xe and/or 3He MRI, chest CT, sputum&#xD;
      induction, Pulmonary Function Tests, Airwave Oscillation test, Lung Clearance Index test,&#xD;
      BORG Dyspnea Scale, and MRC Dyspnea Scale. All procedures will be before, during and after&#xD;
      methacholine challenge (MCh). For V2, all but CT and MCh will be acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 1a and 1b will include MRI, Pulmonary Function Tests including Airwave Oscillation and&#xD;
      Lung Clearance Index, and dyspnea questionnaires; Visit 1c will also include sputum&#xD;
      induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a telephone call at 52+/- 2 weeks, and 104 +/- 2 weeks. to track exacerbations&#xD;
      and update medications. Subjects will complete self-assessments in the form of a) the Asthma&#xD;
      Quality of Life Questionnaire with Standardized Activities (AQLQ(S)) bi-weekly, and the&#xD;
      Asthma Control Diary (weekly) between visits. Self-reported data (the weekly asthma control&#xD;
      diary and bi-weekly AQLQ(S)) will be uploaded by each subject monthly to the investigators&#xD;
      website using a confidential and password protected upload&#xD;
      (www.imaging.robarts.ca/~gep/ForPatients.htm).&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Hyperpolarized Noble Gas MRI</intervention_name>
    <description>Hyperpolarized Helium-3 and/or Xenon-129. Noble gas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently emerged as another research approach for the non-invasive measurement of lung structure and function, including conduction of gas through airways and into airspaces.&#xD;
Noble gas MRI provides a complimentary and alternative method for evaluating lung disease and may be superior to CT because it allows simultaneous visualization of both airway and airspace structure and function.</description>
