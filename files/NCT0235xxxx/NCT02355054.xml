      The purpose of this study is to provide clinical access to PET/CT and PET/MRI with C-11&#xD;
      choline for evaluation of men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer while awaiting&#xD;
      approval of the Washington University Abbreviated New Drug Application for C-11 choline.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient must have biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate initially treated with&#xD;
             curative intent (surgery and radiation therapy are most common treatments but other&#xD;
             treatments are also eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Biochemical recurrence defined as any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL in at least two sequential tests for patients treated with&#xD;
                  surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PSA ≥ 2.0 ng/mL above the post therapy nadir for patients treated with radiation&#xD;
                  therapy, brachytherapy or cryotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PSA ≥ 2.0 ng/ml above the most recent therapy nadir for patients who have&#xD;
                  received additional treatment in the recurrent setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient must have undergone standard-of-care restaging that does not clearly identify&#xD;
             site(s) of active disease. Standard staging examinations may include one or more of&#xD;
             the following: CT or MRI, bone imaging (either Tc-99m bisphosphonate scintigraphy or&#xD;
             F-18 sodium fluoride PET), OR In-111 capromab pendetide scintigraphy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age &gt; 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient must be able to tolerate PET/MRI or PET/CT imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign an Advance Beneficiary Notice&#xD;
             (ABN) (Medicare patient) or a Notice of Non-coverage (NNC) from (non-Medicare patient)&#xD;
             that addresses the potential cost to the patient of C-11 choline PET/CT or PET/MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. For patients planned to have PET/MRI:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient must not have claustrophobia or any other contraindication to MRI as&#xD;
                  evaluated by a standardized MRI safety questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If applicable, patient must not have renal insufficiency (estimated glomerular&#xD;
                  filtration rate &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 based on measurement within the past 60 days)&#xD;
                  or be undergoing dialysis as these conditions preclude safe administration of MRI&#xD;
                  contrast agents. NOTE: At the discretion of principal investigator, a subject may&#xD;
                  be allowed to enroll/continue on study and undergo imaging without the&#xD;
                  administration of contrast in the event of renal insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If applicable, patient must not have a known prior reaction to gadolinium based&#xD;
                  MRI contrast agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. For patients planned to have PET/CT:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient must not have claustrophobia that would preclude PET/CT imaging or other&#xD;
                  contraindications to CT imaging.&#xD;
