    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and usability of newly developed&#xD;
      exergames on exploring the hemineglected space of left neglected stroke patients. Furthermore&#xD;
      to understand the experience of living with visuospatial neglect and to explore the users'&#xD;
      experiences (patients and clinic staff) with those new exergames.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within the REWIRE project, nine exergames have been developed for the treatment of&#xD;
      visuospatial neglect after stroke. All the exercises were aimed, according to classical&#xD;
      rehabilitation, to drive the patients towards the exploration of the hemi-neglected space.&#xD;
      The Gentile's taxonomy has been extended to neglect patients and was used to develop the&#xD;
      exergames. Gentile's taxonomy of motor skills allows a simple to complex progression of&#xD;
      skills and enables determining progress on an objective basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to these specifications, the exergames targeting the exploration of space with&#xD;
      additional cognitive and memory tasks with increasing difficulty levels have been developed.&#xD;
      This allows an individual game selection suitable for the neglect patient's cognitive skills&#xD;
      and guarantees a constant learning process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments and the virtual-reality based neglect training intervention for the stroke&#xD;
      patients will take place at the collaborating rehabilitation clinics in Switzerland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neglect training is thought to be an additional therapy option to regain functional&#xD;
      independence together with the standard rehabilitation program patients are following during&#xD;
      their inpatient stay at the clinic. The exergame neglect training intervention is based on&#xD;
      the widely accepted motor learning training principles specificity, initial values, overload&#xD;
      and progression. Furthermore, the intervention is planned according to the FITT components;&#xD;
      these are: Frequency, Intensity, Time and Type of training. The intervention is characterized&#xD;
      by the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency: 5 sessions per week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intensity: individually adjusted by the treating therapist according to the progress of&#xD;
           the participating patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time: 30-45 minutes per training for 3 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type: REWIRE neglect exergames&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing cognition: Zürcher Maxi Mental Status Test (ZüMAX) The ZüMAX is a test performed in&#xD;
      an interview situation to get a quick (about 30 min) first assessment of neuropsychological&#xD;
      deficits but suits also for long term controlling. It provides a reliable index of the&#xD;
      following domains: language, praxia, learning and memory, perception and visual-constructive&#xD;
      abilities as well as of executive functions. In each of these five functional domains, a&#xD;
      maximum of 6 points can be scored; obviously, a total of 30 points represents optimal&#xD;
      functioning. In addition to this numerical scoring, the ZüMAX allows also the qualitative&#xD;
      judgment of an individual's alertness, ability to cooperate, tempo and emotion. The necessary&#xD;
      equipment for the ZüMAX is the following: stopwatch, metronome, pencil for patients (no&#xD;
      ruler, no eraser), 24 stimulus cards (chimerical faces), ZüMAX testing form with one&#xD;
      coversheet, seven demonstration sheets, four work sheets and four record sheets. Its&#xD;
      test-retest-reliability and concurrent validity have recently been examined for the stroke&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing eye movements: The Eye Tribe Tracker (TETT) To get a better estimate if the games&#xD;
      really influence the exploration of the hemi-neglected space, the eye movements will be&#xD;
      tracked by &quot;THE EYE TRIBE TRACKER&quot; (TETT). It was developed by the Copenhagen-based&#xD;
      eye-tracking start-up company, The Eye Tribe. The company is the first in its category to&#xD;
      offer reliable, consumer-grade eye tracking products. The Eye Tribe tracker is a brand new&#xD;
      sensor combined with an infrared illumination system that provides the very best conditions&#xD;
      for the eye tracking algorithms to work with. The high resolution sensor ensures that the&#xD;
      tiny movements of the pupils can be tracked with high precision while maintaining a wide&#xD;
      field of view. The advanced algorithms work in tandem with the hardware to optimize for most&#xD;
      environments and light conditions. However, it works best in indoor scenarios without direct&#xD;
      sunlight on the device. Its operating range is from 45cm to 75cm, and the tracking area is&#xD;
      40cm x 30cm at 65cm distance (30Hz). The participant will perform an adapted version (using&#xD;
      their eyes instead of their finger) of the test developed by Rabuffetti et al. This Neglect&#xD;
      test consists of a uniform distribution of 120 stimuli, either letters or shapes, including&#xD;
      40 targets and 80 distracters. Each participant will be seated in front of the screen with&#xD;
      the mid-sagittal plane of the trunk aligned with the center of the screen. The task consists&#xD;
      of looking (instead of touching with the index finger) at all the targets that the subject&#xD;
      will be able to detect. Once the target will be looked at for approximately 2 seconds, it&#xD;
      will be circled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to avoid compensatory movements of the head, a chin rest (will be located at the&#xD;
      table in front of the patient. This model is individually adjustable to the height of the&#xD;
      patient, produced out of hygienic materials (varnished wood, aluminium, polyester tissue) and&#xD;
      regularly used by opticians for vision training. The chin rest will also be used during the&#xD;
      intervention while playing the exergames.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing visuospatial neglect: Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT, German: NET) The&#xD;
      standardized BIT consists of six conventional subtests (similar to the cancellation,&#xD;
      bisection, and copying measures) and nine behavioral subtests designed to identify a wide&#xD;
      variety of visual neglect behaviors. The conventional subtests are as follows: Letter and&#xD;
      Star Cancellation , Figure and Shape Copying, Line Crossing and Bisection and&#xD;
      Representational Drawing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nine behavioral subtests of the instrument all assess aspects of daily life: Picture&#xD;
      Scanning with three pictures (plate of food, bathroom sink, and a room), Telephone Dialing,&#xD;
      Menu Reading; Article Reading, Telling and Setting Time, Coin Sorting, Address and Sentence&#xD;
      Copying, Map Navigation, and Card Sorting. Each subtest receives a maximum of 9 points, so&#xD;
      the maximum total score is 81. Scores can provide a functional profile of neglect and a&#xD;
      meaningful guide for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BIT has been shown to be a robust predictor of visuospatial neglect and is a predictor of&#xD;
      functionality after stroke. It quantifies neglect through offering an established concrete&#xD;
      cutoff for detection of visuospatial neglect (BIT &lt; 130). Inter-rater, parallel form, and&#xD;
      test-retest reliability are high (r = .99, .91, .99, respectively, p &lt; .001). Concurrent&#xD;
      validity was established by examining the relationship between the conventional and&#xD;
      behavioral test scores (r = .92, P &lt; .001). There exists a validated German version of the&#xD;
      BIT, called NET (Neglect-Test) which will be used for this study project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ZüMAX and the NET will be repeated after 3 weeks training intervention and furthermore 4&#xD;
      weeks after the training intervention as follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As follow up the investigator assessing personal experiences of neglect patients with&#xD;
      individual interviews.To describe and understand how persons with visuo-spatial neglect&#xD;
      experience and discover their disabilities in daily life during rehabilitation, the&#xD;
      investigator therefore has chosen to adopt a transcendental or psychological phenomenological&#xD;
      research design. A phenomenological study describes the meaning for several individuals of&#xD;
      their lived experiences of a phenomenon - in this project: visuo-spatial neglect. These&#xD;
      experiences are best assessed in individual interviews. To find out if the experience of&#xD;
      playing the neglect exergames supported them in learning to handle their disabilities,&#xD;
      open-ended interview questions addressing this topic are included in the interview guide. The&#xD;
      interview will take place during the same week as the follow-up measurements at a place&#xD;
      convenient for the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meanwhile the investigator is assessing also the personal experiences of the clinic staff&#xD;
      involved in the neglect exergame training with a focus group interview. In order to deepen&#xD;
      the collected answers from the questionnaire given by the clinic staff involved in the study,&#xD;
      the examiner will organize a focus-group interview after termination of the neglect exergame&#xD;
      training intervention. The beforehand evaluated &quot;clinic staff questionnaires&quot; will serve as a&#xD;
      basis for discussion.&#xD;
