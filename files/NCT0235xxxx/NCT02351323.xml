    <textblock>
      Over the past two decades, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has emerged from relative&#xD;
      obscurity to become one of the most serious complications of obesity in Hispanic obese&#xD;
      populations, especially among those with a family history of T2DM. Few therapies have&#xD;
      demonstrated long term efficacy in combating obesity and risk of T2DM in youth. Given the&#xD;
      emerging evidence that glutamine and leucine (building blocks of protein) may affect energy&#xD;
      partition and thus diabetes risk, and that the relationship of glutamine and diabetic risk&#xD;
      has been further evaluated in one adult observational cohort study but data on leucine are&#xD;
      lacking, we plan to conduct a clinical trial to determine the efficacy of glutamine to reduce&#xD;
      insulin resistance, a diabetes risk factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary specific aim of the research plan is to conduct a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo controlled, clinical trial to test the efficacy of 6 months supplements of glutamine&#xD;
      in reducing biomarkers for insulin resistance and weight gain among 56 obese Hispanic&#xD;
      adolescents age 12-19 years with a BMI at or above the 95th percentile and a family history&#xD;
      of T2DM. At the end of the grant period, we will have obtained preliminary data to plan&#xD;
      pivotal clinical trials of glutamine coupled with or without lifestyle changes.&#xD;

      Because of recruitment difficulties the design was modified several times until April 2013&#xD;
      when we were able to increase recruitment. The following changes were made from initial to&#xD;
      final study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study moved from Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) to clinical setting&#xD;
           (Nutrition and Fitness for Life Clinic)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ages eligible expanded from 12-19 years old to 12-19.9 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ethnicity/Race expanded from Hispanic only to include all races/ethnicities&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients without a past family history of T2DM were made eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study period was shortened from 6 months to 12-14 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Number of required visits were reduced from 5 visits to 3 visits (all of which took&#xD;
           place during regularly scheduled clinic appointments)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Open labeled but still randomized&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Those in the Glutamine arm were provided lifestyles change intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) used instead of fasting Homeostatic Model&#xD;
           Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Non-fasting blood draw rather than a fasting blood draw was instituted&#xD;
