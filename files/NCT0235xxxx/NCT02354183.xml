    <textblock>
      Research suggests that individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) experience low&#xD;
      motivation for change (Skodal, Buckley, &amp; Charles, 1983). Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT;&#xD;
      Linehan, 1993) includes commitment strategies that are designed to improve motivation. No&#xD;
      studies have examined the effectiveness of these strategies. The proposed study will evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of a brief DBT intervention consisting of commitment strategies plus skills&#xD;
      training for people who self-harm. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a single&#xD;
      orientation session of (1) commitment strategies plus psychoeducation or (2) psychoeducation.&#xD;
      Immediately following their orientation session, all participants will be enrolled in a 90&#xD;
      minute group skills training session. Primary outcomes include autonomous motivation and&#xD;
      frequency of self harm behaviours. Assessments will be conducted at six time points:&#xD;
      baseline, after the initial orientation session, after the skills training group session, and&#xD;
      at one week, one month, and three month follow-up&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Client motivation is related to therapeutic change (Ryan, Lynch, Vansteenkiste, &amp; Deci) and&#xD;
      low motivation is a pervasive issue for clients with BPD (e.g., Skodal et al., 1983). DBT&#xD;
      (Linehan, 1993) is an effective treatment for BPD and was developed in part to address client&#xD;
      motivation. Within DBT there are commitment strategies that are used to help clients&#xD;
      establish clear goals and increase motivation to work on them. These strategies were designed&#xD;
      to help people commit to eliminating self-harm as well as other behaviours. People are more&#xD;
      motivated to work effectively towards goals for which they are autonomously motivated (Deci &amp;&#xD;
      Ryan, 2000). Despite their importance in DBT, commitment strategies have never been studied.&#xD;
      This study will examine whether commitment strategies are associated with an increase in&#xD;
      autonomous motivation and a decrease in self harm behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will address two primary questions: 1) Are commitment strategies associated&#xD;
      with an increase in autonomous motivation to decrease self-harm behaviour?; and 2) Does&#xD;
      autonomous motivation mediate a relationship between commitment strategies and change in&#xD;
      self-harm behaviour? The investigators will also address a secondary question related to&#xD;
      predictors of autonomous motivation. Our hypotheses are as follows: 1) The group receiving&#xD;
      psychoeducation enhanced with commitment strategies will have higher levels of autonomous&#xD;
      motivation compared to the psychoeducation control group; and 2) autonomous motivation will&#xD;
      mediate the relationship between commitment strategies and decreases in self harm behaviour.&#xD;
      Additionally, autonomy support, low therapist judgment, and goal concordance between client&#xD;
      and therapist will independently contribute to predicting client autonomous motivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research in this area is needed in light of the challenges presented by the low motivation&#xD;
      that often characterizes individuals with borderline traits who engage in self-harm&#xD;
      behaviour. No studies to date have examined DBT's commitment strategies, thus, the effect of&#xD;
      these treatment strategies is unknown and needs to be established. Additionally, identifying&#xD;
      specific variables that are associated with motivation to eliminate self-harm will help&#xD;
      inform the refinement treatment strategies. Finally, few studies have examined the role of&#xD;
      autonomous motivation and treatment outcome.&#xD;

The psychoeducation will consist of information about DBT's biosocial theory and about why people self-harm.
