  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stressors impair optimum function of an individual physiologically and psychologically.&#xD;
      Overcoming stress is possible when one knows which aspects of life are the most troublesome&#xD;
      to manage for individuals. There are certain tools available in Pakistan that can measures&#xD;
      stress in selected populations but there are no validated tools that may quantify stress&#xD;
      which results from events occurring in different aspects of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent Life Changes Questionnaire (RLCQ) is a tool that measures stress of individuals&#xD;
      through life changing events. It has five categories; work, home and family, health, personal&#xD;
      and social and financial. The objective of the study is to adapt RLCQ and validate it so that&#xD;
      it may measure stress among people living in Karachi, Pakistan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to make RLCQ a tool to measure stress within Pakistani context, we would want to&#xD;
      adapt RLCQ and then validate it. The study design is a validation study where the construct&#xD;
      of recent life changing events will be validated by comparing it with a gold standard to&#xD;
      assess the extent of accuracy of measurement by exploring the agreement between them. The&#xD;
      mode of data collection is cross-sectional by administering the adapted RLCQ and the gold&#xD;
      standard simultaneously. Since stress is a subjective phenomenon and serves as a root cause&#xD;
      for many neurodegenerative diseases and mental disorders, a tool for screening mental&#xD;
      illnesses is selected against which we could compare the adapted RLCQ for validation. The&#xD;
      Mini international neuropsychiatric Interviews (MINI) is a structured diagnostic interview&#xD;
      developed and validated by Sheehan in 1997, Florida. It is based on the DSM IV criteria and&#xD;
      ICD-10. The design of this study incorporates content and criterion validity as we have a&#xD;
      pre-existing 'gold standard' which is widely accepted and is in current practice of mental&#xD;
      health screening in Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in six phases. Phase I includes conducting qualitative interviews&#xD;
      to explore the phenomenon. In Phase II, adaptation of RLCQ will be done and review of the&#xD;
      adapted tool will be done with the help of subject experts. Phase III will verify the face&#xD;
      validity of the tool by translations and back translations. In Phase IV, pre-testing of the&#xD;
      tool will be done whereas in phase V, we will administer the tool in the community along with&#xD;
      conducting MINI interviews. Phase VI tests the reliability of the tool.&#xD;
