  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I dose escalation study will evaluate Procaspase Activating Compound-1 (PAC-1), a&#xD;
      small molecule that activates procaspase -3 to caspase-3, resulting in apoptosis of cancer&#xD;
      cells, in patients with advanced malignancies. As of March 1, 2019, only patients with&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumors will be enrolled in Component 1 of this study. PAC-1 is taken orally on&#xD;
      days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PAC-1 (5 dose levels) will&#xD;
      be determined using a modified-Fibonacci dose-escalation 3+3 design. Treatment continues&#xD;
      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, physician discretion, or patient refusal.&#xD;

             Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has an ECOG PS of 0, 1, or 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL, serum albumin &gt; 3.0 gm/dL, AST and ALT &lt; 1.5 ULN or &lt;&#xD;
