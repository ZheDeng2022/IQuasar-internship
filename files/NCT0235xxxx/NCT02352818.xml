      The aim of this CTO registry is to gather data including patient demographic date, cardiac&#xD;
      risk factors, procedural technical data and procedural success/outcome rates. Furthermore, we&#xD;
      aim to evaluate the safety and performance of various CTO specific guidewires, devices (such&#xD;
      as the CrossBoss/Stingray dissection ren-entry device) and other recognised and approved&#xD;
      techniques (retrograde wire escalation, retrograde dissection re-etry techniques). The&#xD;
      incidence of recognized complications (dissections, perforations, cardiac tamponade, vascular&#xD;
      complications, radiation injury, acute kidney injury) will also evaluated. We will assess&#xD;
      clinical outcome at 1 year after succesful CTO procedures.&#xD;

      This objectives of this single-center CTO registry are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gather prospective clinical data on all consecutive patients undergoing complex&#xD;
           difficult CTO PCI procedures including including patient demographic date, cardiac risk&#xD;
           factors, procedural technical data (contrast volume, radiation exposure, procedure time&#xD;
           and procedural success/outcome rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the safety and performance of various CTO dedicated guidewires, devices (such&#xD;
           as the CrossBoss/Stingray anterior dissection re-entry device) and other recognised and&#xD;
           approved techniques (retrograde wire escalation, retrograde dissection re-etry&#xD;
           techniques).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the incidence and severity of recognized complications such as coronary&#xD;
           dissections, coronary perforations (+/- need for emergency pericardiocentesis), acute&#xD;
           kidney injury, radiation injury, access site vascular complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the medium-term outcome (recurrence of symptoms, major cardiovascular events&#xD;
           (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization, target vessel&#xD;
           revascularization) during a routine out-patient consultation (planned as part of normal&#xD;
           standard care) at 1 year post successful CTO PCI. After this consultation, the patient&#xD;
           may choose to have cardiology follow-up at the UZ Leuven or with his/her referring&#xD;
           cardiologist.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All consecutive patients undergoing an elective attempt at percutaneous&#xD;
             revascularization of a chronic total occlusion are eligible for inclusion in the CTO&#xD;
             registry. A chronic total occlusion is defined as an occluded coronary artery with&#xD;
             TIMI 0 flow that has been occluded for 3 months or more. By definition all patients&#xD;
             will have been judged to be acceptable candidates for an attempt at revascularization&#xD;
             before consenting to be part of the CTO registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There are no specific exclusion criteria. If the patient does not wish to consent to&#xD;
             having his personal data kept in a registry the patient will not be included in the&#xD;
             CTO registry.&#xD;
