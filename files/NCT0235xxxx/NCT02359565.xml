    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pembrolizumab and to see how&#xD;
      well it works in treating younger patients with high-grade gliomas (brain tumors that are&#xD;
      generally expected to be fast growing and aggressive), diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas&#xD;
      (brain stem tumors), brain tumors with a high number of genetic mutations, ependymoma or&#xD;
      medulloblastoma that have come back (recurrent), progressed, or have not responded to&#xD;
      previous treatment (refractory). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may induce changes in the body's immune system, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the safety and describe adverse effects associated with administration of the&#xD;
      adult recommended dose of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in each stratum separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the sustained objective response rate, (complete response [CR] + partial&#xD;
      response [PR], sustained for at least 9 weeks) associated with pembrolizumab (MK-3475)&#xD;
      treatment for pediatric patients with recurrent, progressive or refractory diffuse intrinsic&#xD;
      pontine glioma (DIPG), non-brainstem high grade glioma (NB-HGG), ependymoma or&#xD;
      medulloblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To establish the safety and describe adverse effects associated with administration of&#xD;
      the adult recommended dose of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in pediatric patients with progressive&#xD;
      or recurrent hypermutated tumors, including those with constitutional mismatch-repair&#xD;
      deficiency (CMMRD) syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate the sustained response rate of pediatric patients with progressive or&#xD;
      recurrent hypermutated NB-HGG, including those with CMMRD syndrome, treated with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine changes in the immunophenotypic profile of PD-1hi CD8+ T cells from serial&#xD;
      peripheral blood samples obtained before and during treatment with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with hypermutated brain tumors, including those with CMMRD syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the relationship between outcome (response and progression-free survival) and&#xD;
      potential biomarkers, including PD-L1 expression, patient immunophenotype, ribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (RNA) signature profile, mutational profile, tumor gene expression and circulating tumor&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the duration of objective response in patients with measurable disease at&#xD;
      baseline and estimate progression-free/event-free/overall survival for patients in each&#xD;
      stratum treated with pembrolizumab (MK-3475).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate PD-L1 expression on archival tissue obtained from pediatric patients with&#xD;
      eligible primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To examine the ability of quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and&#xD;
      diffusion/weighted imaging/apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping to provide early&#xD;
      assessment of tumor behavior and specifically distinguish pseudoprogression/tumor&#xD;
      inflammation from tumor progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To explore the use of serial MR permeability (dynamic contrast-enhanced [DCE]) and MR&#xD;
      perfusion (dynamic susceptibility contrast [DSC]) to determine if elevated relative cerebral&#xD;
      blood volume (rCBV) and transfer coefficient (ktrans) can distinguish pseudoprogression/tumor&#xD;
      inflammation from tumor progression in tumors treated on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To characterize biomarkers, patient immunophenotyping, mutational load (as determined by&#xD;
      whole exome sequencing), the tumor gene expression profile and ctDNA in patients receiving&#xD;
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To estimate the duration of objective response, progression-free survival/event free&#xD;
      survival and document overall survival of pediatric patients with progressive or recurrent&#xD;
      hypermutated NB-HGG, including those with CMMRD syndrome, treated with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      (MK-3475).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) of all patients enrolled on stratum C&#xD;
      and sustained objective response rate of pediatric patients with hypermutated progressive low&#xD;
      grade gliomas including those with CMMRD, treated with pembrolizumab (MK-3475).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To categorize the T-cell receptor repertoire in PD-1+ cells obtained from peripheral&#xD;
      blood or from tumor tissue, when available, before and after treatment with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      (MK-3475) in pediatric patients treated in stratum C (hypermutated brain tumors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. To define the specificity of T-cell receptors against tumor antigens identified in&#xD;
      objective IX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XI. To characterize functional features of T-cell populations after pembrolizumab (MK-3475)&#xD;
      treatment and relate these findings to epigenetic programs within these cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 21 days for 34 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for&#xD;
      1 year, then every 6 months for up to 3 years.&#xD;
