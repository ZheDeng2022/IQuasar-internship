    <textblock>
      Since high risk prostate cancer requires higher radiation, this study is being done to&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation to the prostate and pelvic regions. Also to&#xD;
      determine the feasibility and safety of each treatment fraction by using cone-beam Computed&#xD;
      Tomography(CT) information and high speed Graphics Processing Unit based computation&#xD;
      treatment planning systems. We also plan to determine the safety of treatment to the&#xD;
      prostate. Health-related quality of life will be measured as part of current clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or to safely escalate dose to the pelvic&#xD;
           nodal using 90 day acute toxicity endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine feasibility and safety of adaptive real time re-planning of the pelvic nodal&#xD;
           region at each treatment fraction by using cone-beam CT (CBCT) information and high&#xD;
           speed GPU based computation treatment planning systems&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of 9.5 Gy per fraction in five fractions (47.5 Gy&#xD;
           total dose) to the prostate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the feasibility and safety of temporal enhanced ultrasound for prostate lesion&#xD;
           tracking during radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To follow tumor related outcomes (i.e. PSA control, progression-free survival (PFS),&#xD;
           distant metastasis (DM) free survival, and overall survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) will be measured as part of current clinical&#xD;
           practice Patients in each dose cohort will all be treated as a single group for dose&#xD;
           escalation. There will be two levels of dose escalation-to prostate lesions and to&#xD;
           pelvic lymph node region. Prostate/SV PTV will be treated at a fixed dose of 9.5 Gy per&#xD;
           fraction for 5 fractions (47.5 Gy) based on our previous phase I/II study experiences.&#xD;
           The starting dose for the dose escalation to the pelvic region PTV will be 4.5 Gy per&#xD;
           fraction for 5 fractions (total dose= 22.5 Gy). Subsequent cohorts of patients will&#xD;
           receive an additional 0.5 Gy per treatment (total 2.5 Gy per escalation). The starting&#xD;
           dose for MRI-visible prostatic lesions will be 10 Gy and subsequent cohorts will receive&#xD;
           an additional 0.5Gy per treatment (total of 2.5Gy per escalation).&#xD;

      Patients will be accrued in alternating dose levels. The two distinct areas of dose&#xD;
      escalations (pelvic lymph node and prostate lesion) will take place one at a time. Minimum&#xD;
      waiting periods will be assigned between each dose cohort to observe toxicity. The phase I&#xD;
      portion of the study will be completed when dose limiting toxicity is reached or when a&#xD;
      sufficiently high dose level (i.e.,5.5 Gy per fraction to a total 27.5 Gy for pelvic lymph&#xD;
      node region and 11Gy per fraction to a total of 55Gy to the prostate lesion), is attained to&#xD;
      consider the therapy likely to be efficacious. All patients will be treated with a total of&#xD;
      24 months of androgen suppression therapy (ADT). Radiation therapy will start 8-12 weeks&#xD;
      after initiation of ADT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No. Patients for each cohort: 7-15 Cohort 1: 9.5 Gy per fraction to prostate/SV, 10 Gy per&#xD;

      per fraction to prostate/SV, 10 Gy per fraction to prostate lesion, 5Gy per fraction to&#xD;
