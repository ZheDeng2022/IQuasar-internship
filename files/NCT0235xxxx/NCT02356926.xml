    <textblock>
      The CHARMED study is a prospective, multicenter, cluster-randomized cross-over study in six&#xD;
      EDs in France. Centers will be randomly assigned to use routine management or systematic&#xD;
      cross checking in the first period, and will use the alternative strategy in the second&#xD;
      period (Fig 1). Patients will be recruited in six centers in France&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both periods, from 9am to 5pm, a CRT will be present in the ED to collect variables on&#xD;
      providers and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control period, usual care and routine management will be provided. In the&#xD;
      intervention group, systematic cross-checking will be implemented three times a day from&#xD;
      8:30am to 6:00pm between emergency physicians. The CRT will seek emergency physicians (EP) by&#xD;
      pairs for crosschecking. Senior physicians will use peer crosschecking (i.e. crosschecker&#xD;
      will also be an emergency senior physician). The CRT will assist the pairing. Each EP will&#xD;
      prepare to present all his or her current patients. Patient presentation will be will be&#xD;
      protocolised (see below), although usual presentation will be sought as this is the&#xD;
      presentation method already in place for handover. The crosschecking will occur in the&#xD;
      presence of the CRT and in the ED, in any medical office staff room, or cubicle available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each EP will then have to present the patients he is actually taking care of, with brief&#xD;
      description of the case. After a case has been presented by the EP, the comments and advice&#xD;
      of the crosschecker will be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance to national and international recommendations 1,2,15, the following definitions&#xD;
      will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Error: Failure of a planned action to be completed as intended, or the use of a wrong&#xD;
      plan to achieve an aim. The severity of an error will be classified using the National&#xD;
      Coordinating Council on Medical Error and Reporting (NCCMERP) from A to I 16, as shown in&#xD;
      table 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse event (AE): An injury that might have resulted from medical care (or lack thereof).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Near Miss: A medical error that has the potential to cause an adverse event, but did not&#xD;
      either by chance or after an intervention. A near miss is an error of severity B, C or D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preventable AE: An AE associated with an error. A preventable AE is a medical error of&#xD;
      severity E, F, G, H or I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe Medical Error (SME): preventable AE or a near miss. The primary objective is to assess&#xD;
      whether the implementation of Systematic Cross Serious unexplained guideline violation (local&#xD;
      or national), even in the absence of any documented injury, will be considered an AE.&#xD;
      Checking in the ED will reduce the rate of severe medical errors. The primary endpoint is the&#xD;
      rate of SME in the seven days following ED visits. As previously described, the subsequent&#xD;
      adverse events might not clearly appear in the ED settings, hence is considered as a SME 8.&#xD;
      Hospital or ED re-attendance within the next 7 days will be also considered as an adverse&#xD;
      event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include the followings:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate of AE and preventable AE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate of Near Miss&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severity of SME&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Factors associated to SME:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Related to patient (age, chief complaint, comorbidities, triage level)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Related to physician (grade, experience, number of physician involved, handoff)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Related to the ED visit (Time of visit, daily occupancy, crowding, waiting time,&#xD;
                length of stay, total number of emergency physicians)&#xD;
