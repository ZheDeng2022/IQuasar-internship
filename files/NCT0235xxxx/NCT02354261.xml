      Carcinoma Nevus Syndrome.&#xD;

      Single arm, phase IIb, multi-center, open-label study evaluating the use of oral SUBA-Cap in&#xD;
      subjects with Basal Cell Carcinoma Nevus Syndrome and non-metastatic Basal Cell Carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent, subjects will undergo a skin biopsy for Gli1 analysis and an&#xD;
      assessment of extent of disease using both tumor measurements (using modified Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria) and color photographs of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive daily oral SUBA-Cap, at a starting dose of 150 mg twice daily (BID).&#xD;
      Reassessments of disease will be conducted at weeks 4, 8, 16, and then every 8 weeks&#xD;
      thereafter. Subjects with evidence of response (partial or complete) will be re-evaluated at&#xD;
      least 4 weeks later for confirmation. Subjects may continue to receive SUBA-Cap until disease&#xD;
      progression (defined as the appearance of one or more new lesions or ulceration of a target&#xD;
      lesion) that requires a change in therapy (surgical intervention or use of other systemic&#xD;
      therapy) or the appearance of unacceptable side effects. Pharmacokinetic assessments (serial&#xD;
      trough levels) will be performed at defined intervals and, when possible, prior to and&#xD;
      following any dose adjustment. Skin biopsies will be taken for Gli1 expression at defined&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
