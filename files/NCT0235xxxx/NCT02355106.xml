             one-year period prior to enrollment. This may include typical AFl occurring while&#xD;
             receiving anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy for non-AFl tachyarrhythmia, including&#xD;
             atrial fibrillation (AF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one episode of typical (clockwise or counterclockwise) atrial flutter&#xD;
             documented by 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) within 6 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has been diagnosed with symptomatic AFl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is at least 18 and ≤75 years of age.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intra-cardiac thrombus has not been eliminated in subjects exposed to less than 4&#xD;
             weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation and a TEE (trans-esophageal echocardiogram)&#xD;
             and/or CT did not conclusively rule out thrombus&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject developed persistent AF at least once in history (electrical or&#xD;
             pharmacological cardioversion after 48h or episode duration &gt;7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject had any previous left atrial ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject had any previous cardiac surgery, e.g. prosthetic valves, except in the case&#xD;
             of an isolated coronary bypass surgery performed more than three months prior to the&#xD;
             procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has permanent pacemaker or defibrillator implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has 2° type II, 3° degree atrioventricular (AV) block or left/right bundle&#xD;
             branch block pattern&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has unstable angina pectoris.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has history of previous myocardial infarction (MI) or percutaneous&#xD;
             intervention during the last three months or planned in the next 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject has symptomatic carotid stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with detected pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
             or any other evidence of significant lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has any contraindication for oral anticoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has any history of previous transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has known intra-cardiac thrombus formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has any significant congenital heart defect corrected or not (except for&#xD;
             patent foramen ovale that is allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has evidence of congestive heart failure (NYHA class II, III or IV) in sinus&#xD;
             rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject has any untreated or uncontrolled hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has renal dysfunction with glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 ml/min/1.72m2.&#xD;
