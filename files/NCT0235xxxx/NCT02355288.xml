  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether less invasive bypass surgery using the left&#xD;
      chest wall artery is more or less effective than inserting a heart stent in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes and a blockage of the main artery at the front of the heart. This will be a clinical&#xD;
      trial study where the investigators will test the rate of recruitment into the study, as well&#xD;
      as the feasibility of allocating each of the 2 treatments.&#xD;

      Purpose/Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate whether minimally invasive bypass surgery with&#xD;
      the left internal thoracic artery (MICS CABG) is more or less effective than percutaneous&#xD;
      revascularization with drug eluting stents (PCI/DES) in patients with diabetes and stenosis&#xD;
      of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 100 adults with diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or Type 2) and&#xD;
      angiographically-confirmed proximal or mid LAD disease, morphologically amenable to either&#xD;
      MICS CABG or PCI/DES; outside the context of an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and&#xD;
      with indication for revascularization based upon symptoms of worsening angina and/or&#xD;
      objective evidence of myocardial ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is a multicentre, two-arm, open label, prospective, randomized, pilot trial over a&#xD;
      duration of 2.75 years, with 0.75 year of initiation, 1 year of patient recruitment and 2&#xD;
      years of follow-up. Patients who consent will be randomized on a 1:1 basis either to MICS&#xD;
      CABG or PCI/DES of the LAD, and followed at 30 days, 6 months, 1 year, 18 months, and 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either MICS CABG or PCI/DES to the LAD.&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the PCI/DES arm will receive, at the discretion of the primary&#xD;
      physician or interventionalist, the stent of choice at the treating institution, with a&#xD;
      recommendation of a everolimus- or zotarolimus-eluting stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is successfully enrolled, eligible and consenting patients within the&#xD;
      first year of enrollment, with success defined as 100 patients or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All-cause mortality, Myocardial Infarction (MI), stroke and target vessel revascularization&#xD;
      (TVR) will be compared for the therapy comparison PCI/DES versus MICS CABG. For these&#xD;
      analyses, the survival analysis outlined for the primary analysis will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life (QOL) at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 18 months, and 2 year will be compared&#xD;
      for the therapy comparison PCI/DES vs. MICS CABG. Patients will be asked to complete the&#xD;
      following questionnaires: the EuroQOL (EQ-5D) and Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main feasibility questions are: &quot;can the investigators enroll a sizable number of&#xD;
      patients at a given centre over a 1 year period?&quot;, &quot;can the investigators implement and&#xD;
      conduct the proposed trial across multiple centres?&quot;, and &quot;can the investigators ensure high&#xD;
      protocol adherence and follow-up, as well as minimize crossovers?&quot;. By enrolling 100&#xD;
      participants across 5 sites over 1 year, and follow them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each therapy group, the frequency distribution each of the domains of the EQ5D will be&#xD;
      tabulated and the mean, standard deviation, median and interquartile range (IQR) calculated.&#xD;
      Therapy groups will be compared on these outcomes using the t-test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum&#xD;
      test and 95%CI calculated. Repeated measures ANOVA will compare the two therapy groups on&#xD;
      changes in health related QOL over time&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating Centres:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have chosen 5 study sites in Canada (3) and in the United States (2). The&#xD;
      recruitment goal for each site is to enroll at least 20 patients.&#xD;
