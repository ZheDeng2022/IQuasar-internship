      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Isolated (or Congenital) GnRH Deficiency (IGD) is a rare disease. People who have this go&#xD;
      through puberty late. Some never reach puberty or don t complete it without treatment. They&#xD;
      also may have an impaired sense of smell or other health problems. Research shows that&#xD;
      disorders like this can have a negative effect on a person s psychological profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To understand the psychological outcomes in people with IGD. These can include depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, poor health, and poor social function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults age 18 and over with IGD. They must be currently on a full dose of hormone&#xD;
           replacement therapy for at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will get a username and password. This will give them access to questions&#xD;
           online. They can do this from any computer connected to the Internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will log in and complete the questionnaires. There are 5 total, but they&#xD;
           will appear as 1 continuous set of questions. Answering them takes about 1 hour or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first set is about the participant s disorder. The rest ask about depression,&#xD;
           anxiety, global health, and social function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All answers will be used for research and to better understand reproductive disorders.&#xD;
           Only researchers from the NIH Unit on Genetics of Puberty and Reproduction and from this&#xD;
           study will know which answers belong to which participant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Isolated GnRH Deficiency (IGD) is a rare disorder characterized by decreased secretion of&#xD;
      GnRH, resulting in impaired gonadotropin secretion and subsequent impaired sex-steroid&#xD;
      production. Patients with this rare clinical syndrome present with absent, delayed, or&#xD;
      stalled pubertal development by eighteen years of age. In addition, non-reproductive&#xD;
      phenotypes of this spectrum have been identified in some individuals, including anosmia,&#xD;
      auditory and ocular defects, and skeletal, neurological, and renal anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the complex heterogeneity among affected individuals and the rarity of the disease&#xD;
      itself, the phenotypic spectrum has not been fully investigated. The relationship between&#xD;
      psychological disorders and IGD remains largely unexplored as a phenotypic association,&#xD;
      despite evidence that disorders of puberty and reproduction can have a negative impact on the&#xD;
      psychological profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to conduct a preliminary investigation into the association between&#xD;
      psychological symptoms and IGD. We plan to recruit adult patients with a diagnosis of IGD to&#xD;
      complete online assessments that measure psychological health outcomes from the patient&#xD;
      perspective in order to gauge the prevalence of negative emotional states among affected&#xD;
      individuals, compared to healthy controls. This will determine whether further studies are&#xD;
      necessary to investigate psychiatric disease as part of the phenotypic spectrum of the&#xD;
      disorder, and will improve our understanding of this complex disorder as a whole. Greater&#xD;
      knowledge of the psychological impact of IGD may impact the current standards of evaluation&#xD;
      and treatment of patients with delayed pubertal maturation.&#xD;

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR IGD PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Males or females with clinical findings consistent with IGD who are greater than or equal&#xD;
        to 18 years old and treated with hormone replacement therapy for IGD at the full adult&#xD;
        replacement dose for at least 3 months. Clinical findings of IGD will be confirmed by a&#xD;
        nurse or physician associated with this protocol, and include: clinical presentation&#xD;
        consistent with a diagnosis of IGD, such as delayed, incomplete, or absent pubertal&#xD;
        development, and a record of serum hormone levels demonstrating low total testosterone&#xD;
        (males) or estradiol (females) in association with low or inappropriately normal&#xD;
        gonadotropin levels in a clinic note or history and physical, and individuals with records&#xD;
        demonstrating failure to undergo normal puberty. Anosmia may or may not be present. Since&#xD;
        IGD presents as a phenotypic spectrum, there are no specific exclusion criteria for this&#xD;
        study, except as noted below.&#xD;
