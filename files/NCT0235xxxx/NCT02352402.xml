  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the POPular CABG study we investigate if the addition of ticagrelor, a drug that inhibits&#xD;
      blood platelets from clotting, to treatment with aspirin will reduce the rate of saphenous&#xD;
      vein graft occlusion as assessed with coronary computed tomography angiography at 1 year&#xD;
      after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is used to prevent the occlusion of grafts placed&#xD;
      during coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG) and to reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      atherothrombotic events during follow-up. Graft occlusion occurs predominantly in saphenous&#xD;
      vein grafts (SVGs) and can result in symptoms of chest pain, myocardial infarction (MI) and&#xD;
      even death. The anti-thrombotic effect of ASA is a result of the inhibition of the generation&#xD;
      of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) in blood platelets. Despite ASA therapy, 6.8% to 26% of SVGs occlude&#xD;
      in the first year after CABG, mainly due to thrombus formation. This might be due to the fact&#xD;
      that ASA is not equally effective in all patients, indicated by a substantial amount of&#xD;
      patients that still generate TXA2 and show activated platelets, despite adequate ASA use. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that more potent platelet inhibition by the addition of ticagrelor to standard&#xD;
      ASA therapy could decrease the rate of SVG occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: To investigate whether a combination of ticagrelor 90mg twice daily and ASA&#xD;
      80mg once daily is superior to ASA 80mg once daily alone in the prevention of SVG occlusion&#xD;
      in patients who underwent CABG with use of one or more SVGs, as assessed with coronary&#xD;
      computed tomography angiography (CCTA) at 1 year after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Number of&#xD;
      patients: Approximately 500 patients will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients undergoing CABG with one or more SVGs, CABG being an isolated&#xD;
      procedure or part of combined surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent procedure, screening and sample size: We will screen patients and obtain&#xD;
      informed consent before CABG. After CABG patients who gave informed consent are screened&#xD;
      again to check if the patient fulfills the inclusion criteria and does not have any exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. A total of 500 patients will receive randomized study medication after CABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients will be randomly assigned to treatment with 90mg of ticagrelor or a&#xD;
      matching placebo twice daily in addition to standard treatment with ASA for the duration of 1&#xD;
      year. Patients will be prescribed 80mg of ASA once daily according to routine clinical&#xD;
      practice. Graft patency will be assessed with CCTA 1 year after randomization. If the patient&#xD;
      consents to participate in the substudies, platelet function tests will be performed before&#xD;
      surgery and 3 days and 1 year after randomization. Thirty day and one-year follow-up of&#xD;
      clinical events will be obtained for all patients by screening the (electronic) patient file,&#xD;
      telephonic interviews, study site visits and possibly with questionnaires.&#xD;
