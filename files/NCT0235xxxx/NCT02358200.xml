  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open label, non-randomized, dose escalation and expansion Phase Ia/b trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety of the combination of BMN 673 and carboplatin, and subsequently BMN 673 in combination&#xD;
      with paclitaxel and carboplatin to determine the recommended Phase II dose of the&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP) 1/2 inhibitors are a novel class of&#xD;
      anticancer agents that have shown activity in tumors with defects in DNA repair and may&#xD;
      induce synthetic lethality in combination with agents that induce DNA damage by preventing&#xD;
      DNA repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of this study is to determine whether a DNA damaging agent can potentiate the&#xD;
      cell death induced by PARP inhibitors in individuals with tumor that are more susceptible to&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the potential benefits of BMN 673 in combination with weekly&#xD;
      carboplatin in patients with metastatic tumors associated with BRCA germ line mutations or&#xD;
      patients with triple negative breast cancer with no known BRCA mutation, subsequently if&#xD;
      tolerated, an additional cohort will examine the feasibility of adding paclitaxel to this&#xD;
      combination for any solid tumor malignancies with potential benefit to this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BMN 673 in combination with&#xD;
      carboplatin in patients with either BRCA mutations or TNBC. If tolerable paclitaxel will be&#xD;
      added to the combination in any solid tumor malignancies with potential benefit to this&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
