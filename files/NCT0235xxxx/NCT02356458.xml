  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) remains an incurable disease with frequent relapses and no&#xD;
      standard therapeutic options in case of relapse. Prolongation of remissions or induction of&#xD;
      longer remissions is therefore crucial. Recently, a synergistic increase in the proteasomal&#xD;
      inhibition of ibrutinib in both bortezomib-sensitive and refractory MCL cells was shown.&#xD;
      These findings, along with the reported single agent activities of both drugs and the&#xD;
      non-overlapping toxicities, are the rationale to combine ibrutinib and bortezomib in MCL in&#xD;
      this trial&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Disease background, therapy background and aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a distinct subtype of B-cell lymphoma. It represents ~5% of all&#xD;
      lymphomas and typically is present in advanced stages, a median age of 60-65 years and a&#xD;
      dismal prognosis with a median survival of ~3 years. Currently, it remains incurable, as the&#xD;
      patients will relapse after first line treatment and require subsequent therapy. The&#xD;
      disease-free survival is progressively shorter with each subsequent relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no standard therapy for relapsed MCL patients. MCL is predominantly a&#xD;
      disease of the elderly who are not suitable for aggressive chemotherapy. Allogeneic&#xD;
      transplants are preferred in young and fit patients, whereas (preferably single agent)&#xD;
      chemotherapy is used to treat older patients, but usually with short duration of responses.&#xD;
      Recently, the therapeutic armamentarium has been expanded with the availability of novel&#xD;
      agents targeting crucial and deregulated pathways in MCL. These include the Bruton's Kinase&#xD;
      (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib with excellent single agent activities. New therapeutic options in&#xD;
      the targeted patient population are clearly needed to prolong remissions especially for&#xD;
      elderly patients where aggressive chemotherapy and allogeneic transplants are no suitable&#xD;
      treatment options. Recently, a synergistic increase in the proteasomal inhibition of&#xD;
      ibrutinib in both bortezomib-sensitive and refractory MCL cells was shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is targeting patients with diagnosis of refractory or relapsed MCL disease after&#xD;
      pretreatment with â‰¤2 lines of non-bortezomib-containing chemotherapy. The proposed treatment&#xD;
      of ibrutinib in combination with bortezomib might lead to an improvement of the therapy in&#xD;
      the targeted relapsed/refractory patient population. Given the absence of a dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity also when applied long-term, ibrutinib is well suited in this patient population as&#xD;
      a maintenance therapy. Therefore, the combination treatment of the trial is followed by a&#xD;
      maintenance therapy part for patients that had no disease progression. New treatment options&#xD;
      should control the disease as best and long as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment consists of 6 cycles of 21 days each of ibrutinib in combination with bortezomib,&#xD;
      followed by a maintenance therapy with ibrutinib monotherapy. In the maintenance therapy&#xD;
      courses repeat every 28-days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Phase I The primary object of the trial is to establish the recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose (RP2D) of ibrutinib in combination with bortezomib in patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine the safety and tolerability of ibrutinib in combination with bortezomib and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the preliminary antitumor activity of ibrutinib in combination with bortezomib&#xD;
           Phase II The main object of the trial is to define the efficacy of the combination&#xD;
           treatment of ibrutinib with bortezomib in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine the safety and tolerability of the RP2D and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the efficacy of ibrutinib in combination with bortezomib in patients with&#xD;
           relapsed MCL followed by an ibrutinib maintenance therapy.&#xD;
