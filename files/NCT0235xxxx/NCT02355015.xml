      The study aims to address the following aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To provide an overview of the epidemiology of the patients who are managed in the&#xD;
           Singapore General Hospital for NTM infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the medical care of patients in the institution with regards to the type of&#xD;
           medical and/or surgical treatment received and specifically, the antibiotic regime and&#xD;
           duration administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A longitudinal follow up which will allow an assessment of our care and patient outcome&#xD;
           in this population cohort&#xD;

      Nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) is difficult to treat and has no standardised antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy. There have been increasing recognition of the need for measurements of NTM care&#xD;
      around the world, as rates of NTM infections have begun to supercede Tuberculosis infections&#xD;
      for the first time. As health care-associated NTM outbreaks also pose an infection control&#xD;
      risk for patients undergoing surgery, this study provides a platform for further greater&#xD;
      uniformity and opportunities for improvement in care. (1,2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Singapore General Hospital (SGH) is a tertiary hospital and sees patients of various complex&#xD;
      medical illnesses. Patients with Nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) infections are also on&#xD;
      follow up with the infectious diseases specialists SGH. The care of NTM patients can last&#xD;
      many years, with patients requiring multiple admissions for reinfections/relapses and are&#xD;
      often on long term suppressive therapy and follow up at the Specialist Outpatient Clinic.&#xD;
      (3,4)The lack of standardised care for NTM patients, lengthy treatment time for NTM&#xD;
      infections, as well as increases in macrolide-resistant NTM infections, warrants a need for&#xD;
      research into the epidemiology and best practice to treat this group of patients. (5,6) We&#xD;
      seek to better define the epidemiology of this group of patients and hope to objectively&#xD;
      measure the effectiveness and quality of our NTM care delivery in SGH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is a lack of a systematic database to track our quality of care and support&#xD;
      services. As there are many Infectious Diseases Specialists in the department, each may have&#xD;
      slight variation in clinical practice and preference in the face of a lack of proper&#xD;
      treatment guideline. We believe NTM management can be improved with a consistent care&#xD;
      delivery pathway and more standardization of therapy and follow up plan. This will lead to&#xD;
      better desired patient outcome. This prospective observational data collection will allow us&#xD;
      to evaluate our current standard of care for these patients, which can lead to identification&#xD;
      for areas of improvement so that we can refine our strategies and implement more effective&#xD;
      and standardized guidelines in the future.&#xD;
