  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resectable esophageal or junctional cancer requires medical treatment by radiotherapy and&#xD;
      chemotherapy followed by surgery. Currently, one of the most commonly used chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment is the FOLFOX. It is a combination of three drugs administered intravenously:&#xD;
      fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and folinic acid. This is the standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another protocol of chemotherapy is widely used by certain European and American teams, due&#xD;
      to promising results : a combination of two drugs administered intravenously: Paclitaxel and&#xD;
      Carboplatin (CarboP-pacliT). At present, no clinical study has shown the superiority of one&#xD;
      treatment over the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this Phase II study is to clarify clinical practice by comparing these two&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no standard preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemoradiation (NCRT) regimen for resectable&#xD;
      esophageal cancer, because most if all trials failed to show any survival advantage favoring&#xD;
      pCRT when compared to surgery only. This failure had been related to the lack of power of&#xD;
      some trials, as well as the ability of chemoradiation to potentiate post-operative morbidity&#xD;
      (including mortality), and therefore hampering the accrual of its own survival benefit.&#xD;
      Hopefully, meta-analyses showed that NCRT increases survival when compared to surgery only.&#xD;
      However, in the clinical practice, this does not make easier the choice of the best NCRT&#xD;
      treatment. It appeared that the radiation regimen that were used in each randomized trials&#xD;
      were heterogeneous with respect with dose, fraction, length of treatment, fields, dosimetry&#xD;
      planning, and quality control. This applies also to chemotherapy with respect with the kind&#xD;
      of cytotoxics that were used (including number of drugs), as well as dosage, and the number&#xD;
      of cycles, although most of the time cytotoxics were fluorouracil and cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dutch colleagues recently showed that NCRT with weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel increase&#xD;
      survival, without increasing postoperative mortality. Of note, most tumors in this trial&#xD;
      arose from the lower third of the esophagus and esogastric junction and these habitually&#xD;
      correlate with less postoperative morbidity compared to upper third tumors. Moreover, the&#xD;
      lung volume spared from radiation was greater in junctional tumors than in upper third&#xD;
      cancers - a critical point in the development of radiation-induced pneumonitis and subsequent&#xD;
      postoperative mortality. It is difficult to understand how this taxane-based chemotherapy is&#xD;
      active, as it did not make better that fluorouracil-based regimen in non-operable patients,&#xD;
      and as NCRT with taxanes makes radiation-induced pneumonitis more likely. The favorable&#xD;
      impact of this NCRT may lie on its radiation regimen. A moderate total dose of radiation,&#xD;
      smaller radial margins than in other trials and modern dosimetry with 3D-planning all improve&#xD;
      the safety of treatment and of subsequent surgery. Finally, the favorable impact of the Dutch&#xD;
      NCRT regimen may lies on the fact that it does not include cisplatin, a compound which has&#xD;
      been found related to the occurrence of more sudden deaths than a non cisplatin-based regimen&#xD;
      such as the FOLFOX combination (fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, folinic acid) in the setting of&#xD;
      definitive chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to evaluate the short-term benefit (complete resection rate) and safety (severe&#xD;
      postoperative rate) of 2 preoperative regimen, (carboplatin-paclitaxel or&#xD;
      fluorouracil-oxaliplatin-folinic acid), combined to the Dutch radiation backbone, in operable&#xD;
      esophageal and junctional (Siewert I-II) cancer. The present trial offers the unique&#xD;
      opportunity to compare two therapeutic strategies that have already been shown to be&#xD;
      efficient in large randomized controlled trials offering level-1 evidence.&#xD;
