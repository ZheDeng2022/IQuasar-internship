  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - In allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), stem cells are taken from a donor and given&#xD;
      to a recipient. Sometimes the recipient s immune system destroys the donor s cells. Or donor&#xD;
      immune cells attack the recipient s tissues, called graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This is&#xD;
      less likely when the recipient and donor have similar human leukocyte antigens (HLA).&#xD;
      Researchers want to see if the drug palifermin improves the results of allogeneic SCT from&#xD;
      HLA-matched unrelated donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if high doses of palifermin before chemotherapy are safe, prevent chronic GVHD, and&#xD;
      improve immune function after transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults 18 years of age or older with blood or bone marrow cancer with no HLA-matched&#xD;
      sibling, but with a possible HLA-matched donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine&#xD;
           tests. They will have scans and heart and lung exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before transplant, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have many tests and exams. These include blood tests throughout the study and bone&#xD;
           marrow biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Get a central line catheter if they do not have one.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have 1-3 rounds of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take more tests to make sure they can have the transplant, including medical history,&#xD;
           physical exam, and CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Get palifermin by IV and more chemotherapy. They will get other drugs, some they will&#xD;
           take for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will get the SCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After transplant, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be hospitalized at least 3-4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have tests for GVHD at 60 days and 6 months. These include mouth and skin photos and&#xD;
           biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stay near D.C. for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit NIH 5 times the first 2 years, then yearly. They may have scans and biopsies.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Graft versus host disease (GVHD) and impaired immune reconstitution are major transplant&#xD;
           complications and barriers to improving outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic stem&#xD;
           cell transplantation (alloHSCT) for hematologic malignancies. GVHD is initiated when&#xD;
           donor T-cells become alloreactive against recipient major or minor histocompatibility&#xD;
           antigens. This process may be exacerbated during the transplantation process by exposure&#xD;
           of tissue antigens to donor T-lymphocytes after chemotherapy-induced injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Palifermin, a recombinant keratinocyte growth factor-1 (KGF-1), imitates the actions of&#xD;
           intrinsic KGF and binds to the FGF receptor 2b, which is expressed in the epidermis,&#xD;
           oral mucosa, GI mucosa and urothelium, thereby increasing the regenerative capacity of&#xD;
           these tissues. Palifermin has been shown to reduce the duration and severity of oral&#xD;
           mucositis after intensive chemo-radiotherapy and autologous HSCT for hematologic cancers&#xD;
           and is FDA approved. In pre-clinical studies, palifermin has been shown to have an&#xD;
           effect on control of acute or chronic GVHD and immune reconstitution after alloHSCT.&#xD;
           However, subsequent clinical studies in alloHSCT indicate that the dose and schedule of&#xD;
           palifermin as currently&#xD;
&#xD;
      used in humans does not optimize its activity in terms of prevention of GVHD or thymus&#xD;
      recovery following alloHSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - We hypothesize that higher doses of palifermin in the immediate pre alloHSCT conditioning&#xD;
      setting will lead to enhanced thymopoiesis, decreased chronic GVHD, and improved immune&#xD;
      reconstitution. A dose escalation study is necessary to determine safe dosing levels in&#xD;
      persons undergoing alloHSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary objective of the phase I portion is to assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
           the administration of the recombinant keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) palifermin in&#xD;
           alloHSCT using unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary objective of the phase II portion is to determine the incidence of severe&#xD;
           chronic GVHD after the addition of palifermin to TMS (tacrolimus, methotrexate and&#xD;
           sirolimus) based GVHD prophylaxis delivered in the identical fashion to the NCI&#xD;
           07-C-0195 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults (greater than or equal to 18 years) with advanced or high risk hematologic&#xD;
           malignancies (including AML, ALL, MDS, CLL, NHL, HL, CML, multiple myeloma, and MPN)who&#xD;
           lack a suitable HLA-matched sibling donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An unrelated donor matched at a minimum of 8 alleles (HLA-A,-B,-C, and DRB1) by&#xD;
           high-resolution typing, identified through the National Marrow Donor Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Karnofsky greater than or equal to 60 and acceptable organ functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive disease-specific induction chemotherapy (EPOCH-F/R or FLAG) prior&#xD;
           to transplant as needed for disease control and immune depletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive an identical conditioning regimen consisting of&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide 1200 mg/m^2/day IV for 4 days and fludarabine 30 mg/m^2/day for 4 days&#xD;
           (transplant days -6 to -3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive a peripheral blood stem cell product from an unrelated donor&#xD;
           matched at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 (8/8) by high-resolution typing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Palifermin will be administered in a phase 1, open label design with the following&#xD;
           proposed schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dose level 1: 180 mcg/kg on day -7&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dose level 2: 360 mcg/kg on day -7&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dose level 3: 540 mcg/kg on day -7&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dose level 4: 720 mcg/kg on day -7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The phase I portion will be conducted in a standard 3+3 design; the maximum possible&#xD;
           number of patients accrued to this portion will be 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) from the phase I portion of the study will be used to&#xD;
           conduct a phase II study. Total accrual on the phase II study will be 27 patients,&#xD;
           including 3-6 patients treated at the MTD in the phase I portion of the study&#xD;

             bilirubin up to 10 mg/dl and/or ALT or AST up to 10 times the upper limit of normal&#xD;
             may be considered for participation if such elevations are thought to be due to liver&#xD;
             involvement by malignancy. However, in these latter patients, if the BR level does not&#xD;
             decrease to less than or equal to 2.5 mg/dl, or AST/ALT do not decrease to less than&#xD;
             or equal to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal after induction chemotherapy,&#xD;
             eligibility for the transplant (research) phase will be atthe discretion of the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are hepatitis B core antibody positive and or have positive hepatitis B&#xD;
             surface antigen will require hepatology consultation. The risk/benefit profile of&#xD;
             transplant and hepatitis B will be discussed with the patient and eligibility&#xD;
             determined by the PI or the LAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient may have a hepatitis C infection. However, each patient will require a&#xD;
             hepatology consultation. The risk/benefit profile of transplant and hepatitis C will&#xD;
             be discussed with the patient and eligibility determined by the PI or the LAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Palifermin has had embryotoxic and fetotoxic effects in animal studies. For this&#xD;
             reason and because the other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be&#xD;
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of active study therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Research Phase Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Verification of donor eligibility (clearance must be received from the NMDP)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donors are evaluated by NMDP affiliated donor centers per NMDP Standards .&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Donors who are medically suitable, but ineligible by FDA guidelines may still&#xD;
                  donate PBSC with documentation of urgent medical need by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who receive stem cell products from ineligible donors will be informed&#xD;
                  of any increase in risk of transfusion-related diseases prior to initiation of&#xD;
                  conditioning chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donors who are ineligible or unwilling to donate bone marrow will not be eligible to&#xD;
             donate to study recipients. However, in the event that the patient has already begun&#xD;
             conditioning chemotherapy and a donor PBSC collection is terminated early for&#xD;
             donor-related medical concerns, a bone marrow graft may be infused. Should this occur,&#xD;
             the recipient will continue to be managed on this protocol for all transplant-related&#xD;
             care and complications. Patient will stay on study but clinical outcomes will not be&#xD;
             eligible for the statistics and end point calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inadequate stem cell collection from the selected donor is defined as less than or&#xD;
             equal to 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg. In most cases, donor cell collections are infused&#xD;
             fresh. If a fresh collection is found to have an inadequate cell count, the cells will&#xD;
             still be infused, but the recipient will be removed from the study, and managed&#xD;
             clinically for all transplantrelated care and complications on this protocol. If the&#xD;
             patient fails to engraft, the donor may be requested for a second collection or an&#xD;
             emergency bone marrow harvest at the discretion of the PI and NMDP Medical Director.&#xD;
             In the event of an inadequate collection obtained prior to patient conditioning, the&#xD;
             donor may be asked to donate a second time, or another eligible donor may be&#xD;
             requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal and hepatic function continues to meet eligibility criteria, reassessed as&#xD;
             follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  24 hour creatinine clearance or calculated (using the Cockcroft-Gault formula)&#xD;
                  creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (induction phase only)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  (((140-age)*mass(kg))/(72*serum creatinine (mg/dL))) x 1.73 m2/patients BSA&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the patient is female, multiply the above by 0.85&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In patients with suspected liver disease, bilirubin must be less than or equal to&#xD;
                  2.5 mg/dL, AST and ALT must be less than or equal to 2.5 times institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The malignancy must be restaged prior to research phase and must not have progressed&#xD;
             during induction chemotherapy (stable disease or better). Persons with acute leukemia,&#xD;
             MDS/RAEB-I or II or CML with previous accelerated or blast phase must have &lt;5% blasts&#xD;
             in the bone marrow. Persons with chronic phase CML may have up to 10% blasts in the&#xD;
             bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA (applies to all phases of this protocol) :&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection that is not responding to antimicrobial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active CNS involvement by malignancy (patients with known positive CSF cytology or&#xD;
             parenchymal lesions visible by CT or MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous other malignancies unless they have undergone curative intent therapy for&#xD;
             that malignancy and (1) have had no evidence of that disease for 5 years, and/or (2)&#xD;
             be deemed at low risk for recurrence (less than or equal to 20% at 5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV positive patients are ineligible as allogeneic stem cell transplant is not yet a&#xD;
             proven approach in this patient population, and patients are at increased risk of&#xD;
             lethal infections when treated with marrow suppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because palifermin has been shown to be&#xD;
             embryotoxic and fetotoxic in animal studies. Because there is an unknown but potential&#xD;
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             palifermin, breastfeeding should be discontinued for the duration of active study&#xD;
             therapy. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of psychiatric disorder or any other condition which may compromise compliance&#xD;
             with transplant protocol or expose patient to unnecessary risk as determined by&#xD;
             principal investigator or lead associate investigator.&#xD;
