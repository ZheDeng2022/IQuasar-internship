  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK1265744 (744) is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) currently in development&#xD;
      for both the treatment and prevention of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Renal&#xD;
      elimination of unchanged 744 is extremely low, with no parent 744 detected in the urine after&#xD;
      a single 30 mg radiolabeled dose. Despite the minimal contribution of renal clearance on&#xD;
      overall 744 elimination, renal impairment may potentially inhibit some pathways of hepatic&#xD;
      and gut drug metabolism and transport, and as a result may impact 744 pharmacokinetics. The&#xD;
      current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft guidance for renal impairment studies&#xD;
      suggests that a pharmacokinetic (PK) study in patients with renal impairment be conducted&#xD;
      even for those drugs primarily metabolized or secreted in bile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be comprised of two cohorts (severe renal impairment and normal renal&#xD;
      function) of 8 subjects each. Upon enrolment, each subject will be admitted to the study&#xD;
      center and undergo serial PK sampling following a single dose of oral 744 30 milligrams (mg).&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the clinic for follow-up evaluations 10-14 days after the 744 30 mg&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
