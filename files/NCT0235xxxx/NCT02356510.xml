  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current guidelines still recommend emergent PCI of the culprit lesion and state that&#xD;
      primary PCI should be limited to the culprit vessel with the exception of cardiogenic shock&#xD;
      and persistent ischaemia after PCI of the supposed culprit lesion. This recommendation is&#xD;
      based on a high number of studies. However, several studies are present about the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of non-culprit vessel PCI during acute MI. Nowadays, the debate is increasingly&#xD;
      going on about the PCI of the non-culprit arteries during the index event with newer&#xD;
      prospective randomized studies. Besides, it is still unclear for the culprit artery whether&#xD;
      to treat only the culprit lesion or all the other lesions in the culprit vessel during the&#xD;
      index event. The present report describes a retrospective comparison between the two&#xD;
      strategies during primary PCI for STEMI, looking for their influence on the clinical and&#xD;
      angiographic course of the patients.&#xD;

      Patient selection: This multi-centre retrospective study included patients from 3 high-volume&#xD;
      primary PCI centres in Turkey. A total number of 5512 patients underwent emergent PCI for&#xD;
      acute STEMI between January 2011 and December 2013. From this patient population, patients&#xD;
      were looked for the presence of an additional lesion to the culprit lesion (CL). Additional&#xD;
      lesion was defined as the presence of an angiographically severe (≥70%) lesion other than the&#xD;
      CL either proximal or distal to it in the same coronary artery after the distal flow was&#xD;
      observed most commonly as a result of guide-wire passage or PTCA of the total occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: - Presence of LMCA lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiogenic shock&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous CABG operation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decision for CABG operation after primary PCI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe valvular disease including aortic stenosis of mitral insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe kidney disease (serum creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dl or patients on maintenance&#xD;
           hemodialysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rejection of second PCI by the patient after the index event&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligible patients were retrospectively sought from the database of the relevant hospital.&#xD;
      The basal characteristics of the patients like age, sex, presence of coronary risk factors&#xD;
      (smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia), vital signs and location of&#xD;
      STEMI at admission were noted. The emergent coronary angiograms of the patients were then&#xD;
      examined and several angiographic and post-PCI features which are defined in detail in the&#xD;
      following sections were addressed. Follow-up of these patients were succeeded either by phone&#xD;
      call, routine polyclinic visits or from the database of hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study groups: Patients were grouped into 2 according to the PCI strategy; culprit vessel (CV)&#xD;
      group including patients who underwent emergent PCI of all severe (≥70 stenosis in CAG)&#xD;
      lesions in the culprit vessel and culprit lesion (CL) group including patients who underwent&#xD;
      emergency PCI only for the CL and staged PCI in 2 weeks for the other additional lesions in&#xD;
      the CV. Both groups underwent staged PCI for the severe lesion(s) in non-culprit vessel(s) if&#xD;
      necessary in a different session in 28 days after the index event. Staged PCI was the&#xD;
      preferred strategy in both groups if necessary because staged PCI has been found to be at&#xD;
      least non-inferior to other strategies in several studies [3, 4, 10, 13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of acute STEMI: The criteria for diagnosis of STEMI were: (1) chest pain within 24&#xD;
      h before admission that lasted for more than 30 min and was not relieved by sublingual&#xD;
      nitroglycerin; (2) ST-segment elevation on electrocardiogram; and (3) elevated serum creatine&#xD;
      kinase (CK) or troponin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergent coronary angiography and PCI procedure: All patients were routinely treated with&#xD;
      heparin, clopidogrel, aspirin, statin and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or&#xD;
      angiotensin II receptor blocker unless contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary angioplasty and stent implantation were performed according to standard percutaneous&#xD;
      techniques through the femoral artery. Standard selective coronary angiography with at least&#xD;
      4 views of the left coronary system and 2 views of the right coronary artery was performed&#xD;
      using the Judgkins technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients with the diagnosis of acute STEMI underwent emergent PCI with bare metal or&#xD;
      drug-eluting stents. Stent implantation was performed at an inflation pressure of 10 to 16&#xD;
      atm. When suboptimal stent deployment was observed, angiographic optimization was performed&#xD;
      using high-pressure noncompliant balloon dilatation to achieve &lt;20% residual stenosis by&#xD;
      visual estimation. Angiographic no-reflow phenomenon was diagnosed if a significant coronary&#xD;
      flow decrease (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] grade &lt;3 flow) without mechanical&#xD;
      obstruction was noticed in final cineangiograms obtained at completion of the PCI procedure&#xD;
      [14, 15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staged PCI: Staged PCI procedure was performed either to the culprit vessel in CL group&#xD;
      and/or to the non-culprit lesion(s) in non-culprit vessel(s) in both groups in 14 days after&#xD;
      the index event. In the CL group, it was performed to culprit and non-culprit vessels during&#xD;
      same intervention. In the CV group, it was performed to non-culprit vessels if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of patients: The investigators collected follow-up information from the database of&#xD;
      the hospitals and/or during telephone calls with patients. Follow-up included screening for&#xD;
      major outcomes including death (in-hospital, cardiac and non-cardiac), non-fatal myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, and need for surgical or percutaneous revas¬cularisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial infarction was defined as a troponin level above the 99th percentile and symptoms&#xD;
      of cardiac ischemia. For patients with re-infarction, the definition required ≥20% increase&#xD;
      of cardiac markers (Troponin) with ischemic symptoms or ECG findings or angiographic evidence&#xD;
      of coronary artery occlusion including early stent thrombosis. Early stent thrombosis was&#xD;
      defined as acute myocardial infarction due to stent thrombosis in 30 days after implantation,&#xD;
      usually during index hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The analysis of the results was performed using the Predictive&#xD;
      Analytics SoftWare (PASW) Statistics 18.0 for Windows (Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). Data were tested for a normal distribution using the&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The categorical variables were shown as numbers of cases with&#xD;
      percentages and the normally distributed continuous variables were shown as mean ± SD.&#xD;
      Student's t-test was used for the analysis of the continuous variables that were normally&#xD;
      distributed and the χ2 test for the categorical variables. The Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test&#xD;
      was used for the variables that were not normally distributed. Statistical significance was&#xD;
      defined as p value less than 0.05.&#xD;
