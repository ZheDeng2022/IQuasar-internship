      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of MEN1112, given as intravenous infusion,&#xD;
      in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. Pharmacokinetics, clinical activity and&#xD;
      potential immunogenicity of MEN1112 will be evaluated as well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed as an open label, non randomised, dose escalation and cohort&#xD;
      expansion, first administration to human study to be conducted in approximately 20 European&#xD;
      sites. The study is aiming to identify the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and Maximum Tolerated&#xD;
      Dose (MTD), to assess the pharmacokinetics and to determine the clinical activity and&#xD;
      potential immunogenicity of MEN1112, administered as IV infusion for two 21-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 100 male and female ≥ 18 years-old patients, with a documented diagnosis of&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory AML (not M3 FAB subtype), will be treated in the study, which consists&#xD;
      of two steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1 is the dose escalation phase according to a 3+3 patients cohort design. Incremental&#xD;
      mg/Kg doses will be tested. Briefly, MEN1112 doses are to be administered to 3 patients; if&#xD;
      no DLT is observed in a cohort of 3 DLT evaluable patients at a given dose level, the next&#xD;
      cohort of 3 new patients will be treated with the next higher dose. In case of DLT occurrence&#xD;
      by one of the three patients at any dose, the cohort will be expanded to 6 DLT evaluable&#xD;
      patients at the same dose level. If two or more patients at a given dose level exhibit DLT,&#xD;
      the dose escalation phase will be concluded as the MTD will be identified as one dose level&#xD;
      below the one at which ≥ 2 DLT out of 6 treated patients occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2 is the cohort expansion phase which will include patients treated at the MTD or the&#xD;
      maximum dose level judged to be tolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each study Step, patients will be given two induction cycles of MEN1112 followed by a&#xD;
      four-week End of Treatment period and a Follow-up period. In Step 1 and Step 2, DLT and MTD&#xD;
      will be assessed when MEN1112 is given as a 'one shot' infusion (first group of patients) for&#xD;
      all doses as well as a 'ramp up' administration to be infused in 3 days for the first two&#xD;
      doses in Cycle 1 (second group of patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along the study period, adverse events, changes in hematology/serum biochemistry parameters&#xD;
      and bone marrow treatment response will represent the major clinical findings to be monitored&#xD;
      on regular basis. The individual experimental clinical phase will last up to 6 months (except&#xD;
      for female patients of childbearing potential that will undergo monthly pregnancy test until&#xD;
      6 months from the last study drug administration) encompassing approx. 40 planned visits at&#xD;
      site, including Screening,Treatment, End of Treatment, Follow-up period and the End of Study&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The Sponsor accepted the iDSMB recommendation to terminate the study due to evidence of&#xD;
    unpredictable liver toxicity and meaningful target engagement not translating into any clinical&#xD;
