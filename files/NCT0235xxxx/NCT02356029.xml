  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine how often cardiopulmonary resuscitation&#xD;
      (CPR) is perceived as inappropriate by Healthcare Providers (HCPs) working in prehospital&#xD;
      Ambulance Services and Emergency Departments. Perception of inappropriate CPR is defined as&#xD;
      resuscitation efforts perceived by HCPs as disproportionate to the expected prognosis of the&#xD;
      patient in terms of survival or quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a HCP perceives CPR as inappropriate, this may cause moral and emotional distress. This&#xD;
      perception may be modulated by the personal background and professional role of the HCP, but&#xD;
      also by his/her working conditions. Apart from the workload, the resulting distress can be&#xD;
      influenced by the way non-technical skills are developed within the team and the ethical&#xD;
      environment in which the HCP functions. Frequent exposure to similar patient care situations&#xD;
      and/or a professional environment not acknowledging the distress may lead to deficient coping&#xD;
      mechanisms and accumulation of moral distress. This may be associated with job leave, burnout&#xD;
      and a decreased quality of patient care. Acute distress may also influence the quality of&#xD;
      care provided to actual and future patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate whether perceived inappropriateness of CPR&#xD;
      is not only associated with patient related factors but also with personal characteristics&#xD;
      and work related factors. Potential consequences for HCP's like moral distress and&#xD;
      intentional job leave will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The REAppropriate study is an international multicentric cross-sectional survey exploring&#xD;
      perception of inappropriateness of CPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of perceived&#xD;
      inappropriateness of CPR (PICPR) of the last resuscitation performed out-of-hospital or in&#xD;
      the Emergency Department (ED) by Healthcare Providers (HCP) working in prehospital Ambulance&#xD;
      Services and EDs. PICPR is defined as resuscitation efforts perceived by HCPs as&#xD;
      disproportionate to the expected prognosis of the patient in terms of survival or quality of&#xD;
      life. Prevalence of PICPR is defined as the number of HCPs reporting PICPR in the last&#xD;
      cardiac arrest situation they attended divided by the total number of surveyed HCPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the hypothesis that PICPR is not only associated with&#xD;
      patient related factors but also with personal characteristics and work related factors.&#xD;
      Other objectives will be assessment of moral distress and intentional job leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each participating country a National Coordinator is nominated by the Steering Committee.&#xD;
      National Coordinators are selected because of their leading role in national or international&#xD;
      scientific organisations related to Emergency Medicine and/or their teaching or research&#xD;
      activities related to Emergency Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each National Coordinator establishes a network of Local Investigators who coordinate study&#xD;
      proceedings within EDs and Ambulance Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will focus on HCPs directly involved in treatment of cardiac arrest patients&#xD;
      (out-of-hospital or in the ED): nurses, doctors, ED Technicians/Nurse Assistants and&#xD;
      Emergency Medical Technicians(EMT)/Paramedics working in EDs and prehospital Ambulance&#xD;
      Services active in the Emergency Medical Services system of the country. Hospitals in&#xD;
      countries without established EDs but with a group of HCPs working inside the hospital and&#xD;
      having as their daily duty the first care and stabilisation of patients arriving unplanned in&#xD;
      the hospital are also eligible for participation in the study. The Local Investigator will&#xD;
      clearly delineate this functional unit within the hospital thus determining the number of&#xD;
      eligible HCPs within the center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two electronic questionnaires will be used: one for the Local Investigator of the ED or&#xD;
      Ambulance Service and one for the HCPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire for Local Investigator: this questionnaire requests quantitative data on&#xD;
      organisational issues like number of beds, ED or Ambulance Service activity, number of&#xD;
      doctors, nurses, EMTs/Paramedics etc. and a few questions about resuscitation practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire for HCPs: the HCPs are asked about their personal characteristics and&#xD;
      educational background. There are questions about their working conditions, job strain and&#xD;
      teamwork within their professional environment. Their opinion is asked about possible reasons&#xD;
      and statements concerning perception of (in)appropriate resuscitation. Finally they are&#xD;
      questioned about the last resuscitation they were involved in themselves (it will not be&#xD;
      necessary for them to have the medical file available while answering these questions). The&#xD;
      HCP is first asked an opinion about the (in)appropriateness of the intervention and the&#xD;
      resulting amount of moral and emotional distress, should this be the case. This is followed&#xD;
      by questions about the circumstances of the cardiac arrest and a query on the relative&#xD;
      importance of patient related, situational and interprofessional items. Four level Likert&#xD;
      items are used where appropriate. Interest level analysis will be incorporated in the&#xD;
      questionnaire to assist in assessing nonresponse bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of the questionnaire will take approximately 20 minutes. Participation is on a&#xD;
      voluntary basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translation of surveys:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A modified Brislin's model of translation will be used. The primary questionnaires are in&#xD;
      English. Both questionnaires are being translated in additional languages (the so called&#xD;
      target languages) using the following procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The first step will be forward translation of the English questionnaire into the target&#xD;
           language by two native speakers of the target language with a proficient knowledge of&#xD;
           English and ideally with a background in the medical specialties covered by the topic of&#xD;
           this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second step is that a third person whose native language is the target language&#xD;
           reviews the translated versions together with the translators of step 1 for grammatical&#xD;
           style and comprehensibility without the English text (so this can be a monolingual&#xD;
           person). The most appropriate forward translation is chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. When this has been achieved the third step is the back translation to the English&#xD;
           language of the most appropriate forward translation by two different bilingual persons&#xD;
           (ideally native English speaking with a proficient knowledge of the target language) who&#xD;
           are blinded from the original English version. Again efforts are made that the back&#xD;
           translators are professionally involved in the research field to improve the quality of&#xD;
           the translation process. The two back translations are reviewed with a third person and&#xD;
           the most appropriate back translation is chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In the last and fourth step the Steering Committee compares the most appropriate back&#xD;
           translation of both questionnaires with the original English version. If necessary,&#xD;
           recommendations will be done for modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout this process regular interaction and feedback with the Steering Committee will&#xD;
      further optimise the quality of the translation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information Technology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the data will be collected through the use of a website especially designed for this&#xD;
      study. Normal web applications use HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to transfer web pages&#xD;
      between the web server and the web browser. In order to guarantee data safety a HTTPS website&#xD;
      signed by a trusted certificate authority will be used for this project. All the transferred&#xD;
      data are encrypted in these circumstances and can only be read by the web browser and the web&#xD;
      server.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics approval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the HCP no risk is associated with participation in the study since the survey is&#xD;
      completely anonymous. Insight in medical files is unnecessary to complete the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Coordinator will submit the protocol to one or more national ethical committees&#xD;
      according to the rules applied in his/her jurisdiction. Ethical approvals should be sent to&#xD;
      the Steering Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If necessary, written informed consent will be obtained from the participating HCPs.&#xD;
      Otherwise, completion of the questionnaire by the HCP will be taken as evidence of consent to&#xD;
      study participation. In countries where informed consent must be obtained, it is preferable&#xD;
      that the informed consent is uniform for the whole country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centers are not allowed to retrieve and report data unless ethical approval or after&#xD;
      reporting to the Steering Committee there is no requirement for ethical approval for their&#xD;
      country.&#xD;
