      MPO is conducting this PMCF study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of its EVOLUTION® Total&#xD;
      Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) components marketed in the EU. These types of studies are required by&#xD;
      regulatory authorities for all devices that do not have medium to long-term clinical evidence&#xD;
      available at the time of gaining approval to market in the EU. This study has been designed&#xD;
      in accordance with MEDDEV 2.12/2 rev 2.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      MicroPort Orthopedics Inc. (MPO) currently markets the EVOLUTION® TKA System globally,&#xD;
      including in the European Union (EU). As part of the process for gaining approval to market&#xD;
      in the EU, MicroPort is conducting this post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of this system. These types of studies are required by&#xD;
      regulatory authorities for all TKA devices that do not have medium to long-term clinical&#xD;
      evidence available at the time of gaining approval to market in the EU. The objectives of&#xD;
      this study are to evaluate component survivorship, cumulative revision rate, functional&#xD;
      outcome scores, and subject satisfaction at early, midterm, and long-term follow-up.&#xD;

             arthritis, or avascular necrosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  inflammatory degenerative joint disease including rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  correction of functional deformity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject was implanted with the specified combination of components&#xD;
