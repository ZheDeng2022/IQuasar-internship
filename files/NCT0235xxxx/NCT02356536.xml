      The CuePeD trial is an intervention trial measuring the effectiveness of a novel treatment&#xD;
      for Freezing of Gait (FOG) in Parkinson's disease (PD). The primary intervention is the use&#xD;
      of a wearable cueing device (WCD), which detects and responds to FOG and extinguishes on the&#xD;
      resumption of normal walking. It is designed for use in PD patients with FOG, in their home&#xD;
      environment where FOG is most severe. Kinematic data will be logged by a memory card in the&#xD;
      belt worn device recording FOG, and falls. The device will be used on 3 different settings in&#xD;
      a gait laboratory environment, and then for 2 weeks in the patient's own home using the same&#xD;
      3 settings. A battery of psychometric instruments will be administered before and after the&#xD;
      trial&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CuePeD trial primarily involves the use of a WCD ( pictured on website&#xD;
      www.brightdevices.com.au). This is a belt worn device, with a co-location of motion sensor&#xD;
      input and cueing output. The input is mediated by miniaturized accelerometers and gyroscopes&#xD;
      and utilizes software algorithms which have been developed to detect FOG. The cueing output&#xD;
      is mediated by a laser light which shines on the floor in front of the user as a continuous&#xD;
      visual signal. The cue is produced because of the device's ability to recognize FOG in the&#xD;
      user. The laser is produced for a predetermined period of time or until normal gait is&#xD;
      recommenced, at which time it extinguishes until the next freezing episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to examine the effectiveness of the WCD for the problem of FOG in PD 'in&#xD;
      vivo', that is, in a community setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOG has been defined narrowly as 'the sudden inability to initiate or sustain locomotion'. It&#xD;
      includes 'start', 'turn' and 'destination' hesitation. A broader definition accepted at the&#xD;
      2010 workshop of clinicians and scientists interested in FOG was &quot; brief, episodic absence or&#xD;
      marked reduction of forward progression of the feet despite the intention to walk&quot; . It&#xD;
      generally occurs several years after the onset of PD and has been recognized as a significant&#xD;
      source of morbidity in PD patients. Cueing represents one of the more promising treatments,&#xD;
      but the demonstration of in vivo effectiveness of this intervention to date, are modest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Falls, while often multifactorial in a general population, in PD are often attributable to&#xD;
      FOG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, current treatments for FOG are largely ineffective, and the evidence for their&#xD;
      use limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions for FOG are usually pharmacological and involve manipulation of laevodopa (LD)&#xD;
      doses, or more recently, the addition of stimulants. Other centrally acting medications have&#xD;
      been described anecdotally as beneficial, but have not been systematically studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possibly as a consequence of the decrease in postoperative laevodopa (LD) dose in chronic&#xD;
      users, or the under recognized significance of the subthalamic nucleus ( the most common&#xD;
      stimulation target) in gait regulation, the rise of Deep Brain Stimulation as a treatment for&#xD;
      PD may contribute to the problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first study employing a wearable device to detect FOG was described by Bachlin in 2010,&#xD;
      but involved a 3 component device (an ankle worn motion sensor, belt worn processing unit and&#xD;
      earpiece for cueing output) and a pulsed auditory cue (a 1 Hz clicking sound).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the recurring difficulties for gait scientists is the inability to elicit FOG in&#xD;
      freezers' in vitro' in the laboratory. This is due to the artificial clinical environment&#xD;
      giving rise to a 'best performance' or 'paradoxical kinesia'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-laboratory, 'in vivo' measures have been limited to user rated questionnaires at the end&#xD;
      of a trial period of in home use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This freeze detecting, cue producing device offers an elegant solution for the amelioration&#xD;
      of FOG and possibly falls in a PD population in their day to day life. In addition, it offers&#xD;
      a novel opportunity for the objective measurement of kinematic data to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      the device in individual subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst cueing has been recognized as a treatment for FOG for more than 25 years, most of this&#xD;
      work has occurred in gait laboratories. It is well known that FOG is induced in many subjects&#xD;
      with initiation of gait, turns and 'dual tasking'. This commonly occurs in the domestic&#xD;
      environment, where there are small spaces doorways, hallways etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most 'in vitro' work has taken place with a fixed, pulsed cue, usually auditory, but&#xD;
      including visual and somatosensory/vibration pulses. Unfortunately, the landmark 2006 RESCUE&#xD;
      trial of Neiubauer demonstrated an improvement in gait that was not sustained once the cueing&#xD;
      device was removed. That is, the problem of FOG is not readily rehabilitated with cueing, and&#xD;
      benefits of cueing training quickly extinguish once the treatment finishes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neurobiology of why FOG occurs in this setting, while beyond the scope of this&#xD;
      description, is beginning to be understood, and is worthy of brief commentary to better&#xD;
      understand the WCD's mechanism of action. Several lines of evidence, including functional&#xD;
      imaging studies point to a failure of reconciliation of motor, cognitive and emotional&#xD;
      circuits in FOG prone patients. Mental tasks (such as counting backwards), additional motor&#xD;
      tasks (such as carrying a glass of water), as well as a feeling of severe anxiety itself can&#xD;
      all induce FOG. The presence of a doorway or kitchen bench, which requires contemplation,&#xD;
      similarly represents a dual tasking challenge which can induce FOG. Being optimally&#xD;
      emotionally aroused in a laboratory setting can assist overcoming the propensity to freeze.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research will be a case series analysis of 30 PD patients with clinically&#xD;
      significant FOG; recruited from local movement disorder neurologists. There will be no&#xD;
      blinding. There will be an ABA design with subjects acting as their own controls - the device&#xD;
      on continually, on during FOG episodes or off at different time periods. There will be&#xD;
      randomization of the 3 device settings for different time periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each trial will take 2 weeks, with an initial gait laboratory assessment. During this&#xD;
      assessment signature freezing episodes will be captured, videoed, for each patient, and&#xD;
      correlated with kinematic readings. identification of FOG episodes and Inter-rater&#xD;
      reliability data will be obtained during these assessments. Patients will become familiar&#xD;
      with the use of the device for later use at home. 3 tasks will be undertaken by each patient&#xD;
      on each device setting - ie 9 tasks in total - these include: a timed up and go, 2 minute&#xD;
      walk and a specifically designed obstacle course. A battery of psychometric instruments will&#xD;
      be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This assessment will then be followed by a 2 week home trial. 3 device settings will be&#xD;
      employed in both environments - 1. the device 'off' and simply measuring FOG using its&#xD;
      software algorithms, 2.the device &quot;on&quot; whereby FOG episodes trigger the laser cue, and 3. the&#xD;
      device on 'continually' whereby, a continuous visual cue is emitted from the device,&#xD;
      independent of FOG episodes .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device will be on settings 1,2 and 3 for 3,7 and 4 days respectively, with randomisation&#xD;
      of the order of settings 2 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 2 week home trial, Kinematic data to capture FOG duration will be logged on the&#xD;
      device during the same time period each day with the device on different settings. Fall data&#xD;
      will collected from 6am to 10pm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crucially, FOG episodes on all 3 settings of the device will be recorded. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure will be the total seconds of FOG when the device is simply recording compared with&#xD;
      the total FOG seconds when a FOG dependent ( or continuous FOG independent) cue is provided&#xD;
      by the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 7 days on setting 2 (FOG dependent cue), instrument ratings will be&#xD;
      completed for a second time, and returned with the device for collation of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst cueing has been recognized as a treatment for FOG for more than 25years, most of this&#xD;
      work has occurred in gait laboratories. It is well known that FOG is induced in many subjects&#xD;
      with initiation of gait, turns and 'dual tasking'. This commonly occurs in the domestic&#xD;
      environment, where there are small spaces doorways, hallways etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hypothesis regarding the limited efficacy conferred by current devices used for FOG, is&#xD;
      that pulsed, fixed auditory stimuli represent a cognitive burden and may actually induce FOG&#xD;
      once the initial freeze is overcome. The work of Wolpert would suggest that a pulsed auditory&#xD;
      cue extending beyond the freezing episode would at best be 'gated' out by the subject, and&#xD;
      essentially ignored. Bachlin's subjects complained that the auditory cue was annoying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A fixed visual cue which extinguishes after the freeze is broken appeals as a powerful&#xD;
      antidote to this paradox of focusing the patient's attention at the point of freezing, but&#xD;
      not adding to their cognitive burden once the freeze is broken. This was recognized with the&#xD;
      first descriptions of cueing for FOG with an inverted walking cane. It is a powerful example&#xD;
      of the curiosity of paradoxical kinesia well known to the disorder, and not easily forgotten&#xD;
      by clinicians who have been witness to it. Until the recent development of increasingly&#xD;
      miniaturized, sophisticated accelerometers and gyroscopes, there was no mechanism to&#xD;
      replicate the effect of an upturned cane held by a walking companion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now known that there is an increasing loss of automaticity in FOG patients, and an&#xD;
      increase in cortical connectivity with deep brain structures - that is, there seems to be a&#xD;
      'cortical takeover' of gait in these patients. It seems likely that a cue may more readily&#xD;
      enable a re-accessing of 'vestigial' gait motor programs in those patients that it helps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2 null hypotheses of the research project will be: (1)That the wearable, freeze detecting&#xD;
      cueing device has no measurable effect on total freeze duration, total number of freezing&#xD;
      episodes , or total number of falls over the same three 1 hour intervals measured on separate&#xD;
      days in subjects with Parkinson's disease; and:(2)That there is no difference in user rated&#xD;
      instrument measures of Quality of Life, Freezing of Gait, Falls, Anxiety and Depression&#xD;
      before and after 2 weeks of treatment a wearable, freeze detecting cueing device in patients&#xD;
      with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research will be a case series analysis of 30 PD patients with clinically&#xD;
      significant FOG; recruited from local movement disorder neurologists. There will be no&#xD;
      blinding. In both arms of the trial, there will be an ABA design with subjects acting as&#xD;
      their own controls - the device on and off at different time periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Freezing of Gait Questionnaire(FOGQ); Falls Efficacy Scale (FES); Parkinson's Disease&#xD;
           Questionnaire 39; Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI), Geriatric depression scale (GDS);&#xD;
           Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI); Mini mental state examination MMSE and MOCA&#xD;
           .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 2minute walk test; Timed 'up and go' test; Dual tasking Timed up and go test;&#xD;
           standardized 20 metre obstacle course that includes a doorway, corridor, 180 and 360&#xD;
           degree turns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be asked to take the WCD home for 14 days with clear guidelines for its&#xD;
      use. The battery of questionnaires to be completed at the end of the 14 days, along with a&#xD;
      self addressed postal pack for the return of the device will accompany the patient.&#xD;
