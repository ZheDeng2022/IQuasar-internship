  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to investigate the use of Raloxifene (a new form of estrogen) in&#xD;
      the treatment of young women with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Raloxifene is a&#xD;
      Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM),which means that it can affect the central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) effects of estrogen (eg. improving emotional symptoms, memory,&#xD;
      information processing and concentration), without adversely affecting reproductive&#xD;
      tissue/organs such as breast, uterus and ovaries. The investigators are conducting a&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo controlled, three month study comparing the psychotic symptom response&#xD;
      of women with schizophrenia in both groups. One group will receive standard antipsychotic&#xD;
      medication plus 120mg Raloxifene, while the second group will receive standard antipsychotic&#xD;
      medication plus oral placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Estrogen is hypothesised to be protective for women against early onset of severe symptoms of&#xD;
      schizophrenia (Hafner, 1991; Seeman, 1992). This 'estrogen hypothesis' was derived from&#xD;
      epidemiological, clinical and animal studies. Following the results of such studies, the&#xD;
      investigators conducted a study (Kulkarni et al 1996) in which a group of premenopausal women&#xD;
      with schizophrenia were given 0.02mg oral estradiol as an adjunct to antipsychotic drug&#xD;
      treatment for eight weeks, and compared their progress with a similar group who received&#xD;
      antipsychotic drugs only. The group receiving estrogen made a significantly more rapid&#xD;
      recovery from acute psychotic symptoms and also reported improvement in their general health&#xD;
      status. Subsequently, the investigators conducted a four week double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study, using 100mcg estradiol skin patches. The investigators found that&#xD;
      the 12 premenopausal women who received the estradiol adjunct had a significantly lower total&#xD;
      PANSS and BPRS score than 12 women who received placebo patches plus antipsychotic&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major potential risks in using estrogen as a longer term adjunctive treatment in&#xD;
      premenopausal women with schizophrenia appear to be the potential harmful effects of estrogen&#xD;
      itself in its action on breast and uterine tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our studies were brief for this reason, in that the investigators used estrogen without&#xD;
      progesterone over an eight week or four week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the recent advent of Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators, in particular Raloxifene&#xD;
      Hydrochloride, there is the potential to harness the positive estrogenic effect on CNS&#xD;
      neurotransmitter systems without affecting breast or uterine tissue. While the CNS effects of&#xD;
      Raloxifene have not been fully studied, its actions are mediated through binding to estrogen&#xD;
      receptors and can thereby regulate gene expression that is ligand, tissue or gene specific.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By inference then, Raloxifene would be expected to impact on dopamine and serotonin pathways&#xD;
      in a similar fashion to conjugated estrogen. A study (Nickleisen et al 1999) on the effect of&#xD;
      Raloxifene on cognition in healthy, postmenopausal women found a slight increase in verbal&#xD;
      memory performance after one month of high dose treatment, while no other differences were&#xD;
      found after 12 months of treatment. There are no studies in women with cognitive impairment&#xD;
      where a treatment effect would be more likely to be apparent. Similarly, there are no&#xD;
      clinical studies to date investigating the effect of Raloxifene on psychotic symptoms. To&#xD;
      this end, the investigators are putting forward an investigator initiated clinical trial&#xD;
      proposal to investigate the effect of adjunctive Raloxifene on psychotic symptoms in women&#xD;
      with schizophrenia. This is, therefore, a study to follow our Pilot Study in the same area,&#xD;
      but with an increase of Raloxifene from 60mg to 120mg daily.&#xD;
