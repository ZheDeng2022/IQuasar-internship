  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to look at possible reasons why some HIV positive people who take&#xD;
      their drugs properly and have no resistance to these drugs, still have low amounts of virus&#xD;
      detectable in their blood. This is known as Low Level Viraemia (LLV). When low levels of HIV&#xD;
      virus are present, some can mutate and make the drugs less effective (i.e. some variants of&#xD;
      the virus become more resistant). Currently, however, these resistance mutations may be&#xD;
      difficult to detect using standard tests for resistance because the amount of virus in the&#xD;
      blood is very low and the standard tests aren't sensitive enough to pick up the mutations.&#xD;
      The investigators will use more sensitive mutation detection methods, known as Next&#xD;
      Generation Sequencing (NGS), to look at whether see if there are any low levels of drug&#xD;
      resistant HIV virus developing in the blood when LLV occurs. The investigators will look at&#xD;
      the different treatment strategies that are used in routine standard practice when LLV is&#xD;
      detected and evaluate which is most effective in preventing development of resistance. The&#xD;
      investigators hope this research will help to inform guidelines on the best way to treat HIV&#xD;
      in the future.&#xD;

      Phase of Study: Non-Drug Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary To investigate the causes of low level viraemia (LLV) in HIV-infected&#xD;
           individuals with no PI resistance associated mutations (RAMs) on conventional genotyping&#xD;
           who have a detectable plasma HIV viral load (pVL) and report &gt;95% adherence* to their&#xD;
           ARV regimens containing a boosted protease inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
           *in case the questionnaire cannot be performed, clinical documentation of adherence will&#xD;
           be used for interpretation of adherence level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary To observe the evolution in virologic and immunologic responses following&#xD;
           routine clinical intervention in HIV-infected individuals with no primary protease&#xD;
           inhibitor mutations (IAS, USA) on conventional genotyping who have a detectable plasma&#xD;
           HIV viral load (pVL) and report &gt;95% adherence* to antiretroviral regimens containing a&#xD;
           boosted protease inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  in case the questionnaire cannot be performed, clinical documentation of adherence&#xD;
                will be used for interpretation of adherence level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A multi-centre, non-drug, observational cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: HIV-infected individuals attending three selected HIV clinics at the Chelsea and&#xD;
      Westminster Hospital, St Mary's Hospital and Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital over the duration&#xD;
      of the study will be identified at weekly viral resistance meetings and routine clinic&#xD;
      appointments if they demonstrate the following HIV pVL criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An HIV pVL of 41-2000 copies/ml (c/ml) on two consecutive tests after being &lt;40 c/ml on&#xD;
           at least two occasions on a bPI-containing regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An HIV pVL of 41-2000 c/ml on two consecutive tests having never achieved &lt;40 c/ml on a&#xD;
           bPI-containing regimen after more than six months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be provided with a patient information sheet and a written consent&#xD;
      form. Following consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Virologic and immunologic assessments will be collected from the clinical records&#xD;
           available&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Viral resistance test (VRT) (using VircoTYPE HIV-1 Virtual PhenotypeTM-LM for&#xD;
           conventional genotyping and Ilumina MiSeq as next generation sequencing, NGS for&#xD;
           minority species testing) will be performed on the first detectable HIV pVL(&gt;40 c/mL)&#xD;
           found in clinic and at 3 to 6 and 12 months later, if HIV pVL is still &gt;40 c/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Sample Size: 120 to 240 samples over the one-year study period, with each centre&#xD;
      providing 40 to 80 samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of Eligibility Criteria: HIV-infected individuals with no primary protease inhibitor&#xD;
      mutations (IAS, USA) on standard VRTs who have a detectable pVL and report &gt;95% adherence*&#xD;
      ARV regimens containing a boosted protease inhibitor with HIV VL criteria as detailed above.&#xD;
      Individuals who have a detectable HIV VL after stopping ARV or having an 8-item Morisky score&#xD;
      of above 2 (or &lt;95% reported adherence will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *in case the questionnaire cannot be performed, clinical documentation of adherence will be&#xD;
      used for interpretation of adherence level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Study Centres: Three&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Study: One year from study approval. Samples for resistance testing will be&#xD;
      collected over the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Emergence of new primary protease inhibitor mutations (IAS, USA) using NGS will be&#xD;
           described.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comparison of respective parameters (HIV VL and CD4 count) between different clinical&#xD;
           interventions. The latter will not be dictated by the protocol but will be conducted as&#xD;
           routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of primary protease inhibitor mutations (IAS, USA) on NGS in HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients with primary protease inhibitor mutations (IAS, USA) on standard VRTs who&#xD;
      demonstrate LLV on ARV regimens containing a bPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Proportion of patients achieving an undetectable HIV VL following an intervention during&#xD;
           periods of LLV on ARV regimens containing a bPI&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evolution of CD4 cell count following an intervention during periods of LLV on ARV&#xD;
           regimens containing a bPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: This is a non-drug study and no interventions will be dictated by this protocol.&#xD;
