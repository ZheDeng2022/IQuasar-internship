      An investigation on the difference in stoma hernia frequency related to surgical technique&#xD;
      when incising the fascia. All patients planned for elective colostomy formation are to be&#xD;
      included. Patients undergoing rectal resection with a TME and a colostomy (Hartmann's&#xD;
      procedure) for rectal cancer, abdominoperineal resection for rectal cancer or diverting&#xD;
      colostomy for any reason are all included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three groups for randomization are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. circular incision in the abdominal wall fascia B. cruciate incision in the abdominal wall&#xD;
      fascia C. mesh enforced cruciate incision in the abdominal wall fascia Primary endpoint is&#xD;
      the parastomal hernia rate within 12 months from index surgery. Secondary end-points include&#xD;
      clinical variables, re-admission and/or re-operation due to any stoma complication, quality&#xD;
      of life and health economy analyses, at 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colostomy formation has been a standard surgical procedure for more than 100 years. Initially&#xD;
      the quality of life for stoma patients was all but good, as the appliances to collect the&#xD;
      feces were cumbersome, smelly and did not ensure non-leakage. As late as in the 60-ies&#xD;
      bandages were still primitive(1). Gradually these problems have decreased as techniques for&#xD;
      bandages have improved. A well functioning colostomy may in itself not negatively affect the&#xD;
      patient's Quality of Life (QoL)(2), although thorough information and support from stoma care&#xD;
      nurses is of utmost importance (3). However, this can only be said if the stoma is well&#xD;
      functioning and if the complications are kept to a minimum. The complication rate after stoma&#xD;
      formation is still considerable, with figures of 21-70% (4, 5) and studies have shown that&#xD;
      adequate height; type of stoma, BMI, emergency surgery and gender may be of importance in&#xD;
      reducing the risk of complications both in the short and long-term (6-8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical technique of stoma formation is only partly evidence based. There are few&#xD;
      studies directed at technical details about stoma construction and their future impact on&#xD;
      stoma function, apart from the importance of the stoma height (6). One study has tested to&#xD;
      standardize the skin incision to 2/3rds of the width of the bowel (9), although the actual&#xD;
      impact of this on the functional outcome of the stoma was not presented.. In the surgical&#xD;
      literature a cruciate incision in the fascia and extraction of the bowel through a hole&#xD;
      sufficient in size is a short description of the surgical technique (10). In clinical&#xD;
      practice sufficient size of the hole has often been equal to &quot;two fingers-width&quot;, is commonly&#xD;
      used, which refers to the width of the surgeon's fingers, a fairly inexact measurement. A&#xD;
      pilot study from Sahlgrenska University Hospital has found that this clinical practice for&#xD;
      the most part results in a skin incision diameter of 50% of the bowel width.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been discussions regarding the placement of the stoma and effects on hernia&#xD;
      incidence, whether in the obliquous muscle or the rectus abdominis (11) or if the bowel&#xD;
      should take an extraperitoneal route (ad modum Goligher) or not (12). No studies have been&#xD;
      sufficient in design or size to thoroughly answer the question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parastomal hernia is a long-term complication that is common, in the literature figures up to&#xD;
      almost 50% have been reported (13, 14). Attempts to reduce the rates of parastomal hernias&#xD;
      have been made in the last few years with a placement of a mesh, at the construction of the&#xD;
      stoma, (15-19). This practice has not been universally accepted, in part due to a hesitance&#xD;
      in the surgical society because of the risk of infections with foreign body material, and&#xD;
      partly due to that most studies are underpowered for their main outcome variable. Another&#xD;
      suggestion for the basic construction of the stoma has been to make a circular incision in&#xD;
      the fascia instead of a cruciate, but this has not been documented in any studies. It has&#xD;
      been described in conjunction with use of circular stapling devices in the skin, no hernias&#xD;
      were found, however the patient numbers were small (20). It is apparent that further studies&#xD;
      are most welcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of parastomal hernias has been discussed. Janes et al. used clinical&#xD;
      examination in their studies (16, 17), and confirmed in a later study that the concurrence&#xD;
      with a CT-verified parastomal hernia was (21) sufficient if performed in a prone position.&#xD;
      Another recent study found that results from a CT-scan was not correlated with patient&#xD;
      symptoms (22). Other studies have evaluated the use of ultrasound and found it feasible (23).&#xD;
      The conclusion must be that evaluation of parastomal hernias may be difficult and must be&#xD;
      standardized in a study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis to be tested in this study is that a circular incision or mesh enforced&#xD;
      cruciate incision in the abdominal wall fascia with a diameter of 50% of the width of the&#xD;
      patients left colon results carries less risk of parastomal herniation than a cruciate&#xD;
      incision where the each of the arms measure 1/2 of the diameter of the patients left colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this trial is to compare the parastomal hernia formation within 12 months after&#xD;
      stoma surgery between circular, mesh enforced cruciate and cruciate incision.&#xD;
