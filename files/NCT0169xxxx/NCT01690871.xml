      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of BEZ235 on Objective Response Rate (best&#xD;
      response on study) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the progression free survival rate at 32 weeks in the included population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the duration of response among responders&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate time to response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the time to progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate safety and tolerability of BEZ235&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify molecular and genomic profiles of PEComas and their potential relationship&#xD;
           to clinical outcome by analyzing PIK3CA, Ras, Raf, TSC, AKT and PTEN alteration in tumor&#xD;
           samples (archival or fresh pre-treatment tumor biopsy) and PIK3CA in circulating DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine biomarkers relevant to BEZ235 activity by analyzing the expression of&#xD;
           phosphoproteins p-AKT, p-S6, p-4EBP1 at screening and during treatment as well as&#xD;
           biomarkers for the proliferation (Ki-67) and apoptosis (PARP) (only if fresh tissue&#xD;
           (optional) is available).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population consists of patients 18 years old or older with progressive&#xD;
      unresectable/advanced or metastatic malignant PEComas previously treated for&#xD;
      unresectable/advanced/metastatic disease with 1 to 2 prior lines of chemotherapy. Patients&#xD;
      must have adequate hematologic, renal, cardiac and hepatic functions and not be previously&#xD;
      treated with a mTOR inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      16 to 33 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, single arm, two-stage phase II study to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy and tolerability of BEZ235 in patients with progressive metastatic&#xD;
      or unresectable/advanced malignant PEComas. The patient should have received 1 or 2 prior&#xD;
      lines of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BEZ235 will be administered until disease progression. Sixteen patients will be enrolled into&#xD;
      Stage 1 and observed for at least 32 weeks at which time an interim analysis will be&#xD;
      performed (plus eventually 4-5 weeks for confirmation of responses occurring on or closely&#xD;
      before this cut-off date). If the number of patients with a response (CR or PR) is 2 or less,&#xD;
      the trial will be stopped for futility. If 3 or more patients experience a response&#xD;
      enrollment will continue up to 33 patients (Stage 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be constituted for reviewing the interim&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of malignant PEComa (included epithelioid AML) of&#xD;
             primary disease or of metastatic lesion from archival tissue if it has been obtained&#xD;
             within 12 months prior to enrollment in this study. This histological diagnosis&#xD;
             includes immunochemistry as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Immunohistochemically positive expression of a melanocytic marker (HMB45, MelanA&#xD;
                  or microphtalmia transcription factor) AND of a smooth muscle marker (smooth&#xD;
                  muscle actin, pan-muscle actin, h-caldesmon or calponin) is mandatory on primary&#xD;
                  or metastatic tumor biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: According to Folpe (2002), criteria for malignancy in non-AML PEComas are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  tumor size of more than 5 cm,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  infiltrative growth pattern,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  high nuclear grade,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  mitotic activity of more than 1/50 high power field (HPF),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  necrosis,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  vascular invasion&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Thus, to be included in the trial, the patient should have tumor presenting with&#xD;
                  2 or more criteria for malignancy associated with aggressive clinical behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. If the primary diagnosis was performed more than 12 months before enrollment, the&#xD;
             histology of a primary/metastatic lesion should be reconfirmed with a fresh biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Availability of a representative tumor specimen, either archival or fresh tumor tissue&#xD;
             for PI3K pathway analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Unresectable/advanced and/or metastatic and documented progressive measurable disease&#xD;
             as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria. Prior to study entry, the progression of the&#xD;
             disease should be confirmed by at least 2 sequential CT scans available for&#xD;
             documentation (will be collected and hold).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Presence of measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1. Note: Lesions in previously&#xD;
             irradiated areas can only be considered measurable if they have clearly progressed&#xD;
             since the radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Treated with 1 or 2 prior lines of treatment Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Disease exclusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) exclusively&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Active uncontrolled or symptomatic CNS metastases Note: A patient with controlled and&#xD;
             asymptomatic CNS metastases may participate in this trial. As such, the patient must&#xD;
             have completed any prior treatment for CNS metastases &gt; 28 days (including&#xD;
             radiotherapy and/or surgery) prior to start of treatment in this study and should not&#xD;
             be receiving chronic corticosteroid therapy for the CNS metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Concurrent malignancy or malignancy in the last 3 years prior to start the study&#xD;
             treatment (with the exception of adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ or&#xD;
             nonmelanoma skin cancer).&#xD;
