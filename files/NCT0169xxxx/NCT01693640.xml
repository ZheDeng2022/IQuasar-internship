      Hypothesis: Abatacept injections will decrease the number of oral ulcers seen in Behcet's&#xD;
      patients&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open label study, where 20 Behcet's patients with resistant oral ulcers and&#xD;
      10 with resistant genital ulcers will be enrolled (screen 40). After enrollment all patients&#xD;
      will be followed for a month to document the number of oral and genital ulcers on their&#xD;
      current regimen. Then all patients will receive abatacept for 6 months (evaluated at weeks 0,&#xD;
      2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24). Then the treatment will be stopped and they will be observed for the&#xD;
      next 2 months, for a total of 9 month trial.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Before any study procedures are performed, subjects will have the details of the study&#xD;
             described to them, and they will be given a written informed consent document to read.&#xD;
             Then, if subjects consent to participate in the study, they will indicate that consent&#xD;
             by signing and dating the informed consent document in the presence of study&#xD;
             personnel.&#xD;

          4. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 10 weeks after the&#xD;
             last dose of study drug to minimize the risk of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have oral ulcers or genital ulcers that have been resistant to&#xD;
             colchicine or topical measures for at least a month.&#xD;
