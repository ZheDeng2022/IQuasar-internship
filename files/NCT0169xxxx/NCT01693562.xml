    <description>The PFS assessed by the investigator in UC cohort is reported. The PFS is defined as the time from the start of study treatment until the first documentation of disease progression based on RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. The PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study; the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. The PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs) in the Dose-escalation, Dose-exploration, and Dose-expansion Phase</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. The TEAEs are defined as events present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug.</description>
        <time_frame>From Day 1 through 90 days after the last dose of study drug (approximately 5.25 years)</time_frame>
        <population>As-treated population included all participants who received any dose of study drug. Participants enrolled in the 10 mg/kg Q2W Expansion and Escalation Cohort have been summarized as a total only. This is because the safety profile of durvalumab monotherapy 10 mg/kg Q2W was manageable and generally consistent with the known safety profile of the anti-programmed cell death ligand (PD-L1/PD-1) drug class.</population>

          <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs) in the Dose-escalation, Dose-exploration, and Dose-expansion Phase</title>
          <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. The TEAEs are defined as events present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug.</description>
          <population>As-treated population included all participants who received any dose of study drug. Participants enrolled in the 10 mg/kg Q2W Expansion and Escalation Cohort have been summarized as a total only. This is because the safety profile of durvalumab monotherapy 10 mg/kg Q2W was manageable and generally consistent with the known safety profile of the anti-programmed cell death ligand (PD-L1/PD-1) drug class.</population>

        <description>The ORR assessed by BICR in participants with non-squamous NSCLC who had received 2 or more prior lines of therapy is reported. The ORR is defined as best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). The CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. A confirmed CR is defined as two CRs that were separated by at least 28 days with no evidence of progression in-between. The PR is defined as &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline) and no new nontarget lesion. A confirmed PR is defined as two PRs or an un-confirmed PR and an un-confirmed CR that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between.</description>

          <description>The ORR assessed by BICR in participants with squamous NSCLC who had received 1 and 2 or more prior lines of therapy is reported. The ORR is defined as BOR of confirmed CR or confirmed PR based on RECIST v1.1. The CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. A confirmed CR is defined as two CRs that were separated by at least 28 days with no evidence of progression in-between. The PR is defined as &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline) and no new nontarget lesion. A confirmed PR is defined as two PRs or an un-confirmed PR and an un-confirmed CR that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between.</description>

        <description>The BOR assessed by BICR based on RECIST v1.1 in NSCLC and SCCHN cohorts is reported. The BOR includes CR, PR, stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), and non-evaluable (NE). The CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. The PR is defined as &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline) and no new nontarget lesion. The PD is defined at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline) and/or new lesion. The SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression. The NE is defined as either when no or only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment.</description>

The BOR includes CR, PR, stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), and non-evaluable (NE). The CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. The PR is defined as &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline) and no new nontarget lesion. The PD is defined at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline) and/or new lesion. The SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression. The NE is defined as either when no or only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment.</description>
          <population>Participants in FAS population with NSCLC and SCCHN were analyzed. FAS population included all participants who received any dose of study drug, had measurable disease at baseline (Day 1) per BICR and were followed for at least 24 weeks by 16Oct2017.</population>

        <description>The DoR assessed by BICR in NSCLC and SCCHN cohorts is reported. The DoR is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response (OR) (confirmed CR or confirmed PR) to the first documented disease progression based on RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. A confirmed CR is defined as two CRs (disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions) that were separated by at least 28 days with no evidence of progression in-between. A confirmed PR is defined as two PRs (&gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to baseline and no new non-target lesion) or an un-confirmed PR and an un-confirmed CR that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between. The DoR was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
        <time_frame>From Day 1 through disease progression, study withdrawal, or initiation of another anticancer therapy, whichever occurred first (approximately 5.25 years)</time_frame>
        <population>Participants in FAS population with NSCLC and SCCHN were analyzed. FAS population included all participants who received any dose of study drug, had measurable disease at baseline (Day 1) per BICR and were followed for at least 24 weeks by 16Oct2017. The DoR was analyzed for those participants who achieved OR.</population>

        <description>Percentage of participants with disease control assessed by BICR in NSCLC and SCCHN cohorts is reported. Disease control is defined as a BOR of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or SD based on RECIST v1.1. A confirmed CR is defined as two CRs (disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions) that were separated by at least 28 days with no evidence of progression in-between. A confirmed PR is defined as two PRs (&gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to baseline and no new non-target lesion) or an un-confirmed PR and an unconfirmed CR that were separated by at least 28 days with no evidence of progression in-between. The SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression.</description>

        <description>The PFS assessed by BICR in NSCLC cohort is reported. The PFS is defined as the time from the start of study treatment until the first documentation of disease progression based on RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. The PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study; the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. The PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <description>The ORR assessed by BICR in UC cohort is reported. The ORR is defined as confirmed CR or confirmed PR based on RECIST v1.1. The CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. A confirmed CR is defined as two CRs that were separated by at least 28 days with no evidence of progression in-between. The PR is defined as &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline) and no new nontarget lesion. A confirmed PR is defined as two PRs or an un-confirmed PR and an un-confirmed CR that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between.</description>

        <title>DoR Assessed by BICR in UC Cohort (PD-L1 Low/Negative, Total, and PD-L1 High) in the Dose-expansion Phase</title>
        <description>The DoR assessed by BICR in UC cohort is reported. The DoR is defined as the duration from the first documentation of OR (confirmed CR or confirmed PR) to the first documented disease progression based on RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. A confirmed CR is defined as two CRs (disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions) that were separated by at least 28 days with no evidence of progression in-between. A confirmed PR is defined as two PRs (&gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to baseline and no new non-target lesion) or an un-confirmed PR and an un-confirmed CR that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between. The DoR was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <description>The PFS assessed by BICR in UC cohort is reported. The PFS is defined as the time from the start of study treatment until the first documentation of disease progression based on RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. The PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study; the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. The PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
