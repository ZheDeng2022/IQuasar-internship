  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study investigating the relationship between vitamin D and peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy (PN) among multiple myeloma (MM) patients treated with either bortezomib or&#xD;
      thalidomide. The study consists of a screening period of up to 14 days, followed by a single&#xD;
      assessment visit to evaluate vitamin D levels, incidence and severity of PN, neuropathic&#xD;
      pain, and markers of depression. Patient charts will also be utilized to assess the frequency&#xD;
      of skeletal-related events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 10% of myeloma patients present at diagnosis with clinical neuropathy although&#xD;
      studies reveal as many as 1/3 may have abnormal electrophysiological examinations. Baseline&#xD;
      neuropathic abnormal findings are exacerbated by many myeloma treatments, especially&#xD;
      bortezomib, thalidomide, and to a lesser extent lenalidomide. Several studies suggest that&#xD;
      vitamin D supplementation may help reduce the symptoms of neuropathy.In this prospective&#xD;
      study, we will investigate the relationship between vitamin D and PN among MM patients&#xD;
      treated with either bortezomib or thalidomide. The study consists of a screening period of up&#xD;
      to 14 days, followed by a single assessment visit to evaluate vitamin D levels, incidence and&#xD;
      severity of PN, neuropathic pain, and markers of depression. Patient charts will also be&#xD;
      utilized to assess the frequency of skeletal-related events.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure&#xD;
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn&#xD;
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior diagnosis of multiple myeloma based on standard criteria (Durie 1986)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received consecutive, prior treatment for MM with a regimen consisting of at least 16&#xD;
             consecutive weeks of bortezomib or 16 consecutive weeks of thalidomide prior to the&#xD;
             Day of Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The 16 weeks of consecutive treatment must have included at least one of the following&#xD;
             doses and schedules:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bortezomib: ≥ 1.0 mg/m² dosed 3 or more times per each 4-week period&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Thalidomide: ≥ 50 mg/day dosed daily&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The qualifying regimen may include both bortezomib and thalidomide. However, the above&#xD;
             inclusion requirements need only be satisfied by either one of the agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plasma cell dyscrasia with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal&#xD;
             protein (M-protein) and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome (Bardwick 1980)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plasma cell leukemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary amyloidosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vitamin D level assessment occurring within the 12 months preceding the Day of&#xD;
             Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vitamin D non-dietary oral supplementation &gt; 1200 IU per day for &gt; 30 total days&#xD;
             within the 12 month period preceding the Day of Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this&#xD;
             clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that&#xD;
             would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the&#xD;
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds&#xD;
