      The Purpose of the Protein Study is to investigate whether a reduced protein diet can inhibit&#xD;
      the growth of prostate cancer in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators hypothesis is that a reduced protein diet will inhibit expression of genes&#xD;
      that are involved in the growth of prostate cancer.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether or not a low protein diet has an&#xD;
      inhibitory effect on prostate cancer cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures relative to the investigators primary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Group 1 the expression of genes and proteins of the PI-3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. For Group 2&#xD;
      the PSA values obtained every three months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        group 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient must have a diagnosis of prostate cancer confirmed by pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient must be scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy no sooner than 6 weeks from&#xD;
             date of enrollment (to allow for a minimum of 4 weeks on the low protein diet).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient must have adequate baseline protein intake (screening 4-day food record shows&#xD;
             protein &gt; 1.0 g/kg FFM)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient must be able to understand the English-language instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient must be able to comply with the low protein diet (as evaluated by the&#xD;
             dietitian and other study team members).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign an IRB-approved written&#xD;
             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5.2.2 Inclusion Criteria - Group 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient must have a diagnosis of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient must have previously undergone a radical prostatectomy for treatment of&#xD;
             prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient must have a detectable PSA (defined as PSA ≥ 0.1) in at least two consecutive&#xD;
             measurements, taken at least one month apart, with no therapy between the PSA&#xD;
             measurements. If the patient has had additional therapy after the radical&#xD;
             prostatectomy, there must be evidence of a rising PSA (i.e., two consecutive&#xD;
             measurements at least one month apart) after the patient has completed the intervening&#xD;
             therapy (meaning that the patient must have failed treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient must have adequate baseline protein intake (screening 4-day food record shows&#xD;
             protein &gt; 1.0 g/kg FFM).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient must have adequate baseline caloric intake (screening 4-day food record shows&#xD;
             caloric intake of &gt; 1500 kcal/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient must be able to understand the English-language instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient must be able to comply with the low protein diet (as evaluated by the&#xD;
             dietitian and other study team members).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign an IRB-approved written&#xD;
             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient must not currently be receiving any therapy for prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient must not have any serious chronic illness such as unstable angina, any&#xD;
             uncontrolled metabolic disorder, or any immunologic disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient must not have a history of any previous malignancy (with the exception of&#xD;
             squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin) in the 5 years prior to enrollment (for&#xD;
             Group 1) or 12 months prior to enrollment (for Group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient must not have a previous history of a stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient must not be taking any medications that might confound the study results&#xD;
             (anabolic agents (such as androgen, androgen precursor, rhGH) in the 6 months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment; corticosteroids (other than nasal) in the 6 months prior to enrollment; or&#xD;
             finasteride or dutasteride).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient must not have dementia or any other cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient must not have a lifestyle or fixed diet pattern that would interfere with&#xD;
             participation in or interpretation of the results of this study&#xD;
