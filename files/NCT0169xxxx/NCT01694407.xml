    <textblock>
      This prospective, double-blinded, randomized, parallel cohort study will examine the genital&#xD;
      and systemic safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), disintegration and&#xD;
      disappearance times, and acceptability of four vaginal tablets: 1) Tenofovir (TFV) alone; 2)&#xD;
      Emtricitabine (FTC) alone; 3) TFV combined with FTC; and 4) placebo. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to treatment group, to number of tablets to be inserted in the Single Use Phase (1&#xD;
      tablet or 1 tablet followed by a second tablet two hours later to mimic the BAT24 dosing&#xD;
      regimen), and to one of four collection time points (2, 4, 6, or 24 hours after tablet&#xD;
      insertion) for assessments only after the last dose of the Multiple Use Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Single Use Phase of the study, the participant will insert one tablet in the clinic to&#xD;
      estimate times to disintegration and disappearance. Those randomized to two tablets will&#xD;
      insert a second tablet 2 hours later. In all women, sample collection will occur 5 hours&#xD;
      after the initial tablet insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Multiple Use Phase of the study, participants will insert a tablet once daily for 14&#xD;
      days. The 1st, 7th, and 14th tablets will be inserted in the clinic; the remaining tablets&#xD;
      will be inserted at home. The clinic will call the participant on day 3 of the multiple use&#xD;
      phase to ask about any symptoms the participant may be experiencing. Each insertion in the&#xD;
      clinic will be followed by sample collection and, at Visits 4 and 6, colposcopy at the&#xD;
      participant's assigned time point.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess genital safety after a single use (consisting of one tablet in half of&#xD;
           participants and one tablet followed by a second tablet two hours later in the other&#xD;
           half) and during and after two weeks of daily tablet use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess systemic safety after two weeks of daily tablet use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of TFV and FTC after a single use (as defined above)&#xD;
           and during and after two weeks of daily tablet use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the time needed for tablet disintegration and the time needed for full&#xD;
           tablet disappearance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess acceptability of the tablet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess indicators of the pharmacodynamics (PD) of TFV and FTC in vitro using&#xD;
           biological samples (fluids) from study participants obtained before use, after a single&#xD;
           (use as define above), and after two weeks of daily tablet use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory:&#xD;
&#xD;
      •To assess exploratory indicators of the PD of TFV and FTC in vitro using biological samples&#xD;
      (tissues) from study participants obtained before use, after a single use (as defined above),&#xD;
