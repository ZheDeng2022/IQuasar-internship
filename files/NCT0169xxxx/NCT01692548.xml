    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental disorders&#xD;
      among children. It is associated with an important burden to individuals, their families and&#xD;
      society. ADHD is a chronic condition and the majority of affected individuals presents&#xD;
      symptoms and associated functional deficit through adult life. Although pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment can be easily implemented and are short-term effective, its efficacy tends to&#xD;
      decrease with time and long-term effects are uncertain. Psychosocial treatments tend to be&#xD;
      effective only during treatment delivery and treatment effects are not sustained. New&#xD;
      treatment strategies are required in order to provide better care to ADHD patients. Early&#xD;
      interventions might avoid the development of the disorder, limit its persistency or prevent&#xD;
      associated deficits. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological intervention for children at risk for ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled clinical trial has the aim of testing the efficacy of&#xD;
      neurofeedback for children at increased risk for ADHD (subclinical ADHD symptoms). This is&#xD;
      study is a multisite school based trial. Forty children from the 1st to the 4th grade with&#xD;
      subclinical ADHD symptoms will be randomized to neurofeedback or waiting list. Subclinical&#xD;
      ADHD will be defined as having 3-5 out of 9 inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity&#xD;
      symptoms according to parents clinical evaluation (K-SADS-PL) but less than 6 symptoms&#xD;
      according to teachers report (assessed using SNAP-IV) OR 3-5 symptoms according to teachers&#xD;
      report and less than 6 according to parents clinical evaluation. Exclusion criteria includes&#xD;
      IQ lower than 80, severe mental disorder or neurological disease. Treatment will comprise 25&#xD;
      sessions of NF using Slow Cortical Potential training. Children will be invited to attend 2&#xD;
      sessions per week, each session comprises 4 blocs of 20 trials with both activation and&#xD;
      deactivation challenges. Eldith Tharaprax equipment will be used in both sites. The study,&#xD;
      including treatment sessions, will be conducted in schools. Two public schools were selected&#xD;
      to host the study, one in São Paulo and another in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Main outcome will be&#xD;
      parents rating scores for ADHD symptoms (SWAN questionnaire). To avoid bias due to the low&#xD;
      literacy of our population, parents will be assisted by a staff member to fill the SWANs&#xD;
      questionnaires. Second outcomes includes: 1) Performance on computerized tests designed to&#xD;
      measures time processing, basic processing, inhibitory control and executive function and&#xD;
      delay aversion and 2) Pre- post treatment differences on electrophysiological measures (evoke&#xD;
      related potentials during two tasks that requires sustained attention, self-monitoring and&#xD;
      response to attentional prime); 3) conversion to ADHD (incident cases). Outcomes measures&#xD;
      will be assessed prior to treatment start, in after the 13 session, soon after the 25&#xD;
      session, after 6 months of follow-up. Random regression will be used to model each subject's&#xD;
      response against time (from baseline to session 12 and from 12th session to treatment end).&#xD;
      For continuous variables we will compare the average slope of the regression line across the&#xD;
      two groups to test whether the intervention is superior to waiting-list. Proportion of new&#xD;
      cases will be compared across groups using chi square test.&#xD;
