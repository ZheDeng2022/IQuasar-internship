  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, beta blockers have been used for migraine prophylaxis, but in later years also&#xD;
      antiepileptic drugs. Contraindications and side effects have to some degree limited their&#xD;
      use, and new prophylactics that can be used by most migraine sufferers and with little side&#xD;
      effects are in demand. One product that may seem to fulfill these requirements is&#xD;
      Acetyl-L-carnitine, which is a dietary supplement and naturally occurs in plants and animals.&#xD;
      L-carnitine is necessary for fatty-acid metabolism and energy production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, no placebo-controlled studies have previously evaluated the efficacy of&#xD;
      Acetyl-L-carnitine in adults with migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of Acetyl-L-carnitine as a&#xD;
      prophylaxis in migraine patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study will be a single-centre double-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled crossover&#xD;
      study with Acetyl-L-carnitine or placebo. We plan to include 72 patients. The follow up&#xD;
      duration will be 36 weeks. The study will be performed according to Good Clinical Practice,&#xD;
      and relying partly on the International Headache Society Guidelines for controlled trials of&#xD;
      drugs in migraine from 2012 and partly on the guidelines divulged by the IHS task force on&#xD;
      trial guidelines for chronic migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a screening visit including a neurological consultation, eligible patients will sign an&#xD;
      informed consent declaration before they enter a 4 week run-in (baseline) period when they&#xD;
      keep a headache diary. After 4 weeks they return for the second visit. If they have had 2 or&#xD;
      more migraine attacks they are allowed to proceed in the study. If they have less than 2&#xD;
      migraine attacks (required for proceeding in the study), they are allowed to extend the&#xD;
      baseline period another 4 weeks. Those who then during the whole 8 week period have on&#xD;
      average 2 or more migraine attacks per month are also allowed to proceed. Otherwise they are&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of the treatment period The duration of each of the two treatment periods is 12&#xD;
      weeks. During each period there will be one telephone contact at the start of each treatment&#xD;
      period to remind patients to start with medicines, and one after 2 weeks to check compliance&#xD;
      and side effects. In the second last week of every treatment period there will be a doctor&#xD;
      and nurse visit with drug accounting and dispensing of new medicines for the next period. At&#xD;
      this visit one will ensure that the patient has just enough medicines left to finish the&#xD;
      period before the wash-out. As recommended in crossover studies, the participants enter a&#xD;
      washout period of 4 weeks between the two treatment periods, to reduce the risk of carryover&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Randomization will be generated using a computerized procedure. A randomization&#xD;
      list containing 72 patient numbers is made before the start of the study, and the patient&#xD;
      number is then indicated on a package with medicines for that patient. The study has a&#xD;
      crossover design, and the two different treatment periods (active or placebo) can arise to&#xD;
      two different treatment sequences (AP or PA). Patients are therefore randomized in blocks of&#xD;
      4 where one of these two treatment sequences is assigned to each patient in random order.&#xD;
      With 72 patients to be included, this means that 18 patients are randomized in each block. In&#xD;
      each block, 50% patients have the treatment sequence AP, and 50% PA in a random order.&#xD;
