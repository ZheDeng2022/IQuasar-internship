      This is a 10-week pilot study for a randomized non-blinded controlled clinical trial to&#xD;
      assess whether use of the Rifton Gait Trainer will improve the incidence of mobilization of&#xD;
      critically ill ventilator dependent patients in the intensive care units (ICUs) and improve&#xD;
      important patient outcomes. The pilot study is designed to assess the feasibility and&#xD;
      logistics of doing a study of this nature in the ICU; it will also provide the means to&#xD;
      obtain estimates of outcome effect sizes, number of repeated measures, time between repeated&#xD;
      measures, and intra-subject and intra-unit correlations, to be used for sample size&#xD;
      calculations.&#xD;

      Background Critical care costs an estimated 90 billion dollars per year in the United States,&#xD;
      comprising approximately 1% of the gross national product.1 Though this expenditure is&#xD;
      enormous, together with advances in critical care medicine and mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      technology, it has produced a priceless trend in decreasing intensive care unit (ICU)&#xD;
      mortality.1 Of all ICU admissions, about 40% require mechanical ventilation, often with&#xD;
      accompanying necessary periods of sedation and inactivity.1 Although more patients are&#xD;
      surviving their ICU stay, it is becoming apparent that our current ICU culture of heavy&#xD;
      sedation and inactivity is taking its toll on the complete recovery of the critically ill&#xD;
      patient. 1,2 Several studies have shown significant disability one year after discharge, as&#xD;
      well as major declines in functional status and health-related quality of life; half of ICU&#xD;
      patients were unable to return to work due to persistent fatigue, weakness, and poor&#xD;
      functional status. 4 The primary contributor was muscle wasting and weakness,5 due to the&#xD;
      prolonged immobilization brought about by illness, lengthy bed rest, deep sedation, and the&#xD;
      use of paralytic agents.6 It is estimated that just a single day of inactivity causes muscle&#xD;
      strength to decrease by 1-1.5%.7 Although 94% of survivors with critical illness&#xD;
      myoneuropathy can demonstrate meaningful clinical recovery of muscle strength 9 months out&#xD;
      from their hospital stay, there are still some patients whose weakness may persist, resulting&#xD;
      in severe and prolonged functional deficits.14,18 To combat the deleterious effects of&#xD;
      inactivity and improve complete recovery, some hospitals have instituted programs under the&#xD;
      rubric early mobility, wherein sedation is reduced and patients are engaged in progressive&#xD;
      levels of activity as soon as physically possible. Early mobilization starts with passive&#xD;
      range of motion exercises, then progresses to active range of motion, sitting, standing, and,&#xD;
      finally, walking. Early mobility in the ICU has been proposed as a crucial instrument in&#xD;
      muscle preservation and protection from neuropathy of critical illness, thereby decreasing&#xD;
      long-term morbidity and physical debilitation.18&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing body of evidence indicating that early mobilization of ventilated patients&#xD;
      can have a significant positive impact on length of stay, muscle condition, and the patient's&#xD;
      overall sense of well-being. The use of early mobility in patients with respiratory failure&#xD;
      has been proven safe with the implementation of proper monitoring in a physiologically stable&#xD;
      and awake patient.2 Hopkins et al. implemented an early activity program and demonstrated a&#xD;
      decline in length of ICU stay of 3 days.1 Morris et al. implemented a similar early&#xD;
      mobilization program that showed a statistically significant decrease in the length of stay&#xD;
      in the ICU (6.9 vs. 5.5 days, P=0.025) as well as in the hospital (14.5 vs. 11.2 days,&#xD;
      P=0.006); in addition there was a notable trend towards decreased inpatient cost per patient&#xD;
      ($44,302 vs. $41,142, P=0.262).19 Schweikert et al. were able to demonstrate that patients&#xD;
      who had undergone early mobilization had a greater rate of return to independent functional&#xD;
      status at hospital discharge (59% vs. 35%, P=0.02).20 These studies have demonstrated the&#xD;
      ability to increase mobilization, improve physical function, and decrease ICU resource&#xD;
      utilization within a relatively short period of time with an appropriate change in routine&#xD;
      clinical practice.12&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, there exist significant barriers to the implementation of an early mobility&#xD;
      program. The most significant and pervasive of these barriers is cultural-the perception that&#xD;
      the critically ill patient cannot tolerate physical activity. This barrier, however, is&#xD;
      rapidly dissolving with the mounting evidence noted above. The demonstrated benefits of early&#xD;
      mobility have prompted increasing numbers of institutions to develop their own early mobility&#xD;
      protocols and attempt their implementation. Once the cultural barriers are overcome, however,&#xD;
      additional barriers appear. Thus, implementation has been slow and spotty. In a multisite&#xD;
      study, only 27% of patients with acute lung injury received any form of physical therapy in&#xD;
      the ICU, with treatments occurring only 6% of those days.22 These barriers involved: 1)&#xD;
      providing safety guarantees, 2) accommodating staffing models, and 3) finding the right&#xD;
      hardware. With regard to safety guarantees, there exist legitimate fears regarding possible&#xD;
      harm to the patient in the process of mobilization, either secondary to patient falls, or&#xD;
      unintentional removal of lines, feeding or drainage tubes, or endotracheal tubes. Safe&#xD;
      mechanical support is needed for the patient, to the point of full body-weight support. The&#xD;
      staffing model is also critical: the mobilization of one ventilated patient requires, in&#xD;
      addition to a physical therapist, at least three staff members to move medical equipment&#xD;
      while the patient walks.11, 21 Although on a given day, within a 20-bed ICU, only two&#xD;
      patients might qualify for assisted walking, and would require only four 15-minute periods&#xD;
      from a 5-member mobility team per day, the logistics of assembling that team from the ICU&#xD;
      staff are often prohibitive. Finally with regard to finding appropriate hardware, the&#xD;
      management and transport of medical equipment alongside the walking patient is not easily&#xD;
      addressed with rolling poles and carts. The current standard of care for walking a&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated patient consists of a wheeled walker held onto by the patient, the&#xD;
      patient supported with a gait belt held from behind by a physical therapist, and 4-5 staff&#xD;
      persons in attendance to guide the patient, roll the equipment, and be ready to &quot;pick up&quot;&#xD;
      should the patient fall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an alternative to the front-wheeled walker, the Rifton Gait Trainer has been introduced&#xD;
      into clinical practice. This device provides greater inherent safety features via a pelvic&#xD;
      harness that keeps the patient from falling, even if their legs should give out while&#xD;
      walking. In addition, there is a chest piece to keep patients from tipping forward or&#xD;
      backward, and there are higher handholds to help patients mobilize more easily. The Rifton&#xD;
      Gait Trainer addresses two of the three above listed barriers by providing more inherent&#xD;
      safety features through better hardware, and it may also help decrease the number of staff&#xD;
      required to mobilize patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose The following sections describe a 10-week pilot study for a randomized non-blinded&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial to assess whether use of the Rifton Gait Trainer will improve the&#xD;
      incidence of mobilization of critically ill ventilator dependent patients in the intensive&#xD;
      care units (ICUs) and improve important patient outcomes. The pilot study is designed to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility and logistics of doing a study of this nature in the ICU; it will also&#xD;
      provide the means to obtain estimates of outcome effect sizes, number of repeated measures,&#xD;
      time between repeated measures, and intra-subject and intra-unit correlations, to be used for&#xD;
      sample size calculations for a multi-center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Approximately forty subjects will be randomized to use either the RGT or the FWW,&#xD;
      with enrollment spanning a period of approximately 10 weeks. Patients will be deemed eligible&#xD;
      to ambulate based on their daily mobility score, as calculated according to the Early&#xD;
      Mobility Protocol. Mobility scores are first determined based on level of consciousness. The&#xD;
      unconscious patient has the lowest mobility level, Level 1. Patients who are conscious but&#xD;
      have a low RASS score (-2) are considered a Level 2. Conscious patients are considered to be&#xD;
      Level 3 or 4. Level 4 patients are those patients who have proven that they can master all&#xD;
      the activities outlined for Level 3 mobility; that is, they can dangle at the bedside and&#xD;
      stand and pivot to a chair. Level 4 activities are separated from Level 3 activities only by&#xD;
      the ability to walk in the hallway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will occur prior to randomization. Randomization will occur when patients&#xD;
      have been on the ventilator &gt; 2 days and have mobility scores eligible for walking.&#xD;
      Randomization will be assigned on a 1:1 ratio to either the RGT or FWW. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized using a web-based system called CREDIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis A future study will be considered feasible if we are able to enroll 60% of&#xD;
      eligible patients, have records for 90% of eligible ambulation days, and at least 85% of&#xD;
      required data fields are completed as designed. Analysis will be based on intention-to-treat;&#xD;
      that is, regardless of which walker is actually used, the patient will be analyzed in the&#xD;
      group to which he or she was randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure, how many times the patient is mobilized each day, will be&#xD;
      compared between devices using a hierarchical generalized linear model with number of times&#xD;
      the patient is mobilized each day as the dependent variable, device, unit and day and an&#xD;
      interaction of device with day as the independent variables, and subject as the random effect&#xD;
      in the model. Most likely, ordinal regression will be used with 0, 1, 2 or more times as the&#xD;
      definition of outcome. If there are too few occurrences of 2 or more, we will convert to a&#xD;
      logistic model. If one device is better than the other, we would expect the odds of being&#xD;
      mobilized at a higher level with RGT is significantly different from the odds of being&#xD;
      mobilized with FWW. We will also test for the interaction of device with time.&#xD;
