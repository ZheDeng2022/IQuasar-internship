      This clinical trial studies whether screening methods used to diagnose cancer of the&#xD;
      prostate, lung, colon, rectum, or ovaries can reduce deaths from these cancers. Screening&#xD;
      tests may help doctors find cancer cells early and plan better treatment for lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether screening with chest x-ray can reduce mortality from lung cancer in&#xD;
      women and men aged 55-74 at entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess screening variables, other than mortality, for each of the interventions&#xD;
      including sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the incidence, stage, and survival of cancer cases. III. To investigate the&#xD;
      mortality predictive value of biologic and/or prognostic characterizations of tumor tissue as&#xD;
      intermediate endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To conduct biomolecular and genetic research into factors associated with cancer&#xD;
      carcinogenesis and promotion, as well as the early detection of these factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants in the overall PLCO study are stratified by screening center, gender,&#xD;
      and age (55-59 vs 60-64 vs 65-69 vs 70-74). Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms&#xD;
      (control vs screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I (Control): Participants receive standard medical care. Participants complete a Diet&#xD;
      History Questionnaire (DHQ) at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (Lung Screening): Participants undergo a chest x-ray (one postero-anterior view) at&#xD;
      baseline and annually for 2 years. Participants classified as &quot;smokers&quot; undergo an additional&#xD;
      chest x-ray at year 3. A scheduling and tracking procedure is implemented to ensure regular&#xD;
      attendance at repeat screens for participants screened negative or for those who are&#xD;
      designated suspicious or positive at screening but for whom subsequent diagnostic procedures&#xD;
      do not reveal lung cancer (follow-up diagnostic procedures are through their own medical care&#xD;
      environment). Participants diagnosed with lung cancer via a screening test are referred for&#xD;
      treatment in accordance with current accepted practice for appropriate stage of disease,&#xD;
      patient age, and medical condition; a procedure is provided for contact with qualified&#xD;
      medical personnel to insure appropriate therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete a Baseline Questionnaire (BQF/M) to assess smoking status. Participants&#xD;
      complete a Dietary Questionnaire (DQX) at baseline and DHQ at year 3. An Annual Study Update&#xD;
      (ADU) (previously referred to as the Periodic Survey of Health [PSH] questionnaire) is mailed&#xD;
      to each participant annually for 13 years to identify all prevalent and incident lung cancers&#xD;
      as all deaths that occur among both screened and control subjects during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of screening, participants are followed up for at least 13 years.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women who at the time of randomization are less than 55 or greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 75 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals undergoing treatment for cancer at this time, excluding basal-cell and&#xD;
             squamous-cell skin cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with known prior cancer of the colon, rectum, lung, prostate (men only) or&#xD;
             ovary (women only)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  This includes primary or metastatic PLCO cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with previous surgical removal of the entire colon, one lung, or the&#xD;
             entire prostate (men only)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Until October 1996, women with previous surgical removal of both ovaries were&#xD;
                  excluded from the trial. In order to increase the enrollment of women into the&#xD;
                  trial, beginning in October 1996, these women were no longer excluded for this&#xD;
                  reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are participating in another cancer screening or cancer primary&#xD;
             prevention trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males who have taken Proscar/Propecia/finasteride in the past 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Individuals who are already enrolled in the trial when their physician&#xD;
                  prescribes finasteride are not prevented from taking this medication. As a&#xD;
                  result, these participants will continue to be screened and followed just as&#xD;
                  those participants who are not on finasteride.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Men who are taking Tamoxifen are not excluded from any part of the PLCO&#xD;
                  Screening Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior to April 1, 1999 women were excluded from the trial if they were currently&#xD;
                  taking or had taken Tamoxifen or Evista\Raloxifene in the past 6 months. As of&#xD;
                  April 1999 based on a decision from the PLCO Ovary Subcommittee, women who have&#xD;
                  or are currently taking Tamoxifen or Evista\Raloxifene are not excluded from&#xD;
                  participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are unwilling or unable to sign the informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males who have had more than one PSA blood test in the past three years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who have had a colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, or barium enema in the past&#xD;
             three years&#xD;
