    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to asses the efficacy and the clinical safety of the transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic resonance guided high intensity focused ultrasound system ExAblate 4000, InSightec&#xD;
      Ltd. for functional neurosurgery in the treatment of movement disorders. The treatments to be&#xD;
      conducted in this study are non-invasive, i.e. without opening the skull, and will create&#xD;
      microthalamotomies in specific target areas such as thalamus, subthalamus and pallidum. The&#xD;
      data obtained in this study will be used to evaluate the basic safety aspects of this new&#xD;
      treatment technology and will serve as a basis for the clinical introduction of MR-guided&#xD;
      ultrasound neurosurgery.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who are able and willing to give consent and able to attend all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of a MD, such as Essential Tremor (ET), Idiopathic Parkinson's diseases or&#xD;
             primary Dystonia as confirmed from clinical history and examination by a movement&#xD;
             disorder neurologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A MD refractory to adequate medical treatment, or in whom the indication for Deep&#xD;
             Brain Stimulation (DBS) would be given, but DBS cannot be performed because of medical&#xD;
             comorbidities or medical reasons, or because the patient clearly confirms by written&#xD;
             statement that he does not want to undergo DBS for personal reasons (PD: increasing&#xD;
             motor fluctuations albeit optimal medical treatment &amp; unbearable side effects of&#xD;
             medication; ET: failure of adequate tremor control with Propranolol and Primidone&#xD;
             alone and in combination; Dystonia: dystonia or pain not controlled by oral&#xD;
             medication). An adequate medication trial is defined as a therapeutic dose of each&#xD;
             medication or the development of side effects as the medication dose is titrated.&#xD;

          -  Either the medial thalamic nuclei or the subthalamic or pallidal areas can be target&#xD;
             by the ExAblate device. The target region must be apparent on MRI such that targeting&#xD;
             can be performed with either direct visualization or by measurement from landmarks,&#xD;
             using the &quot;Stereotactic Atlas of the Human Thalamus and Basal Ganglia&quot; by Anne Morel,&#xD;
             39 analogous to our first clinical FUS study on patients with chronic pain 33.&#xD;
