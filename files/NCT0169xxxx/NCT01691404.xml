  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flavonoid-rich foods such as tea and cocoa have been identified as having a blood&#xD;
      pressure-lowering effect. Part of this effect is thought to be due to the flavonoid content&#xD;
      of these foods although it is currently unknown which flavonoids play a role. Epicatechin is&#xD;
      one the major flavonoids in cocoa while quercetin is largely found in tea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study the investigators plan to investigate the effects of pure epicatechin and&#xD;
      quercetin supplementation on vascular function and blood pressure in untreated&#xD;
      (prehypertensive) subjects by way of a three-armed double-blind crossover intervention.&#xD;
      Participants will sequentially consume supplements containing quercetin, epicatechin or&#xD;
      placebo for a period of 4 weeks. Before and after this 4 week period, measurements of&#xD;
      vascular function and blood pressure will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the supplementation of epicatechin and quercetin will&#xD;
      improve vascular function and blood pressure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By means of a three-armed double-blind crossover intervention, the effects of pure flavonoid&#xD;
      supplementation will be investigated. The products under investigation will be epicatechin&#xD;
      and quercetin-3-glucoside. Subjects will be asked to consume either 160mg of&#xD;
      quercetin-3-glucoside, 100mg of epicatechin or a placebo capsule for a period of 4 weeks.&#xD;
      Measurements of vascular function and blood pressure will be taken before and after each&#xD;
      4-week intervention period. A 4-week washout period will be planned between each&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of vascular function will include flow-mediated dilation, pulse wave analysis,&#xD;
      pulse wave velocity and vasomotion as well as biomarkers of inflammation and vascular&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
