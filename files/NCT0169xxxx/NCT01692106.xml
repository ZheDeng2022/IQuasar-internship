      This study evaluates the feasibility of endoscopic myotomy for achalasia. In achalasia, there&#xD;
      is loss of relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), as well as a higher baseline&#xD;
      pressure in the LES. The most widespread treatment for this disease and the one that has the&#xD;
      best long term results involves cutting the muscle layers of the lower esophagus and on the&#xD;
      neighbouring stomach without injurying the underlying mucosa or inner layer of the esophageal&#xD;
      wall. This is done during a surgery through the abdomen either with a big incision or more&#xD;
      recently with the keyhole technique. This surgery has various potential complications, one of&#xD;
      which being making a hole through the mucosa or not extending the cut on the muscle long&#xD;
      enough to obtain adequate relaxation of the sphincter. The per oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM)&#xD;
      is a new intervention that is done also under general anesthesia in the operating room;&#xD;
      however, it involves no skin incisions and all the procedure is done through a fiber optic&#xD;
      camera. It involves making a cut in the inner layer of the esophagus and then with cautery&#xD;
      cut the muscle fibers responsible of the blockage and finally closing the initial opening&#xD;
      with clips. In this study we will investigate the feasibility of this intervention both from&#xD;
      a technical aspect as well as a logistical perspective given the local operating room&#xD;
      constraints.&#xD;

      All patients will have routine pre-operative EGD, manometry, barium swallow, ph-metry.&#xD;
      Equally all patients will undergo Eckardt's and grading systems of symptom severity before&#xD;
      and after the intervention. The patients will have a gastro-graffin swallow in the first day&#xD;
      after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Under general anesthesia upper endoscopy is performed using a standard single&#xD;
      channel gastroscope. Submucosal injection with 10 ml saline with 1% methylen blue at the&#xD;
      level of the mid esophagus is initially performed. A small longitudinal submucosal incision&#xD;
      is created using a standard needle knife. For a sufficient entry point as well as submucosal&#xD;
      tunnel, a dilating balloon is inserted submucosally via the created incision similar to the&#xD;
      technique used in standard endoscopic submucosal dissection. The balloon is slightly inflated&#xD;
      to allow sufficient entrance of the endoscope. The gastroscope is advanced into the&#xD;
      submucosal space and the tunnel is created via needle knife or blunt dissection as&#xD;
      appropriate. The tunnel is created distally and is stopped several centimeters beyond the&#xD;
      lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which can easily be identified. Using flexible scissors, a&#xD;
      triangle tip- or respectively an isolated tip-knife the clearly visible circular muscles are&#xD;
      divided starting 4 cm above the LES extending 2 cm beyond the previously identified&#xD;
      esophageal border. The longitudinal and serosal layers are left intact. Finally the mucosal&#xD;
      entry is closed with standard endoscopic clips. Patients will receive standard postoperative&#xD;
      care for surgical myotomy, including long-term follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If for any reason the endoscopic treatment is unable to be completed or infeasible, a&#xD;
      standard laparoscopic treatment will be performed.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be consecutively evaluated on effectiveness of the endoluminal procedure by conducting standard diagnostics including postoperative gastrografin swallow. After 6 months standard esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), high-resolution manometry and pH impedance will be done and a Quality of Life questionnaire will be filled out. Results will be compared to historical data of 40 conventional laparoscopic Heller myotomies.</description>
