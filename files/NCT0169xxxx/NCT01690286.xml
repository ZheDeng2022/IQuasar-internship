  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of repeated twice-daily administration&#xD;
      of 200 mg ketoconazole on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of JNJ-38518168.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-sequence,&#xD;
      randomized (dose of JNJ-38518168 (3 mg or 30 mg) is assigned by chance), single-center,&#xD;
      multiple-dose study designed to assess the potential effects of multiple oral administration&#xD;
      of ketoconazole (KTZ) on the steady-state (a situation where the overall intake of a drug is&#xD;
      in equilibrium with its elimination) pharmacokinetics of JNJ-38518168. Pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      explores how the drug is absorbed in the body, distributed within the body, and how it is&#xD;
      removed from the body over time. The study consists of 3 phases: a Screening Phase of&#xD;
      approximately 3 weeks (Days -22 to -2); an Open-Label Phase (Days -1 to 26); and a Follow-up&#xD;
      Phase occurring from 7 to 10 days after the last dose of study drug. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive either a daily dose of 3 mg JNJ-38518168 (Group 1) or a daily&#xD;
      dose of 30 mg JNJ-38518168 (Group 2) orally administered for 25 days. All participants will&#xD;
      receive multiple oral doses of KTZ (200 mg every 12 hours for both Groups 1 and 2) from Day&#xD;
      22 through Day 25. An optional group of participants receiving 10 mg once daily of&#xD;
      JNJ-38518168 (Group 3) may be evaluated if the data from Groups 1 and 2 do not allow the&#xD;
      sponsor to estimate sufficiently the interaction between KTZ and daily dose of 10 mg&#xD;
      JNJ-38518168. The participants will receive an oral dose of the study drugs in the morning of&#xD;
      specified days, after an overnight fast for at least 10 hours. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected at various times throughout the study for evaluation of drug concentrations in&#xD;
      plasma. Safety will be assessed by reporting of adverse events, vital signs, physical&#xD;
      examination results, weight, and electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluations. Participants will leave&#xD;
      the study center on Day 26 after the collection of the last scheduled PK blood sample. For&#xD;
      each participant, a follow-up visit will occur 7 to 10 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
      drug. For each participant, the total duration of the study is approximately 8 weeks.&#xD;
