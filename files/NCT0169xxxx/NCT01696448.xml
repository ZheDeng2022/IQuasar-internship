  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Though medical treatment has been effective in the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases&#xD;
      (including coronary atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus), the incidence of these disorders&#xD;
      continues to be high. Many reasons are responsible, but lifestyle changes, including an&#xD;
      increased prevalence of obesity and the metabolic syndrome, are significant for this cause.&#xD;
      Diagnosis and treatment of obese patients with hypertension requires that health care&#xD;
      providers address the issues of hypertension, glucose intolerance, body weight and&#xD;
      dyslipidemia. A sedentary lifestyle and poor cardiorespiratory fitness are not only&#xD;
      associated with the (cardio) metabolic syndrome but could actually be considered features of&#xD;
      the metabolic syndrome. These issues are significant in the health of certain individuals,&#xD;
      who experience greater difficulty in treated BP control, experience increased hypertensive&#xD;
      and diabetic complications, and have higher levels of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of the nutritional supplements&#xD;
      berberine, alpha-lipoic acid, and picrorhiza (CAR-191) when consumed 30 minutes before meals,&#xD;
      on appetite suppression, body composition and weight control. Additionally, the investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate the effects of this combination of nutraceuticals on the mechanistic effects of&#xD;
      oxidation, inflammation, and vascular function in a high-risk population with the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective To assess the comparative effect of a combination (known as CAR-191) of&#xD;
      berberine (200 mg), alpha-lipoic acid (150 mg), and picrorhiza (100 mg) three times a day,&#xD;
      compared to placebo three times a day, on parameters relate to appetite suppression, weight&#xD;
      control and body composition in a high risk population with the metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Co-objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effects of CAR-191 versus placebo on changes in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endothelial function using noninvasive brachial artery reactivity (BAR) ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biomarkers including IL-6, HOMA-IR, HbA1C, hsCRP, adiponectin, plasma/urine&#xD;
           isoprostanes, PAI-1, TNFα-II, aldosterone, and glutathione redox ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinary protein excretion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical chemistry including plasma glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total&#xD;
           bilirubin, uric acid, transaminases (SGOT/AST, SGPT/ALT), alkaline phosphatase,&#xD;
           C-reactive protein, and lipoproteins&#xD;

      Though medical treatment has been effective in the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases&#xD;
      (including coronary atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus), the incidence of these disorders&#xD;
      continues to be high. Many reasons are responsible, but lifestyle changes, including an&#xD;
      increased prevalence of obesity and the metabolic syndrome, are significant for this cause.&#xD;
      Recent reported guidelines by the JNC-VII and National Cholesterol Education Panel/ATP-III&#xD;
      suggest that blood pressure reduction is effective in improving the overall quality of life&#xD;
      and may be helpful in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis and treatment of obese patients with hypertension requires that health care&#xD;
      providers address the issues of hypertension, glucose intolerance, body weight and&#xD;
      dyslipidemia. Strategies to promote therapeutic lifestyle change (TLC), specifically&#xD;
      increased physical activity and reduced dietary intake resulting in weight loss, are not as&#xD;
      well defined. A sedentary lifestyle and poor cardiorespiratory fitness are not only&#xD;
      associated with the (cardio) metabolic syndrome but could actually be considered features of&#xD;
      the metabolic syndrome. These issues are significant in the health of certain individuals,&#xD;
      who experience greater difficulty in treated BP control, experience increased hypertensive&#xD;
      and diabetic complications, and have higher levels of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of the nutritional supplements&#xD;
      berberine, alpha-lipoic acid, and picrorhiza (CAR-191) when consumed 30 minutes before meals,&#xD;
      on appetite suppression, body composition and weight control. Additionally, the investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate the effects of this combination of nutraceuticals on the mechanistic effects of&#xD;
      oxidation, inflammation, and vascular function in a high-risk population with the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the initiation of CAR-191 in patients which meet at least 3&#xD;
      of the 5 criteria (ATP-III guidelines) for the cardiometabolic syndrome. The investigators&#xD;
      will determine whether the CAR-191 combination as compared to placebo provides benefit in&#xD;
      appetite suppression, body composition and certain clinical endpoints, including effects on&#xD;
      endothelial function, lipid levels, and glucose control. This study will analyze the effects&#xD;
      of 12 week administration of CAR-191 versus placebo on these parameters in a population of&#xD;
      patients (n=40) with the cardiometabolic syndrome. The study has a parallel design consisting&#xD;
      of 2 weeks of washout and then 12 weeks of treatment to either CAR-191 or placebo. The total&#xD;
      study period is 14 weeks. Patients will be assigned to the CAR-191 or placebo group in a 3:1&#xD;
      ratio so that 30 patients will receive CAR-191 and 10 patients will receive placebo. See&#xD;
      attached study design.&#xD;
