      The goal of this study is to generate unique information to guide improvements on&#xD;
      interventions to reduce maternal and newborn mortality as well as prevent stillbirths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the burden, timing, and causes of maternal&#xD;
      deaths, stillbirths and neonatal deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an observational study where data will be collected retrospectively in the&#xD;
      context of the ongoing study in Haryana, India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women of reproductive age living in the study area have already been enumerated for the&#xD;
      parent studies. Active surveillance is being conducted for identifying pregnancies and deaths&#xD;
      among women of reproductive age in the population through 3 monthly home visitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verbal autopsies will be conducted for all deaths of women in the reproductive age, including&#xD;
      those who died in pregnancy, childbirth and up to 42-60 days after childbirth. Verbal autopsy&#xD;
      interviews will also be conducted for all stillbirths.&#xD;

      RATIONAL &amp; BACKGROUND INFORMATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the Millennium Development Goals, those that aim to reach significant reductions in&#xD;
      maternal and child mortality have been proving the hardest to achieve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most maternal and neonatal deaths are caused by a few conditions, and majority of them are&#xD;
      preventable with currently available, effective interventions. About a third of stillbirths&#xD;
      occur in the intrapartum period, integrally related to the availability and quality of&#xD;
      essential and emergency childbirth services. Effective interventions to reduce maternal&#xD;
      deaths, stillbirths and newborn and child deaths reach less than half the pregnant women,&#xD;
      mothers, newborns and children who need them. Information on mortality and morbidity as well&#xD;
      as health care delivery is largely available only from surveys, which have inherent&#xD;
      methodological issues that limit validity. Vital registration information and reliable&#xD;
      information from the health system is missing in the same countries where the burden of&#xD;
      mortality is the highest and health care is least accessible. This leads to underestimates of&#xD;
      the magnitude of the problem with negative implications for the prioritization of&#xD;
      interventions to scale-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BMGF and WHO are supporting a set of large intervention trials that will follow cohorts&#xD;
      of pregnant women and newborns to document the impact of the interventions. These trials&#xD;
      provide a unique opportunity to address additional questions relevant for improving maternal,&#xD;
      newborn and child health (MNCH) programs and for addressing the above-mentioned gaps in data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES Goal&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a part of the large ongoing parent study on newborn health&#xD;
      research in Haryana, India titled &quot;Efficacy of neonatal vitamin A supplementation in&#xD;
      improving child survival in Haryana, India: generation of evidence necessary for informing&#xD;
      global policy&quot; to better understand the epidemiology of maternal mortality, stillbirths and&#xD;
      neonatal deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is collecting information on the burden, timing and causes of neonatal&#xD;
      deaths and an estimate of maternal deaths and still births. The proposed additional study&#xD;
      presents a unique opportunity to estimate population-based burden, timing, and causes of&#xD;
      maternal deaths and stillbirths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an observational study where data will be collected retrospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in the same study areas and population as the parent study. The&#xD;
      participants in this study will be pregnant women identified through surveillance among all&#xD;
      women of reproductive age in the population where the parent study is being conducted, and&#xD;
      their newborn infants. Some women not eligible for enrollment into the parent study due to&#xD;
      loss of their babies or live babies with exclusion criteria or those who do not give consent&#xD;
      for the parent study or women who died during pregnancy or child birth may still be included&#xD;
      in the AMANHI study. Information on women refusing to take part in the parent studies is&#xD;
      being documented. This information will be used for analysis exploring whether this group has&#xD;
      a different risk of maternal or newborn mortality. Only the control group in the parent study&#xD;
      will be considered for analysis of neonatal deaths in this observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal mortality, pregnancy outcomes and consequent neonatal mortality will be measured&#xD;
      among women identified as pregnant during surveillance and followed-up until 42-60 days after&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The period of data collection for this objective will be 12-24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Estimates&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal mortality, stillbirth rates and neonatal mortality will be estimated for all&#xD;
      pregnant women, mothers and newborns from the time that the site meets the minimum criteria&#xD;
      for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The verbal autopsies will be filled retrospectively for a window period of 1 year for deaths&#xD;
      in women and for still births.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verbal autopsies for neonatal deaths are already being filled in parent study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of study site:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parent study, Neonatal Vitamin A supplementation trial, is being conducted in 16&#xD;
      clusters, of which 13 are catchment areas of Primary Health Centres in Faridabad and Palwal&#xD;
      districts in the state of Haryana and 3 are urban slum clusters in Faridabad district.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active surveillance is being conducted for identifying pregnancies and deaths among women of&#xD;
      reproductive age in the population through 3 monthly home visitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of identification of pregnancy, information is recorded on the details of the&#xD;
      pregnancy including last menstrual period. For women whose infants are enrolled into the&#xD;
      study, information on vital status of the mother is obtained from the 3 monthly follow up&#xD;
      visit and the pregnancy surveillance register retrospectively as well as prospectively for&#xD;
      those infants whose 3 month follow up visits are still due.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For women whose infants are not enrolled due to exclusion criteria or women who had still&#xD;
      births or abortions, visits are made at 42 to 60 days to record information on vital status&#xD;
      of the women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Miscarriages/abortions, stillbirths, live births, neonatal deaths and maternal deaths are&#xD;
      recorded. Verbal autopsies will be conducted for all deaths of women in the reproductive age,&#xD;
      including those who died in pregnancy, childbirth and up to 42-60 days after childbirth for&#xD;
      still births and neonatla death. Sites will use a standardized verbal autopsy questionnaire.&#xD;
      Specially trained workers will conduct verbal autopsies within 3 months of reporting of a&#xD;
      death. For deaths that have already been reported since the initiation of the parent studies,&#xD;
      verbal autopsies can be done within 12 months of death (WHO verbal autopsy standards, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The verbal autopsy instruments have been pre-tested and used extensively in many settings.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the site will translate the questionnaire and pretest it to ensure that the&#xD;
      translated questions capture the intended information. Any changes based on pre-tests will be&#xD;
      made prior to implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study in which pregnant women are being identified and followed up&#xD;
      until the end of the postnatal period to identify stillbirths and maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      deaths as part of the parent studies. A verbal autopsy interview will be conducted for all of&#xD;
      these deaths. There are no direct safety concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval has been obtained from WHO and SAS ERC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent is already being requested from each household to conduct reproductive&#xD;
      surveillance in order to identify pregnant women and periodic follow up. This consent is&#xD;
      verbal and the informed consent form is signed by the member of the research team obtaining&#xD;
      consent to confirm that he/she has accurately read the consent form to the potential&#xD;
      participant/head of household, the individual has had the opportunity to ask questions and&#xD;
      has consented freely. The informed consent forms for verbal autopsies will be confirmed with&#xD;
      a signature or thumbprint by the participant. In the absence of a signature, a witness (other&#xD;
      than the member of the research team obtaining consent) will be asked to sign and counter&#xD;
      signed by the member of the research team obtaining consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      All identifier information will be delinked and identifier information will be stored under&#xD;
      lock and key after the analysis is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on a core set of variables will be collected with standard definitions used&#xD;
      across all sites. The WHO will provide a set of range and consistency checks that must be&#xD;
      applied to these variables, although the exact procedures used to carry out these checks will&#xD;
      be left to the individual sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic data capture or double data entry by separate data entry specialists will be&#xD;
      performed onsite. Alternatively, scanning of forms using special TeleForms software will be&#xD;
      performed. The site will be responsible for initial cleaning of the data, including running&#xD;
      range and consistency checks as well as periodic reviews of distributions and identification&#xD;
      of outliers. The study site will resolve any inconsistencies within their database in&#xD;
      consultation with their field data collection team and with field verification if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the core set of variables from the study site will be sent every 3 months to a&#xD;
      central data repository established for the project at the WHO. The WHO team will run another&#xD;
      set of range and consistency checks including checking of consistency of data quality across&#xD;
      sites. Any inconsistencies or queries will be provided to the study site, which will be&#xD;
      expected to check and address the list of queries and resubmit data. Cleaned data from all&#xD;
      sites will be pooled and stored in a SQL database at the WHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All verbal autopsies will be analyzed using reliable and valid computer-based methods&#xD;
      including the Random Forests, Inter-VA and Tariff methods. The site will conduct the analysis&#xD;
      of their verbal autopsy data in order to determine the causes of deaths for stillbirths and&#xD;
      neonatal and maternal deaths. A data analysis workshop will be held at the WHO in Geneva in&#xD;
      the second quarter of 2014 to conduct a pooled analysis of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal investigators will provide monthly progress reports during the entire study period&#xD;
      and will participate in regular telephone conferences with WHO staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Field supervisors will check all forms completed by field workers before data entry. Field&#xD;
      supervisors will observe 5% of randomly selected field worker verbal autopsies. Data cleaning&#xD;
      quality assurance will be performed using consistency and range checks both at the study&#xD;
      sites and at the WHO data coordination centre as described above in the data management&#xD;
      section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WHO Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health will be responsible for&#xD;
      monitoring the study in collaboration with selected site investigators. WHO staff and/or site&#xD;
      investigators will perform site monitoring visits to each site at least every 6 months to&#xD;
      assess the quality of study implementation and data collection using a standardized site&#xD;
      monitoring checklist. The site visit will lead to the provision of recommendations for study&#xD;
      improvement. More intensive visits are planned for the first six months of study&#xD;
      implementation to ensure prompt problem identification and resolution.&#xD;

        This study will be conducted in the same study areas and population as the parent study.&#xD;
        The participants in this study will be pregnant women identified through surveillance among&#xD;
        all women of reproductive age in the population where the parent study is being conducted,&#xD;
        and their newborn infants. The parent study is not conducting an intervention related to&#xD;
        maternal health or stillbirths. Therefore, the results of the AMANHI study related to&#xD;
        maternal and stillbirth outcomes are not likely to be influenced by what happens in the&#xD;
        parent study. However, only the control group in the parent study will be considered for&#xD;
        analysis of neonatal deaths in this observational study.&#xD;
