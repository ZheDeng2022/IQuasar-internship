      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of changing to DuoTrav® (Travoprost&#xD;
      0.004%/Timolol 0.5%) from prior prostaglandin analogue or beta-blocker monotherapy in Russian&#xD;
      glaucoma patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension whose intraocular pressure&#xD;
      (IOP) is uncontrolled while on their current treatment.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical diagnosis of ocular hypertension, primary open-angle glaucoma and&#xD;
             pseudoexfoliative or pigment dispersion glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be on a stable IOP-lowering regimen of prostaglandin analogue or beta-blocker&#xD;
             (monotherapy) within 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have IOP considered to be safe (in the opinion of the investigator), in both eyes, in&#xD;
             such a way that should assure clinical stability of vision and the optic nerve&#xD;
             throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an IOP of between 19 to 35 mmHg (at any time of the day) in at least one eye&#xD;
             (which would be designated as the study eye). In any eye not designated as a study&#xD;
             eye, the IOP should be able to be controlled on no pharmacologic therapy or on the&#xD;
             study medicine alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to discontinue the use of all other ocular hypotensive medication(s) prior to&#xD;
             receiving the study medication for the entire course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to follow instructions and willing and able to attend all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have best corrected visual acuity of 6/60 (20/200 Snellen, 1.0 LogMAR) or better in&#xD;
             each eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Read, sign, and date an Ethics Committee reviewed and approved informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known medical history of allergy, hypersensitivity or poor tolerance to any component&#xD;
             of DuoTrav® that is deemed clinically significant in the opinion of the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corneal dystrophies in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any opacity or subject uncooperativeness that restricts adequate examination of the&#xD;
             anterior chamber of either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent infectious/noninfectious conjunctivitis, keratitis or uveitis in either&#xD;
             eye. Blepharitis or non-clinically significant conjunctival injection is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of ocular herpes simplex infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intraocular conventional surgery or laser surgery in either eye that is less than&#xD;
             three months prior to the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Risk of visual field or visual acuity worsening as a consequence of participation in&#xD;
             the study, in the investigator's best judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progressive retinal or optic nerve disease from any cause apart from glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of systemic medications known to affect IOP (e.g., oral beta-adrenergic blockers,&#xD;
             alpha-agonists and blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium&#xD;
             channel blockers), which have not been on a stable course for 7 days prior to&#xD;
             Screening Visit or an anticipated change in the dosage during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bronchial asthma, a history of bronchial asthma, or severe chronic obstructive&#xD;
             pulmonary disease that would preclude the safe administration of a topical&#xD;
             beta-blocker.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe allergic rhinitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness to risk the possibility of darkened iris or eyelash changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential not using reliable means of birth control for at least&#xD;
             one month prior to the Screening/Baseline Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in any other investigational study within 30 days prior to the Screening&#xD;
             Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.&#xD;
