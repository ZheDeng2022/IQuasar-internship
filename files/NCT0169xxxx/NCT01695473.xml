      This is a phase II, study of BKM120 in patients with high-risk, localized prostate cancer.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be enrolled and scheduled to have an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the&#xD;
      prostate to confirm high-risk disease and collect prostate tissue for analysis. Two weeks&#xD;
      after the biopsy, patients will begin taking 100 mg/day of BKM120. BKM120 will be given at&#xD;
      this dose level orally once daily for 14 days prior to radical prostatectomy at University of&#xD;
      California, San Francisco. Radical prostatectomy will be performed on the day of the last&#xD;
      dose of BKM120 at day 14. No further drug will be tken after the radical prostatectomy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, prospective, pharmacodynamic study of BKM120 in high-risk, localized&#xD;
      prostate cancer. After informed consent and central pathology review of the core prostate&#xD;
      biopsy, eligible patients will be enrolled and scheduled to have an ultrasound-guided biopsy&#xD;
      of the prostate to confirm high-risk disease and collect tissue for molecular analysis. Two&#xD;
      weeks after the biopsy, patients will begin taking 100 mg/day of BKM120. BKM120 will be given&#xD;
      at this dose level orally once daily for 14 days prior to radical prostatectomy at University&#xD;
      of California, San Francisco. Radical prostatectomy will be performed on the day of the last&#xD;
      dose of BKM120 at day 14. No further drug will be administered after radical prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 24 patients, or 21 evaluable patients, will be enrolled through the Department of&#xD;
      Urology or Genitourinary Medical Oncology at the University of California, San Francisco for&#xD;
      this pharmacodynamic study. Toxicity will be assessed during BKM120 administration, and will&#xD;
      involve a clinic visit on Day 14 ± 2 (i.e. before surgery). Follow-up with safety evaluations&#xD;
      will be at 90 ± 7 days post-operatively and involve a toxicity questionnaire, blood tests,&#xD;
      and clinic visit. Toxicity will be monitored and reported using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria&#xD;
      version 4.0 guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient symptom diary will be distributed to each patient at baseline for symptom&#xD;
      self-recording and BKM120 dose self-administration. In addition, a patient identifier card&#xD;
      (wallet-sized) will be distributed to each patient after informed consent and registration.&#xD;
      This information will contain the patient's age, study name and number, investigator and&#xD;
      study coordinator contact information, and expected adverse events that may be present as a&#xD;
      result of BKM120 administration.&#xD;

                  Oral contraception use by female partners, injected or implanted hormonal methods&#xD;
                  are not allowed as BKM120 potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal&#xD;

          <description>Two weeks after confirmatory biopsy, patients will begin taking 100 mg/day of BKM120. BKM120 will be given at this dose level orally once daily for 14 days prior to radical prostatectomy. Radical prostatectomy will be performed on the day of the last dose of BKM120 at day 14. No further drug will be administered after radical prostatectomy. For unforeseen delays in OR scheduling, up to 7 additional days of BKM120 may be administered prior to surgery.</description>

            <description>Two weeks after confirmatory biopsy, patients will begin taking 100 mg/day of BKM120. BKM120 will be given at this dose level orally once daily for 14 days prior to radical prostatectomy. Radical prostatectomy will be performed on the day of the last dose of BKM120 at day 14. No further drug will be administered after radical prostatectomy. For unforeseen delays in OR scheduling, up to 7 additional days of BKM120 may be administered prior to surgery.</description>
