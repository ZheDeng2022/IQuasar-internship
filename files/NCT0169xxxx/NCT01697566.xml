  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the effects of metformin and/or a&#xD;
      program called &quot;lifestyle intervention&quot; on the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) in&#xD;
      post-menopausal women who are also obese (both are risk factors for endometrial cancer).&#xD;
      Researchers also want to learn how insulin levels will be affected by metformin, diet and/or&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin is designed to treat both diabetes and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a&#xD;
      condition in which the body makes insulin but does not use it properly. It is often referred&#xD;
      to as &quot;pre-diabetes&quot;. Many people with insulin resistance have high levels of both sugar and&#xD;
      insulin in their blood at the same time, which have been reported in patients with&#xD;
      endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, metformin will be compared to a placebo. A placebo is not a drug. It looks&#xD;
      like the study drug but is not designed to treat any disease or illness. It is designed to be&#xD;
      compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle intervention is made up of a series of in-person sessions where you meet with a&#xD;
      coach to discuss strategies for losing weight and ways to increase physical activity. It also&#xD;
      consists of materials designed to help you lose weight and will offer opportunities for&#xD;
      supervised exercise.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the roll of dice) to 1 of 4 study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metformin only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo and lifestyle intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metformin and lifestyle intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither you nor the study staff will know if you are receiving metformin or placebo. However,&#xD;
      if needed for your safety, the study staff will be able to find out what you are receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first month you will gradually increase the dose of metformin/placebo by mouth as&#xD;
      listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 1: One capsule each day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 2: One capsule 2 times each day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 3: One capsule 3 times each day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 4: Two capsules 2 times each day&#xD;
&#xD;
      After week 4, you will continue to take 2 capsules of metformin/placebo 2 times each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are receiving the lifestyle intervention, you will have 16 lifestyle intervention&#xD;
      sessions over 4 months. At each of these sessions, you will discuss methods for managing your&#xD;
      weight. You will receive print materials and worksheets, measuring utensils, and a food&#xD;
      scale. You will be instructed how to use each of these materials and how often to use them&#xD;
      during the study. You will also be provided with opportunities for supervised exercise (such&#xD;
      as group exercise class and group walks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are traveling during a scheduled session, it can be performed over the telephone. Each&#xD;
      call should last about 30 minutes, during which you will discuss the same goals and&#xD;
      information that you would discuss in the in-person sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can begin receiving the study drug/placebo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the second screening visit , you will have a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)&#xD;
           scan to measure your body composition. The scan requires you to lie still on a table for&#xD;
           about 8-10 minutes while a low-energy x-ray takes an image that allows the study staff&#xD;
           to get an image of your body fat density.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given an accelerometer (a small, portable device that measures your physical&#xD;
           activity) and be taught how to use it at the first Screening Visit. You will wear the&#xD;
           accelerometer at all times while you are awake for 7 days. At the second Screening&#xD;
           Visit, you will return the accelerometer at an intervention session. If you are not able&#xD;
           to return it at the second visit then you will mail it back to the study staff in a&#xD;
           pre-paid envelope. You will receive the accelerometer again at Month 4 and wear it for&#xD;
           another 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive a study diary in which you will record any and all exercise you perform&#xD;
           each day while you are on study. It should take about 5 minutes to complete each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete questionnaires about diet and exercise. These questionnaires should&#xD;
           take about 30-40 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will also be taught to complete a questionnaire on the internet to record the food&#xD;
           you eat in a 24 hour period. You will do this 3 times over a 2 week period. The first&#xD;
           time, you will complete it at the clinic. The study staff will call and remind you to&#xD;
           complete the questionnaire the other 2 times. Each time you complete this questionnaire,&#xD;
           it should take about 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Month 1, all participants will return for a study visit. The following tests and&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If this blood draw shows that&#xD;
           your liver or kidney function is abnormal, you will need to return for an additional&#xD;
           blood °draw at Month 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are having symptoms that you would describe as moderate or worse, you will have a&#xD;
           non-pelvic physical exam including measurement of your vital signs and any unreported&#xD;
           symptoms you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each month, you will be asked about any symptom(s) that you may have to learn if it is&#xD;
      related to the study. If you are called, this phone call should last about 5 minutes. If you&#xD;
      are asked in a in-person visit, the visit can last up to an hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive the study drug/placebo and/or lifestyle intervention for up to 4 months. You&#xD;
      will be taken off study if you have intolerable side effects or if you develop endometrial&#xD;
      cancer or hyperplasia during the study. Your participation in the study will be over after&#xD;
      the end-of-study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 4th month, you will have a post-treatment visit. You will repeat all&#xD;
      procedures performed in the first and second visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your height, weight, waist, and hip circumference will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a DEXA scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the questionnaires about food, diet, and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given a questionnaire about your satisfaction (based on the intervention) to&#xD;
           complete and return at this visit. This questionnaire will take up to an hour to&#xD;
           complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an endometrial biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 8 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for biomarker testing.&#xD;
           You will have to fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for 12 hours before this&#xD;
           blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the questionnaire on the internet to record the food you eat in a 24&#xD;
           hour period. You will do this 3 times over a 2 week period. The first time, you will&#xD;
           complete it at the clinic. The study staff will call and remind you to complete the&#xD;
           questionnaire the other 2 times. Each time you complete this questionnaire, it should&#xD;
           take about 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1 year after the screening visits (+/- 1 month), the following tests and procedures&#xD;
      will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your height, weight, waist, and hip circumference will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a DEXA scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 8 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for biomarker testing.&#xD;
           °You will have to fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for 12 hours before this&#xD;
           blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will wear the accelerometer for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete questionnaires about food, diet, and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the questionnaire on the internet to record the food you eat in a 24&#xD;
           hour period. You will do this 3 times over a 2 week period. The first time, you will&#xD;
           complete it at the clinic. The study staff will call and remind you to complete the&#xD;
           questionnaire the other 2 times. Each time you complete this questionnaire, it should&#xD;
           take about 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Metformin is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of diabetes and insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson Cancer&#xD;
      Center.&#xD;
