  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A-PREDICT is a study of axitinib in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma unsuitable&#xD;
      for nephrectomy (as judged by the treating clinician) to evaluate efficacy, safety, toxicity&#xD;
      and changes in biomarkers during therapy. Axitinib will given twice daily by mouth according&#xD;
      to tolerability of treatment, for as long as patients are deriving clinical benefit. Blood&#xD;
      and tumour tissue samples will be taken prior to and during therapy to evaluate biomarkers of&#xD;
      treatment response. The primary clinical objective of this study is to define the activity of&#xD;
      axitinib given to patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma unsuitable for nephrectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A-PREDICT is a single arm, single agent, open label, multicentre, phase II study of axitinib&#xD;
      in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma of predominant clear cell histology and&#xD;
      unsuitable for debulking nephrectomy (as judged by the treating clinician). Patients who have&#xD;
      provided consent and have satisfied the eligibility criteria will be registered into the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The starting dose of axitinib will be 5 mg twice daily by mouth, escalating to a maximum of&#xD;
      10mg twice daily by mouth according to tolerability of treatment, for as long as patients are&#xD;
      deriving clinical benefit. Treatment will be paused for one week prior to percutaneous biopsy&#xD;
      of the primary on day 1 week 9. Disease progression will be evaluated according to RECIST&#xD;
      v1.1 criteria 8 weeks after commencing treatment, at 8 weekly intervals to 6 months and 3&#xD;
      monthly thereafter. Blood and tumour tissue samples will be taken prior to and during therapy&#xD;
      to evaluate biomarkers of treatment response. Nephrectomy will be carried out on any patient&#xD;
      who becomes suitable in the opinion of the treating clinician during the course of the trial.&#xD;
      Where possible, tissue samples will be taken from resected specimens. Response to axitinib in&#xD;
      marker lesions will be correlated with changes in biomarkers.&#xD;

    <description>The proportion of study participants alive and progression free at 6 months (day 1 week 25 visit). Progression will be measured from the date of study entry (registration date) until the first date of either death or confirmed progressive disease according to RECIST. Patients alive and free from progression will be censored at the date of last follow-up. The proportion of patients progression free at 6 months will be reported with 95% confidence interval. In addition, progression free survival will be presented using the Kaplan Meier product limit method with median progression free survival reported.

    <description>Axitinib treatment Axitinib is an oral VEGF-receptor inhibitor. Patients are prescribed a starting dose of 5mg twice daily, escalating to 10mg in absence of dose limiting toxicities.&#xD;
Patients should stop axitinib treatment one week prior to day 1 week 9 percutaneous research biopsy of the primary renal tumour and restart 2-3 days post biopsy.&#xD;
Doses should be taken approximately 12 hours apart and patients should be instructed to take their doses at approximately the same times each day.&#xD;
Dose adjustments, including dose increase or dose reduction, are permitted and should be based on clinical judgement and the guidelines provided in the protocol.</description>
