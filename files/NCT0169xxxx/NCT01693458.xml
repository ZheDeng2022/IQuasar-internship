    <textblock>
      The Appreciative Inquiry Change Agents (CA) program (NAMWEZA) intends to address broad&#xD;
      societal issues by engaging HIV-positive leaders as 'change agents' in their communities. In&#xD;
      this study, the CAs will be recruited from an HIV Care and Treatment Centre in Dar es Salaam.&#xD;
      The Namweza program has the potential to address structural issues related to HIV risk, such&#xD;
      as access to limited resources, through an entrepreneurial component of the program. A&#xD;
      positive, or appreciative, focus promotes CAs to examine assets in themselves and in their&#xD;
      networks, encourages strengthening of relationships, and facilitates planning for a positive&#xD;
      future for themselves, their families, and their communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stepped wedge randomized trial will be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      program for the following primary outcomes: uptake of HIV services among network members of&#xD;
      the CAs; rate of unprotected sex and frequency of concurrent relationships among CAs and&#xD;
      their social networks; and levels of self-esteem, general self efficacy, and risk of intimate&#xD;
      partner violence in the CAs. Secondary outcomes include: depressive symptoms, hopefulness,&#xD;
      and HIV-related stigma (among CAs); social support and quality of relationships (among CAs);&#xD;
      and HIV knowledge, attitudes and self-efficacy in preventing HIV transmission or re-infection&#xD;
      (CAs and their networks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following are primary hypotheses that will be tested through this stepped wedge&#xD;
      randomized trial evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Uptake of HIV services will increase among individuals in the network of the&#xD;
           HIV-positive Change Agents related to the intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Levels of self-esteem and general self-efficacy will increase in trained Change Agents;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rate of unprotected sex and number of concurrent partners will decrease (among network&#xD;
           of Change Agents as well as Change Agents themselves; i.e. the 'study population'); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) will decrease in Change Agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Prevalence of depressive symptoms and HIV-related stigma will decrease and level of&#xD;
           hopefulness will increase in trained Change Agents;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Levels of HIV knowledge, attitudes and self-efficacy in preventing HIV transmission and&#xD;
           re-infection among CA and their networks will increase; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Degree of social support and quality of relationships will improve among CA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the proposed intervention is found to be effective, linkages with the Tanzanian Ministry&#xD;
      of Health and other stakeholders will enable scale-up of the program throughout the country.&#xD;

      Intervention approach: Appreciative Inquiry Change Agents (CA) program (NAMWEZA) (see&#xD;
      Appendix D for draft Facilitators' Guide). The intervention is based on an Appreciative&#xD;
      Inquiry approach that comprises a 10-session program based on learning by doing rather than&#xD;
      factual classroom type learning, although it includes discussion of relevant facts about HIV,&#xD;
      and other STIs. The intervention is based on the template of Stepping Stones (Jewkes et al.,&#xD;
      2008), which is internationally one of the most widely used participatory behavioral&#xD;
      interventions targeting sexual health. The Stepping Stones curriculum was shortened and&#xD;
      radically adapted from more than 20 sessions. However NAMWEZA borrows generously from many of&#xD;
      the exercises and games. It also employs the successful experience of stratification by age&#xD;
      and sex to engage 4 different working groups (younger and older, male and female). The&#xD;
      intervention is described in detail in Appendix D in the facilitators guide. A full draft&#xD;
      curriculum is available on request. It is currently being translated into Swahili for use in&#xD;
      Tanzania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention uses a number of psychological methods for creating change as effectively&#xD;
      and rapidly as possible. It focuses on showing affirmation and being appreciative by looking&#xD;
      for what is working in people's lives. Looking for resilience and coping strategies, and&#xD;
      naming these, aims to raise self-esteem and the sense of competence in&#xD;
      'someone-who-has-a-future'. In every session, participants dream or imagine whom they might&#xD;
      talk to about the things they have learned, or what they might do to prevent the spread of&#xD;
      HIV personally or in their community. Imagining or dreaming their personal scenarios creates&#xD;
      possibilities for different positive futures, for ways of behaving and being in relationship&#xD;
      with people. These exercises, that are repeated every session in different forms, are&#xD;
      designed to empower participants, giving them energy and hope. Participants learn and&#xD;
      practice these life skills and report on their practical utility as they interact with their&#xD;
      social networks each week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every exercise is discussed in small groups or role-played so that ideas and strategies can&#xD;
      be shared and different responses can be practiced. Participants rehearse and try different&#xD;
      ways of saying and doing things, until they find their own words and personal approaches&#xD;
      within the given format. Discussions about love and safe, enjoyable sex allow participants to&#xD;
      explore these personal subjects in the security of sex and age stratified groups. There is a&#xD;
      particular emphasis on assertiveness and communication skills to raise self-esteem and&#xD;
      decrease interpersonal violence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most sessions end with meditation or mindfulness so that people become aware of how their&#xD;
      bodies feel. This helps them to recognize their own and others' body language and non-verbal&#xD;
      communication, helping them to be more aware of other people's responses. Integration and&#xD;
      awareness of the body is developed in the process of mindfulness training. This is&#xD;
      particularly useful when thinking about disclosure and potential intimate partner violence&#xD;
      (IPV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Closing circle is a daily session closing/winding up activity where all participants gather&#xD;
      into a circle and each has a chance to say one thing they have learned in that day which they&#xD;
      might share with someone in the community and one thing they are looking forward to doing&#xD;
      before the next meeting. As part of the intervention, facilitators will be required at the&#xD;
      end of each session to document their perception of how the session was conducted and meet&#xD;
      with other facilitators in a self evaluation and support session that will form the basis for&#xD;
      preparation for the next training session. They will be requested to provide reports on level&#xD;
      of participant's comfort with content of sessions, level of participation, range of learning&#xD;
      reported, and areas for improvement reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last sessions engage participants in thinking about practical issues of encouraging&#xD;
      entrepreneurial skills. Participants explore ways that they might work in their local&#xD;
      communities as change agents to reduce the spread of the virus and improve the situation of&#xD;
      those living with HIV.&#xD;
