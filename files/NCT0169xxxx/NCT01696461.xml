  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, two strata, multicenter, prospective study of&#xD;
      plerixafor-mobilized HLA-identical sibling allografts in recipients with hematological&#xD;
      malignancies. This study will establish the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous plerixafor&#xD;
      for this purpose.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the proportion of donors whose cells can be&#xD;
      successfully mobilized and collected with a sufficient CD34+ cell dose using plerixafor as&#xD;
      the mobilizing agent, using an intention-to-treat analysis. Donor mobilization following&#xD;
      plerixafor will be considered successful if ≥ 2.0x10e6 CD34+ cells/kg recipient weight are&#xD;
      collected in no more than two leukapheresis collections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All donors receiving plerixafor will be included in the analysis of the primary objective&#xD;
      based on the intention-to-treat principle.Recipients will be classified into one of the two&#xD;
      strata, myeloablative or reduced intensity, according to his/her conditioning regimen. The&#xD;
      target enrollment is 64 donor/recipient pairs, 32 pairs per stratum.&#xD;
