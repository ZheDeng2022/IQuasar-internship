    <textblock>
      Probiotics play an important role in preventing overgrowth of potentially pathogenic bacteria&#xD;
      and maintaining the integrity of the gut mucosal barrier. The beneficial effects of&#xD;
      probiotics have been previously studied in adult patients with IBS. Clinical studies show&#xD;
      that patients meeting the criteria for diagnosis for IBS have greater probability for being&#xD;
      affected by celiac desease if compared to controls without IBS. Since one of the causes&#xD;
      attributed to the onset of IBS is the modified flora gut, it is interesting to determine the&#xD;
      beneficial effects that probiotics may have on gastrointestinal symptoms in celiac disease&#xD;
      patients. The goal of the present study is to determine whether oral administration of a&#xD;
      probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus plantarum 14D-CECT 4528, Lactobacillus casei,&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium breve Bbr8 LMG P-17501, Bifidobacterium breve Bl10 LMG P-17500 and&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium animalis under randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions would&#xD;
      improve symptoms of adult celiac patients with IBS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind study, placebo-controlled, carried out in three&#xD;
      departments of gastroenterology in Southern Italy (Bari, Taranto e Castellana Grotte).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Celiac patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome will considered eligible for inclusion. They&#xD;
      will be between 18 and 65 years old and they will be in GFD for at least 2 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be excluded from the study patients with previous abdominal surgery, chronic disease,&#xD;
      alarm signs of organic conditions, treatment with probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics and&#xD;
      antispasmodics in the previous month, immunodeficiency, pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The size of the sample, which must show a benefit greater than 25% compared to placebo&#xD;
      (untreated group that usually able to respond positive in 20% of cases), will require 58&#xD;
      patients per arm to ensure a power of 90% with an alpha error of 0.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be assigned consecutive numbers, starting with the lowest number available, and&#xD;
      randomly assigned, with the use of a computer generated randomisation list using permuted&#xD;
      block design, to receive orally either a probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus plantarum&#xD;
      14D-CECT 4528, Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium breve Bbr8 LMG P-17501, Bifidobacterium&#xD;
      breve Bl10 LMG P-17500 and Bifidobacterium animalis or placebo (sachets identical in taste&#xD;
      and appearance to the active study product except for the absence of probiotic mixture) once&#xD;
      a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. phase of &quot;running-in&quot; of two weeks to reduce the possibility of a next significant&#xD;
           placebo effect in which the patient should not take no product;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. supplementation for 6 weeks in which the patient will take one packet per day of placebo&#xD;
           or active product;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. follow-up of 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be entered sequentially to receive the assigned treatment. Boxes&#xD;
      containing placebo will have the same shape, dimension, indication and appearance as those&#xD;
      containing the viable probiotic mixture and will be provided by the probiotic producer&#xD;
      (Moviscom Srl, Rome, Italy) which ensure that the study is blinded for investigators and&#xD;
      patients. Group assignment will be concealed from participants and investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the duration of the trial (w1- w14) patients will record gastrointestinal symptoms on&#xD;
      weekly diary. During the same time will compiled, every two week, the Gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptom rating score (GSRS), that consists of a 15-point questionnaire to assess severity and&#xD;
      frequency of symptoms validated by Svedlund et al.. For all patients will be collected, at T&#xD;
      = 0 and T = 42 days, stool samples on which will be performed the extraction of DNA and RNA&#xD;
      for a possible assessment of the intestinal microflora. Bacteria DNA in stools will be&#xD;
      extracted and stored at -80Â°C for future analysis. At the end of the study, for patients who&#xD;
      have achieved the primary objective will be made specific identification of the intestinal&#xD;
      microflora for verify any amendments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The compliance to the study will be demonstrated according to the number of sachets consumed&#xD;
      by the patient during the 6 weeks of administration, and on the basis of the compilation of&#xD;
      the questionnaires provided by the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures Primary outcome will be the incidence in IBS in celiac patients receiving&#xD;
      probiotics as compared to those receiving placebo. We have chosen pain as the primary outcome&#xD;
      measure, in line with the proposed points-to-consider for IBS trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBS will be diagnosed and categorised according to ROME III criteria. Secondary outcomes are:&#xD;
      1) evaluation of frequency/severity of symptoms according to treatment arm; 2) modification&#xD;
      of intestinal microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the intestinal microbiota of these informative cases will help to assess&#xD;
      whether there is a intestinal microbiota suggestive of future inset of IBS and ability of our&#xD;
      probiotic mixture to stabilize the intestinal microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events and Disallowed Medication Adverse events will be monitored throughout the&#xD;
      study. Patients will not allowed to consume any probiotic other than those provided and they&#xD;
      will be invited to continue their eating and physical exercise habits.&#xD;
