  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine if Triciribine (TCN) and carboplatin are safe&#xD;
      and tolerable when given together, and to determine if this combination of drugs can help&#xD;
      people with recurrent ovarian cancer.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability, and determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose of triciribine when combined with carboplatin in women with&#xD;
      platinum-resistant, recurrent or persistent ovarian cancer. The secondary objectives are to&#xD;
      evaluate the clinical activity of carboplatin plus triciribine in women with&#xD;
      recurrent/persistent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer by assessing response rate,&#xD;
      progression-free survival, and duration of stable disease.&#xD;

    <description>To determine the maximum tolerated dose of TCN-PM when combined with carboplatin in a Phase I clinical trial of biomarker-selected women with platinum-resistant, recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer (OVCA).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The best overall response is the best time point response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest sum recorded since baseline).&#xD;
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10mm.&#xD;
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.&#xD;
Response and progression will be evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1-1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from study entry to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).&#xD;
Response and progression will be evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1-1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Stable Disease (SD)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for Partial Response (PR) nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.&#xD;
Response and progression will be evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1-1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.</description>
