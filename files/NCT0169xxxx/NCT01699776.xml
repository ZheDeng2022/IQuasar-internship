  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is established that at a serum concentration 0.5-0.9 ng/ml digoxin is effective in&#xD;
      patients with heart failure, especially in the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF). It is&#xD;
      the claimed that ivabradine by lowering heart rate reduces symptoms and improves clinical&#xD;
      outcomes in patients with heart failure. The effect of ivabradine and digoxin in heart&#xD;
      failure was compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 22 patients with ischemic heart failure, AF, and diastolic dysfunction with&#xD;
      preserved left ventricular systolic function were treated with digoxin and ivabradine for 3&#xD;
      months, according to a randomization cross-over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected data Medical history, physical examination, laboratory (including proBNP and serum&#xD;
      digoxin concentrations), ECG, 6-minute walk test, and echocardiographic data (LVEF, LAVi,&#xD;
      e/e1 ratio).&#xD;

      Protocol This is an investigator-started study, coded GC&amp;PJ-dig-Iva 2009-2012. The study was&#xD;
      planned according to the Good Clinical Quality standards and the analysis was performed using&#xD;
      an intention-to-treat method. The protocol was approved from an Ethics Committee. Selected&#xD;
      patients gave their written informed consent. The family practitioners agreed and obtained&#xD;
      the data and analysis. Collected data were analyzed from single-blinded investigators&#xD;
      (without knowledge of the used test drug and time of collection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Study design: same patients were assigned to DIG or IVA for 3 months, according to a&#xD;
      randomization cross-over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tested drugs Commercial brands of digoxin and ivabradine were used. Digoxin was given by&#xD;
      mouth at a dose of 0.125 mg/day, 5 times per week, for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ivabradine was given by mouth at a dose of 7.5 mg bid for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Chronic and stable coronary artery disease Permanent atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
      Diastolic dysfunction with maintained systolic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Unstable angina pectoris. Reduced systolic cardiac function (LVEF&lt;52%).&#xD;
      Normal diastolic function. Diabetes requiring insulin. Moderate or severe renal or hepatic&#xD;
      dysfunction. Technically insufficient echocardiographic quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected data Medical history and concomitant medications. Physical examination was&#xD;
      performed. Laboratory values (including proBNP and serum digoxin concentration). ECG.&#xD;
      Echocardiography. 6-minute walk test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses Data are expressed as mean ± 1 SD. Absolute values and percent changes&#xD;
      in relation to baseline measurements were analyzed. The 2 hypotheses tested were: null&#xD;
      hypothesis: mu1-mu2=0.0, and alternative hypothesis: mu1-mu2&gt;&gt;0.0. Comparisons within groups&#xD;
      were made using paired t tests or the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test, where&#xD;
      appropriate. Between-group comparisons were performed by unpaired t tests or the&#xD;
      non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test, respectively. Chi-square test or Kruskal-Wallis test were&#xD;
      used to compare continuous normally or not normally distributed and qualitative variables,&#xD;
      where appropriate. Multivariate analysis of variance was performed. A p value of &lt; 0.05 was&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;

        All patients had heart failure NYHA (New York Heart Association) class III. All had chronic&#xD;
        and stable coronary artery disease which had been treated with percutaneous dilatation and&#xD;
        stenting, and/or aortocoronary bypass. The pathology had induced a permanent AF and heart&#xD;
        failure with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and preserved systolic function.&#xD;
        Preserved systolic function was defined by a LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction)&#xD;
        ≥52%. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was defined by a e/e1 ratio &gt; 15 (septal&#xD;
        spectral tissue-Doppler).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

        mellitus requiring insulin, moderate or severe renal or hepatic dysfunction, or technically&#xD;
        insufficient echocardiography.&#xD;
