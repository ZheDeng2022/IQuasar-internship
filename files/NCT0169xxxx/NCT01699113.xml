  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are to find out in healthy subjects if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  YF476 prevents the ECL-cell hyperplasia induced by repeated doses of rabeprazole - a&#xD;
           proton pump inhibitor;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  YF476 also prevents rebound hyperacidity after stopping rabeprazole; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  YF476 by itself causes neither ECL-cell hyperplasia after repeated doses nor rebound&#xD;
           hyperacidity after stopping YF476.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess the safety and tolerability of YF476, alone and in combination with rabeprazole;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  compare the effects of YF476, alone and in combination with rabeprazole, on serum&#xD;
           gastrin and plasma CgA and SST;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess if there is a pharmacokinetic interaction between YF476 and rabeprazole;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess the pharmacokinetics of repeat doses of YF476 by itself; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  study the metabolism of YF476.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We want to know if YF476 prevents ECL-cell hyperplasia induced by PPI, and rebound&#xD;
      hyperacidity after PPI withdrawal, in man, as it does in the rat. A positive result would&#xD;
      support further studies to assess if a combination of YF476 and a PPI is a better way of&#xD;
      treating patients with peptic ulcer disease and GORD than a PPI alone. Equally, we want to&#xD;
      know if YF476 by itself not only inhibits gastric acid secretion but also does not cause&#xD;
      ECL-cell hyperplasia and rebound hyperacidity after withdrawal. A positive result would&#xD;
      support further studies to assess if YF476 alone is an alternative and perhaps better&#xD;
      treatment for patients with peptic ulcer disease and GORD than a PPI alone. The study design&#xD;
      is important. We need to ask ourselves several questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, which PPI should we use? Omeprazole has been studied more than other PPI, and is&#xD;
      probably still the most widely used PPI in the clinic. A disadvantage of omeprazole is that&#xD;
      its metabolism is affected by genetic polymorphism. Studies of human liver microsomes in&#xD;
      vitro (Yamazaki et al 1997) show that omeprazole is metabolised by 5-hydroxylation (catalysed&#xD;
      by CYP2C19, and to a lesser extent CYP3A4) and sulphoxidation (catalysed by CYP3A4). YF476&#xD;
      inhibits CYP3A4/5 in vitro; but we don't know how relevant that is in vivo. CYP2C19 has 3&#xD;
      genotypes: homozygous extensive metabolisers, with higher enzymatic activity; heterozygous&#xD;
      extensive metabolisers, with moderate enzymatic activity; and poor metabolisers, with&#xD;
      markedly impaired enzymatic activity. Consequently, in CYP2C19 homozygous extensive&#xD;
      metabolisers, acid suppression by omeprazole is reduced compared with heterozygous and poor&#xD;
      metabolisers (Shirai et al 2001). Homozygous extensive metabolisers comprise about 70% of the&#xD;
      European and USA populations and about 30% of the Asian population. Recently, a new CYP2C19&#xD;
      gene variant that causes ultrarapid metabolism of omeprazole has been identified in 18% of&#xD;
      Swedes (Sim et al 2006). So, if we use omeprazole, we should genotype subjects for CYP2C19.&#xD;
      Ideally, we should stratify their allocation to treatments, to try to avoid confounding the&#xD;
      results. But, we are unlikely to be able to get the genotyping results quickly enough after&#xD;
      screening to make stratification practical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rabeprazole, unlike omeprazole, is metabolised mainly via a non-enzymatic pathway with minor&#xD;
      CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 involvement. Therefore, acid suppression by rabeprazole is less affected&#xD;
      by CYP2C19 genotype (Shirai et al 2001; Miura et al 2006), which is one reason for using&#xD;
      rabeprazole instead of omeprazole. Omeprazole and rabeprazole are both off-patent, so a&#xD;
      combination product of YF476 and either PPI is possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, what dose of PPI should we use, and for how long? The dose of PPI should be one that&#xD;
      is clinically relevant. If the choice of PPI is omeprazole, the dose should be 40 mg daily,&#xD;
      because 20 mg -- the standard clinical dose -- was less effective than the recommended doses&#xD;
      of other PPI in raising gastric pH (Warrington et al 2006). Rabeprazole 20 mg was more&#xD;
      effective than esomeprazole 20 mg in those studies, another reason for using rabeprazole&#xD;
      (Warrington et al 2005). Taking everything into account, we have decided to use rabeprazole&#xD;
      20 mg daily for our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of PPI dosing is probably more important than the choice of PPI and dose. The&#xD;
      longer the duration of dosing, the more likely we are to show the morphological changes of&#xD;
      ECL-cell hyperplasia. But ethical considerations and compliance issues mean that we have to&#xD;
      compromise over duration of dosing. The available evidence suggests that 2 weeks is not long&#xD;
      enough to induce ECL-cell hyperplasia, whereas 8-12 weeks may be more than long enough. So, 6&#xD;
      weeks seems a reasonable compromise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third, how long after stopping the PPI should we assess rebound hyperacidity? Early studies&#xD;
      in man failed to show rebound hyperacidity after stopping omeprazole because the assessments&#xD;
      were done too soon (Prewett et al 1991). PPIs are non-competitive inhibitors of the proton&#xD;
      pump, which takes days to regenerate fully. The available evidence suggests that 2 weeks&#xD;
      after PPI withdrawal is long enough to study rebound hyperacidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourth, what dose of YF476 should we use? Single and repeated doses of 100 mg daily were well&#xD;
      tolerated and completely suppressed pentagastrin-stimulated increases in gastric acid volume&#xD;
      and H+ content in healthy subjects. The toxicology and toxicokinetic studies support dosing&#xD;
      of 100 mg daily for up to 13 weeks. So, a dosing schedule of 100 mg daily for 6 weeks is&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifth, is it safe to give a PPI and YF476 together? No safety problems were reported when&#xD;
      rats were given omeprazole and YM022, an enantiomer of YF476, for 13 weeks (Nishida et al&#xD;
      1995). Also, no safety problems were reported when omeprazole and YF476 were given to rats&#xD;
      for 8 weeks (Chen et al 2000). However, whatever PPI we use, we should assay blood&#xD;
      concentrations of PPI and YF476 (Redrup et al 2002) at the start and end of dosing, lest a&#xD;
      drug-drug interaction confound the results of the outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixth, what tests of gastric function and ECL cells should we use to compare the treatments?&#xD;
      We should study: plasma gastrin, to assess the degree of hypergastrinaemia; plasma CgA, a&#xD;
      marker of ECL-cell hyperplasia; plasma SST, a marker of D-cell activity;&#xD;
      pentagastrin-stimulated increases in gastric acid volume and H+ content, and 24-hour&#xD;
      ambulatory pH, to compare anti-secretory responses during and after stopping treatments;&#xD;
      gastric biopsies, to assess changes in ECL-cell histology and enzymes; and dyspepsia&#xD;
      symptoms, to assess occurrence of symptomatic rebound hyperacidity after stopping treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventh, should the study be crossover or parallel-group in design? In healthy subjects, a&#xD;
      crossover study is often the ideal design. Comparisons are made within rather than between&#xD;
      subjects, which reduces the variability of the results. But, a crossover design is not&#xD;
      practical given the long dosage period and the demanding procedures. By using rabeprazole, we&#xD;
      avoid the potential problem of between-subject differences attributable to CYP2C19 genetic&#xD;
      polymorphism. So, a parallel-group design with 3 groups of subjects randomised to either&#xD;
      YF476, rabeprazole, or a combination of YF476 and rabeprazole, is a sensible solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighth, should we have identical treatments and a placebo group? We can over-encapsulate the&#xD;
      treatments to make them identical so that the study is double blind in design. Ideally, we&#xD;
      should have a placebo group, but if the study is double blind in design and the methods are&#xD;
      mostly objective, a placebo group is not essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, should we use patients or healthy subjects? Healthy subjects and patients with&#xD;
      peptic ulcer disease or GORD all develop hypergastrinaemia and ECL-cell hyperplasia after&#xD;
      repeated dosing with a PPI, and rebound hyperacidity after stopping the PPI. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      the study is best done in healthy subjects because they are more likely to comply with the&#xD;
      demanding study procedures, more homogeneous, more robust, and not on medication. The YF476&#xD;
      reproductive toxicology studies justify including women who are not at risk of pregnancy.&#xD;
      However, H pylori-positive subjects should be excluded. In a recent UK community study, 15%&#xD;
      of people were H pylori-positive (Lane et al 2006).&#xD;
