  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The growth of the elderly population is associated with the autonomy failure and the increase&#xD;
      of dependence problems. Fall incidents are the third cause of chronic disablement in older&#xD;
      persons and are one of the major risk factors for entering in dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent progress in home technologies and medical care are opportunities to search how to&#xD;
      apply these tools to reduce and prevent falling at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cost effectiveness of simple home automation&#xD;
      pack coupled to teleassistance service for preventing home falls in frail elderly population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1200 patients will be enrolled and randmosied within two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  home with automation pack coupled to teleassistance service&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  home without this technology&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is one of the first European randomized studies using the criteria MAST (Model for&#xD;
      Assessment of Telemedicine) for medico-economic evaluation of technology solutions for the&#xD;
      prevention and care in the elderly. The medico-economic evaluation of the overall&#xD;
      contribution of home automation kit associated with telecare will be conducted in accordance&#xD;
      with the recommendations of the research program Renewing Health FP7 the European Union. This&#xD;
      program has developed an analytical model common to all evaluations of telemedicine&#xD;
      applications that have an impact on health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . The home-based technology in this study will be a simple home automation pack coupled to&#xD;
      teleassistance service. The automation pack will include: a remote intercom, an electronic&#xD;
      bracelet or pendentive, a pull shower in the bathroom, a light path, a smoke detector and a&#xD;
      gas detector in the kitchen. The central hotline will provide telephone support at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intercom is a remote transmitter which enables the platform to provide remote assistance with&#xD;
      the elderly at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each person will have electronic bracelet or pendentive with a medallion which will be&#xD;
      provided with the dialer. It is a system that allows remote assistance to the elderly by&#xD;
      pressing the central medallion of the device to request assistance or report a dangerous&#xD;
      situation (risk of falling, or fall) to the platform of teleassistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bathroom alarm zipper is a device installed in the shower that allows subjects to use it&#xD;
      when at risk of falling or fall detection. The shower is a high risk of fall for the elderly&#xD;
      due to movements very often results in an imbalance of seniors already weakened by aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The light path is a 1.5 m device installed near the bed and turns automatically on when the&#xD;
      person sets foot on the ground. It can provide adapted visibility by showing the right path&#xD;
      and improving consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The smoke and gas detector are devices installed on the ceiling of the kitchen. They allow&#xD;
      respectively detecting abnormally high rates of smoke or a gas leak in the house or&#xD;
      apartment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The teleassistance platform is a central technical hotline located in Creuse area. It is&#xD;
      functional at any time. All electronic devices are connected to the plant. An alert is&#xD;
      signaled by an alarm, involving an immediate phone call to the resident of the house to&#xD;
      assess the situation. The resulting actions taken are either reassuring the person, giving&#xD;
      directions to the person or sending a message to aid in the event ascertained or suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A monthly questionnary should be filled by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main judgment criterion will be the cumulated incidence of home falls requiring emergency&#xD;
      admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Changes score ISO profile resource according to SMAF scale,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Proportion of participants with regular physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Effect on admissions in institutions (nursing homes or senior residential care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Time before management of stroke and the length of stay in rehabilitation unit.&#xD;
