      Multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the use of 3 days of&#xD;
      pulsed radiofrequency energy (PRFE) to treat pain after bunionectomy surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical study's primary objective is to compare the overall analgesic effect of the&#xD;
      Provant Therapy System (test device) to an identical sham device (placebo) in subjects&#xD;
      experiencing post-operative pain following first metatarsal bunion surgery. The study&#xD;
      hypothesis is that, over the first 72 hours (3 days) after the initial test device treatment,&#xD;
      subjects treated with an active test device will show a statistically significant difference&#xD;
      (reduction) in pain intensity scores when compared with subjects treated with a sham&#xD;
      (placebo) device. Treatment with the test device will continue through the 168 hour (7 day)&#xD;
      timepoint. Safety will be followed through 28 days.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Treatment with the test device twice per day, over 3 days (7 total treatments)</time_frame>
    <description>Sum of time-weighted Pain Intensity Differences (SPID). Pain relief was assessed at completion of first treatment, 45min,60min,90min,2hrs,3hrs,4hrs,6hrs following T0 and every 2hrs between 6AM to 10PM. After 10 PM and before 6AM, pain relief assessments were done every 4hrs. Subjects rated pain relief relative to baseline using a categorical scale: 0=none; 1=a little; 2=some; 3= a lot; 4 = complete. SPIDt = ∑PID x (time(t) - time(t-1)) x PID(i). A more negative SPID value means less pain. Total score of SPID ranged from a min value of -1091550.00 in the active arm and -2120130.00 in the sham arm and a max value of 603060.00 in the active arm and 1077630.00 in the sham arm. No absolute min and max scores were calculated.</description>

    <description>Pain relief was assessed at completion of first study device treatment, 45 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours following T0 (±5 mins). Thereafter, pain relief was assessed every 2 hours (±5 mins) between 6AM to 10PM throughout the in-patient treatment period. After 10 PM and before 6AM, pain relief assessments were done every 4 hours. Subjects rated pain relief relative to baseline pain intensity using a categorical scale: 0=none; 1=a little; 2=some; 3= a lot; 4 = complete. Based on these scores, a time weighted pain relief score was calculated, Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR). TOTPAR-Pain Relief = ∑PID x (time(t) - time(t-1)) x PID(i).&quot;</description>

        <title>Overall Analgesic Efficacy (Via SPID 0-72 Hrs)</title>
        <description>Sum of time-weighted Pain Intensity Differences (SPID). Pain relief was assessed at completion of first treatment, 45min,60min,90min,2hrs,3hrs,4hrs,6hrs following T0 and every 2hrs between 6AM to 10PM. After 10 PM and before 6AM, pain relief assessments were done every 4hrs. Subjects rated pain relief relative to baseline using a categorical scale: 0=none; 1=a little; 2=some; 3= a lot; 4 = complete. SPIDt = ∑PID x (time(t) - time(t-1)) x PID(i). A more negative SPID value means less pain. Total score of SPID ranged from a min value of -1091550.00 in the active arm and -2120130.00 in the sham arm and a max value of 603060.00 in the active arm and 1077630.00 in the sham arm.
