      This study will be divided into two phases. The purpose of the Phase I registry is to assess&#xD;
      the current force being used for ablation of symptomatic paroxysmal AF in a wide range of&#xD;
      operators in different Canadian centres with the operators being blinded to the contact force&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase II of the study, operators will have open use of the force contact data. Phase I and&#xD;
      II data will be compared in order to assess the efficiency of using the THERMOCOOL®&#xD;
      SMARTTOUCH™ catheter.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia affecting over 5% of the population&#xD;
      above the age of 65 years. The use of percutaneous catheter ablation for symptomatic&#xD;
      management has increased over the last decade. It is well established that AF ablation is&#xD;
      superior to anti-arrhythmic drugs for symptomatic recurrence of AF. Despite this, success&#xD;
      rates with a single procedure for paroxysmal AF is approximately 80% with the majority of&#xD;
      recurrence due to recovery of lesions or &quot;gaps&quot; found at repeat procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) will undergo&#xD;
      ablation using a newly Health Canada approved catheter with SmartTouch technology that&#xD;
      enables the measurement of catheter tip contact force and direction inside the heart. The&#xD;
      purpose of Phase I of the study is to assess the current force being used for ablation of&#xD;
      symptomatic paroxysmal AF in a wide range of operators in different Canadian centres with the&#xD;
      operators being blinded to the contact force data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective will be to assess whether lesion recovery, as assessed in redo&#xD;
      procedures, corresponds to contact force measurements. It is hypothesized that gaps found on&#xD;
      repeat procedures will correspond to ablation lesions associated with a lower contact force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase II, operators will have open use of the force contact data. Phase I and II data will&#xD;
      be compared in order to assess the efficiency of using the SmartTouch catheter. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that the open use of contact force data will decrease the procedural time and&#xD;
      number of lesions to achieve bidirectional pulmonary vein isolation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  At least one episode of AF must have been documented on telemetry, ambulatory monitor,&#xD;
             or 12-lead ECG.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of any previous ablation for atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
