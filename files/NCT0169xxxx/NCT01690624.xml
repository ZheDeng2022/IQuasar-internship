  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute myeloid leukemia who experience a relapse after at least one prior&#xD;
      regimen may be enrolled in this trial. In addition, acute myeloid leukemia patients who are&#xD;
      in complete remission with high risk to relapse may be eligible for this trial. The trial&#xD;
      will examine whether monotherapy with BI 836858 is safe and tolerable at escalating dose&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of relapsed or refractory AML with at least one prior treatment for acute&#xD;
             myeloid leukemia and patients with diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia in complete&#xD;
             remission with high risk to relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Expression of CD33 on more than 30% of bone marrow blasts at screening for patients&#xD;
             with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia is required. CD33 positive&#xD;
             expression of bone marrow blasts at the time of initial acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
             diagnosis is sufficient for those patients in complete remission with high risk to&#xD;
             relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 0, 1 or 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Written informed consent which is consistent with International Conference on&#xD;

          1. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia according to WHO definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia &gt; 5.000 blasts in the&#xD;

             relapsed acute myeloid leukemia patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation within the last 28 days before first treatment&#xD;
             with graft versus host disease requiring more than 20 mg of steroids per day. Steroid&#xD;
             dosage must be stable within two weeks prior to start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who are candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (for patients&#xD;
             with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia).&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Serum creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dl&#xD;

             or safety of the trial drug&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Female patients of childbearing potential who are sexually active and unwilling to use&#xD;
             a medically acceptable method of contraception during the trial and for 6 months after&#xD;

         18. Pregnant or nursing female patients&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Treatment with another investigational agent under the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Within two weeks (4 weeks for biologics or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) of&#xD;
                  first administration of BI 836858; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patient has persistent toxicities from prior anti-leukemic therapies which are&#xD;
                  determined to be relevant by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Concomitant treatment with another investigational agent while participating in&#xD;
                  this trial.&#xD;
