  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately half of hypertensive patients have diastolic dysfunction and diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction is associated with development of congestive heart failure and increased&#xD;
      mortality. Although diastolic heart failure associated with hypertension is a clinically&#xD;
      significant problem, few clinical trials have been conducted and there is no proven&#xD;
      pharmacological therapy to improve outcomes. To the best of the investigators knowledge,&#xD;
      there has been no randomized trial to demonstrate that an antihypertensive drug improves&#xD;
      diastolic function in hypertensive patients with diastolic dysfunction. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that fimasartan added to standard therapy will be superior to placebo in&#xD;
      improving diastolic dysfunction in mildly symptomatic patients with hypertension and&#xD;
      diastolic dysfunction, and try to examine this hypothesis in a double-blind, randomized&#xD;
      comparison study using echocardiography.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Approximately half of hypertensive patients have diastolic dysfunction and diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction is associated with development of congestive heart failure and increased&#xD;
      mortality. The Framingham study reported that 51% of patients with HF have a preserved left&#xD;
      ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and hypertension is the strongest risk factor for HF with&#xD;
      preserved ejection fraction, also termed diastolic heart failure. The rates of death and&#xD;
      morbidity in these patients are as high as in patients with HF and a low LV ejection&#xD;
      fraction. Hypertensive patients are at increased risk of developing LV hypertrophy and&#xD;
      myocardial fibrosis, which cause relaxation abnormality and decreased compliance of LV with a&#xD;
      rise in the LV diastolic pressure. Although HF associated with hypertension is a clinically&#xD;
      significant problem, few clinical trials have been conducted and there is no proven&#xD;
      pharmacological therapy to improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the activation of rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been shown to&#xD;
      induce LV hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis, the RAAS may play a central role in the&#xD;
      pathogenic process from hypertension to diastolic HF. Inhibitors of RAAS have been considered&#xD;
      as a treatment option for these patients, and the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) have&#xD;
      been of interest because they antagonize the effects of angiotensin II more completely. The&#xD;
      largest clinical trial, the Irbesartan in Heart Failure with Preserved Systolic Function&#xD;
      (I-PRESERVE), recently reported that treatment with irbesartan did not reduce the risk of&#xD;
      death or hospitalization for cardiovascular causes among 4,128 patients who had HF with a&#xD;
      preserved LV ejection fraction. The negative result observed in the I-PRESERVE trial may have&#xD;
      been the consequence of the following possible factors. First, this trial may have targeted&#xD;
      patients in whom the disease process was too advanced for ARBs to be effective. Second,&#xD;
      irbesartan may not be an appropriate ARB for a HF trial, because ARBs are not all the same in&#xD;
      terms of clinical outcome data in patients with HF. Irbesartan did not have outcome data on&#xD;
      reducing HF hospitalization in high-risk hypertensive patients and telmisartan showed no&#xD;
      benefits compared to placebo in these patients, although candesartan and valsartan&#xD;
      significantly reduced endpoint in placebo-controlled trials. Telmisartan and irbesartan have&#xD;
      PPARγ activity and this activity might neutralize the beneficial effects of ARB on HF,&#xD;
      because it is well known that PPARγ agonist, rosiglitazone, increases the incidences of HF&#xD;
      significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating the effect of treatments on diastolic dysfunction has been limited by difficulties&#xD;
      in non-invasive measure of LV diastolic pressure, but recent advances in echocardiography&#xD;
      have made it possible to assess diastolic dysfunction accurately and reproducibly. Thus,&#xD;
      additional clinical studies with the other ARBs are needed in hypertensive patients with&#xD;
      diastolic dysfunction and assessment of diastolic function by echocardiography will be&#xD;
      helpful to determine whether addition of ARB to standard therapy is beneficial to&#xD;
      hypertensive patients with diastolic dysfunction. Fimasartan is the first ARB developed in&#xD;
      Korea, and was felt to be particularly appropriate for examining the hypothesis that the ARB&#xD;
      can improve diastolic dysfunction associated with hypertension, because fimasartan is a&#xD;
      potent and well-tolerated ARB. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no randomized&#xD;
      trial to demonstrate that an antihypertensive drug improves diastolic function in&#xD;
      hypertensive patients with diastolic dysfunction. We hypothesize that fimasartan added to&#xD;
      standard therapy will be superior to placebo in improving diastolic dysfunction in mildly&#xD;
      symptomatic patients with hypertension and diastolic dysfunction, and try to examine this&#xD;
      hypothesis in a double-blind, randomized comparison study using echocardiography.&#xD;
