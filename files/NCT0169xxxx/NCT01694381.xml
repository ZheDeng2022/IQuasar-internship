  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (pro-urokinase) is a highly effective&#xD;
      thrombolytic drug. At pharmacologic concentrations however, pro-urokinase is converted to&#xD;
      urokinase - a non specific thrombolytic, limiting its therapeutic use. Mutant pro-urokinase&#xD;
      (M5) is more stable and its conversion to urokinase is inhibited by C1-inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the overall safety and tolerability related to systemic plasminogen activation&#xD;
           of single doses of M5 over a wide dose range (study part I).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of single doses of C1-inhibitor on the overall safety and&#xD;
           tolerability of single doses of M5 and its effect on M5-induced coagulation changes&#xD;
           (study part II).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mutant proUK, M5, was specifically designed to improve the plasma stability of single-chain&#xD;
      proUK by reducing its intrinsic catalytic activity and allowing it to retain its proenzyme&#xD;
      form until it encounters a thrombus. As an additional consequence of the mutation, its&#xD;
      two-chain enzymatic form (tcM5) is sensitive to inhibition by C1-inhibitor (C1INH) a&#xD;
      relatively abundant plasma inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While it has a negligible effect on urokinase (UK), C1INH inhibits tcM5 irreversibly,&#xD;
      preventing non-specific plasminogen activation, responsible for bleeding complications. The&#xD;
      effect of endogenous C1INH can be augmented by the addition of exogenous C1INH. In vitro&#xD;
      studies in rats and dogs indicated that adding C1INH to plasma prior to clot lysis by M5&#xD;
      prevented bleeding, fibrinogenolysis and plasminogen depletion but did not affect the rate of&#xD;
      fibrinolysis. In a recent pilot rat stroke study, at similarly effective doses, M5, preceded&#xD;
      by C1INH adjunctive therapy, was equivalent to tPA alone but caused significantly less ICH,&#xD;
      was much more effective than tPA preceded by adjunctive C1INH, and was the only group with a&#xD;
      significant functional improvement at 24h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose restrictions which limit efficacy of tPA-based thrombolysis are expected to be&#xD;
      circumvented by M5 preceded by adjunctive C1INH. C1INH is a commercially available plasma&#xD;
      derived product with a well-established safety and efficacy profile and is currently&#xD;
      indicated and available for routine prophylaxis of hereditary angioedema (HAE).&#xD;
