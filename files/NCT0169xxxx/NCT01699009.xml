      The purpose of the study is to assess whether, in individuals with migraines, a low-fat,&#xD;
      vegan diet improves pain more effectively than a control supplement or a placebo. The&#xD;
      principal measures are pain as measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the change in&#xD;
      migraines frequency. The study duration is 36 weeks.This study also tests that a low fat,&#xD;
      plant-based (vegan) diet free of foods commonly identified as triggers improves mood, using&#xD;
      the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (CESD-R), and the Beck&#xD;
      Depression Inventory II (BDI-II).&#xD;

      Preliminary evidence suggests that low-fat, vegetarian diets and certain nutritional&#xD;
      supplements can help reduce pain and also reduce the need for pain medications for some&#xD;
      people. The investigators will ask about 100 people to participate. All of them will get a&#xD;
      low-fat, vegan diet and a nutritional supplement (mixture of omega-3 oils and vitamin E or a&#xD;
      placebo), although some will get the diet first, and others will get the supplement first.&#xD;
      This order in which they will get the diet and the supplement will be determined randomly,&#xD;
      that is, by chance (like the toss of a coin). The principal measures are pain as measured by&#xD;
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS)and the change in migraines frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mood change will be measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression&#xD;
      Scale-Revised (CESD-R), and the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II).&#xD;
