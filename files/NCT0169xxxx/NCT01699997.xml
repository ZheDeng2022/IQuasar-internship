  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: A large body of research has shown that Oxytocin (OXT) is an important prosocial&#xD;
      peptide and there is also initial evidence that the central OXT system is altered in several&#xD;
      mental disorders that are characterized by severe social disturbances and deficits, such as&#xD;
      anxiety disorders with prominent social dysfunction (e.g., schizophrenia), mood disorders and&#xD;
      borderline personality disorder. OXT may reduce psychotic symptoms and may diminish certain&#xD;
      social cognition deficits that are not improved by current antipsychotic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The project has two main aims, listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the efficacy of intranasal OXT in reducing negative symptoms in patients with&#xD;
           schizophrenia in association with second-generation antipsychotics (SGA);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To use an Emotional Priming Paradigm task to assess pre- and post-treatment change in&#xD;
           the patients general cognitive and emotional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross over design. Materials and&#xD;
      methods: Patients involved in the study will be recruited in six centres in the north of&#xD;
      Italy. Each subject (aged 18-45, with a duration of the disorder no longer than 10 years)&#xD;
      will be enrolled after a screening phase. 80 patients will be randomly assigned to either 40&#xD;
      IU OXT once daily or vehicle placebo, in addition to their pre-study antipsychotic medication&#xD;
      regimen: all reasonable attempts maintain the same SGA dosages throughout the study will be&#xD;
      made. The study ratio is 1:1. The total study duration for each individual subject will be&#xD;
      approximately 8 months, which includes an up to 7-day screening period, a baseline&#xD;
      randomization visit, and a four month long cross-over treatment period. Subjects will be&#xD;
      trained by researchers about the self-administration of intranasal OXT. A trustworthy&#xD;
      caregiver will be trained as well. Each patient will receive every morning a SMS text message&#xD;
      on his mobile phone as a reminder for OXT administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the treatment, all patients will be assessed with standardized assessment&#xD;
      instruments and will undergo an in depth neuropsychological assessment; additional&#xD;
      evaluations, including safety evaluations, will be performed at 4 and 8 month follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the negative score in the Positive and Negative Syndrome&#xD;
      Scale (PANSS) performed at 2,4,6 and 8 months since the start of the treatment.&#xD;

      The project has two main aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Aims of the cross-over study To assess the efficacy of intranasal OXT in reducing&#xD;
           negative symptoms in patients with SZ (as evaluated with PANSS), in association with&#xD;
           standard Second Generation Antipsychotics (SGA)treatment; recruited patients will be&#xD;
           aged 18-45 years and will have a disorder duration of no longer than 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aims of the neuropsychological assessment To use an Emotional Priming Paradigm (EPP)&#xD;
           task to assess pre- and post-treatment change in the patients general cognitive and&#xD;
           emotional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim at treating a large sample size of patients with schizophrenia,&#xD;
      consisting exclusively of patients with a limited disorder duration and rather young age, for&#xD;
      a sufficiently long period of time. Our rationale for employing a longer treatment period&#xD;
      than used in previous and on-going trials is to ascertain the possibility of a positive OXT&#xD;
      dose-response relationship, which would be observable, however, with longer treatment&#xD;
      exposure. Moreover, only patients with a disorder onset of 10 years or less will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will then be standardized in terms of AP treatment and randomized to OXT or placebo for&#xD;
      8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OXT is a hormone that is naturally present in the human body, and recent studies have&#xD;
      suggested that patients with SZ show low levels of this neuropeptide. It is therefore&#xD;
      hypothesized that the treatment proposed in this project might balance apparently lower OXT&#xD;
      levels in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, another innovative aspect of this project is the attention at ameliorating patients&#xD;
      adherence to treatment by supporting them with a reminder program (automatic SMS will be sent&#xD;
      every morning to remind patients the daily OXT self-administration) and involving a&#xD;
      trustworthy caregiver who will be trained in OXT administration and will be asked to monitor&#xD;
      the patient compliance by recording each self-administration on a written form.&#xD;

The investigators also expect that OXT will have a positive influence on the patients quality of life and reduction of PANSS positive subscale score.
