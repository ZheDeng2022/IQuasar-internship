  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is the ninth most common cancer in male population in Korea. It was&#xD;
      estimated that 1,864 new cases of esophageal cancer were reported and 1,434 deaths occurred&#xD;
      in Korea in 2005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although half of the patients with esophageal cancer initially present with locoregional&#xD;
      disease amenable to radical surgery or radiation-based therapy, most patients eventually&#xD;
      develop metastatic disease with or without local recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy plays a major role in palliative therapy and remains to be the primary mode of&#xD;
      treatment for the recurrent or metastatic esophageal cancer. Although various chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimens are available, esophageal cancer carries a very poor prognosis, with a mean survival&#xD;
      time of less than 8.1 months with current chemotherapies used singly or in combination with&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU), vindesine, mitomycin, docetaxel, paclitaxel, cisplatin, irinotecan,&#xD;
      vinorelbine, or capecitabine. The majority of the trials performed were in small numbers of&#xD;
      patients with reported response rates from 15 to 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The response was usually of short duration and there was no survival benefit with single&#xD;
      agent chemotherapy. Combination chemotherapy has slightly improved the results in terms of&#xD;
      duration of response (3-6 months), but still there was little improvement in overall&#xD;
      survival. Therefore, the identification of new active agents is essential to prolong the&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials of single agent docetaxel have been reported in patients with esophageal&#xD;
      cancer and the response rate is about 18-25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S-1, a new biochemical modulator of 5-FU, is an oral dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase(DPD)&#xD;
      inhibitory fluoropyrimidine. The advantages of S-1 compared with 5-FU are greater convenience&#xD;
      because of its oral formulation and continuous delivery, without intravenous infusion. S-1 is&#xD;
      frequently used as a substitute for 5-FU in gastric cancer, but limited data is available for&#xD;
      esophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of docetaxel and S-1 is highly active and well tolerated in advanced or&#xD;
      recurrent gastric cancer, and the synergistic antitumor activity has been fully elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we will evaluate the efficacy of docetaxel and S-1 combination chemotherapy in&#xD;
      Korean patients with esophageal cancer.&#xD;
