    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and direct healthcare costs of&#xD;
      asthma management in patients with evidence of persistent asthma following an increase in&#xD;
      asthma therapy in the form of either an increased dose of inhaled glucocorticosteroids (ICS)&#xD;
      using extrafine hydrofluoroalkane-beclometasone dipropionate (HFA-BDP) via pressurised&#xD;
      metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) or breath-actuated inhaler (BAI), or a change to combination ICS&#xD;
      plus long-acting bronchodilator (LABA) therapy using fixed combinations (fluticasone&#xD;
      propionate / salmeterol [FP/SAL] or budesonide / formoterol [BUD/FOR]) or separate pMDIs and&#xD;
      BAIs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current asthma guidelines in the UK are underpinned by evidence derived from randomised&#xD;
      controlled trials (RCTs). Although RCT data are considered the gold standard, the patients&#xD;
      recruited to asthma RCTs are estimated to represent less than 10% of the United Kingdom's&#xD;
      (UK's) asthma population. The poor representation of the asthma population is due to a number&#xD;
      of factors, such as tightly-controlled inclusion criteria for RCTs. There is therefore a need&#xD;
      for more representative RCTs and real-life observational studies to inform existing&#xD;
      guidelines and help optimise asthma outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fixed combination asthma inhalers, FP/SAL (Seretide) and BUD/FOR (Symbicort) are&#xD;
      indicated for use in asthma when adequate asthma control is not achieved with low/medium dose&#xD;
      ICS therapy and as-needed (prn) reliever therapy (a short-acting beta-agonist [SABA]). Fixed&#xD;
      combination inhalers are also indicated in patients already adequately controlled on separate&#xD;
      ICS/LABA therapy. However, emerging trends in asthma prescribing indicate increasing use of&#xD;
      add-on therapies (particularly in the form of combination inhalers) in the early stages of&#xD;
      asthma therapy, even as first-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In practice, there is significant pressure (supported by asthma guidelines) to use the least&#xD;
      expensive, effective inhaled therapies available. While the effect of increased use of add-on&#xD;
      and combination therapies in terms of patient benefits remains uncertain, the impact on the&#xD;
      UK's National Health Service (NHS) treatment costs is unequivocal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short, randomised trials of the effectiveness of asthma monotherapies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      extrafine HFA-BDP is at least as effective at half the dose as BDP pMDI, and equivalent to&#xD;
      same-dose FP pMDI. There is also evidence to suggest that extrafine HFA-BDP optimises&#xD;
      deposition in the lung and affords greater tolerance of poor coordination of breathing and&#xD;
      inhaler actuation. In addition, one long-term, prospective, randomised, open-labelled trial&#xD;
      comparing extrafine HFA-BDP with BDP over the course of one year demonstrated greater&#xD;
      improvements in symptom-free days and quality of life in the extrafine HFA-BDP treatment&#xD;
      group, at a lower cost per symptom-free day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis for this study, therefore, is that extrafine HFA-BDP may be a suitable, and&#xD;
      cost-effective, alternative to combination therapy (as fixed or separate inhalers) in&#xD;
      children and adults with evidence of persistent asthma.&#xD;
