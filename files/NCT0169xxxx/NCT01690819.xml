    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in almost 20% of patients with severe acute&#xD;
      brain injury and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. A massive increase in&#xD;
      sympathetic activity and an increased production of proinflammatory cytokines released into&#xD;
      the systemic circulation are the most important recognized mechanisms. Altered blood brain&#xD;
      barrier after injury causes spillover of inflammatory mediators from the brain into the&#xD;
      systemic circulation leading to peripheral organs damage. The adrenergic surge induces an&#xD;
      increase in vascular hydrostatic pressure and lung capillary permeability, causing an&#xD;
      alteration of alveolar capillary barrier with fluid accumulation, resulting in ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of mechanical ventilation after acute brain injury are the maintenance of&#xD;
      optimal oxygenation, and a tight control of carbon dioxide tension, although ventilatory&#xD;
      settings to be used to obtain these targets, while avoiding secondary insults to the brain,&#xD;
      are not clearly identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protective ventilatory strategy has been positively evaluated first in patients with ARDS,&#xD;
      and then in those undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass or lung resection surgery, or in brain&#xD;
      death organ donors, but data on the effect of protective mechanical ventilation on patients&#xD;
      with acute brain injury are still lacking even if this is a population with recognized risk&#xD;
      factors for ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the primary aim of this multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled trial is&#xD;
      to investigate whether a protective ventilatory strategy, in the early phase after severe&#xD;
      acute brain injury, is associated with a lower incidence of ARDS, avoiding any further damage&#xD;
      to the brain. Secondary aim is to evaluate if a protective ventilatory strategy is associated&#xD;
      with reduced duration of mechanical ventilation, incidence of organ failure, intensive care&#xD;
      unit length of stay, and lower concentrations of plasma inflammatory cytokines, without&#xD;
      adversely affect in neurological outcome.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is described as the most common&#xD;
      non-neurologic organ dysfunction occurring in the early phase after severe acute brain&#xD;
      injury, with a reported incidence of 10-15% and increased morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant role has been recently proposed for neuro-inflammation in the genesis of ARDS&#xD;
      following acute brain injury. The neuro-inflammatory response represents initially a&#xD;
      coordinated effort to protect the brain after injury, but may then become altered and be&#xD;
      responsible for the activation of the secondary injury cascade leading to single or multiple&#xD;
      organ dysfunction. This preclinical event may increase the susceptibility of lungs to the&#xD;
      stress of injurious mechanical ventilation. The main targets of ventilatory management of&#xD;
      acute brain injury patients are maintenance of an optimal oxygenation, and a tight arterial&#xD;
      carbon dioxide control. Actual Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury, in particular, state that hypoxia (PaO2 &lt;60 mmHg or SaO2 &lt; 90%) should be avoided and&#xD;
      PaCO2 level tightly controlled with a target of 35-38 mmHg. However, no published&#xD;
      recommendation exists on which ventilator setting, in terms of tidal volume, respiratory&#xD;
      rate, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels, should be used to obtain these&#xD;
      respiratory targets. In previous studies on patients with ARDS, mechanical ventilation with a&#xD;
      low tidal volume and moderate PEEP levels resulted in decreased mortality and increased&#xD;
      number of ventilatory free days, and it now represents the standard of care for these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with acute brain injury represent a category at risk to develop ARDS both because of&#xD;
      the adrenergic cascade and the inflammatory reaction, and because of the ventilatory strategy&#xD;
      implemented to optimize gas exchange. Nevertheless, no clinical trial has been performed to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of protective ventilatory strategies upon severe acute brain injury&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS The aim of this study is to investigate whether the application of a protective&#xD;
      ventilatory strategy, defined as low tidal volume and moderate levels of PEEP, improves the&#xD;
      combined end point of &quot;event free survival&quot; defined as survival without ventilator dependency&#xD;
      or ARDS diagnosis, without adversely affecting neurological outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim of this study is to evaluate if protective ventilatory strategy may increase&#xD;
      number of ventilator and organ failure free days, reduce intensive care unit (ICU) length of&#xD;
      stay, reduce the incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP), reduce concentrations of&#xD;
      plasma inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, TNF-RI/II, IL-8, IL-1ra, IL-1beta), without&#xD;
      adversely affecting neurological outcome as measured by the Modified Oxford Handicap scale at&#xD;
      intensive care unit discharge and the Glasgow Outcome Scale-extended (GOSe) at 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>Combined end point of &quot;event free survival&quot; defined as survival without ventilator dependency or ARDS* diagnosis&#xD;
*ARDS will be defined according to Berlin definition criteria. If chest x-ray is not immediately available, ARDS diagnosis will be suspected and confirmed later on.&#xD;
Interpretation of bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray and of heart failure vs. fluid overload was variable and in a large observational study (LUNGSAFE, JAMA. 2016 Feb 23;315:788-800) hypoxemic patients with new infiltrates were described as a well-defined group with outcome, risk factors, comorbidities and clinical management similar to ARDS. Therefore, in March 2016 the study protocol replaced &quot;ARDS&quot; with &quot;acute hypoxemic respiratory failure&quot; as one of the components of the composite primary endpoint. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was defined as PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt; 300, with presence of infiltrates on chest x-ray, independently of lung opacities distribution and characteristics.</description>
