    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single centre, parallel group study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of retigabine XR formulation in healthy adult Japanese&#xD;
      subjects. To compare the pharmacokinetic and safety profile, Caucasian subjects are also&#xD;
      incorporated. This study is intended to facilitate inclusion of Japanese patients in the&#xD;
      global phase III program for retigabine XR formulation.&#xD;

             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and&#xD;
             12-lead ECG. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside&#xD;
             the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the&#xD;
             Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to&#xD;
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight ≥ 50 kg and BMI within the range 18.5 - 24.9 kg/m2 (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;

             time of the first dose of study medication until 1 week post-last dose&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is&#xD;
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Single QTcB or QTcF&lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block.&#xD;
&#xD;

             poses a significant suicide risk. Evidence of serious suicide risk may include any&#xD;
             history of suicidal behavior in the past 6 months and/or any suicidal ideation of type&#xD;
             4 or 5 on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibody or HIV&#xD;

             proof distilled spirits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational&#xD;

             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study&#xD;
             procedures or compromise subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a&#xD;
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.&#xD;
