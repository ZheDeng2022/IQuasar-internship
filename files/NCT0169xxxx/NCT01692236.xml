      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection appears to cause problems with blood vessel&#xD;
      function. These problems may add to some thinking and mood disorders found in people with HIV&#xD;
      infection. Researchers want to evaluate HIV infected patients to see if blood vessel function&#xD;
      contributes to thinking and mood disorders, such as early dementia and depression. To do so,&#xD;
      they will compare study results between people with and people without HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the thickness of blood vessel walls between people with and without HIV&#xD;
           infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the relationship between blood vessel thickness and thinking and mood&#xD;
           disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 25 and 55 years of age who have HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy individuals between 25 and 55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have imaging studies of the brain and major blood vessels in the head&#xD;
           and neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also have neuropsychological testing. These tests will look at memory,&#xD;
           learning and thinking ability, attention, and mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have the option of coming back for repeat blood tests every six months&#xD;
           and repeat imaging studies and neuropsychological tests every year, over 1- 4 years&#xD;
           period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      With combination antiretroviral therapy, HIV/AIDS has been transformed from a progressive,&#xD;
      usually fatal infection to a manageable chronic condition. Yet, HIV associated neurocognitive&#xD;
      disorders (HAND) pose a significant clinical problem, even among patients with controlled HIV&#xD;
      viremia. There is evidence of accelerated vascular aging and other vascular disorders in&#xD;
      HIV-infected (HIV+) people, and studies suggest an association between vascular disorders and&#xD;
      unfavorable neurocognitive outcomes. Thus, one possible contributing factor to the high rates&#xD;
      of HANDs and depression could be vascular dysfunction, similar to vascular depression and&#xD;
      vascular dementia that occur in elderly non-HIV+ individuals. One commonly used diagnostic&#xD;
      marker of vasculopathy is thickening of the vessel wall. Multiple studies have already&#xD;
      established the correlation between vessel wall thickening and vascular disease&#xD;
      manifestations. This prospective observational study aims to examine the relationships&#xD;
      between neurocognitive and depression outcomes and vessel wall thickness as a marker of&#xD;
      vascular disease in HIV+ adults. We will be using neuropsychological testing, brain imaging,&#xD;
      blood biomarkers, and state-of-the-art high-resolution MR imaging of the carotid vessel&#xD;
      walls. HIV infected patients (n=40) and HIV-negative controls (n=40) will be recruited.&#xD;
      Participants who consent to longitudinal follow-up will be followed for two years with&#xD;
      clinical evaluations every 6 months and repeat imaging studies at 12 and 24 months. Cross&#xD;
      sectional data analysis will compare markers of vascular and neurocognitive disorders between&#xD;
      HIV-infected and HIV-negative participants. The longitudinal data analysis will assess and&#xD;
      compare the temporal progression of vascular disease (imaging and blood biomarker findings)&#xD;
      in relation to changes in neurocognitive and depression scores in both groups.&#xD;
