    <description>PF-05206388 will be provided as a Retinal Pigment Epithelium living tissue equivalent for intraocular use in the form of a monolayer of Retinal Pigmented Epithelial (RPE) cells immobilized on a polyester membrane. The membrane is approximately 6 mm x 3 mm and will contain a confluent layer of RPE cells, at a nominal dose of 17 mm2. The implant is intended to be life-long.</description>
