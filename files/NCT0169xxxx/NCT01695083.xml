      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatty liver most frequently corresponds to a fat overload of the liver. It is usually&#xD;
      classified as alcoholic steatosis or non-alcoholic steatosis. In the case of non alcoholic&#xD;
      fatty liver overload, the histological spectrum ranges from simple steatosis to&#xD;
      steatohepatitis (NASH) which associates inflammation to steatosis, with a risk of progression&#xD;
      to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Obese patients are at particular risk of NASH. Screening of these&#xD;
      hepatic lesions is difficult especially as they may exist while the liver tests are normal.&#xD;
      The diagnosis of NASH is currently done by liver biopsy, which exposes them in particular to&#xD;
      the risk of hemorrhagic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects required:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the literature and data collected Louis Mourier in the recent years, the&#xD;
      inclusion of 200 patients would examine 20-40 patients with severe histological steatosis and&#xD;
      steatohepatitis. All patients will be included in Louis Mourier hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: one month Search duration: 37 months Duration inclusions: 36 months The total&#xD;
      duration of participation for a patient will be one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a monocentric, prospective study evaluating the value of noninvasive tests for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of hepatic lesions in morbid obese patients. The &quot;open &quot; MRI system allows access&#xD;
      to MRI for all obese patients (maximum weight 250 kg). Three of such systems are available in&#xD;
      France and liver pathology can be explored only on the system of Louis Mourier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reference method is liver histology; studied tests are abdominal MRI, Fibroscan / CAP,&#xD;
      and serum tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examinations required specifically for research Examinations required specifically for the&#xD;
      research is abdominal MRI, FibroScan/ CAP and serum tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate the use of abdominal MRI, the FibroScan/ CAP and serum tests for finding severe&#xD;
      steatosis and / or NASH, specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values of&#xD;
      these tests are calculated. The gold standard is the result of histology on liver biopsy,&#xD;
      with a morphometric study of these parameters. ROC curves are used to determine the best&#xD;
      compromise between sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints were:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histological lesions of liver fibrosis. Quantification of abdominal fat by MRI (in the form&#xD;
      of three variables of interest: quantification of the surface of the visceral fat, of&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat and of intrahepatic fat assessed by the percentage loss of signal&#xD;

      Main objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study was to determine in patients with morbid obesity waiting for&#xD;
      bariatric surgery, the accuracy of non-invasive tests for diagnosis of severe steatosis and /&#xD;
      or NASH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard is liver biopsy with a morphometric study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive tests will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum tests: the FibroMax (which includes the NASH test, FibroTest and SteatoTest) and&#xD;
           FibroMeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiological examinations: MRI and FibroScan / CAP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine the accuracy of these non-invasive tests for the diagnosis of severe&#xD;
           steatosis alone, steatohepatitis (NASH or) and hepatic fibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine the best combination of these tests to better evaluate the presence of&#xD;
           severe steatosis, NASH and a hepatic fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to quantify MRI visceral and subcutaneous fat in morbidly obese patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Judging Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary endpoint To validate the use of serum tests, FibroScan / CAP abdominal MRI for&#xD;
           the diagnosis of severe steatosis and / or NASH (specificity, sensitivity, positive and&#xD;
           negative predictive values). The gold standard is the result of histology on liver&#xD;
           biopsy, with a morphometric study. For each diagnostic test, a ROC curve is used to&#xD;
           determine the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The histological diagnosis of severe steatosis is defined by the presence of hepatic&#xD;
           steatosis grade 3 or higher. The diagnosis of NASH is defined by the presence of lobular&#xD;
           inflammation with neutrophils and hepatocytes ballooning.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Histological lesions of liver fibrosis Quantification of abdominal fat by MRI (in the&#xD;
           form of three variables of interest: quantification of the surface of the visceral fat&#xD;
           from the surface of the subcutaneous fat and the amount of intrahepatic fat assessed by&#xD;
           the percentage loss of signal).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methodology and expected number of patients in research&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a prospective study evaluating the value of noninvasive tests for the diagnosis&#xD;
           of hepatic lesions in morbid obese patients. The MRI system &quot;open&quot; allows access to&#xD;
           obese patients. Three such systems are available in France and liver pathology is&#xD;
           supported only on the system of Louis Mourier.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The reference method is liver histology; tests studied are MRI abdominal Fibroscan /&#xD;
           CAP, and serum tests (FibroTest, FibroMeter, SteatoTest, NASH test).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be conducted in 200 obese patients who will have a liver biopsy performed&#xD;
           during bariatric surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tests for the detection of steatosis (fat quantification of intrahepatic MRI&#xD;
                measurement of steatosis by CAP, serum tests) and evaluating histological steatosis&#xD;
                (main objective)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tests for the detection of NASH (test serum) and histology&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tests of fibrosis (serum tests; FibroScan) and histological data assessing&#xD;
                fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The duration and extent of obesity (BMI) and biological data (HOMA-test) will be taken&#xD;
           into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examinations required specifically for research&#xD;
&#xD;
           Liver biopsy is routinely performed intraoperatively in the routine monitoring of&#xD;
           patients for bariatric surgery, examinations specific to the research are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum tests&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  FibroScan / CAP&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Abdominal MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
           Risk / risk absences The sting at blood sampling can cause the formation of a small&#xD;
           hematoma without gravity, which will subside spontaneously within a few days.&#xD;
&#xD;
           FibroScan ® / CAP presents no risk of side effects. Liver MRI shows no risk if the&#xD;
           cons-indications are respected. Wearing a stack (pacemaker) or any element that contains&#xD;
           the iron near the eyes or head are contra-indications as are a major risk factor (risk&#xD;
           of death, blindness). The presence of a heart valve or a stent (also called metal&#xD;
           prosthesis) is not an absolute contra-indication-and their compatibility with MRI will&#xD;
           be verified before completion of the examination, as is the case in practice clinic ..&#xD;
&#xD;
           Liver biopsy, which is part of the examinations carried out in a systematic way without&#xD;
           any protocol adds no additional risk to the surgical&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study site&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be conducted at Louis Mourier, a reference center for the treatment of&#xD;
           obesity, which has an open system allowing access to obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Indications for bariatric surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indications for bariatric surgery at Louis Mourier, a reference center for the treatment of&#xD;
      obesity, are consistent with the recommendations of the HAS in 2009, based on professional&#xD;
      consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is indicated in patients with all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. BMI ≥ 40 or BMI ≥ 35 with comorbid&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. failure (s) prior (s) of the conventional treatment of obesity combined dietary,&#xD;
           physical activity and behavioral therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. appraisal nutritionally: global, personal and non-surgical&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. considered only after medical treatment for a minimum of 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. well-informed and motivated patients, with acceptable surgical risks&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. obesity stable (or worsening) for five years&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. absence of endocrine pathology (adrenal, thyroid) may be due to obesity&#xD;
