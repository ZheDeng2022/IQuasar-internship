  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open label, prospective, non-randomized single arm study. Combination of two treatment&#xD;
      modalities - HAI with FUDR and systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous gemcitabine in combination with&#xD;
      intravenous cisplatin and intra-arterial FUDR. Definition of safety and toxicity of this&#xD;
      combined regional and systemic treatment approach. Definition of the response rate after 3&#xD;
      months of hepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy with continuous infusion FUDR with or without&#xD;
      ligation of the right or left portal vein, in combination with 3 months of systemic cisplatin&#xD;
      and gemcitabine in patients with unresectable intrahepatic or hilar CCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 9-18 patients are required. 3-6 patients per dose level. A maximum of three dose&#xD;
      levels (1 - 3) has been defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methodology: Traditional 3+3 dosing algorithm to find MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trial with medicinal product&#xD;

    <measure>Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of intravenous gemcitabine with concomitant administration of FUDR-HAI and intravenous cisplatin.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dose limiting toxicities will be assessed to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine in combination with fixed doses of cisplatin and FUDR. DLTs are per protocol prespecified AE or laboratory abnormalities observed during the first 6 weeks of study treatment. The MTD is one dose level below the dose level that caused DLTs in â‰¥ one third of patients (2 or more in a cohort of 6 patients), as determined by a traditional 3+3 algorithm.</description>
