    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether, in individuals with diabetic neuropathy, a&#xD;
      low-fat, vegan diet in combination with a vitamin B12 supplement improves pain, sensation and&#xD;
      other subjective symptoms, more effectively than a vitamin B12 supplement with no diet&#xD;
      changes. The principal measure is pain as measured by the following assessment tools:&#xD;
      Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument, Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire, Neuropathy&#xD;
      Impairment Score - Lower Limbs, Neuropathy Total Symptom Score, Neuropathy Pain Scale, McGill&#xD;
      Pain Questionnaire and Global Impression Scale. The study duration is 20 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study also examines the effects of a low-fat, vegan diet on mood, using the Center for&#xD;
      Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised, and the Beck Depression Inventory.&#xD;

      The following determinations will be made at baseline, mid-point, and end of each 20-week&#xD;
      study period, as well as at one-year follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General status, symptoms, and medication accounting. Participants will be asked to report&#xD;
      changes in their health and medication use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease Activity. The following assessments will be used to measure pain and changes in&#xD;
      sensory perception related to diabetic neuropathy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument. The MNSI questionnaire consists of 15&#xD;
           questions followed by a single 8-point clinical examination involving inspection of the&#xD;
           foot, assessment of ankle reflexes, and semi-quantitative determination of vibration&#xD;
           perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire Norfolk QOL-DN is a 47-item questionnaire&#xD;
           developed by the Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, VA, for assessing subjects'&#xD;
           perception of the effects of diabetes and diabetic neuropathy. It consists of 28 items&#xD;
           pertaining specifically to to small fiber, large fiber and autonomic nerve function&#xD;
           symptoms, and activities of daily living (ADL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropathy Impairment Score for Lower Limbs (NIS-LL) The NIS-LL is the lower limb&#xD;
           component of the full Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) and has 3 domains including:&#xD;
           muscle weakness, reflexes, and sensation. The maximum score is 88 points. Based on&#xD;
           experience with and data collected from these clinical trials, the Peripheral Nerve&#xD;
           Society considers a 2 point change on the NIS-LL to correspond to a meaningful change in&#xD;
           clinical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropathy Total Symptoms Score (NTSS-6) Neuropathy total symptom score-6 (NTSS-6) is a&#xD;
           neuropathy sensory symptom scale that is designed to evaluate the frequency and&#xD;
           intensity of individual neuropathy sensory symptoms identified frequently by patients&#xD;
           with DPN. A total of six questions are synthesized to identify and quantify the specific&#xD;
           positive and negative symptoms associated with sensory deficits in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropathy Pain Scale In order to assess and differentiate qualities of pain, Galer and&#xD;
           Jensen developed the Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS) in 1997. The NPS is composed of 10&#xD;
           items that assess two global pain domains including pain intensity and unpleasantness,&#xD;
           and six pain qualities, including sharp, hot, dull, cold, sensitive, and itchy pain, in&#xD;
           two dimensions (internal and cutaneous).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  McGill Pain Questionnaire The McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) is used to specify&#xD;
           subjective pain experience using sensory, affective and evaluative word descriptors. The&#xD;
           short form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) contains 11 questions referring to&#xD;
           the sensory dimension of the pain experience and four related to the affective&#xD;
           dimension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Global Impression Scale Global impression scale (GIS) is also termed global rating of&#xD;
           change scales (GRC) and was developed to assess patients' overall improvement or&#xD;
           deterioration in a clinical setting, and has been frequently used in musculoskeletal and&#xD;
           chronic pain trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Height. Height will be measured at baseline (only) with participants standing barefoot with&#xD;
      their backs to a wall-mounted stadiometer and heels against the wall, recorded to the nearest&#xD;
      0.5 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body weight. With participants wearing light, indoor clothing but without shoes, body weight&#xD;
      will be measured to the nearest 0.1 kg, using a digital scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure. A digital blood pressure monitor and a cuff of a size appropriate to the&#xD;
      participant's arm will be used. The cuff size for each participant will be recorded for&#xD;
      consistency of use at each visit. Participants will be asked to remove all clothing that&#xD;
      covers the location of cuff placement and then rest in a seated position for 5 minutes with&#xD;
      legs uncrossed, without talking or reading. The back and arm will be supported such that the&#xD;
      middle of the cuff on the upper arm is at the level of the right atrium (the mid-point of the&#xD;
      sternum). Three measurements will be taken at 1-minute intervals. The first measurement will&#xD;
      be disregarded, and the mean of the remaining 2 measurements will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrations will be measured using the Olympus&#xD;
      Cholesterol Reagent on Olympus Chemistry Analyzers. HDL-cholesterol will be measured directly&#xD;
      using the HDL-C plus 3rd generation test with the Roche direct HDL-cholesterol assay.Low&#xD;
      density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration will be estimated using the Friedewald&#xD;
      equation. Plasma triglyceride levels will be measured using Olympus Chemistry analyzers from&#xD;
      Quest Diagnostics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive Metabolic Panel. These values will be evaluated at baseline, 20 weeks, and&#xD;
      one-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemoglobin A1c. Hemoglobin A1c will be measured in whole blood using the COBAS INTEGRA on&#xD;
      Roche clinical chemistry analyzers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose. Plasma glucose will be measured using an Olympus Chemistry Analyzer from Quest&#xD;
      Diagnostics, Baltimore, MD, USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary albumin and creatinine will be assessed on spot urine samples. Samples for the&#xD;
      albumin assay will be tested using the K-Assay High-Sensitive Microalbumin assay from Quest&#xD;
      Diagnostics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apolipoprotein E (APOE): Participants who consent to this aspect of the study will be&#xD;
      genotyped for the ε2, ε3, and ε4 alleles. A sample of approximately 5 ml of the participant's&#xD;
      blood is required and will be drawn simultaneously with the 20-week health assessment labs.&#xD;
      Individuals with diabetes are at greatly increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease,&#xD;
      and some studies have suggested that the effect of saturated fat intake on Alzheimer's risk&#xD;
      may be most evident in (or even limited to) carriers of the APOEε4 allele. The ApoE protein&#xD;
      produced by the APOE gene is a major plasma apolipoprotein and the primary cholesterol&#xD;
      carrier in the brain [62]. As a group, these individuals have higher plasma LDL&#xD;
      concentrations, compared with APOEε3 homozygotes [63] Moreover, APOE status may influence the&#xD;
      relationship between dietary intake and plasma lipid concentrations [63]. APOE determination&#xD;
      may provide useful information as to who benefits from dietary changes that aim to modify&#xD;
      plasma lipid concentrations, with implications for subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      and Alzheimer's disease. The blood test will be drawn once, at the 20-week health assessment&#xD;
      only. This test will be optional. If participants decide not to do the test, it will not&#xD;
      affect their status in the study. The blood samples that are collected will be used for APOE&#xD;
      allele testing for this study only. All samples will be destroyed after analysis and no part&#xD;
      of the specimen will be retained per policy of Quest Diagnostics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genotyping for Taq1 A and Taq1B polymorphisms. Participants who consent to this aspect of the&#xD;
      study will be genotyped for the A1 and B1 alleles, using the PCR method [64] A sample of&#xD;
      approximately 5 ml of the participant's blood is required and will be drawn simultaneously&#xD;
      with the 20-week health assessment labs. Studies suggest that the A1 allele of the Taq1A&#xD;
      polymorphism (rs1800497), located ≈10 kb downstream of the D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) gene,&#xD;
      may influence dietary behavior and response to treatment. Individuals with the A1 allele&#xD;
      generally have a lower-than-normal complement of dopamine receptors (DRD2) in the human&#xD;
      brain, and are more likely than others to engage in smoking, substance abuse, and compulsive&#xD;
      gambling [65]. The prevalence of A1 and B1 alleles of the DRD2 gene is strongly associated&#xD;
      with severe alcoholism [66]. Further, the A1 allele is also common among obese individuals&#xD;
      [67]. We identified this allele in approximately half of individuals with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      participating in a research study [68]. The possibility that genetic factors may influence&#xD;
      dietary behavior may mean that extended support is essential for facilitating dietary&#xD;
      transitions among many, if not all, individuals with diabetes. In group settings, support can&#xD;
      be engaging and cost effective. The blood test will be drawn once, at the 20-week health&#xD;
      assessment only. This test will be optional. If participants decide not to do the test, it&#xD;
      will not affect their status in the study. The blood samples that are collected will be used&#xD;
      for TaqA1 allele testing for this study only. All samples will be destroyed after analysis&#xD;
      and no part of the specimen will be retained per policy of The Biological Samples Processing&#xD;
      Core Facility (BSPC) at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin biopsy. A single skin biopsy (3 millimeters in diameter and 4 millimeters in depth) will&#xD;
      be removed from one of three sites on the leg at baseline and 20 week health assessment, as&#xD;
      well as at one year follow up. The epidermal nerve fiber density test is the only objective&#xD;
      test currently available for assessing small fiber neuropathy. A physician or experienced&#xD;
      health care professional will clean the skin with alcohol pads and anaesthetize the skin by&#xD;
      administering 2% lidocaine with epinephrine. The biopsy will be performed using a 3mm&#xD;
      disposable, circular punch. The biopsies will be immediately placed in a fixative container,&#xD;
      and then placed into a cooler with an ice pack. The samples will then be shipped for&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-day dietary record: A 2-day dietary record will be used to assess macro- and micronutrient&#xD;
      intakes. Participants will be given the option to complete a manual or online version&#xD;
      (online: http://riskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/instruments/asa24/) for collecting and&#xD;
      calculating diet and nutrient intake. Participants will need Internet access if they choose&#xD;
      to do an online version. If necessary, digitized records will be analyzed using Nutrition&#xD;
      Data Systems for Research software (University of Minnesota), by a registered dietitian&#xD;
      certified by the Nutrition Coordinating Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24-Hour Multi-Pass Dietary Recalls. At weeks 3 and 12, a registered dietitian will make&#xD;
      unannounced telephone calls to each participant to administer a 24-hour diet recall, using a&#xD;
      multi-pass approach (Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis,&#xD;
      MN). These recalls will not be subjected to statistical analysis, but will allow the&#xD;
      investigators to check for poor adherence. The ASA-24 is a software tool developed by&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute. It enables automated and self-administered 24-hour dietary&#xD;
      recalls. The format and design of ASA-24 are based on a modified version of the&#xD;
      interviewer-administered Automated Multiple Pass Method (AMPM) 24-hour recall developed by&#xD;
      the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Participants will be provided a user name, password, and&#xD;
      link to the ASA-24 online diet recall Web site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Eating Inventory is a highly reliable 51-item questionnaire providing quantitative&#xD;
      measures of dietary restraint, disinhibition, and hunger. It will serve as a gauge of ease in&#xD;
      adapting to the intervention diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form assesses recent physical&#xD;
      activity patterns. The method is highly reliable; an assessment of test-retest repeatability&#xD;
      produced a correlation of 0.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clinical Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (CESD-R) assesses mood. The CES-D&#xD;
      is a 20-item self-report measure designed originally for use among the general population. It&#xD;
      measures the frequency with which participants have experienced a specific symptom within the&#xD;
      preceding week, using a four-point rating scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) assesses mood. It is the most widely used&#xD;
      instrument for detecting depression. The questions on the BDI-II are in alignment with DSM-IV&#xD;
      criteria. Each item is a list of four statements arranged in increasing severity about a&#xD;
      particular symptom of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall quality of life will be assessed using the SF-36, which is a brief health survey with&#xD;
      36 questions. The SF-36 provides psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary&#xD;
      measures. The SF-36 is a general measure that has been administered across various age&#xD;
      groups, disease spectra, and treatment regimens. Items on the SF-36 are scored on a scale of&#xD;
      0-100, with a higher score indicating better health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medications. Participants in both groups will be asked to keep their medications constant and&#xD;
      to add no new nutritional supplements to their current medication regimen, except as&#xD;
      recommended by their personal physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions for the diet and supplement group and supplement-only group are described&#xD;
      below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The diet and supplement group will be asked to follow a low-fat, vegan diet and take a&#xD;
           daily vitamin B12 supplement of 1000mcg of methylcobalamin for 20 weeks. According to&#xD;
           the American Dietetic Association, vegan and vegetarian diets meet all nutritional&#xD;
           requirements when appropriately planned.The diet consists of whole grains, vegetables,&#xD;
           legumes, and fruits, with no restriction on energy intake. Animal products, added oils,&#xD;
           and sugars will be excluded. In choosing grain products and starchy vegetables (e.g.,&#xD;
           bread, potatoes), participants will be encouraged to select those retaining their&#xD;
           natural fiber and having a glycemic index &lt;70, using tables standardized to a value of&#xD;
           100 for glucose. No meals will be provided. Participants will handle their own food&#xD;
           preparation and purchases, with guidance from the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be provided with a commercially available supplement containing&#xD;
           vitamin B12 and asked to take it daily during the study. Should they wish to continue&#xD;
           the diet thereafter, they will be counseled to use any standard multivitamin or other&#xD;
           reliable source of vitamin B12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The supplement-only group will follow an unrestricted diet, but will be given the&#xD;
           identical vitamin B12 supplement of 1000mcg of methylcobalamin as the diet group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before randomization, participants will be told that they will either be assigned to a diet&#xD;
      and supplement intervention group or a supplement-only group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both groups, alcoholic beverages will be limited to one per day for women, and two for&#xD;
      men.&#xD;
