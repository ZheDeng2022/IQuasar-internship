      -  Recipient desensitization protocols were shown to enable successful living donor kidney&#xD;
           transplantation across major ABO blood group barriers. For extracorporeal depletion of&#xD;
           circulating ABO antibodies plasmapheresis or ABO blood group specific immunoadsorption&#xD;
           (IA) are most commonly used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The efficiency of semiselective non-antigen specific IA in ABO-incompatible&#xD;
           transplantation is currently not well established. One potential drawback of&#xD;
           semiselective adsorbers could be an incomplete elimination of IgM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This randomized controlled crossover trial was designed to clarify whether membrane&#xD;
           filtration, as an adjunct to semiselective IA, can substantially enhance elimination of&#xD;
           IgM.&#xD;

      -Background and study aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABO-incompatible living donor kidney transplantation offers the possibility to expand the&#xD;
      donor pool by approximately 30%. A variety of different desensitization protocols were shown&#xD;
      to enable successful transplantation across major ABO barriers. In this context, apheresis&#xD;
      for antibody depletion represents the therapeutic mainstay. Two distinct technical&#xD;
      principles, plasmapheresis and ABO antigen-specific immunoadsorption, were shown to allow for&#xD;
      excellent short- and intermediate-term outcomes. A particular technical advantage of&#xD;
      immunoadsorption may be its high selectivity regarding antibody depletion, which precludes&#xD;
      major losses of essential plasma constituents, including coagulation factors and albumin,&#xD;
      even after treatment of large plasma volumes. Nevertheless, high treatment costs associated&#xD;
      with the use of ABO-specific columns (that are not approved for reuse) may limit their&#xD;
      widespread clinical application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficiency of semi-selective immunoadsorption technologies regarding ABO antibody&#xD;
      depletion and recipient desensitization is less well established. Theoretically,&#xD;
      non-antigen-specific immunoglobulin depletion using protein A-, GAM peptide-, or anti-Ig&#xD;
      antibody-based adsorbers, could bring about several advantages, such as lower treatment costs&#xD;
      associated with the use of reusable twin columns, and the potential to simultaneously deplete&#xD;
      antibodies also against HLA antigens. A critical drawback, however, may be an evident&#xD;
      inefficiency regarding (ABO-specific) IgM depletion, and this could pose a considerable risk&#xD;
      of rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One strategy to overcome the drawback of incomplete IgM depletion could be the use of&#xD;
      semiselective immunoadsorption combined with other antibody depletion technologies. In this&#xD;
      context, one attractive option could be an enhancement of antibody elimination by connecting&#xD;
      a membrane filter (cascade filter) to the immunoadsorption device. We propose to conduct an&#xD;
      open randomized crossover study that is designed to see if membrane filtration when applied&#xD;
      as an adjunct to semiselective immunoadsorption (GAM peptide adsorbers) is able to enhance&#xD;
      anti-ABO IgM elimination to an extent comparable to ABO antigen-specific immunoadsorption.&#xD;
      The results of this study, which will enrol 14 patients receiving IA treatment for clinical&#xD;
      indications outside the transplantation field, are expected to provide a valuable basis for&#xD;
      the use of combined apheresis approaches in the context of ABO-incompatible kidney&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Who can participate?&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are planning to recruit 14 adult patients (&gt;18 years, both genders eligible, healthy&#xD;
      volunteers not accepted) that are subject to regular routine IA therapy at &gt;1 weekly&#xD;
      intervals for clinical indications that are not related to ABO-incompatible transplantation&#xD;
      (antibody-mediated autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or myasthenia&#xD;
      gravis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      -What does the study involve?&#xD;
&#xD;
      For membrane filtration, we will use a membrane filter with documented capacity to eliminate&#xD;
      plasma IgM. The study will be conducted in a randomized crossover design (AB vs. BA design;&#xD;
      stratified randomization). Treatment consists in IA plus membrane filtration (A) or IA as the&#xD;
      sole treatment (B), respectively. The primary study endpoint is the percent reduction of ABO&#xD;
      blood group specific IgM. The study is powered to detect a 30% increase in IgM elimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?&#xD;
&#xD;
      We do not expect any direct benefits for the study subjects. This pilot study, however, may&#xD;
      provide a valuable basis for a future trial evaluating the clinical impact of combined IA&#xD;
      plus membrane filtration in ABO incompatible transplantation. Potential risks include:&#xD;
      adverse reactions upon exposure to polysulfone (rash, pruritus, fever), reduction in&#xD;
      fibrinogen levels and eventually a transient increase in the risk of bleeding.&#xD;
