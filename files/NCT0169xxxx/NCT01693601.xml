  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, single arm, dose finding study to assess safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      the oral combination of Panobinostat and Ruxolitinib in patients with myelofibrosis (MF) in&#xD;
      chronic and accelerated phase.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase I/II open label, single institution, combination therapy trial of induction Ruxolitinib&#xD;
      followed by combination with Panobinostat in dose escalation cohorts with a primary endpoint&#xD;
      of determining the safety and tolerability of combination therapy in patients with&#xD;
      myelofibrosis (MF) in chronic and accelerated phase. A 3+3standard dose escalation scheme&#xD;
      will be employed and the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be captured and&#xD;
      the occurrence of such events will determine dose cohort escalation by predetermined and&#xD;
      established rules. In addition to establishing the DLTs, maximally tolerated dose (MTD), and&#xD;
      recommended phase II dose (RPTD) in the phase I portion of this trial, exploratory biomarkers&#xD;
      will be evaluated within phase I as well. Pharmacodynamics and exploratory genetic and&#xD;
      epigenetic biomarkers will be explored as predictors of response to therapy. The RPTD cohort&#xD;
      will be expanded to incorporate a total of 22 patients, including 6 from phase I, in order to&#xD;
      assess clinical response as assessed by International Working Group for Myelofibrosis&#xD;
      Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) as a primary endpoint for the phase II portion of this&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
