  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past 30 years much has been learned about the molecular genetics and natural history&#xD;
      of familial forms of hematuria. However, enhanced understanding of these conditions has yet&#xD;
      to generate effective therapies for Alport syndrome(AS), the form of familial hematuria&#xD;
      associated with end-stage renal disease. Males with AS inevitably develop end-stage kidney&#xD;
      failure, with a 50% likelihood of dialysis or kidney transplantation by age 25 years. There&#xD;
      is no proven treatment for AS, although studies in animals have suggested several promising&#xD;
      potential therapies. Pharmacological or biological treatments that might delay or prevent the&#xD;
      development of kidney failure exist, but need to be evaluated through clinical trials.&#xD;
      Researchers interested in implementing clinical trials in AS will face several challenges,&#xD;
      the foremost of which is the relative rarity of the disease, necessitating aggressive efforts&#xD;
      to identify and recruit potential subjects for multi-center collaborative clinical trials.&#xD;
      The Alport Syndrome Research Collaborative (ARC) was established in 2009 as a partnership of&#xD;
      the Alport Syndrome Treatments and Outcomes Registry (ASTOR), the European Alport Registry&#xD;
      and centers of AS research in Canada, China and France with the objective of testing&#xD;
      potential treatments to delay or prevent terminal renal failure in people with AS. In this&#xD;
      feasibility study the five ARC centers will interrogate existing AS registries and databases,&#xD;
      and monitor accrual of new AS cases over an 18-month period, in order to quantify subjects in&#xD;
      the disease categories of interest. As part of this project we will examine the utility of&#xD;
      urinary uromodulin excretion as a marker of kidney injury and potential trial endpoint in AS&#xD;
      clinical trials. Our goals are to (1) demonstrate that participating centers have access to&#xD;
      sufficient numbers of males and females with AS to populate adequately-powered clinical&#xD;
      trials focused on two clinical targets, microalbuminuria and overt proteinuria, and (2) to&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that in males with AS urinary uromodulin excretion decreases as&#xD;
      albuminuria and proteinuria increase and that uromodulin offers an independent and insightful&#xD;
      measure of renal fibrosis and response to therapy.&#xD;

      The specific aims of this multi-site study are two-fold. The first aim is to demonstrate that&#xD;
      the Alport syndrome (AS) populations available to us through our registries and clinical&#xD;
      networks include sufficient numbers of affected subjects in the early stages of the AS&#xD;
      nephropathy to reach specific recruitment targets. The clinical populations thus identified&#xD;
      will form the basis of a future RO1 proposal for funding of a clinical trial. The second aim&#xD;
      is to examine urinary uromodulin excretion and its relationship to urinary albumin excretion&#xD;
      in early AS, to assess the utility of urinary uromodulin as a marker of renal tubular injury&#xD;
      in AS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five regional recruitment centers in the United States, Canada, China, France and Germany&#xD;
      will interrogate existing AS registries and databases, and monitor accrual of new AS cases&#xD;
      over an 18-month period, in order to quantify subjects in four disease categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal albumin excretion (albumin/creatinine ratio [ACR] &lt; 30 mg/g), on no treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Microalbuminuria (ACR &gt; 30 mg/g, protein/creatinine ratio [Prot/Cr] &lt; 0.2 mg/mg), on no&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overt proteinuria (Prot/Cr &gt; 0. 2 mg/mg), on no treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overt proteinuria (Prot/Cr &gt; 0.2 mg/mg), despite treatment with an angiotensin&#xD;
           converting enzyme inhibitor&#xD;

&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2&#xD;
&#xD;
      United States (only): We have a repository of 410 frozen urine samples from AS males with&#xD;
      normal albumin excretion, microalbuminuria (MA) or proteinuria, including 46 males with 2 or&#xD;
      more serial samples. We will use stored urine samples to measure uromodulin concentrations.&#xD;
      To determine whether urine uromodulin excretion decreases as AS progresses, we will compare&#xD;
      urine uromodulin creatinine ratios (UCR) in these groups. We will also measure urine&#xD;
      albumin:uromodulin ratios (AUR), and analyze whether an increase in AUR precedes the increase&#xD;
      in ACR. There will be 20 patients in each group. Results will be compared by chi squared&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although Alport syndrome (AS) is a major genetic cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in&#xD;
      children and young adults, no clinical trials to test therapies aimed at delaying or halting&#xD;
      the progression of the AS nephropathy have been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AS accounts for about 2% of children with chronic kidney disease, children on dialysis, and&#xD;
      pediatric renal transplant recipients in the U.S. AS arises from mutations in genes encoding&#xD;
      the α3α4α5 type IV collagen network of glomerular, cochlear and ocular basement membranes.&#xD;
      About 80% of AS families have X-linked disease (XLAS) due to mutations in the COL4A5 gene,&#xD;
      which encodes the type IV collagen α5 chain. XLAS males progress inexorably to ESRD, with&#xD;
      ESRD risks of 50% by age 25, 90% by age 40 and nearly 100% by age 60. Age at ESRD is strongly&#xD;
      correlated with genotype. ESRD risk by age 30 is 90% for deletions and nonsense mutations,&#xD;
      70% for splicing mutations and 50% for missense mutations. XLAS females exhibit a lower but&#xD;
      significant risk of ESRD: 12% by age 45, 30% by age 60 and 40% by age 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While renal transplantation for AS has excellent outcomes, therapies capable of delaying ESRD&#xD;
      would enhance the lives of affected patients and families and likely reduce costs of care.&#xD;
      Several therapies improve outcomes in animal models of AS, including angiotensin converting&#xD;
      enzyme inhibition (ACEi, AT1-receptor blockage (ARB), inhibition of TGF-β1, matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinases, vasopeptidase A (11), or HMG-CoA reductase; chemokine receptor 1&#xD;
      blockade, BMP-7, stem cells and irradiation. In ARAS mice, initiation of ACEi therapy before&#xD;
      onset of proteinuria suppressed proteinuria and azotemia and doubled length of survival;&#xD;
      smaller but still significant improvements in outcome occurred when ACEi was started after&#xD;
      onset of proteinuria. ACEi therapy begun before onset of proteinuria lengthened survival in&#xD;
      canine XLAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the complete lack of controlled trials demonstrating that ACEi/ARB alter the course&#xD;
      of human AS nephropathy, many AS patients receive empiric treatment with ACEi/ARB. In&#xD;
      response to a survey we conducted via the Pediatric Nephrology listserv in 2007, 97% of 107&#xD;
      pediatric nephrologists reported that they empirically treat children with AS in order to&#xD;
      preserve renal function. 70% initiate treatment, almost always with ACEi or ARB, once&#xD;
      patients have developed overt proteinuria. Thus, most pediatric nephrologists are treating&#xD;
      children with AS with agents that have not been shown to alter the natural history of the&#xD;
      disease in humans. However, initiation of treatment is typically delayed until proteinuria&#xD;
      has developed, past the point at which maximum benefit was observed in animal models. The&#xD;
      survey results suggest that a placebo-controlled trial of an intervention such as ACEi for AS&#xD;
      children with normal albumin excretion or microalbuminuria would not conflict with standard&#xD;
      pediatric nephrology practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transient reduction in proteinuria by ACEi therapy was shown in one small, uncontrolled study&#xD;
      of AS patients, and in French and Chinese AS populations as described in Preliminary Studies.&#xD;
      Another small, uncontrolled study suggested that ACEi combined with aldosterone antagonism&#xD;
      had a greater suppressive effect on proteinuria in AS patients than ACEi alone. The European&#xD;
      Alport Registry is conducting an ongoing analysis of AS males treated with ACEi compared to&#xD;
      untreated historic controls; preliminary data from this study suggests a beneficial effect on&#xD;
      the timing of ESRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The challenge of AS today is to test treatments that show promise in animal studies, and to&#xD;
      compare them in terms of efficacy, adverse effects and costs. Because ACEi therapy has been&#xD;
      effective in animal studies, is relatively safe and inexpensive, and is already used&#xD;
      empirically, controlled trials are needed to test the efficacy of ACEi and the optimal timing&#xD;
      of therapy. Trials of AS therapies face several obstacles. AS is a relatively rare disease,&#xD;
      so enrollment of sufficient numbers of subjects for valid clinical trials will require&#xD;
      aggressive efforts to identify and recruit potential participants, including multi-site,&#xD;
      international collaboration. Because the AS nephropathy progresses to ESRD over decades,&#xD;
      trials based on endpoints such as rate of decline in GFR or age at onset of ESRD will be&#xD;
      difficult to fund and sustain. Parents of children with AS appear to have relatively little&#xD;
      enthusiasm for clinical trials involving serial kidney biopsy. Studies of biomarkers of&#xD;
      disease progression that could serve as clinical trial endpoints are needed. Clinical trials&#xD;
      in AS should be designed so that confounding effects of genotype on outcomes are minimized.&#xD;

      Description of University of Minnesota Central Office Role and Responsibilities&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Minnesota PI and the Alport Syndrome Treatments and Outcomes Registry&#xD;
      (ASTOR) central office staff will design and implement and monitor protocols including data&#xD;
      safety monitoring, data sharing and information dissemination activities. The central office&#xD;
      will house and manage all data generated by the multi-site study. ASTOR has established an&#xD;
      Oracle based data management system and is in ownership of the software needed to expand and&#xD;
      translate the existing system to allow for accurate transfer of clinical data from&#xD;
      participating sites for storage, retrieval, and statistical analysis. ASTOR has an existing&#xD;
      public website that will be enhanced to provide language specific (Chinese, French, German&#xD;
      and Spanish) study information related to the multi-site study objectives, organizational&#xD;
      structure and trial protocols and procedures. ASTOR will create and manage all relevant&#xD;
      electronic data collection forms and database storage systems. ASTOR staff's responsibilities&#xD;
      include the database development, management, quality control and secure transmittal of&#xD;
      de-identified subject data. ASTOR will create a generic telephone script and the data&#xD;
      obtained during the telephone conversation will be recorded on the transcript form, and the&#xD;
      entered into the database managing system. The scripts will be translated appropriately.&#xD;
