    <textblock>
      Investigation of the long-term efficacy and safety of Depigoid Birch 5000 according to the&#xD;
      perennial treatment regimen in comparison to placebo in adult and adolescent patients with&#xD;
      birch pollen-induced allergic rhinitis and/or rhinoconjunctivitis to show superiority vs.&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the study includes adolescent patients it is run under an approved PIP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study duration per patient will be 5 years: 3 years of perennial treatment (application&#xD;
      of study medication at intervals of 4-6 weeks) followed by a treatment-free observational&#xD;
      phase of 2 years (seasons).&#xD;
