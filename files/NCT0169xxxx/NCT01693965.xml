  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary infection is the most common and serious complication in the evolutionary&#xD;
      course of cystic fibrosis (CF). Administration of antibiotics adapted to infecting pathogens&#xD;
      is one of the key issues for its management. However, more than half of patients with CF have&#xD;
      chronic respiratory infections for which infectious agent remains unknown leading to&#xD;
      empirical antibiotic therapies that are not adapted to the causative agents. Recently, new&#xD;
      technologies have been applied for the description and characterization of microbial agents&#xD;
      in CF patients including molecular biology techniques that allowed us to detect and to&#xD;
      identify new and/or emerging pathogens. Moreover, more sophisticated molecular techniques&#xD;
      such as pyrosequencing and PCR amplification and cloning lead us to demonstrate the huge&#xD;
      microbial diversity associated with chronic bronchopulmonary infections in this population.&#xD;
      Otherwise, a metagenomic approach revealed the extraordinary complexity of the respiratory&#xD;
      flora in these patients and, somewhat unexpected, abundance of anaerobes, viruses, and&#xD;
      bacteriophages. In addition, it has been shown that some antibiotics commonly used in&#xD;
      clinical practice for the treatment of respiratory infections were able to induce these&#xD;
      bacteriophages, suggesting the existence of lateral gene transfer by transduction. The human&#xD;
      microbiome is the set of microbial communities associated with the human body and represents&#xD;
      all living microorganisms in the body. Its role in the immunity development has recently been&#xD;
      demonstrated suggesting that changes in this ecosystem play a critical role in evolution of&#xD;
      several human diseases. For example, in obesity it has been shown that there is a&#xD;
      relationship between the intestinal human microbiota and nutritional and metabolic status of&#xD;
      the hosts and specific alterations of these intestinal microbiota may represent a metagenomic&#xD;
      signature of this disease. Evolution of the respiratory microbiota in patients with cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis, whose nutritional status is often impaired (chronic malnutrition due to disorder of&#xD;
      digestive absorption) and receiving regular antibiotic treatments remains unknown to date.&#xD;
      Characterization of this ecosystem and its role is a critical step to understand the&#xD;
      evolutionary course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this seminal study is to describe and to characterize the respiratory&#xD;
      microbiota from sputum samples obtained from a limited number of selected patients with CF&#xD;
      from 5 regional care centers (CRCM) from South of France (Mucomed network) (2 patients per&#xD;
      center : 6 adults and 4 children), with similar clinical, microbiological and functional&#xD;
      status before and after a cure of antibiotics. Different microbiological tools will be used&#xD;
      including axenic culture systems, co-culture on amoebae in order to to isolate and to&#xD;
      identify the microbial communities. Identification of bacteria will be done using MALDI-TOF&#xD;
      mass spectrometry and/or molecular techniques. Moreover, 16S rRNA PCR amplification followed&#xD;
      by cloning and sequencing of PCR products from the same sputum sample will be carried out to&#xD;
      identify and to compare the bacterial species identified using molecular methods. In a second&#xD;
      step, once the respiratory microbiota was characterized, it will be interesting to develop a&#xD;
      dedicated microarray that will allow to detect all the bacteria identified in the first stage&#xD;
      of the project and to assess its relevance on a larger cohort of patients with CF by studying&#xD;
      the correlation between the respiratory microbiota and clinical status of patients according&#xD;
      to the prescribed antibiotic treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will open new clinical perspectives and will help us to determine the potential&#xD;
      role of antibiotics on the microbiota evolution during treatment according to regional health&#xD;
      care practices. This will contribute to better understand the role of the microbiota in the&#xD;
      evolution of these chronic respiratory infections. It could be the first step for innovative&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies, taking into account the balance of complex microbial flora and&#xD;
      possibly evolving according to antibiotic therapies. It could also form part of a larger&#xD;
      preventive strategy against transmission of specific pathogens in CF.&#xD;
