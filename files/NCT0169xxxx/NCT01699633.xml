    <textblock>
      Nevirapine is the preferred nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) for&#xD;
      treatment of HIV in children younger than 3 years old who have tuberculosis (TB) coinfection.&#xD;
      However, there is very limited data on the drug-drug interactions between rifampin and&#xD;
      nevirapine in children of this age group. The purpose of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      effect of rifampin-containing anti-TB treatment on the blood levels of nevirapine in young&#xD;
      children with HIV and TB coinfection. Also, the study will find out whether checking the&#xD;
      genetic makeup of a child could help to determine the appropriate dose of nevirapine in the&#xD;
      setting of concomitant anti-TB treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV and TB coinfection is a common and a major cause of death in children globally. Treatment&#xD;
      of the two infections together at the same time saves lives but some of the TB medications&#xD;
      have significant drug-drug interactions with commonly used antiretroviral drugs (ARVs).&#xD;
      Rifampin induces the activity of cytochorme P450 (CYP) enzymes and may reduce the blood&#xD;
      levels of important ARVs such as nevirapine or efavirenz when coadministered. The CYP enzymes&#xD;
      activity can vary from person to person depending on genetic makeup, further complicating&#xD;
      drug-drug interactions. Nevirapine undergoes extensive metabolism by hepatic CYP3A and CYP2B6&#xD;
      enzymes. The induction of CYP3A4 and 2B6 by rifampin causes a 10 - 68% reduction in&#xD;
      nevirapine exposure upon concomitant dosing in adults. Pharmacokinetic studies suggest that&#xD;
      nevirapine trough concentrations in HIV-infected children tend to be lower or sub-therapeutic&#xD;
      in children younger than 3 years old. To our knowledge, the only study that evaluated the&#xD;
      influence of rifampin on nevirapine plasma concentrations in younger children reported&#xD;
      substantial reductions in nevirapine concentrations with rifampin co-administration. It is&#xD;
      currently unclear whether using the recommended nevirapine dose (200 mg/m2 twice daily)&#xD;
      without the two-week lead-in of 200 mg/m2 once daily will overcome the risk of&#xD;
      sub-therapeutic concentrations in the setting of concomitant anti-TB treatment. This study&#xD;
      will investigate the effect of rifampin-containing anti-TB therapy on nevirapine plasma&#xD;
      concentration in children younger than 3 years old, as well as find out whether CYP2B6 and&#xD;
      CYP3A4 enzymes genetic polymorphisms influence the magnitude of the drug-drug interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific hypotheses to be tested are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rifampin-containing anti-TB therapy substantially reduces nevirapine Cmin and estimated&#xD;
           AUC0-12h in young HIV-infected children (by at least 40%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CYP2B6 extensive metabolizers have substantially lower plasma nevirapine Cmin and&#xD;
           estimated AUC0-12h in the presence than in the absence of rifampin-containing TB&#xD;
           therapy, but no significant difference in intermediate and slow metabolizers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-arm parallel assignment pharmacokinetic study in TB/HIV co-infected children will be&#xD;
      performed at the KATH. Children aged 3 - 35 months with HIV infection with or without TB&#xD;
      coinfection, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve, not previously exposed to nevirapine will be&#xD;
      enrolled. The ART regimen will consist of nevirapine 200 mg/m2 plus zidovudine (ZDV) 180 -&#xD;
      240 mg/m2 and lamivudine (3TC) 4 mg/kg twice daily in accordance with WHO guidelines. There&#xD;
      will be no lead-in dosing of nevirapine in the co-infected patients on rifampin. The dose of&#xD;
      nevirapine in the HIV mono-infected group will be 200 mg/m2 daily x 2 weeks and then twice&#xD;
      daily afterwards. Standard anti-TB therapy will be prescribed to the HIV/TB co-infected&#xD;
      patients. Anti-TB treatment will start immediately upon diagnosis. Antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      will be started as soon as anti-TB therapy is tolerated (typically within 2 to 8 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete medical history, physical examination, and staging of HIV disease will be&#xD;
      performed before initiation of ART and at subsequent study visits. Relevant data will be&#xD;
      collected using standardized forms. Baseline measurements prior to initiation of ART will&#xD;
      include complete blood count (CBC), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function tests&#xD;
      (LFTs), CD4 cell count determination and plasma HIV-1 RNA level. Measurements of CD4 cell&#xD;
      count and plasma HIV-1 RNA will be repeated at weeks 12 and 24 after starting ART. All study&#xD;
      participants will follow-up at 2 and 4 weeks, as well as monthly for assessment of treatment&#xD;
      side effects. Additional tests will be done when clinically indicated to evaluate for drug&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic testing will be performed at week 4 of ART in both arms and at 4 weeks after&#xD;
      anti-TB treatment is stopped while the child is receiving ART only in the HIV/TB co-infected&#xD;
      group. All patients will be admitted to the hospital the night prior to complete PK sampling.&#xD;
      Study drugs will be administered after at least a 2-hour fast in non-breastfed children.&#xD;
      Younger children on exclusive breast-feeding will be allowed to breast feed as needed&#xD;
      throughout the study. At each sampling time, 2 mL of blood will be collected into an EDTA&#xD;
      tube at times 0, 2, 6 and 12 hours post-dose for determination of nevirapine concentrations.&#xD;
      Actual times of sampling will be recorded. The blood samples will be centrifuged at 3000g for&#xD;
      10 minutes and plasma stored at - 70oC until measurement of plasma drug concentrations.&#xD;
      Nevirapine concentrations in plasma will be measured using validated gas chromatography with&#xD;
      mass spectrometry and nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (using NONMEM, version VI) will be&#xD;
      used to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters (CL/F, AUC, Cmin, Cmax), inter-individual error,&#xD;
      and residual error. DNA sample will stored for genotyping of drug metabolizing enzymes and&#xD;
      transporters.&#xD;
