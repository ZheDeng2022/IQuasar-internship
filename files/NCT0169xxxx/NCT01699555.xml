      of GNbAC1 in healthy male subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scientific research has shown that the expression of genes of a virus which is integrated in&#xD;
      the Human genetic material, the Multiple Sclerosis associated RetroVirus (MSRV) could play a&#xD;
      critical role in the causation of multiple sclerosis. GNbAC1 is an experimental medication,&#xD;
      which neutralizes (i.e. inactivates) a protein of MSRV that might contribute to the&#xD;
      development or deterioration of multiple sclerosis.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male healthy subjects, 18-55 years of age and in good health as determined by past&#xD;
             medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram and laboratory&#xD;
             tests at Screening and confirmed at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically acceptable for the purposes of the study sitting blood pressure and pulse&#xD;
             rate, i.e.: BP: 100 - 150 mm Hg systolic, 50 - 95 mm Hg diastolic and pulse rate: 45 -&#xD;
             100 bpm. Blood pressure and pulse will be measured after 3 minutes resting in a&#xD;
             sitting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index between 18.5 and 30.0 kg/m2 and body weight in the 50 - 95 kg range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No need for regular concomitant medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with partners of childbearing potential have to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             during, and for at least the four weeks after administration of study medication.&#xD;
             Adequate contraception is defined as usage by at least one of the partners of a&#xD;
             barrier method of contraception, together with usage by the female partner, commencing&#xD;
             at least three months prior to Screening, of a stable regimen of any form of hormonal&#xD;
             contraception or an intra-uterine device. Use of abstinence alone is not considered&#xD;
             adequate. Use of a barrier method alone is considered adequate only if the subject was&#xD;
             vasectomized at least six months prior to Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to communicate well with the investigator and comply with the requirements of&#xD;
