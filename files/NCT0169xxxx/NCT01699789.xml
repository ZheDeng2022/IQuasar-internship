      CPIC is a community initiative and research study funded by the NIH. CPIC was developed and&#xD;
      is being run by community and academic partners in Los Angeles underserved communities of&#xD;
      color. CPIC compares two ways of supporting diverse health and social programs in&#xD;
      under-resourced communities to improve their services to depressed clients. One approach is&#xD;
      time-limited expert technical assistance coupled with culturally-competent community outreach&#xD;
      to individual programs, on how to use quality improvement toolkits for depression that have&#xD;
      already been proven to be effective or helpful in primary care settings, but adapted for this&#xD;
      study for use in diverse community-based programs in underserved communities. The other&#xD;
      approach brings different types of agencies and members in a community together in a 4 to&#xD;
      6-month planning process, to fit the same depression quality improvement programs to the&#xD;
      needs and strengths of the community and to develop a network of programs serving the&#xD;
      community to support clients with depression together. The study is designed to determine the&#xD;
      added value of community engagement and planning over and above what might be offered through&#xD;
      a community-oriented, disease management company. Both intervention models are based on the&#xD;
      same quality improvement toolkits that support team leadership, care management, Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavioral Therapy, medication management, and patient education and activation.&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesized that the community engagement approach would increase agency and&#xD;
      clinician participation in evidence-based trainings and improve client mental health-related&#xD;
      quality of life. In addition, during the design phase, community participants prioritized&#xD;
      adding as outcomes indicators of social determinants of mental health, including physical&#xD;
      functioning, risk factors for homelessness and employment. Investigators hypothesized by&#xD;
      activating community agencies that can address health and social services needs to engage&#xD;
      depressed clients, these outcomes would also be improved more in the collaboration condition.&#xD;
      Investigators also hypothesized that the collaboration approach would increase use of&#xD;
      services.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Underserved communities of color in low income, largely ethnic-minority neighborhoods face an&#xD;
      excessive burden of illness from depression due to higher prevalence of depression and lower&#xD;
      access to quality care. Evidence-based quality improvement (QI) programs for depression in&#xD;
      primary care settings-where many low-income and minority patients receive their only mental&#xD;
      health care-can enhance quality of depression care and improve health outcomes. These&#xD;
      programs are under-utilized in community-based health care settings, and have not been&#xD;
      adapted for use across diverse agencies (social service, faith based, primary and specialty&#xD;
      care) that could partner to support disease management for depression. Partners in Care&#xD;
      (PIC)and WE Care are interventions designed to improve access to evidence-based depression&#xD;
      treatments (medication management or psychotherapy) for primary care patients and, in WE&#xD;
      Care, social service clients. PIC evaluated a services delivery intervention while WE Care&#xD;
      was an effectiveness trial with study-provided treatments. Both studies promoted use of the&#xD;
      same evidence-based treatments. Both PIC and WE Care programs improved use of evidence-based&#xD;
      treatments for depression and health outcomes for African Americans and Latinos. The PIC&#xD;
      interventions reduced health outcome disparities evident in usual care in the first follow-up&#xD;
      year and at five-year follow-up. While these findings offer hope to underserved communities,&#xD;
      such communities have poor resources to support implementation of these programs, and may&#xD;
      have historical distrust in research and health care settings. There is no evidence-based&#xD;
      approach to support agency networks in underserved communities in implementing QI programs&#xD;
      for depression. To address this information gap, investigators created Community Partners in&#xD;
      Care (CPIC), a group-level randomized, controlled trial, with randomization at the level of&#xD;
      an agency site or &quot;unit.&quot; The trial is being fielded in two underserved communities,&#xD;
      Hollywood and South Los Angeles, and conducted through a community- participatory, partnered&#xD;
      research (CPPR) approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To engage two underserved communities in improving safety-net care for depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the effects of a community-engagement approach to implementing evidence-based&#xD;
           depression quality improvement toolkits (PIC/WE Care) through a community collaborative&#xD;
           network across services sectors, compared to technical assistance to individual programs&#xD;
           from the same services sectors coupled with culturally-competent outreach to implement&#xD;
           the same toolkits. The outcomes are: a) client access to care, quality of care and&#xD;
           health outcomes, with the primary outcome being mental-health related quality of life&#xD;
           and additional outcomes reflecting social determinants of mental health of interest to&#xD;
           the community (physical health, homelessness risk factors, employment); b) services&#xD;
           utilization and costs; c) agency adoption of PIC/WE Care; d) and provider attitudes,&#xD;
           knowledge and practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To describe the process of implementation of the community engagement intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPIC was awarded funds from the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) in 2013&#xD;
      to accomplish the following 3 aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the long-term (3-year) effectiveness of community engagement and planning&#xD;
           versus agency technical assistance to implement depression QI and improve depressed&#xD;
           clients' health status and risk for homelessness&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine how depressed clients in under-resourced communities prioritize diverse&#xD;
           health and social outcomes and identify their preferences for services to address&#xD;
           priority outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify capacities of providers to respond to depressed clients' priorities and to&#xD;
           generate recommendations for building capacity to better address clients'priorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that community engagement and planning will be more effective than technical&#xD;
      assistance in improving 3-year outcomes and that clients will prioritize quality of life. We&#xD;
      expect to find gaps in provider capacities to address client priorities that network&#xD;
      strategies could address.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary outcome for the long-term follow-up is mental health related quality of life and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes are use of healthcare and community services for depression and physical&#xD;
      functioning and homeless risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2014, CPIC was awarded funds from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health&#xD;
      Disparities (NIMHD) to use existing quantitative CPIC data and collect new qualitative data&#xD;
      to describe pathways to reducing disparities. The funding allows us to longitudinally track&#xD;
      the implementation of the CEP model in a new county-wide initiative to develop community&#xD;
      networks to promote healthy neighborhoods. The aims under this additional funding are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine pathways to reducing mental health and social disparities by conducting&#xD;
           community-academic partnered analyses of CPIC data by 1) examining intervention effects&#xD;
           for disparity subgroups (African Americans, Latinos, gender groups, insurance and&#xD;
           housing status groups); 2) identifying predictors and mediators of barriers to&#xD;
           access/services and client outcomes; 3) analyzing intervention effects on provider&#xD;
           workforce diversity; and 4) generating explanatory models for intervention effects and&#xD;
           their sustainability by interviewing CPIC administrators and providers, as well as prior&#xD;
           and current clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore the generalizability and replicability of the CPIC partnered model and, more&#xD;
           broadly, to inform the process of incorporating science into policy by conducting a&#xD;
           longitudinal case study of the CEP model implementation in a county-wide &quot;neighborhood&#xD;
           health&quot; initiative in Los Angeles to reduce mental health and social disparities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of this study, we will be able to explain how community-engaged and participatory&#xD;
      models of intervention implementation can reduce health and social disparities and ultimately&#xD;
      achieve public health impact. Study findings will be disseminated widely using traditional&#xD;
      academic, community-valued, and policy-relevant dissemination channels.&#xD;

          <description>RS offers time-limited technical assistance to individual agencies and outreach from a community engagement specialty, to review components of the QI Program Intervention as implemented by the RS Expert Team.&#xD;
QI Program: The QI program is an evidence-based toolkit that supported team leadership, case and care management, medication management, and CBT for depression. The Case management manual supported depression screening and tracking of outcomes; patient education and activation, care coordination, and behavioral activation and problem solving. The toolkit includes education on depression and a community health worker manual. The expert team for RS consisted of 3 psychiatrists, a psychologist expert in CBT, a nurse care manager, a community engagement specialist, a QI expert, and staff support. The team offered 12 webinars to each community on components of collaborative care as well as site visits to primary care clinics on clinical assessment and medication management.</description>

          <description>CEP supports 4 months of planning for the CEP Council of representatives from assigned programs in biweekly 2-hr meetings to fit trainings in the QI Program to the community and develop strategies across programs to collaborate as a network. The CEP Council developed a written plan for training and monitoring and supported implementation of the training plan. CEP sites received enrolled client lists. The toolkit is the same as RS. The CEP Council was supported by a workbook developed by the overall CPIC Council that provided principles, approach, agendas, and resources for the multi-sector planning meetings. The CEP Councils met twice a month for 4-6 months to develop their plan and met monthly during implementation of trainings. The study Council supported CEP meetings. Community leaders co-led trainings with study experts to help assure sustainability. Each CEP council had $15K to defray costs of venues, materials, and consultations, while the study provided that for RS.</description>

QI Program: The QI program is an evidence-based toolkit that supported team leadership, case and care management, medication management, and CBT for depression. The Case management manual supported depression screening and tracking of outcomes; patient education and activation, care coordination, and behavioral activation and problem solving. The toolkit includes education on depression and a community health worker manual. The expert team for RS consisted of 3 psychiatrists, a psychologist expert in CBT, a nurse care manager, a community engagement specialist, a QI expert, and staff support. The team offered 12 webinars to each community on components of collaborative care as well as site visits to primary care clinics on clinical assessment and medication management.</description>

The CEP Council developed a written plan for training and monitoring and supported implementation of the training plan. CEP sites received enrolled client lists. The toolkit is the same as RS. The CEP Council was supported by a workbook developed by the overall CPIC Council that provided principles, approach, agendas, and resources for the multi-sector planning meetings. The CEP Councils met twice a month for 4-6 months to develop their plan and met monthly during implementation of trainings. The study Council supported CEP meetings. Community leaders co-led trainings with study experts to help assure sustainability. Each CEP council had $15K to defray costs of venues, materials, and consultations, while the study provided that for RS.</description>

QI Program: The QI program is an evidence-based toolkit that supported team leadership, case and care management, medication management, and CBT for depression. The Case management manual supported depression screening and tracking of outcomes; patient education and activation, care coordination, and behavioral activation and problem solving. The toolkit includes education on depression and a community health worker manual. The expert team for RS consisted of 3 psychiatrists, a psychologist expert in CBT, a nurse care manager, a community engagement specialist, a QI expert, and staff support. The team offered 12 webinars to each community on components of collaborative care as well as site visits to primary care clinics on clinical assessment and medication management.</description>

The CEP Council developed a written plan for training and monitoring and supported implementation of the training plan. CEP sites received enrolled client lists. The toolkit is the same as RS. The CEP Council was supported by a workbook developed by the overall CPIC Council that provided principles, approach, agendas, and resources for the multi-sector planning meetings. The CEP Councils met twice a month for 4-6 months to develop their plan and met monthly during implementation of trainings. The study Council supported CEP meetings. Community leaders co-led trainings with study experts to help assure sustainability. Each CEP council had $15K to defray costs of venues, materials, and consultations, while the study provided that for RS.</description>

            <description>RS offers time-limited technical assistance to individual agencies and outreach from a community engagement specialty, to review components of the QI Program Intervention as implemented by the RS Expert Team.&#xD;
QI Program: The QI program is an evidence-based toolkit that supported team leadership, case and care management, medication management, and CBT for depression. The Case management manual supported depression screening and tracking of outcomes; patient education and activation, care coordination, and behavioral activation and problem solving. The toolkit includes education on depression and a community health worker manual. The expert team for RS consisted of 3 psychiatrists, a psychologist expert in CBT, a nurse care manager, a community engagement specialist, a QI expert, and staff support. The team offered 12 webinars to each community on components of collaborative care as well as site visits to primary care clinics on clinical assessment and medication management.</description>

            <description>CEP supports 4 months of planning for the CEP Council of representatives from assigned programs in biweekly 2-hr meetings to fit trainings in the QI Program to the community and develop strategies across programs to collaborate as a network. The CEP Council developed a written plan for training and monitoring and supported implementation of the training plan. CEP sites received enrolled client lists. The toolkit is the same as RS. The CEP Council was supported by a workbook developed by the overall CPIC Council that provided principles, approach, agendas, and resources for the multi-sector planning meetings. The CEP Councils met twice a month for 4-6 months to develop their plan and met monthly during implementation of trainings. The study Council supported CEP meetings. Community leaders co-led trainings with study experts to help assure sustainability. Each CEP council had $15K to defray costs of venues, materials, and consultations, while the study provided that for RS.</description>

QI Program: The QI program is an evidence-based toolkit that supported team leadership, case and care management, medication management, and CBT for depression. The Case management manual supported depression screening and tracking of outcomes; patient education and activation, care coordination, and behavioral activation and problem solving. The toolkit includes education on depression and a community health worker manual. The expert team for RS consisted of 3 psychiatrists, a psychologist expert in CBT, a nurse care manager, a community engagement specialist, a QI expert, and staff support. The team offered 12 webinars to each community on components of collaborative care as well as site visits to primary care clinics on clinical assessment and medication management.</description>

The CEP Council developed a written plan for training and monitoring and supported implementation of the training plan. CEP sites received enrolled client lists. The toolkit is the same as RS. The CEP Council was supported by a workbook developed by the overall CPIC Council that provided principles, approach, agendas, and resources for the multi-sector planning meetings. The CEP Councils met twice a month for 4-6 months to develop their plan and met monthly during implementation of trainings. The study Council supported CEP meetings. Community leaders co-led trainings with study experts to help assure sustainability. Each CEP council had $15K to defray costs of venues, materials, and consultations, while the study provided that for RS.</description>

Community leaders co-led trainings with study experts to help assure sustainability. Each CEP council had $15K to defray costs of venues, materials, and consultations, while the study provided that for RS.</description>

QI Program: The QI program is an evidence-based toolkit that supported team leadership, case and care management, medication management, and CBT for depression. The Case management manual supported depression screening and tracking of outcomes; patient education and activation, care coordination, and behavioral activation and problem solving. The toolkit includes education on depression and a community health worker manual. The expert team for RS consisted of 3 psychiatrists, a psychologist expert in CBT, a nurse care manager, a community engagement specialist, a QI expert, and staff support. The team offered 12 webinars to each community on components of collaborative care as well as site visits to primary care clinics on clinical assessment and medication management.</description>

QI Program: The QI program is an evidence-based toolkit that supported team leadership, case and care management, medication management, and CBT for depression. The Case management manual supported depression screening and tracking of outcomes; patient education and activation, care coordination, and behavioral activation and problem solving. The toolkit includes education on depression and a community health worker manual. The expert team for RS consisted of 3 psychiatrists, a psychologist expert in CBT, a nurse care manager, a community engagement specialist, a QI expert, and staff support. The team offered 12 webinars to each community on components of collaborative care as well as site visits to primary care clinics on clinical assessment and medication management.</description>

QI Program: The QI program is an evidence-based toolkit that supported team leadership, case and care management, medication management, and CBT for depression. The Case management manual supported depression screening and tracking of outcomes; patient education and activation, care coordination, and behavioral activation and problem solving. The toolkit includes education on depression and a community health worker manual. The expert team for RS consisted of 3 psychiatrists, a psychologist expert in CBT, a nurse care manager, a community engagement specialist, a QI expert, and staff support. The team offered 12 webinars to each community on components of collaborative care as well as site visits to primary care clinics on clinical assessment and medication management.</description>

The CEP Council developed a written plan for training and monitoring and supported implementation of the training plan. CEP sites received enrolled client lists. The toolkit is the same as RS. The CEP Council was supported by a workbook developed by the overall CPIC Council that provided principles, approach, agendas, and resources for the multi-sector planning meetings. The CEP Councils met twice a month for 4-6 months to develop their plan and met monthly during implementation of trainings. The study Council supported CEP meetings. Community leaders co-led trainings with study experts to help assure sustainability. Each CEP council had $15K to defray costs of venues, materials, and consultations, while the study provided that for RS.</description>

QI Program: The QI program is an evidence-based toolkit that supported team leadership, case and care management, medication management, and CBT for depression. The Case management manual supported depression screening and tracking of outcomes; patient education and activation, care coordination, and behavioral activation and problem solving. The toolkit includes education on depression and a community health worker manual. The expert team for RS consisted of 3 psychiatrists, a psychologist expert in CBT, a nurse care manager, a community engagement specialist, a QI expert, and staff support. The team offered 12 webinars to each community on components of collaborative care as well as site visits to primary care clinics on clinical assessment and medication management.</description>

The CEP Council developed a written plan for training and monitoring and supported implementation of the training plan. CEP sites received enrolled client lists. The toolkit is the same as RS. The CEP Council was supported by a workbook developed by the overall CPIC Council that provided principles, approach, agendas, and resources for the multi-sector planning meetings. The CEP Councils met twice a month for 4-6 months to develop their plan and met monthly during implementation of trainings. The study Council supported CEP meetings. Community leaders co-led trainings with study experts to help assure sustainability. Each CEP council had $15K to defray costs of venues, materials, and consultations, while the study provided that for RS.</description>

QI Program: The QI program is an evidence-based toolkit that supported team leadership, case and care management, medication management, and CBT for depression. The Case management manual supported depression screening and tracking of outcomes; patient education and activation, care coordination, and behavioral activation and problem solving. The toolkit includes education on depression and a community health worker manual. The expert team for RS consisted of 3 psychiatrists, a psychologist expert in CBT, a nurse care manager, a community engagement specialist, a QI expert, and staff support. The team offered 12 webinars to each community on components of collaborative care as well as site visits to primary care clinics on clinical assessment and medication management.</description>

The CEP Council developed a written plan for training and monitoring and supported implementation of the training plan. CEP sites received enrolled client lists. The toolkit is the same as RS. The CEP Council was supported by a workbook developed by the overall CPIC Council that provided principles, approach, agendas, and resources for the multi-sector planning meetings. The CEP Councils met twice a month for 4-6 months to develop their plan and met monthly during implementation of trainings. The study Council supported CEP meetings. Community leaders co-led trainings with study experts to help assure sustainability. Each CEP council had $15K to defray costs of venues, materials, and consultations, while the study provided that for RS.</description>

            <description>CEP supports 4 months of planning for the CEP Council of representatives from assigned programs in biweekly 2-hr meetings to fit trainings in the QI Program to the community and develop strategies across programs to collaborate as a network. The CEP Council developed a written plan for training and monitoring and supported implementation of the training plan. CEP sites received enrolled client lists. The toolkit is the same as RS. The CEP Council was supported by a workbook developed by the overall CPIC Council that provided principles, approach, agendas, and resources for the multi-sector planning meetings. The CEP Councils met twice a month for 4-6 months to develop their plan and met monthly during implementation of trainings. The study Council supported CEP meetings. Community leaders co-led trainings with study experts to help assure sustainability. Each CEP council had $15K to defray costs of venues, materials, and consultations, while the study provided that for RS.</description>

      <time_frame>Mortality data obtained from back up contact person identified by participants in prior survey periods. The suicidal ideation within the last two weeks data was collected over the 12 months study duration.</time_frame>
      <desc>Screening for suicidal ideation in the baseline utilized the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) item: &quot;Over the past two weeks, when you felt depressed or uninterested, did you repeatedly consider hurting yourself, feel suicidal, or wish that you were dead? Did you attempt suicide or plan a suicide? At 6 and 12 months, screening utilized the item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire with a follow-up question: &quot;Are these thoughts bothering you now?&quot; if responding affirmatively.</desc>

          <title>Resources for Services RS</title>
          <description>RS offers time-limited technical assistance to individual agencies and outreach from a community engagement specialty, to review components of the QI Program Intervention as implemented by the RS Expert Team.&#xD;
QI Program: The QI program is an evidence-based toolkit that supported team leadership, case and care management, medication management, and CBT for depression. The Case management manual supported depression screening and tracking of outcomes; patient education and activation, care coordination, and behavioral activation and problem solving. The toolkit includes education on depression and a community health worker manual. The expert team for RS consisted of 3 psychiatrists, a psychologist expert in CBT, a nurse care manager, a community engagement specialist, a QI expert, and staff support. The team offered 12 webinars to each community on components of collaborative care as well as site visits to primary care clinics on clinical assessment and medication management.</description>

          <title>Community Engagement and Planning CEP</title>
          <description>CEP supports 4 months of planning for the CEP Council of representatives from assigned programs in biweekly 2-hr meetings to fit trainings in the QI Program to the community and develop strategies across programs to collaborate as a network. The CEP Council developed a written plan for training and monitoring and supported implementation of the training plan. CEP sites received enrolled client lists. The toolkit is the same as RS. The CEP Council was supported by a workbook developed by the overall CPIC Council that provided principles, approach, agendas, and resources for the multi-sector planning meetings. The CEP Councils met twice a month for 4-6 months to develop their plan and met monthly during implementation of trainings. The study Council supported CEP meetings. Community leaders co-led trainings with study experts to help assure sustainability. Each CEP council had $15K to defray costs of venues, materials, and consultations, while the study provided that for RS.</description>
