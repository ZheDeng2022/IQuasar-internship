  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Focused Ultrasound Focused ultrasound is an attractive method for non-invasive thermal&#xD;
      ablation of soft tissue tumors. Treatment begins by acquiring a series of MR images of the&#xD;
      target organ. The physician then identifies a target volume in the MR images and delineates&#xD;
      the treatment contours on the images. Therapy planning software calculates the parameters&#xD;
      required to effectively treat the defined target volume. During the treatment an ultrasound&#xD;
      transducer generates and focuses ultrasound energy to a focal point, called a sonication. The&#xD;
      sonication raises the tissue temperature within a well-defined region to a degree, which&#xD;
      causes thermal coagulation. MR images acquired during sonication provide a quantitative,&#xD;
      real-time temperature map of the target area to confirm the location of the sonication and&#xD;
      the size of the coagulated region. The sonication process is repeated at multiple adjacent&#xD;
      points to cover the entire prescribed treatment volume.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female ages over 18 years old that give informed written consent to&#xD;
             participate in study. Females in reproductive age have to provide a negative serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with primary diagnosis (biopsy proven) of a malignant glioma or a recurrent&#xD;
             glioma, that do not accept a conventional tumor resection or where a conventional&#xD;
             tumor resection is not indicated according to both the neurosurgeon in charge and the&#xD;
             neuro-oncology colloquium at the Kantonsspital Aarau.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Or:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients with a supratentorial brain metastasis of a malignant tumor, that do not&#xD;
             accept a conventional tumor resection or where a conventional tumor resection is not&#xD;
             indicated according to the neurosurgeon in charge and the neuro-oncology colloquium at&#xD;
             the Kantonsspital Aarau.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The portion of the tumor to be treated during one intervention is less than 3.0 cm in&#xD;
             diameter, corresponding to a volume of ca. 14 cc.&#xD;
&#xD;
             If the total size of the tumor is larger than 3.0 cm in diameter then eventual&#xD;
             complementing ablations will not be performed before 2 week after the first treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The tumor to be treated is clearly defined and can be well distinguished from&#xD;
             surrounding brain tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The border of the targeted tumor volume has in all directions a distance of at least&#xD;
             2.5 cm from the inner table of the skull. Portions of the tumor that are not planned&#xD;
             to be treated due to this safety margin will be marked.&#xD;
&#xD;
