    <textblock>
      This study will be the first to test the anti-cancer peptide Nerofe in humans. It will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic behavior, and pharmacodynamic and clinical effects of&#xD;
      Nerofe given intravenously every other day to patients with advanced malignant disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 single-center, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study, to be&#xD;
      conducted in 2 phases. The Dose Escalation Phase will determine the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) of Nerofe and evaluate its safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,&#xD;
      immunogenicity, and preliminary clinical effects. The subsequent Dose Confirmation Phase will&#xD;
      be a cohort expansion at or below the MTD of Nerofe. Subjects will be treated with IV doses&#xD;
      of Nerofe thrice weekly (on alternating days) in consecutive, 28-day cycles. Subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluated regularly for safety. Subjects who tolerate the drug and who do not experience&#xD;
      progressive disease, intolerable toxicity, or meet any of the other withdrawal criteria may&#xD;
      continue to receive Nerofe for up to 6 cycles, at the discretion of the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator. Throughout the trial, oversight will be provided by the Clinical Safety&#xD;
      Committee.&#xD;
