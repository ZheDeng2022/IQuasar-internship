    <textblock>
      Even during mitral valve repair procedure (MVP) for severe mitral stenosis (MS), the&#xD;
      intraoperative assessment of mitral valve area (MVA) is necessary for evaluating the severity&#xD;
      of MS before the repair and excluding residual MS for immediate determination of the success&#xD;
      of the repair procedure and postoperative prognosis. For this purpose, several methods have&#xD;
      been applied by introperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE): pressure half-time&#xD;
      (PHT) of mitral inflow Doppler and 2-dimensional (2D) planimetry methods have been widely&#xD;
      used in clinical practice. However, especially after MVP, the PHT method is usually&#xD;
      unreliable because it usually underestimates the MVA due to various intraoperative&#xD;
      hemodynamic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors hypothesized that the MVA determined by 3D TEE would be more accurate than that&#xD;
      by PHT during immediate post-MVP procedure in severe MS patients and comparable to&#xD;
      postoperative MVA determined by MDCT. Therefore, the present study determined the MVA by&#xD;
      using PHT, 3D planimetry and MDCT before and after the MVP procedure in severe MS patients&#xD;
      and analyzed them to evaluate 3D TEE's utility for evaluation of MVA.&#xD;

      After obtaining permission of the Institutional Review Board of Konkuk University Medical&#xD;
      Center, Seoul, South Korea , patients scheduled to undergo elective MVP due to more than&#xD;
      moderate MS and left atrial enlargement with or without atrial fibrillation (AFib) signed&#xD;
      written informed consent agreements and prospectively participate in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the routine transthoracic echocardiographic evaluation, cardiac CT examination&#xD;
      is performed in all recruited patients prior to surgery to determine MVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction of anesthesia and tracheal intubation are performed after the administration of&#xD;
      intravenous etomidate 0.1-0.2 mg/kg and rocuronium 0.9 mg/kg followed by continuous infusion&#xD;
      of remifentanil (0.5-1.0 mcg/kg/min). After tracheal intubation, sevoflurane (1.0 inspired&#xD;
      vol%) and infusion of rocuronium (0.2 mg/kg/hr) are administered for anesthesia maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After anesthesia induction, pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is placed in right internal&#xD;
      jugular vein into pulmonary artery by pressure guidance and a 3D TEE probe (X-9™, Philips&#xD;
      Medical Systems Andover, MA, USA) is inserted for the comprehensive intraoperative TEE&#xD;
      examination using a 3D echocardiographic imaging platform (iE33; Philips Medical Systems,&#xD;
      Andover, MA, USA). While momentarily turning off the ventilator, three consecutive&#xD;
      velocity-time integrals (VTIs) of mitral inflow Doppler scans were obtained by applying the&#xD;
      continuous wave Doppler parallel to the mitral inflow Color Doppler signal in the&#xD;
      midesophageal long-axis view. In case of AFib, the biggest VTI among the 5 consecutive VTIs&#xD;
      of the mitral inflow Doppler was used for determining PHT to detect maximal mitral inflow&#xD;
      among irregular heartbeats. Immediately after recording the VTIs, a live 3D zoom &quot;en face&quot; MV&#xD;
      view from the left atrium (LA) or left ventricle (LV) perspective is acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As baseline data, MVA is determined by using PHT method (MVA-PHT): PHT of the mitral inflow&#xD;
      deceleration slope is determined using stored mitral inflow Doppler VTI and the MVA are&#xD;
      automatically calculated assuming MVA = 220/PHT. At the same time, a 2D image of the smallest&#xD;
      MVA perpendicular to the mitral inflow at the maximal MV opening was achieved by&#xD;
      post-processing including aligning and cropping of the acquired 3D images with an installed&#xD;
      software (3DQ™ in Q-lab™, Philips, USA). MVA was determined by circumferential tracing of the&#xD;
      leaflet edges of the MV opening in the cropped and reconstructed tomographic image from&#xD;
      stored 3D volume image (MVA-3D) (Fig. 1). All MVA measurements were repeated 3 times within a&#xD;
      minimal time interval by the same expert cardiac anesthesiologists with the mean value used&#xD;
      for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients got a single type of MVP (Comprehensive Mitral Valve Apparatus Reconstruction™)&#xD;
      consisting of following procedures under moderate hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) by&#xD;
      one cardiac surgeon: restoration of a sufficient MV opening with repair of anterior or&#xD;
      posterior MV leaflets, mitral commissure, and chordate; and lifting posterior annuloplasty&#xD;
      using a flexible ready to use band. A Maze operation is additionally performed in patients&#xD;
      who associated with Afib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after the weaning from the CPB and achieving stable hemodynamics (mean arterial&#xD;
      blood pressure &gt; 65 mmHg, heart rate 60-90 beats per minute, cardiac index &gt; 2.0 L/min/m2),&#xD;
      MVA-PHT and MVA-3D are determined in the same manner as the baseline data acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following intraoperative exclusion criteria are applied: 1) intraoperative conversion to&#xD;
      MV replacement due to insufficient repair procedure, 2) the inability to delineate MV opening&#xD;
      due to insufficient 3D imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 7 postoperative days, the MVA-CT is determined again for comparison to other methods&#xD;
      by an expert cardiac radiologist in the same manner which applied preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses are conducted using SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). To assess&#xD;
      intra-observer variability, the MVAs measured by PHT method and 3D planimetry with TEE are&#xD;
      analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The comparisons of MVA-PHT, MVA-3D,&#xD;
      and MVA-CT before or after MVP are analysed used a One Way Repeated Measures Analysis of&#xD;
      Variance and their pairwise multiple comparisons are performed via the Tukey method. The&#xD;
      comparisons of the other continuous variables of echocardiographic findings are performed by&#xD;
      paired t or Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests. The linear regression analysis is used to determine&#xD;
      possible correlation between MVA by using each method. Data are expressed as mean ± SD (95%&#xD;
      confidence interval. CI) or median (25%-75%), and number of the patients. A p value less than&#xD;
      0.05 is considered statistically significant.&#xD;
