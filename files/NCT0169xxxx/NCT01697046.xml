  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a pilot, open label study involving 65 participants. All participants will be&#xD;
      followed until seroconversion or until the last enrolled participant completes one year of&#xD;
      follow-up, whichever happens first. Participant study number will be given at the screening&#xD;
      visit, prior to inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chosen intervention and study regimen are based on the dynamics of viral infection and&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics of the study drugs. In order to inhibit reverse transcription nucleoside&#xD;
      and nucleotide analogues need to be phosphorylated intracellularly. On the other hand,&#xD;
      available data indicate that it takes approximately 10 hours between exposure and HIV viral&#xD;
      integration, offering a window of opportunity for Raltegravir to block integration and thus&#xD;
      prevent infection, given that this drug does not need to be metabolized to exert its effect.&#xD;
      The intervention will be maintained for 4 weeks following exposure, in accordance with&#xD;
      Brazilian and CDC guidelines for PEP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with reported high-risk behavior (and anticipated future high-risk behavior) but no&#xD;
      exposure in the immediate past will be the focus of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be prescribed raltegravir 400 mg BID + Truvada once daily. All study&#xD;
      participants will receive a 4-days starter pack. Study participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      start study drugs if they expect or experience an exposure of any mucous membrane (oral,&#xD;
      urethral, anal) to semen. Subjects who expect or experience these exposures will be&#xD;
      instructed to take 1 pill of Raltegravir 400mg and one pill of truvada, followed by a second&#xD;
      dose of Raltegravir 12 hours later. From the second day onward, participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to take Raltegravir 400 mg BID + Truvada once daily. The first dose should be&#xD;
      taken no more than 6 hours before or 6 hours after the expected or actual exposure and&#xD;
      continued for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will also be instructed to report to the study site within 4 days of&#xD;
      beginning study drugs to respond to a CASI questionnaire and to have blood taken. They will&#xD;
      be instructed to return at the end of the 4-week chemoprophylaxis course for reevaluation and&#xD;
      to be given another 4-day supply of medication. Under no circumstances will any participant&#xD;
      be given a greater than 4 week supply of medication; all will be evaluated for toxicity and&#xD;
      adherence following each course of chemoprophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will be monitored closely for safety after each course of&#xD;
      chemoprophylaxis and at the end of the trial. In addition, subjects will be instructed to&#xD;
      immediately contact the site if they experience certain symptoms consistent with severe&#xD;
      toxicity. At each evaluation a careful clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory&#xD;
      assessment, including HIV serology, will be completed. Adherence will be estimated based on&#xD;
      self-report and the use of pill counts. During each visit, subjects will be reminded of the&#xD;
      need to not increase high-risk sexual behavior. HIV serology and response to a CASI&#xD;
      questionnaire will be conducted monthly.&#xD;
