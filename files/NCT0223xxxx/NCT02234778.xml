  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the Tissue Genesis®&#xD;
      Icellator Cell Isolation System™ in Critical Limb Ischemia. The Icellator System™ device&#xD;
      removes certain cells from the adipose (fat) tissue which will be used to treat patients with&#xD;
      blockages in the arteries of their lower legs that may require a future amputation, which is&#xD;
      caused by severe peripheral artery disease (PAD). The purpose of this study is to determine&#xD;
      if treatment with cells that have been removed from the Icellator System™ device will reduce&#xD;
      the number of major amputations and deaths in a six month time period.&#xD;

    <description>To obtain preliminary feasibility evidence of the ability of the Tissue Genesis Inc. (TGI) stromal vascular fraction (SVF) material to result in freedom from major amputation (above the ankle) or death at 26 weeks following treatment. Treatment failure is defined as the composite of major amputation of the treatment limb or all-cause death.</description>
