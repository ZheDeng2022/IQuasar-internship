  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a drug called temsirolimus in&#xD;
      combination with a drug called perifosine in treating brain tumors that have continued to&#xD;
      grow after previous treatment. Temsirolimus is an intravenous drug approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      treatment of other cancers (kidney cancer, certain types of lymphoma) but not for brain&#xD;
      tumors. Perifosine is a pill that has not been approved by the FDA which blocks a messenger&#xD;
      that tells cancer cells to grow. Research suggests that combined treatment with both drugs is&#xD;
      better than either alone, and that it is reasonably safe.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors, and glioblastoma (GBM) is the&#xD;
      most common subtype in adults, representing more than 50% of gliomas. Standard initial&#xD;
      treatment for newly diagnosed GBM consists of maximal surgical resection followed by&#xD;
      radiotherapy to the tumor bed and chemotherapy with an oral DNA alkylator, temozolomide.&#xD;
      However, recurrence is nearly universal despite standard therapy. There is no standard&#xD;
      treatment at recurrence. Median survival is about 15 months from diagnosis and 6 months from&#xD;
      recurrence. Once patients develop tumor progression, conventional chemotherapy is generally&#xD;
      ineffective.&#xD;

    <description>Cytoreductive surgery planned (surgical cohort). After post-operative standard evaluations, patients will resume therapy. After anti-emetic prophylaxis, patients will receive the first divided dose of the perifosine loading dose after recovery from surgery. Patients will be observed for at least 30 minutes to ensure there has been adequate anti-emetic prophylaxis, and then patients will receive temsirolimus administered over 30-60 minutes IV. The remaining divided doses of the perifosine loading dose will then be administered. Patients will then return weekly for infusion of temsirolimus over 30-60 minutes IV. Dosing will be continuous although for the purposes of evaluation, a cycle will be defined as 4 weeks (28 days).</description>
