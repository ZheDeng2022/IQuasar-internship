  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant percentage of individuals who die by suicide do not seek mental health services&#xD;
      in the time preceding their death. This population is underserved and it is unclear what&#xD;
      barriers keep them from seeking treatment. In order to begin a line of research aimed at&#xD;
      addressing this high-risk population, this proposal rests on the hypothesis that suicidal&#xD;
      individuals who do not seek treatment prior to attempting suicide experience the same&#xD;
      psychopathological difficulties as suicidal individuals who do seek treatment - namely,&#xD;
      severe emotion dysregulation. However, these non-treatment-seeker s will likely require more&#xD;
      creative recruitment strategies and briefer interventions than treatment-seeking individuals.&#xD;
      As such, this application proposes to use wide-reaching recruitment efforts throughout the&#xD;
      community to locate and enroll individuals who are suicidal but not seeking treatment.&#xD;
      Further, there is a paucity of empirical support for interventions targeting suicidal&#xD;
      individuals. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is one of the few treatments that have been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be effective with a suicidal population and is the only treatment whose&#xD;
      effectiveness has been replicated. Previous research has suggested that an abbreviated&#xD;
      version of the skills that are taught in DBT skills training have effectively reduced emotion&#xD;
      dysregulation (i.e., depression and anxiety) in problem drinkers and the format of the&#xD;
      proposed intervention is derived from this evidence-based emotion dysregulation intervention.&#xD;
      As such, the proposed research is a randomized, controlled pilot trial of a very brief,&#xD;
      one-time, skills-based intervention targeting difficulties in emotion regulation and distress&#xD;
      tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research aims to evaluate the safety of the intervention, the feasibility of the&#xD;
      research methods (including the appropriateness of the relaxation training control&#xD;
      condition), and to preliminarily estimate the immediate (one week) and long-term (one and&#xD;
      three month) changes resulting from the DBT Brief Skills Intervention (DBT-BSI) relative to a&#xD;
      relaxation training control on the primary outcomes of suicide ideation and emotion&#xD;
      dysregulation as well as a number of secondary outcomes. These results will inform the design&#xD;
      of a subsequent full-scale randomized controlled trial of the DBT-BSI.&#xD;
