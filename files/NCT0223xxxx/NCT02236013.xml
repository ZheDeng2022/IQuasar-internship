      The purpose of this study is to describe the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and define the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ASP2215 when combined with cytarabine/idarubicin or&#xD;
      daunorubicin remission induction in a 7+3 schedule. Safety and tolerability of ASP2215 will&#xD;
      also be evaluated. This study will also characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASP2215&#xD;
      when given in combination with cytarabine/idarubicin or cytarabine/daunorubicin remission&#xD;
      induction and high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) consolidation therapy in newly diagnosed acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia as well as evaluate the effect of ASP2215 on the PK of cytarabine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a four-part trial. In Part 1, subjects will be enrolled to successive cohorts to&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Dose escalation decision will be made based on&#xD;
      DLTs that occur after the first dose of ASP2215 during remission induction. The treatment&#xD;
      will consist of three distinct periods: remission induction, consolidation and maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, subjects will be enrolled into an expansion cohort. Subjects will receive ASP2215&#xD;
      at the MTD established in Part 1 or recommended expansion dose, and will also receive&#xD;
      remission induction, consolidation and maintenance therapy. The DLT observation period during&#xD;
      the expansion cohort will be from the start of dosing of ASP2215 during the first remission&#xD;
      induction treatment until Day 21 of the first consolidation cycle or before the start of the&#xD;
      second consolidation cycle, whichever is sooner; as well as from the start of maintenance&#xD;
      treatment until Day 28 of the second maintenance cycle. If testing at a dose level must be&#xD;
      stopped, then a lower dose may be tested for remaining subjects to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 3, two cohorts will be enrolled to evaluate an alternative anthracycline and ASP2215&#xD;
      schedule. During remission induction, ASP2215 dosing will begin at day 8 and continue for 14&#xD;
      days to day 21. Subjects will be hospitalized during remission induction therapy while&#xD;
      receiving chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cohort 3A, some subjects will be enrolled to receive 7+3 regimen consisting of cytarabine&#xD;
      and an alternative antracycline, daunorubicin. During remission induction subjects will&#xD;
      receive a 7+3 induction regimen consisting of daunorubicin IV infusion on days 1 through 3&#xD;
      and cytarabine as a continuous infusion on days 1 through 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cohort 3B, some subjects will be enrolled to receive 7+3 regimen consisting of cytarabine&#xD;
      and idarubicin at an alternative dosing schedule for ASP2215 during remission induction.&#xD;
      During remission induction subjects will receive a 7+3 induction regimen consisting of&#xD;
      idarubicin by IV infusion on days 1 through 3 and cytarabine as a continuous infusion on days&#xD;
      1 through 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Part 3, if day 21 bone marrow evaluation shows residual blasts and the bone marrow is not&#xD;
      aplastic, a second induction cycle with the same regimen will be given starting at least 7&#xD;
      days after last dose of ASP2215 and no later than day 35 of the first induction cycle.&#xD;
      Consolidation and Maintenance therapy follow the same schedule and dosage outlined in Part&#xD;
      1.The DLT observation period for dose escalation decisions will be from the start of ASP2215&#xD;
      administration during the first remission induction treatment until day 42 of the last&#xD;
      remission induction treatment cycle or before the start of the first consolidation cycle,&#xD;
      whichever is sooner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject that receives less than 80% of the intended dose of any of the study drugs during&#xD;
      the remission induction period may be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3 may be expanded for additional subjects to ensure at least some subjects are FLT3 + in&#xD;
      each of the Alternative Anthracycline and Schedule Cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 4, the effect of continuous ASP2215 exposure during consolidation will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During remission induction, subjects will receive a 7+3 induction regimen consisting of&#xD;
      daunorubicin on days 1 through 3 and cytarabine as a continuous infusion on days 1 through 7.&#xD;
      ASP2215 will be given at the designated dose, once daily starting on day 8, and continued for&#xD;
      14 days until day 21. If day 21 bone marrow evaluation shows residual blasts and the bone&#xD;
      marrow is not aplastic, a second induction cycle with the same regimen will be given starting&#xD;
      at least 7 days after last dose of ASP2215 and no later than day 35 of the first induction&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consolidation therapy will follow the same schedule and dosage outlined in Part 1 except for&#xD;
      the ASP2215 schedule. ASP2215 will be given at the designated dose, once daily starting on&#xD;
      day 1 up to day 56, which is the maximum number of days between each consolidation cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may participate in up to 3 consolidation cycles. Maintenance therapy and&#xD;
      posttreatment will also follow the same schedule and dosage outlined in Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DLT observation period will be during the first consolidation cycle only. This will be&#xD;
      from the start of ASP2215 administration (consolidation cycle 1 day 1) until consolidation&#xD;
      cycle 1 day 56 or the next chemotherapy cycle, whichever is sooner.&#xD;
