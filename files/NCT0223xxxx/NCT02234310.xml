    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of recombinant coagulation&#xD;
      factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc, BIIB029) in previously untreated patients (PUPs) with&#xD;
      severe hemophilia B. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of rFIXFc in the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of bleeding episodes in PUPs, and to evaluate rFIXFc consumption for&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of bleeding episodes in PUPs.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Annualized Number of Bleeding Episodes (Spontaneous and Traumatic) Per Participant (Annualized Bleeding Rate [ABR])</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>ABR was annualized number of bleeding episodes during efficacy period (EP) per participant normalized to a 1-year interval of time. Bleeding episodes were classified as: spontaneous if parent/caregiver/participant records bleeding event when there is no known contributing factor such as definite trauma or antecedent strenuous activity; and traumatic when there is known reason for bleed. ABR=(Number of bleeding episodes during EP/total number of days during EP)*365.25. EP reflects the sum of all intervals of time during which participants were treated with rFIXFc per treatment regimens excluding surgical/rehabilitation periods and large injection intervals (greater than [&gt;]28 days). Participants were included in summary of more than 1 treatment regimen if their regimen changed during study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Annualized Number of Spontaneous Joint Bleeding Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Bleeding episodes were classified as spontaneous if parent/caregiver/participant records a bleeding event when there is no known contributing factor such as a definite trauma or antecedent &quot;strenuous&quot; activity. Annualized spontaneous joint bleeding episodes=(Total number of spontaneous joint bleeding episodes during efficacy period (EP) divided by total number of days during EP)*365.25. EP reflects the sum of all intervals of time during which participants were treated with rFIXFc per treatment regimen excluding major and minor surgical/rehabilitation periods and large injection intervals (&gt;28 days). Participants were included in summary of more than 1 treatment regimen if their regimen changed during study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of rFIXFc Injections With Excellent or Good, Moderate or None Treatment Response Assessed Using a 4-Point Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Using e-diary, each participant's parent/caregiver rated treatment response to any bleeding episode (BE) at approximately 8 to 12 hours from time of injection and prior to additional doses of rFIXFc given for same BE using 4-point scale:- 1=Excellent: abrupt pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8 hours after initial injection; 2=Good: definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approx. 8 hours after injection, but possibly requiring more than 1 injection after 24-48 hours for complete resolution; 3=Moderate: Probable/slight beneficial effect within 8 hours after initial injection and requires more than 1 injection and 4=None: No improvement or condition worsens within approx. 8 hours after initial injection. Participants were included in summary of more than 1 treatment regimen if their regimen changed during study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Number of Exposure Days (EDs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>An ED was defined as a 24-hour period in which a participant received one or more doses of rFIXFc injections, with the time of the first injection of rFIXFc defined as the start of the ED. Participant who did not have a particular injection type were counted as having zero injections for that type.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Annualized rFIXFc Consumption Per Participant for the Prevention and Treatment of Bleeding Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Total annualized rFIXFc consumption (in IU/kg) was calculated for each participant as: Annualized consumption = (Total IU/kg of rFIXFc during efficacy period (EP) divided by total number of days during EP)*365.25. EP reflects the sum of all intervals of time during which participants were treated with rFIXFc according to the treatment regimens of the study excluding surgical/rehabilitation periods and large injection intervals (&gt; 28 days). Participants were included in summary of more than 1 treatment regimen if their regimen changed during study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Injections of rFIXFc Required to Resolve a Bleeding Episode</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Number of injections of rFIXFc required to resolve a bleeding episode during efficacy period (EP) were reported. EP reflects the sum of all intervals of time during which participants were treated with rFIXFc according to the treatment regimens of the study excluding surgical/rehabilitation periods and large injection intervals (&gt;28 days). All injections given from the initial sign of a bleed, until the last date/time within the bleed window were counted. Participants were included in summary of more than 1 treatment regimen if their regimen changed during study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Dose Per Injection of rFIXFc Required to Resolve a Bleeding Episode</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The average dose of rFIXFc per injection per bleeding episode was calculated as the average of all doses (IU/kg) administered to treat the bleeding episode during efficacy period (EP). EP begins with the first treatment regimen dose of rFIXFc and ends with the last dose (regardless of the reason for dosing). Surgery/rehabilitation periods are not included in the EP. Participants were included in summary of more than 1 treatment regimen if their regimen changed during study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in rFIXFc Incremental Recovery (IR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, and 144</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were taken at trough and Cmax (maximum concentration) for assessment of incremental recovery, measured by the one-stage clotting assay. IR (International Units per deciliter [IU/dL] per IU/kg) = (Cmax for FIX activity - Pre-dose FIX activity) (IU/dL)/ Actual dose (IU/kg), where Cmax is 30 minute FIX activity post-dose and FIX activity less than (&lt;)0.5 IU/dL was set to 0 IU/dL for calculation of IR.</description>

    <description>Participants received rFIXFc intravenous (IV) injection as follows: Prophylactic treatment regimen: started with rFIXFc 50 International Units per kilogram (IU/kg) weekly until a participant reached at least 50 exposure days (ED=24-hour period in which greater than or equal to (&gt;=1) injection/dose of rFIXFc was given) to rFIXFc, withdrawal from study or end of study. Adjustments to dose and dosing interval was based on incremental recovery, subsequent Factor IX (FIX) levels, physical activity, bleeding pattern, in accordance with local standards of care for prophylactic regimen (PR). Treatment with episodic (on demand) regimen can be initiated before PR at investigators discretion. Episodic (On demand; optional): rFIXFc at individual doses based on participant's clinical condition, type and severity of bleeding event until PR.</description>

        <description>ABR was annualized number of bleeding episodes during efficacy period (EP) per participant normalized to a 1-year interval of time. Bleeding episodes were classified as: spontaneous if parent/caregiver/participant records bleeding event when there is no known contributing factor such as definite trauma or antecedent strenuous activity; and traumatic when there is known reason for bleed. ABR=(Number of bleeding episodes during EP/total number of days during EP)*365.25. EP reflects the sum of all intervals of time during which participants were treated with rFIXFc per treatment regimens excluding surgical/rehabilitation periods and large injection intervals (greater than [&gt;]28 days). Participants were included in summary of more than 1 treatment regimen if their regimen changed during study.</description>

          <description>Participants received rFIXFc IV injection as follows: Prophylactic treatment regimen: started with rFIXFc 50 IU/kg weekly until a participant reached at least 50 exposure days (ED=24-hour period in which &gt;=1 injection/dose of rFIXFc was given) to rFIXFc, withdrawal from study or end of study. Adjustments to dose and dosing interval was based on incremental recovery, subsequent Factor IX levels, physical activity, bleeding pattern, in accordance with local standards of care for prophylactic regimen (PR). Treatment with episodic (on demand) regimen can be initiated before PR at investigators discretion. Episodic (On demand; optional): rFIXFc at individual doses based on participant's clinical condition, type and severity of bleeding event until PR.</description>
