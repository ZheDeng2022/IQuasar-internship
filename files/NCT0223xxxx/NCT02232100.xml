  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a complex medical condition associated with significant&#xD;
      distress, disability, and reduction in quality of life. Research has shown that patients with&#xD;
      chronic musculoskeletal pain demonstrate attentional biases towards pain-related information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether internet-delivered attentional bias&#xD;
      modification, which aims to implicitly train attention away from pain-related information,&#xD;
      has beneficial effects upon pain and pain-related distress in patients with chronic&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised to either an attentional training condition, or to a&#xD;
      no-training placebo condition. The primary outcome measures are pain intensity and pain&#xD;
      interference, and secondary outcome measures include anxiety, depression, pain-related fear&#xD;
      and sleep problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed and reported separately for participants aged 16 - 24 and 25 - 60. It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that participants receiving internet-delivered attentional bias modification&#xD;
      will show significantly greater reductions in pain and pain-related distress compared to&#xD;
      participants receiving placebo training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a complex medical condition. Patients often experience&#xD;
      increased levels of pain-related distress, including anxiety, depression and disability,&#xD;
      impaired sleep, poor well-being and diminished quality of life. Over the past decade,&#xD;
      numerous studies have provided evidence for the existence of attentional bias towards&#xD;
      pain-related information in chronic pain patients. A critical question remaining unanswered&#xD;
      is whether pain-related bias is simply an epiphenomenon of chronic pain, or whether it has a&#xD;
      causal role in the maintenance of pain. Recently, there has been growing interest in the&#xD;
      potential benefits of attentional retraining in individuals with various emotional disorders,&#xD;
      with focus upon attentional bias modification (ABM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABM is a theory-driven intervention which uses computer-based paradigms, typically the&#xD;
      visual-probe task, to implicitly manipulate attention away from sources of threat relevant to&#xD;
      the individual's fears or concerns. To date, three published studies using ABM with chronic&#xD;
      pain patients exist, the combined results of which support the therapeutic benefits of ABM on&#xD;
      pain, pain-related distress and disability. Considering these encouraging results, it is&#xD;
      important to expand this field of research and explore ABM in chronic pain in greater depth.&#xD;
      In particular, all former studies assessed the clinical effectiveness of ABM in laboratory&#xD;
      environments. The purpose of this double-blind RCT study is to determine whether&#xD;
      internet-delivered ABM training (I-ABMT) has therapeutic benefits for patients with chronic&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain on pain and pain-related distress, thereby assessing training effects in&#xD;
      real-world settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visual-probe task will be used for assessment and modification of pain-related&#xD;
      attentional biases. This is a computerised paradigm which records participant response times&#xD;
      to a series of visual stimuli. Following an initial fixation point, each trial presents a&#xD;
      stimulus pair in distinct locations (e.g. left and right of the initial fixation point), for&#xD;
      a specified length of time (i.e., 500 or 1250ms). Stimuli may consist of words or images,&#xD;
      with experimental trials featuring one pain-related stimulus and one neutral stimulus.&#xD;
      Following this, both stimuli are removed, with a visual probe replacing one stimulus.&#xD;
      Participants indicate the location of this probe as quickly and accurately as possible via&#xD;
      manual response. Response times are faster to probes appearing in an attended region of the&#xD;
      screen than an unattended region, providing a measure of attentional allocation. Averaged&#xD;
      response times are calculated, which are converted into an index of attentional bias. In the&#xD;
      standard and control (i.e., placebo) versions of the visual probe task, the probe replaces&#xD;
      pain-related and neutral stimuli an equal number of times, while in the I-ABMT version, the&#xD;
      probe always replaces neutral stimuli thus training attention away from pain-related stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose effects will be explored in this study, with participants randomised to one of four&#xD;
      conditions: (i) 10-session Attentional Modification Group , (ii) 10-session Attentional&#xD;
      Control Group, (iii) 18-session Attentional Modification Group, and (iv) 18-session&#xD;
      Attentional Control Group. The primary outcome measures are pain intensity and pain&#xD;
      interference, and secondary outcome measures include anxiety, depression, pain-related fear&#xD;
      and sleeping impairment, including engagement to and satisfaction with the online&#xD;
      visual-probe training task. It is hypothesized that participants receiving ABM training will&#xD;
      show significantly greater reductions in pain and pain-related distress compared to&#xD;
      participants receiving placebo training. Dose effects will be investigated in an exploratory&#xD;
      manner, and data will be analysed and reported separately for participants aged 16 - 24 and&#xD;
      25 - 60.&#xD;
