    <textblock>
      This first in man (FIM) study is to collect data in support of the safety and performance of&#xD;
      the Intact Vascular Tack-It Endovascular System™ for tissue apposition to optimize balloon&#xD;
      angioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: Composite of Major Adverse Limb Events (MALE) and Peri-procedural Death (POD),&#xD;
      assessed at 1 month. Endpoint includes any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major amputation - amputation above the ankle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Re-intervention (surgical or endovascular) in the target limb&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure-related death - any death within 1 month of the index procedure or any MALE&#xD;

      at the intended target site(s) and successful withdrawal of the delivery catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical Success: Device success (defined above) and the ability of the Tack to resolve&#xD;
      post-PTA dissection, demonstrating angiographic patency at the conclusion of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Success: Ability of the Tack to resolve post-PTA dissection and achieve patency at&#xD;
      the conclusion of the procedure, without procedure related complications within 48 hours&#xD;
      after the index procedure or at hospital discharge, whichever is sooner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Maintenance of luminal patency of the target lesion by TBI (≤0.15 decrease) as compared&#xD;
           to the baseline TBI obtained prior to discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Doppler Exam (presence of signal)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study observational endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameter will be assessed at 6 months (Per local Standard of Care):&#xD;
