      This study will enroll specimens from subjects diagnosed with various cancers and who have&#xD;
      either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. RETROSPEFCTIVE / ARCHIVAL SAMPLES already undergone surgical resection of their tumor&#xD;
           and have one or more formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks on file within&#xD;
           the local (or affiliated) pathology archive (replicate blocks from same tumor) or blocks&#xD;
           no longer required to be maintained on file - discard blocks, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PROSPECTIVE SAMPLES are scheduled to undergo surgical treatment and who prior to&#xD;
           scheduled surgery, provide informed consent and donate a 10-20 ml blood sample. After&#xD;
           surgery, surplus tissues (including tumor and adjacent normal tissues) not required for&#xD;
           diagnosis will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject clinical information will be collected, including basic demographic information,&#xD;
      medical history, current cancer history and treatment. A final pathology report will be&#xD;
      obtained for each subject's surgical specimen. In some instances, and based on the cancer&#xD;
      indications required, longitudinal data may also be collected at a frequency of every 6&#xD;
      months to once per year. Longitudinal data will include information on study subject survival&#xD;
      and disease recurrence.&#xD;
