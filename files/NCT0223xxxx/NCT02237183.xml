      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of iloprost compared with a placebo&#xD;
      in preventing lung cancer in former smokers. Chemoprevention is the use of drugs to keep&#xD;
      cancer from forming or coming back. Inhaled iloprost may help prevent lung cancer from&#xD;
      forming in patients who used to smoke and who have been found to have abnormal cells in their&#xD;
      mucus.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the toxicity of inhalational iloprost administered to patients daily for 2&#xD;
      months, given four times a day (QID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the compliance QID dosing regimens. II. To evaluate the effect on&#xD;
      endobronchial histology. III. To evaluate the effect on expectorated sputum cytology by both&#xD;
      standard cytologic analysis and an automated three-dimensional morphologic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the effect on endobronchial brushing and biopsy gene expression of peroxisome&#xD;
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), glutathione S-transferase mu (GSTmu),&#xD;
      carboxylesterase 1 (Ces1), Fos-related antigen 1 (FosL1), cytochrome p4502e1, stearoyl coA&#xD;
      desaturase 1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily member 9, transforming growth factor&#xD;
      beta (TGFbeta), Jun and a 46 gene panel associated with dysplasia persistence, using&#xD;
      Affymetrix arrays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the improvement in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as measured by&#xD;
      arterial blood gas (ABG) (improved ventilation perfusion matching), pulmonary function&#xD;
      testing, 6-minute walk distance, quality of life (St. George's respiratory questionnaire,&#xD;
      COPD assessment test [CAT]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate whether the in vitro response of cultured airway epithelial progenitor cells&#xD;
      to iloprost is a predictor of in vivo response in study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are enrolled to Cohort A to completion prior to initiation of Cohort B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT A: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive iloprost via inhalation using a nebulizer QID for 60 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive placebo via inhalation using a nebulizer QID for 60 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT B: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms. COHORT B DISCONTINUED AS OF 03/26/2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Patients receive iloprost via inhalation using a nebulizer BID for 60 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM IV: Patients receive placebo via inhalation using a nebulizer BID for 60 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 90 days and then annually&#xD;
      for up to 5 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of iloprost on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic&#xD;
             dose are unknown; for this reason and because prostacyclins are known to be&#xD;
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men having intercourse with a woman&#xD;
             of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while participating in this study, she should inform her study physician immediately;&#xD;
             Note: Women are considered to be of child-bearing potential if they are not surgically&#xD;
             sterile or are under the age of 65 and have menstruated within the last two years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants must not be currently receiving or have previously received&#xD;
             thiazolidinedione treatment unless sputum atypia or endobronchial dysplasia are&#xD;
             documented again after thiazolidinedione treatment and within 12 months of entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not have been treated with iloprost at any time; Note: participants&#xD;
             on the placebo arm of previous iloprost trials are eligible, but participants on the&#xD;
             placebo arm of cohort A of this study may not be enrolled in cohort B&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not have used any other investigation agent within the last six&#xD;
             months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of&#xD;
             similar chemical or biologic composition of iloprost&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not&#xD;
             limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that in the opinion of investigators would jeopardize patient safety of data&#xD;
             integrity; Note: individuals who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive will&#xD;
             not necessarily be excluded, will be considered on a case-by-case basis, but will be&#xD;
             required to meet criteria related to patient safety and data integrity, as assessed by&#xD;
             investigators&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not have a current or prior invasive malignancy within the past 6&#xD;
             months; participants may enroll prior to biopsy result report, unless there are&#xD;
             findings at bronchoscopy suggesting an invasive malignancy; history of the following&#xD;
             curatively treated cancers during any time prior to screening is allowed: non-melanoma&#xD;
             skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, and bladder carcinoma in situ&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must not have received either chemotherapy or radiotherapy within the&#xD;
             previous 6 months; Note: participants receiving long-term adjuvant hormonal therapy&#xD;
             (such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer) are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding; iloprost is a prostacyclin agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with iloprost, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with iloprost&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As iloprost inhibits platelet function, patients must not be taking anticoagulants,&#xD;
             with the exception of aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to risk for hypotension in patients on vasodilators or antihypertensive&#xD;
             medications, participants must not have blood pressure &lt; 95 mm Hg systolic&#xD;
