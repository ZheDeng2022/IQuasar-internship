    <textblock>
      Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has been detected in humans in the Caribbean area for the first&#xD;
      time in November 2013 (St-Martin Island). By February 2014, the virus had spread to several&#xD;
      other Caribbean islands as well as French Guyana, South America. During the outbreak of&#xD;
      Chikungunya that affected the Reunion island in 2005/2006, it was observed that the neonatal&#xD;
      forms of infections acquired by mother to child transmission during childbirth, were not the&#xD;
      exception and were critical. Mother-to-child transmission occurs when the mother is viremic&#xD;
      at the time of delivery. The mean duration of viremia after the onset of first clinical&#xD;
      symptoms is six days. The rate of mother-to-child transmission is 50%. All neonates&#xD;
      contaminated during labor and delivery present with a symptomatic disease and the rate of&#xD;
      severe forms is about 50%, primarily due to damage of the central nervous system, often&#xD;
      leaving permanent damage (seizures, cerebral palsy).Due to the severity of Chikungunya in&#xD;
      neonates and the burden of cerebral palsy, it is imperative to identify a safe and effective&#xD;
      preventive and/or curative intervention. Human polyvalent immunoglobulins purified from&#xD;
      plasma samples obtained from Chikungunya-convalescent donors exhibit a potent neutralizing&#xD;
      activity in vitro. They were evaluated for their preventive and curative effects in a&#xD;
      neonatal mouse model of CHIKV infection. After administration of a lethal dose of CHIKV, all&#xD;
      neonatal mice that had received immunoglobulins survived while all control animals that had&#xD;
      received non hyperimmune immunoglobulins died. In humans, specific human immunoglobulins&#xD;
      proved to be effective and safe in neonates born to hepatitis B viremic mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis : The investigators hypothesize that the administration of anti-CHIKV hyperimmune&#xD;
      human intravenous immunoglobulins to neonates exposed to a high risk of severe form of&#xD;
      Chikungunya infection is safe enough to justify its evaluation in an open non randomized&#xD;
      trial aimed to confirm the safety and preliminary assess the efficacy of this intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population to be studied will consist of neonates born to mothers presenting with&#xD;
      clinical symptoms of Chikungunya within six days before and two days after childbirth. These&#xD;
      neonates will therefore be exposed to a high risk of developing a severe form of Chikungunya&#xD;
      infection. In most cases the reality of this risk will have been demonstrated by a positive&#xD;
      CHIKV RT-PCR on maternal blood sampled before childbirth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      References to literature and data that are relevant to the trial, and that provide background&#xD;
      for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chikungunya virus has been detected in humans in the Caribbean area for the first time in&#xD;
      November 2013 (St-Martin Island). By February 2014, the virus had spread to several other&#xD;
      Caribbean islands as well as French Guyana, South America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the outbreak of Chikungunya (CHIK) that affected the Reunion Island in 2005/2006, the&#xD;
      neonatal forms of infections acquired by mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) during&#xD;
      childbirth, were reported in 50% of viremic mothers and associated with high neonate&#xD;
      morbidity. MTCT occurred only when the mother was viremic at the time of delivery. The&#xD;
      viremic period begins 2 days before the onset of symptoms and lasts for six days following&#xD;
      the first symptoms. In infected neonates contaminated during labor, symptoms appeared after a&#xD;
      median incubation period of 4 days. All neonate CHIK cases were symptomatic and the rate of&#xD;
      severe forms was about 50%; these severe forms were primarily due to damages to the central&#xD;
      nervous system, often leaving permanent damage (seizures, cerebral palsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the severity of Chikungunya in neonates and the burden of cerebral palsy, it is&#xD;
      imperative to identify a safe and effective preventive and/or curative intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the administration of hyperimmune human intravenous immunoglobulins to&#xD;
      neonates exposed to a high risk of severe form of Chikungunya infection is safe enough to&#xD;
      justify its evaluation in an open non randomized trial aimed to confirm the safety and&#xD;
      preliminary assess the effectiveness of this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the primary objective of the trial is to assess the safety of hyperimmune human&#xD;
      intravenous immunoglobulins in neonates, a clear potential individual benefit is expected for&#xD;
      participating neonates, namely a decreased risk of development of a severe form of&#xD;
      Chikungunya, especially in terms of high-burden central nervous system complications&#xD;
      (seizures, cerebral palsy). This is a major issue since the first case of complicated&#xD;
      neonatal Chikungunya has already occurred in Martinique in January 2014 (clinical&#xD;
      manifestations included fever, pain, skin rash, and encephalopathy in a four-day-old&#xD;
      neonate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this trial demonstrates safety and is consistent with potential efficacy of anti-CHIKV&#xD;
      hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulins, this would pave the way to the realization of a&#xD;
      phase III trial whose main objective would be to confirm the effectiveness of the strategy,&#xD;
      including in other situations, particularly in individuals at risk for severe disease such as&#xD;
      exposed neonates and adults with underlying conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This would also be a proof-of-concept for such a therapeutic/preventive strategy in other&#xD;
      severe emerging infectious diseases such as arboviral diseases or viral hemorrhagic fevers,&#xD;
      as long as no specific drug or vaccine is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of developing a severe form in Chikungunya is high in neonates born to CHIKV-viremic&#xD;
      mothers. Central nervous system complications represent the most important concern because&#xD;
      they are both frequent and frequently associated with permanent brain damages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no effective therapeutic strategy has been identified in this situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administration of hyperimmune anti-CHICKV intravenous immunoglobulins has proven&#xD;
      effective in preventing the development of Chikungunya in a neonatal mouse model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several randomized clinical trials demonstrated that intravenous immunoglobulins where safe&#xD;
      when administered to neonates and infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first cases of neonatal Chikungunya infection have been identified in French West Indies&#xD;
      since the onset of the current outbreak and at least one case was associated with CNS&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatricians and neonatologists working in the four hospitals that will participate in the&#xD;
      clinical trial have been contacted. They expressed that they are keen to provide a&#xD;
      potentially effective therapy to newborns exposed to a high risk of developing of Chikungunya&#xD;
      infection and they are convinced that such a treatment would be harmless to neonates, based&#xD;
      on their own experience with the use of polyvalent intravenous immunoglobulins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No specific treatment has been identified to date for Chikungunya infection, especially for&#xD;
      severe neonatal forms. While efficacy and safety of anti-CHIKV hyperimmune immunoglobulins&#xD;
      have been demonstrated in neonate mice, to date no such study has been performed in humans.&#xD;
      Therefore this study would be first to assess this promising therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also expected that this study will provide new information on the natural history of&#xD;
      Chikungunya infection in neonates as well as on the pathophysiology of viral transmission&#xD;
      (transplacentally during labor or/and during fetal progression into the genital tract).&#xD;
      Actually comparison of quantitative CHIKV RT PCR titers in mother's urine at delivery,&#xD;
      placenta, and neonate's blood and other fluids, as well as determination of placental&#xD;
      microperfusion markers (placental alkaline phosphatase on cord blood) should shed light on&#xD;
      this issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: The primary endpoint will be evaluated in all enrolled neonates.&#xD;
      Tolerability and safety of anti-CHIK IVIG will be assessed by evaluating the frequency of&#xD;
      patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, pulmonary hemorrhage, tachycardia or&#xD;
      hypotension during anti-CHIKV IVIG infusion, hemolytic anemia, hyponatremia and ascites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: Secondary endpoints will be evaluated only in neonates born to mothers&#xD;
      who had a definite CHIKV-infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the tolerability and safety of anti-CHIKV&#xD;
      hyperimmune immunoglobulins given intravenously to neonates exposed to a high risk of MTCT of&#xD;
      CHIKV, i.e. born to a mother with definite or possible CHIKV infection at the time of&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of anti-CHIKV hyperimmune&#xD;
      immunoglobulins given intravenously in the subgroup of neonates born to mothers with definite&#xD;
      CHIKV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonates will be classified in one of the following 3 categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neonatal CHIKV clinical disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical symptoms consistent with acute CHIKV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Demonstration of infection based on CHIKV IgM seroconversion and/or identification&#xD;
                of CHIKV viremia (positive CHIKV qRT-PCR at Day 3),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neonatal CHIKV asymptomatic infection:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Absence of any symptom consistent with CHIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Demonstration of infection based on CHIKV IgM seroconversion and/or identification&#xD;
                of CHIKV viremia (positive CHIKV qRT-PCR at Day 3),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neonatal CHIKV infection excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Absence of CHIKV IgM seroconversion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social and Behavioral Science Survey:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, we will conduct a Social and Behavioral Science survey aimed to assess the&#xD;
      factors associated with the parental decision to participate or not in the clinical trial,&#xD;
      given its peculiar context (emerging disease, therapeutic intervention in a neonate,&#xD;
      invitation to participate in the peri-partum period, short period of time for&#xD;
      decision-making.&#xD;
