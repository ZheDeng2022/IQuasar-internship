  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase II trial focused on how dabrafenib and trametinib before and after&#xD;
      surgery works in treating patients with stage IIIB-C melanoma that has a specific mutation in&#xD;
      the BRAF gene. Dabrafenib and trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving dabrafenib and trametinib before surgery may&#xD;
      make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.&#xD;
      Giving dabrafenib and trametinib after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare relapse-free survival (RFS) between patients who develop a pathologic complete&#xD;
      response (pCR) or do not achieve a pCR following dabrafenib and trametinib neoadjuvant&#xD;
      combination therapy in patients with locally advanced BRAF V600 mutated melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare overall survival of patients with pathologic complete response (pCR) and&#xD;
      patients without pCR who are receiving dabrafenib and trametinib neoadjuvant therapy followed&#xD;
      by adjuvant combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To identify biomarkers predictive of response through collection of serial blood draws&#xD;
      and biopsies in patients receiving neoadjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the safety of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate and perform further advanced imaging analysis on magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) scanned (if&#xD;
      available) images collected on patients enrolled onto this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and trametinib PO once daily (QD)&#xD;
      for 8 weeks. After completion of 8 weeks of dabrafenib and trametinib, patients undergo&#xD;
      surgery. Approximately 1 week after surgery, patients receive dabrafenib PO BID and&#xD;
      trametinib PO QD for 44 additional weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.&#xD;

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed below; this&#xD;
             criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until 4&#xD;
             weeks after the last dose of study medication; however, it is advised that&#xD;
             contraception be used for a total of 16 weeks following the last dose (based on the&#xD;
             lifecycle of sperm); methods: a) abstinence, defined as sexual inactivity consistent&#xD;
             with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject; periodic abstinence (e.g.&#xD;
             calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not&#xD;
             acceptable methods of contraception; b) condom (during non-vaginal intercourse with&#xD;
             any partner - male or female) OR c) condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
             cervical/vault caps) plus spermicidal agent (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) (during&#xD;
             sexual intercourse with a female)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented&#xD;
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of&#xD;
                  spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous&#xD;
                  follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] &gt; 40 MlU/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/mL [&lt; 140&#xD;
                  pmol/L] is confirmatory); females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose&#xD;
                  menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception&#xD;
                  methods listed below if they wish to continue their HRT during the study;&#xD;
                  otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal&#xD;
                  status prior to study enrollment; for most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will&#xD;
                  elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends&#xD;
                  on the type and dosage of HRT; following confirmation of their post-menopausal&#xD;
                  status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a&#xD;
                  contraceptive method&#xD;

                  below for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or&#xD;
                  investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of&#xD;
                  pregnancy at that point; female subjects must agree to use contraception until 4&#xD;
                  weeks after the last dose of study medication, and must have a negative serum or&#xD;
                  urine pregnancy test within 14 days prior to the start of dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects contraception methods: a) abstinence; b) intrauterine device (IUD) or&#xD;
             intrauterine system (IUS) that meets the &lt; 1% failure rate as stated in the product&#xD;
             label; c) male partner sterilization prior to the female subject's entry into the&#xD;
             study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject; d) double barrier method:&#xD;
             condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) plus spermicidal agent&#xD;
             (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository)&#xD;
