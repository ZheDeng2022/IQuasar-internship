    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how safe and effective the combination of the study&#xD;
      drugs romidepsin and lenalidomide is for treating patients with peripheral t-cell lymphoma&#xD;
      (PTCL) who have not been previously treated for this cancer. Currently, there is no standard&#xD;
      treatment for patients with PTCL; the most common treatment used is a combination of drugs&#xD;
      called CHOP, but this can be a difficult treatment to tolerate because of side effects, and&#xD;
      is not particularly effective for most patients with PTCL. Romidepsin (Istodax®) is a type of&#xD;
      drug called an HDAC inhibitor. It interacts with DNA (genetic material in cells) in ways that&#xD;
      can stop tumors from growing. It is given as an infusion through the veins. Lenalidomide&#xD;
      (Revlimid®) is a type of drug known as an immunomodulatory drug, or IMID for short. This drug&#xD;
      affects how tumor cells grow and survive, including affecting blood vessel growth in tumors.&#xD;
      It is given as an oral tablet (by mouth).&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of romidepsin plus lenalidomide in patients&#xD;
      with previously untreated peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety of the combination of romidepsin and lenalidomide. II. Further&#xD;
      evaluate efficacy of the combination of romidepsin and lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate the delay to cytotoxic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the use of Northwestern Medicine (NM) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) vs CT imaging in PTCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Validate a new prognostic model for newly diagnosed PTCL. III. Investigate the tumor&#xD;
      immunohistochemical profile to identify potential biomarkers associated with prognosis and&#xD;
      treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive romidepsin intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 and&#xD;
      lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up&#xD;
      to 1 year in the absence of disease progression, inter-current illness that prevents further&#xD;
      administration of treatment, unacceptable toxicity, patient decides to withdraw from study&#xD;
      treatment (or study as a whole), or general or specific changes in the patient's condition&#xD;
      render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type&#xD;
&#xD;

               -  Transformed mycosis fungoides&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: A copy of the pathology report is sufficient to register the patient to the&#xD;
                  trial; diagnosis of PTCL should have been based on identification in biopsy&#xD;
                  specimens of a peripheral T-cell lymphoma disorder characterized by positivity in&#xD;
                  the malignant cell population of at least 3 of the following T-cell markers:&#xD;
                  betaF1, cluster of differentiation (CD)2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, and negativity&#xD;
                  of at least 2 of the following B-cell markers CD19, CD20, CD79alpha and paired&#xD;
                  box 5 (Pax-5); further, CD56 should be used for the diagnosis of the nasal type,&#xD;
                  while CD30, ALK-1 and Pax-5 (that should be negative) are required for the&#xD;
                  anaplastic type; CD10, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 13 (CXCL13), programmed&#xD;
                  cell death (PD)-1 and CD21 are warranted for the diagnosis of angioimmunoblastic&#xD;
                  T-cell lymphoma along with Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small ribonucleic acid&#xD;
                  (RNA) (EBER) in situ hybridization; determination of mindbomb E3 ubiquitin&#xD;
                  protein ligase 1(Mib-1)/marker of proliferation Ki-67 (Ki-67) to be performed;&#xD;

                  lymphoma, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma and subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell&#xD;
                  lymphoma are TIA1 cytotoxic granule-associated RNA binding protein (TIA-1),&#xD;
                  granzyme B and perforin; it is acknowledged that no marker has absolute lineage&#xD;
                  specificity, and that immunophenotypic studies should be performed with panels of&#xD;
                  monoclonal antibodies; final diagnoses containing caveats such as &quot;suspicious of&quot;&#xD;
                  or &quot;presumably&quot; are considered inadequate for a patient to be enrolled in the&#xD;
                  trial&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Patients with adequate archived (well-preserved, formalin-fixed) biopsy&#xD;
                  tissue remaining will be required to submit a portion for exploratory studies;&#xD;
                  this is not optional if tissue is available; however, lack of adequate tissue for&#xD;
                  exploratory studies will not preclude patients from participating&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have bi-dimensionally measurable disease (&gt;= 1 cm) by CT imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Patients with marrow-only disease are eligible; response for these patients&#xD;

               -  Males receiving lenalidomide must agree to use a latex condom during any sexual&#xD;
                  contact with FCBPs even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: A FCBP is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a&#xD;
