  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to test the hypothesis that aerobic training can reduce&#xD;
      flu-like symptoms following interferon beta 1a injections in patients with Multiple&#xD;
      Sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary purpose is to evaluate whether or not changes in circulating cytokines provide a&#xD;
      mechanism that can explain a potential positive effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Flu-like symptoms (FLS) such as fever, muscle aches, chills, and fatigue are common side&#xD;
      effects of interferon beta (IFN-ß) treatment and may affect the willingness of patients with&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis (MS) to initiate therapy. The initiation phase of MS treatment is a&#xD;
      critical period that can affect patients' views on the long-term acceptability and the&#xD;
      adherence to the therapy, underscoring the need for strategies to reduce treatment-related&#xD;
      adverse events such as FLS following IFN-ß injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once-weekly intramuscular IFNß-1a, which has been available since 1996, is indicated for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with relapsing forms of MS to slow the accumulation of physical&#xD;
      disability progression and the frequency of clinical exacerbations. Although intramuscular&#xD;
      IFNß-1a is generally well tolerated, FLS have been reported in up to 76% of patients&#xD;
      receiving this treatment. Consequently, interventions that can reduce FLS after IFNß-1a&#xD;
      injection are warranted. One approach to reduce FLS has been dose titration. Titration is the&#xD;
      practice of initiating therapy with a lower starting dose and gradually increasing the dose&#xD;
      at defined intervals until the full dose is reached. Moreover, a combination of dose&#xD;
      titration and pre-treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or&#xD;
      acetaminophen in healthy subjects, has been sown to reduce FLS severity by 37-76%. However,&#xD;
      not all patients benefit from dose titration and also the effects in MS still have to be&#xD;
      determined. Consequently, other types of FLS management after IFNß-1a injection have to be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, case reports from both Finland and Denmark suggest that aerobic exercise is&#xD;
      able to markedly reduce FLS symptoms in MS patients, but so far no studies have evaluated&#xD;
      this. However, from healthy subjects it is known that aerobic exercise is capable of&#xD;
      positively influencing the immune system and evidence suggests that the prophylactic effect&#xD;
      of exercise may, to some extent, be the induction of an anti-inflammatory environment with&#xD;
      each bout of exercise (e.g. via increases in circulating anti-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      including interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist and IL-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing evidence is particularly suggestive of an acute effect of aerobic exercise on&#xD;
      the circulating cytokine levels, which could be an important mechanism in explaining a&#xD;
      potential positive effect of aerobic exercise on FLS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, the purpose of the present study is to test the hypothesis that aerobic&#xD;
      training can reduce FLS following interferon beta 1a injections in patients with Multiple&#xD;
      Sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary purpose is to evaluate whether or not changes in circulating cytokines provide a&#xD;
      mechanism that can explain a potential positive effect.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Definite relapsing-remitting MS according to the McDonald criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treated with IFNß-1a (Avonex®) for at least 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Frequent experiencing FLS (muscle aches, chills, fatigue, fewer9) in the hours&#xD;
             following IFNß-1a injection (self-reporting that this happens 75% or more of the times&#xD;
             after injection).&#xD;
