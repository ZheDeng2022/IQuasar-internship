  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 120 patients with pathologically confirmed locally advanced low-risk&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma were enrolled. They were randomly divided into two groups, with 60&#xD;
      patients in each group. One group was treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy&#xD;
      (IMRT) combined with Endostar and the other group was treated with IMRT combined with&#xD;
      concurrent chemotherapy. The short term efficacy and the toxic and side effects of these&#xD;
      treatments were evaluated. The 1-year, 3-year, 5-year overall survival and progression-free&#xD;
      survival of patients were analyzed. Our data may provide an alternative option for the&#xD;
      treatment of locally advanced low-risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma with high efficacy and low&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;

      This study was a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial. A set of&#xD;
      unified standards were used, including the clinical research program, inclusion criteria,&#xD;
      exclusion criteria, chemoradiotherapy regimen and evaluation criteria. Six medical centers&#xD;
      participated in this study and 120 patients with pathologically confirmed locally advanced&#xD;
      low-risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma were enrolled. These patients were stratified according to&#xD;
      clinical stage and participating center, and were randomly divided into two groups: IMRT&#xD;
      combined with Endostar group ( IMRT 70-74Gy, Endostar 7.5mg / m2, 2 cycles of intravenous&#xD;
      infusion, and 2 cycles of maintenance therapy after radiotherapy) and IMRT combined with&#xD;
      concurrent chemotherapy group ( IMRT 70-74Gy, DDP 100mg / m2, intravenous infusion over 2&#xD;
      hours , for 2-3 cycles). After treatment, follow-up was performed every 3 months. The&#xD;
      treatment toxicity, local control rate, distant metastasis-free survival, overall survival,&#xD;
      progression-free survival were observed and assessed.&#xD;
