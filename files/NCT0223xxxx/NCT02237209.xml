    <textblock>
      Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of illness in infants and children around&#xD;
      the world. This study will evaluate the safety and immune response to an RSV vaccine in&#xD;
      RSV-seronegative infants and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a companion study to CIR 291.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RSV is the most common viral cause of serious acute lower respiratory illness (LRI) in&#xD;
      infants and children under 5 years of age in the world. RSV illness can range from mild upper&#xD;
      respiratory tract illness (URI) to severe LRI, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Severe&#xD;
      RSV disease in infancy may also predispose children to develop reactive airway disease during&#xD;
      childhood. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an RSV&#xD;
      vaccine (RSV LID ΔM2-2) in RSV-seronegative infants and children at least 6 months and&#xD;
      through 24 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine study eligibility, the screening process will include a blood collection.&#xD;
      Screening may begin after the RSV season (i.e., as of April 1) and enrollment must precede&#xD;
      the RSV season (no later than October 14). At study entry, eligible participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive one dose of either the RSV vaccine or placebo, which will be&#xD;
      delivered as nose drops. Participants will also undergo a review of medical history, clinical&#xD;
      assessment, and a nasal wash. They will then receive their assigned vaccine and will remain&#xD;
      under observation for monitoring for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine. Additional study&#xD;
      visits will occur at Days 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, 19, 21, 28, and 56. These visits will&#xD;
      include clinical assessments and nasal washes; on Day 56, a blood collection will also occur.&#xD;
      On days where no study visit is scheduled (through Day 29), participants' parents or&#xD;
      guardians will report participants' temperatures and signs of illness to researchers by&#xD;
      e-mail or phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In October following vaccination, participants may have a pre-RSV season blood collection&#xD;
      visit. During RSV season, November through March following vaccination, researchers will&#xD;
      contact participants' parents or guardians on a weekly basis for follow-up monitoring. During&#xD;
      this time frame, participants seen by a medical provider for fever, respiratory illness, or&#xD;
      otitis media will have a study visit, which will include a nasal wash and clinical&#xD;
      assessment. In April following vaccination, participants will undergo a final blood&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
