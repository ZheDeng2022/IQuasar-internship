  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This drug-drug interaction study will assess the potential of CTX-4430 to induce CYP3A&#xD;
      activity in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that midazolam (a sensitive, widely used CYP3A4 substrate) blood&#xD;
      levels will not change after treatment with CTX-4430.&#xD;
