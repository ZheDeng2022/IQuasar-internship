  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is a common childhood-onset, multi-factorial, highly&#xD;
      heritable, clinically and genetically heterogeneous, neurodevelopmental disorder. Due to its&#xD;
      high prevalence and severe lifelong impairment without effective prevention and treatment,&#xD;
      there is a dearth of investigating its pathogenesis, longitudinal outcome, and biomarkers&#xD;
      (endophenotypes). The ultimate goals of this 5-year project are to prospectively investigate&#xD;
      the outcome and changes of psychosocial and neurocognitive functions of a cohort of probands&#xD;
      with ASD at adolescence and young adulthood as the primary aim; and to test whether&#xD;
      structural and functional brain connectivity can be effective endophenotypes of ASD using the&#xD;
      unaffected sibling and follow-up designs as the secondary aims.&#xD;

      Primary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the neuropsychological, neuroimaging, social cognitive, and psychosocial&#xD;
      outcomes at adolescence and young adulthood among children with ASD as compared to typically&#xD;
      developing (TD) controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the changes and stability of ASD core symptoms, neuropsychological function,&#xD;
           structured and functional connectivity, psychosocial functions over a 4-7 year follow-up&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify early individual (clinical, behavioral, and neurocognitive variables),&#xD;
           family, school, environmental factors to predict the neurocognitive and psychosocial&#xD;
           outcomes at adolescence and young adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To validate the neuropsychological functioning (e.g., set-shifting, executive function,&#xD;
           and visuo-spatial memory etc.) and structural (morphometric,, cortical thickness,&#xD;
           gyrification, white matter tract integrity) and functional connectivity (resting-state&#xD;
           and social task fMRI) in fronto-temporal, cortico-striato-thalamic, default mode&#xD;
           network, and other circuits as effective imaging endophenotypes (biomarkers) by&#xD;
           demonstrating the stability of these imaging data and the intermediate position of&#xD;
           unaffected siblings between ASD probands and age-, sex-, handedness-, and IQ-matched TD&#xD;
           at Time 1 and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To correlate the data from structural and functional connectivity, neuropsychology and&#xD;
           ASD core symptoms stratifying by proband-unaffected sibling dyads, and different&#xD;
           developmental stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To collect blood sample, and to analyze neurodevelopmental and immune genes, cytokine&#xD;
           level, and environmental exposure.&#xD;
