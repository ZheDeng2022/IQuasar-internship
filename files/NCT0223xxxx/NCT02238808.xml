    <textblock>
      Some breast cancers have estrogen receptors (ER+). The investigators know that some ER+&#xD;
      tumours can be cured by hormone therapy alone while other ER+ breast cancers cannot.&#xD;
      Currently, there is no perfect way to tell these groups apart nor do the investigators know&#xD;
      why some respond when others do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research findings suggest that the two types of ER+ breast cancers differ in their response&#xD;
      to estrogen with estrogen being toxic to one type and not the other. For those tumours that&#xD;
      find estrogen toxic, this may explain why tumours only start to grow when estrogen levels&#xD;
      decrease after menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see whether a two-week treatment of estrogen equal to&#xD;
      pre-menopausal estrogen levels will decrease the rate at which patients' ER+ tumours grow.&#xD;
      This will be done by comparing the growth rate in the tissue removed during standard of care&#xD;
      surgery after patients have been treated with 7-14 days of estrogen prior to that surgery.&#xD;

      Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that includes two ER+ genetic subtypes (luminal A&#xD;
      and luminal B) that differ in their response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from the Women's Health Initiative Trial showed that estrogen treated hysterectomized&#xD;
      women with no prior history of breast cancer had a significant and persistent decrease in&#xD;
      breast cancer incidence when compared to placebo treated participants. This implies that some&#xD;
      ER+ breast cancers are in fact growth inhibited by estrogens and are not growth promoted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that some ER+ breast cancers (luminal A) are actually&#xD;
      sensitive (growth inhibited) by estrogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess changes in breast cancer proliferation after a 7-14 day trial of estradiol in&#xD;
           newly diagnosed estrogen receptor positive post-menopausal breast cancer patients prior&#xD;
           to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exploratory analysis of biologic correlates with comparison to available genotyping&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label single group assignment pilot study for safety/efficacy and exploratory&#xD;
      biologic correlates&#xD;
