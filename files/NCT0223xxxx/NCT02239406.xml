  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if avascular necrosis of the acetabulum is present&#xD;
      in metal-on-metal revisions and to what depth this dead avascular bone occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convenient sample of a consecutive series of 15 patients treated for metal on metal&#xD;
      acetabular revision surgery will be included.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients being treated for metal on metal acetabular revision surgery by a physician at&#xD;
      OrthoCarolina, PA will be screened for eligibility. These patients will be approached by&#xD;
      their surgeon and asked to volunteer their participation in the study. Potential subjects&#xD;
      will meet with a research coordinator to discuss details of the study and those you volunteer&#xD;
      participation will be asked to sign an informed consent prior to the collection of study&#xD;
      data. . Basic demographic information (initials, age, gender, height, weight, BMI), dates of&#xD;
      original index surgery, reason for revision, type of implant being removed, and standard of&#xD;
      care cobalt and chromium metal ion levels will be collected via chart review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet all eligibility criteria will have three biopsies performed at the time of&#xD;
      their revision surgery. A pathologist will note the presence or absence of bone necrosis and&#xD;
      will measure the length (mm) of necrosis, acute inflammation, chronic inflammation, normal&#xD;
      bone, and entire bone specimen in order to obtain a ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A bone biopsy is a procedure in which bone samples are removed (with a special instrument&#xD;
      during surgery) and looked at under a microscope for necrosis (tissue death), infection, or&#xD;
      other bone disorders. Once the acetabular hip replacement implants have been removed the&#xD;
      following steps will occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The biopsy needle will be inserted into the bone (3 locations; 2 from ilium, 1 from&#xD;
           pubis or ischium = 3 total).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The biopsy needle will be withdrawn and firm pressure will be applied to the biopsy site&#xD;
           for a few minutes, until the bleeding has stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each bone biopsy sample will be labeled sequentially and by anatomic location (i.e.,&#xD;
           ilium #1, ilium #2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The normal bone will be marked on the bone sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The bone biopsy sample will be sent to the lab for examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The acetabulum bone will be reamed so the new implant can be seated.&#xD;
