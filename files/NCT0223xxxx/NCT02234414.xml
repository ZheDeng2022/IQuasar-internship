  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Switzerland, the prevalence of vertebral fractures in community- dwelling women is unknown&#xD;
      and the published data from the Swiss hospitals statistics represent only the tip of the&#xD;
      iceberg. In addition, the percentages of women correctly identified with vertebral fractures&#xD;
      due to osteoporosis and the treatment rate of these women with a drug proven to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of further fractures are unknown. Furthermore, it is not known whether the prevalence of&#xD;
      vertebral fractures differs between urban and rural areas or between mountain areas and plain&#xD;
      country, e.g. due to possible differences in sun exposure (vitamin D production) and/ or in&#xD;
      physical activity and/ or dietary habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical signs and symptoms leading to the suspicion of vertebral fracture(s) lack either&#xD;
      sensitivity (wall-occiput distance) or specificity (rib-pelvis distance). Whether a&#xD;
      combination of both would improve sensitivity and specificity is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard for the diagnosis of vertebral fracture relies on antero-posterior and&#xD;
      lateral X-Rays of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Despite standardization of X-Ray readings, a&#xD;
      retrospective study of hospitalized elderly patients has shown that as many as 50% of the&#xD;
      radiographic reports failed to note the presence of moderate to severe vertebral fractures.&#xD;
      In a primary care setting, fewer than 2% of the women received diagnoses of osteoporosis or&#xD;
      vertebral fracture, although expected prevalence is 20% to 30% and appropriate drug treatment&#xD;
      was offered to only 36% of the diagnosed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent availability of software for vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) coupled to DXA&#xD;
      measurements allows for the detection of vertebral deformities, which is critical for&#xD;
      management of osteoporosis, as the existence of such deformities substantially increases the&#xD;
      risk of subsequent fracture. Recently published results show that VFA allows the diagnosis of&#xD;
      a vertebral fracture. The sensitivity of VFA for detection of vertebral fractures compared to&#xD;
      expert radiologist reading of X-ray is excellent for grade 2 and 3 fractures, ranging between&#xD;
      90-94%.&#xD;
