      The primary objectives of this study are to investigate the safety and tolerability profile&#xD;
      of the therapeutic vaccine hVEGF26-104/RFASE and to determine the effective dose of&#xD;
      hVEGF26-104/RFASE required to neutralize VEGF in serum, defined as a VEGF level below 9,0&#xD;
      pg/mL.&#xD;

      Angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing blood vessels) plays an&#xD;
      important role in the growth and spread of tumors. Angiogenesis is regulated by a balance of&#xD;
      activators and inhibitors. One of the angiogenic activators is the vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor (VEGF, also referred to as VEGF-A). Over the past decade, several angiogenesis&#xD;
      inhibitors have been discovered and implemented in the therapy of cancer patients.&#xD;
      Bevacizumab (a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits VEGF-A) has been shown to improve&#xD;
      survival in different tumor types in first and second line therapy when given in various&#xD;
      chemotherapy combinations. Furthermore, research has shown a survival benefit of continued&#xD;
      VEGF suppression with bevacizumab beyond first progression in metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      So although repeated use of bevacizumab as a chronic therapy is much desired, currently this&#xD;
      is not feasible because of substantial disadvantages of bevacizumab therapy. First, since&#xD;
      bevacizumab only offers temporary VEGF neutralization, it needs frequent repeated&#xD;
      administration. Secondly, bevacizumab is an intravenous therapy, which requires&#xD;
      hospitalization on each administration. Third, bevacizumab has very high production costs.&#xD;
      These specific drawbacks of longer term monoclonal antibody therapy could be circumvented by&#xD;
      the use of a therapeutic cancer vaccine targeting VEGF. A vaccine is able to induce sustained&#xD;
      VEGF suppression and can be administered via an intramuscular (IM) injection. In addition, a&#xD;
      vaccine will likely inhibit VEGF more effectively as compared to bevacizumab, because a&#xD;
      vaccine induces a polyclonal antibody response, resulting in higher avidity binding.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is believed that endogenous antibodies have a better tumor penetrating&#xD;
      capacity, as compared to exogenously administered antibodies. The vaccine hVEGF26-104 is a&#xD;
      truncated synthetic peptide mimic of the VEGF protein and consists of 79 amino acids (residue&#xD;
      26-104). The vaccine contains an antigen that directs the body's own polyclonal antibody&#xD;
      response towards the active site of the endogenous VEGF molecule. After binding of the&#xD;
      antibodies to endogenous VEGF this hormone will no longer be able to bind to its receptors&#xD;
      (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) and consequently will no longer exert its pro-angiogenic effect. To&#xD;
      enhance the immune response, RFASE, which belongs to the adjuvant group of&#xD;
      sulpholipopolysaccharides, will be used as an adjuvant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives - To investigate the safety and tolerability profile of hVEGF26-104/RFASE.&#xD;
      - To determine the effective dose of hVEGF26-104/RFASE required to neutralize VEGF in serum,&#xD;
      defined as a VEGF level below 9,0 pg/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives - To determine the anti-VEGF antibody titer, induced by&#xD;
      hVEGF26-104/RFASE administration. - To determine the effective dose of hVEGF26-104/RFASE&#xD;
      required to neutralize VEGF in plasma and in a platelet sample. - To assess the effect of&#xD;
      VEGF neutralization in a functional Ba/F3-R2 cell proliferation assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives - To assess the cellular anti-tumor immune response induced by&#xD;
      hVEGF26-104/RFASE administration. - To assess immunomodulatory effects upon hVEGF26-104/RFASE&#xD;
      administration. - To make a preliminary assessment of hVEGF26-104/RFASE to suppress&#xD;
      angiogenesis within the tumor. - To assess the immune infiltration and the regulation of&#xD;
      endothelial cell adhesion molecules within the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label single center phase I study. A &quot;3 + 3 &quot; dose escalation design will be&#xD;
      used. The study will investigate sequential cohorts consisting of 3 patients to be enrolled&#xD;
      and treated at the applicable dose level. The study medication consists of 1.0 mL hVEGF26-104&#xD;
      (in escalating doses of 62.5, 125, 250 and 500 µg/mL) combined with 1.0 mL RFASE (fixed dose&#xD;
      of 20 mg/mL). Eligible subjects will receive three IM injections with hVEGF26-104/RFASE on&#xD;
      days 0 (primer), 14 and 28 (boosters). To assess potential toxicity of the adjuvant RFASE,&#xD;
      the 3 patients enrolled in the first cohort of the study (62.5 μg/mL) will receive a single&#xD;
      injection with 1.0 mL RFASE (fixed dose of 20 mg/mL) as a single agent 14 days prior to the&#xD;
      first immunization with hVEGF26-104/RFASE. If none out of 3 patients experiences dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity (DLT) at a certain dose level, one can proceed to the next dose level. If&#xD;
      one patient experiences a DLT at a certain dose level, another 3 patients will be assigned at&#xD;
      the same dose level. In the highest dose escalation cohort, at least 6 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled. If VEGF is no longer neutralized, but there is no sign of progression either; the&#xD;
      patient will receive another booster of hVEGF26-104/RFASE in order to achieve VEGF&#xD;
      neutralization again. This booster can be repeated until progressive disease, death or other&#xD;
      reasons for withdrawal from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will receive three intramuscular injections with hVEGF26-104/RFASE in&#xD;
      dose-escalation on days 0 (primer), 14 and 28 (boosters), followed by an observation period&#xD;
      of 6 weeks. Blood will be drawn at given timepoints to assess safety, immunogenicity and&#xD;
      angiogenesis parameters. At screening, a tumor biopsy will be performed for a baseline&#xD;
      assessment of angiogenesis and immune infiltration. In the case that VEGF is neutralized 8&#xD;
      weeks after first hVEGF26-104 administration, the patient will be asked to undergo another&#xD;
      biopsy at week 10 to assess any possible change in angiogenesis and immune infiltration in&#xD;
      the tumor. If VEGF is no longer neutralized, but there is no sign of progression either; the&#xD;
      patient will receive another booster of hVEGF26-104/RFASE in order to achieve VEGF&#xD;
      neutralization again.&#xD;

    <description>hVEGF26-104/RFASE is investigated in dose escalation in which hVEGF26-104 is escalated from 62.5 ug to 500 ug and RFASE is given in a fixed dose of 20 mg. Three patients are treated at each dose level. If 0 of the 3 patients are observed to have DLT, the dose level is escalated one step for the next cohort. If 1 of the 3 patients shows DLT, 3 additional patients are treated at that dose level. If none of these show DLT, the dose level is escalated for the next cohort; otherwise, the prior dose level is defined as the MTD. At the highest dose level 6 patients will be treated. The recommended dose for a phase II trial will be the lowest dose that results in the most effective VEGF neutralization, together with acceptable safety and toxicity.</description>
