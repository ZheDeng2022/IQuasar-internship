      • Quality control of the study: 1.1 Study monitoring and source data verification: Monitoring&#xD;
      was done according to the monitoring plan by a representative of the investigator, who&#xD;
      checked the case report forms for completeness and clarity, and cross-checked them with&#xD;
      source documents. In addition to the monitoring visits, frequent communications (letter,&#xD;
      telephone, fax, e-mail), by the study monitor ensured that the investigation was conducted&#xD;
      according to protocol design and regulatory requirements. Study close-out was performed by&#xD;
      the study monitor upon closure of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 On-site audits: Domestic and foreign regulatory authorities, the IEC/IRB, and an auditor&#xD;
      authorized by the sponsor may request access to all source documents, case report forms, and&#xD;
      other study documentation for on-site audit or inspection. Direct access to these documents&#xD;
      was guaranteed by the investigator, who must provide support at all times for these&#xD;
      activities. Medical records and other study documents may be copied during audit or&#xD;
      inspection provided that subject names are obliterated on the copies to ensure&#xD;
      confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Documentation: A case report form was provided for each subject. All protocol-required&#xD;
      information collected during the study was entered by the investigator, or designated&#xD;
      representative, in the case report form. Details of case report form completion and&#xD;
      correction were explained to the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator, or designated representative, should complete the case report form pages as&#xD;
      soon as possible after information is collected, preferably on the same day that a study&#xD;
      patient is seen for an examination, treatment, or any other study procedure. Any outstanding&#xD;
      entries must be completed immediately after the final examination. An explanation should be&#xD;
      given for all missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A source data location list was prepared prior to study initiation. This list was filed in&#xD;
      both the trial master file and the investigator study file and updated as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The completed case report forms were reviewed and signed by the investigator named in the&#xD;
      clinical study protocol or by a designated sub investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor would retain the original of all completed case report forms. The principal&#xD;
      investigator kept the copies of all completed case report forms for 25 years after the trial&#xD;
      based on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Quality assurance of study products: All products used in this study were manufactured and&#xD;
      provided by Bright Dairy &amp; Food Co., Ltd. The quality test of study products was conducted by&#xD;
      Shanghai dairy products quality supervision and inspection station. The study products were&#xD;
      stored at the study site and assigned to the subjects by the investigator. The amount of&#xD;
      products received and assigned were filed on product distribution list by the investigator.&#xD;
      The study products were not allowed to be given to anyone who didn't participated in the&#xD;
      study. No sales of unassigned products was allowed. After the completion of the study, the&#xD;
      unassigned products need to be returned to Bright Dairy &amp; Food Co., Ltd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The products were labeled with study code. A master participation list was completed which&#xD;
      identifies each patient full name and unique identification number. The identity of the&#xD;
      specific product was blind to patients, support staff and investigators. The unmasking&#xD;
      occurred to the investigators and statistical analyses team only after completion of&#xD;
      statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Data management: Study data were recorded on Case Report Forms (CRFs) and then entered into&#xD;
      saved in the form of Excel files. Data was double entered and cross-validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Management of subject withdrawal: A number of 120 subjects were enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At their own request or at the request of their legally authorized representative,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If, in the investigator's opinion, continuation in the study would be detrimental to the&#xD;
           patient's well-being,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If they are lost to follow-up. In all cases, the reason for and date of withdrawal must&#xD;
           be recorded in the Exit Form and in the subject's medical records and the sponsor's&#xD;
           representative must be notified within 5 days. The subject must be followed up to&#xD;
           establish whether the reason was an adverse event, and, if so, this must be reported in&#xD;
           accordance with the procedure of an adverse event (described bellow). The investigator&#xD;
           must make every effort to contact subject lost to follow-up. Attempts to contact such&#xD;
           subject must be documented in the subject's records (e.g., dates and times of attempted&#xD;
           telephone contact).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator must be notified of all serious or unexpected adverse events within 48 hours.&#xD;
      Notification does not depend on whether there is a connection to the study formula or not.&#xD;
      All adverse events must be documented on the appropriate pages of the case report forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Statistical analysis plan: Analysis was performed for the intent-to-treat population.&#xD;
      Chi-square test was used comparison among study groups for categorical data. For continuous&#xD;
      outcomes, one-way ANOVA was used for between-group comparison, followed by multiple&#xD;
      comparison with Bonferroni adjustment. Paired t-test was used for pre-post comparison within&#xD;
      each study group. Non-parametric methods were used for non-normal data, data with unequal&#xD;
      variances. The analysis was completed using the statistical package SPSS17.0.&#xD;
