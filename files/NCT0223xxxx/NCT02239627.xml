  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a common condition, affecting majority of the adults in the United States at&#xD;
      some point in their lives. Fortunately, most resolve, even without treatment. However, some&#xD;
      suffer from continued or recurrent pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those suffering from continued or recurrent low back pain, numerous treatment options&#xD;
      exist. One such option is an epidural injection, particularly when other non-surgical&#xD;
      treatment options have failed. An epidural injection is the placement of a needle into the&#xD;
      space around the spinal cord with the aid of a live X-Ray machine, followed by an injection&#xD;
      of various medications. Typically, the medication that is injected is a steroid, commonly&#xD;
      with the combination of local anesthetic medication. Epidural steroid injections, with or&#xD;
      without local anesthetic is part of the established standard of care in the United States for&#xD;
      those with continued or recurrent low back pain. The steroid is believed to reduce&#xD;
      inflammation and edema of the injured or irritated nerves. However, despite the routine use&#xD;
      of epidural steroids, the steroid itself is not without risks or side effects. Though rare,&#xD;
      the steroids have been associated with complications including osteoporosis, steroid induced&#xD;
      myopathy, cataracts and many others. In order to minimize the side effects associated with&#xD;
      epidural steroids, limiting the dose and frequency have been outlined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clonidine is another medication, commonly used in numerous clinical settings. U. S. Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration approved the medication for epidural use for cancer pain but studies have&#xD;
      shown effectiveness in non-cancer pain was well and is routinely used for various conditions.&#xD;
      There is growing evidence on the use of epidural clonidine for treatment of pain, including&#xD;
      low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will study and compare the effectiveness, if any, of clonidine compared to&#xD;
      steroid in an epidural injection for low back pain.&#xD;
