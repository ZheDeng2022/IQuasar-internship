      Purpose To establish the safety and efficacy of the Coherex WaveCrest Left Atrial Appendage&#xD;
      Occlusion System for left atrial appendage (LAA) closure during treatment of non-valvular&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation in patients who are at increased risk for embolic stroke and have an&#xD;
      ongoing indication for oral anticoagulation.&#xD;

      Primary Safety Endpoint The primary safety endpoint is the incidence of major adverse events&#xD;
      up to 45 days post-procedure. Major adverse events are defined as life-threatening incidents&#xD;
      as determined by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC) and include events such as device&#xD;
      embolization; cardiac injury, re-intervention, and/or device-related surgery; bleeding events&#xD;
      such as pericardial effusion requiring drainage, cranial bleeding due to any source,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding; or any other event related to the device or the procedure, which&#xD;
      requires treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint is the incidence of LAA occlusion at&#xD;
      45 and/or 180 days (+ten days) post-procedure. LAA occlusion will be assessed by&#xD;
      transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) color flow Doppler and will be defined as absence of&#xD;
      flow in the LAA or color flow Doppler jets less than 3mm.&#xD;

        The target population for this study is the subset of patients who have non-valvular&#xD;
        paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent atrial fibrillation; LAA anatomy amenable to treatment&#xD;
        by percutaneous techniques; and an anticoagulation indication for potential thrombus&#xD;
        formation in the left atrium. Patients with an absolute or relative contraindication to&#xD;
        anticoagulants will also be included.&#xD;
