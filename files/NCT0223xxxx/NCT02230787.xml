      Enamel matrix proteins have been shown to play a crucial role during tooth development and&#xD;
      its supporting tissues. This is used in periodontal surgery where regeneration of lost&#xD;
      tissues around the teeth is intended. Emdogain, a product of Straumann Institute contains&#xD;
      these matrix proteins and has been successfully used in regenerative periodontal surgery for&#xD;
      more than 16 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of gum recession is a common requirement, more and more patients are seeking&#xD;
      treatment at the investigators' clinic due to aesthetic concern, root sensitivity and&#xD;
      difficulties in performing adequate oral hygiene. The standard treatment comprises the&#xD;
      transplantation of a piece of connective tissue from the palate to the denuded root surface.&#xD;
      In many cases Emdogain is additionally applied to enhance healing. So far the effect of&#xD;
      Emdogain on the early wound healing process after surgical root coverage has not been&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the investigators' study is to compare early wound healing parameters between&#xD;
      treatment with and without Emdogain. For this study 40 patients undergoing root coverage&#xD;
      surgery at the investigators' department will be included. Early wound healing features&#xD;
      between the two groups will be described and compared. Furthermore, inflammatory markers&#xD;
      typical for early healing will be evaluated together with patients'subjective postoperative&#xD;
      comfort. Finally, outcomes 6 months after the treatment will be assessed. The investigators'&#xD;
      hypothesis is that Emdogain treatment enhances wound healing and decreases post-operative&#xD;
      complication rates.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect of Emdogain on wound healing after gingival recession coverage using connective tissue&#xD;
      graft: a pilot study Emdogain Treatment Emdogain (Institute Straumann, Basel Switzerland) is&#xD;
      an enamel matrix protein derivative with the vehicle propylene glycol alginate. Emdogain has&#xD;
      been used for more than 16 years for regenerative periodontal treatment of intrabony, class&#xD;
      II furcation and recession defects. Animal and human histological studies have provided&#xD;
      evidence for periodontal regeneration (e.g. formation of root cementum, periodontal ligament&#xD;
      and alveolar bone) following the application of Emdogain in conjunction with periodontal&#xD;
      surgery. The use of Emdogain has been shown to significantly improve the clinical outcomes&#xD;
      evidenced by probing depth reduction, and clinical attachment gain and is considered today as&#xD;
      a routine procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Therapy of buccal gingival recession is a common indication for treatment in order&#xD;
      to improve plaque control thus preventing gingivitis and root caries but also to improve&#xD;
      aesthetics and root sensitivity. The ultimate goal of a root coverage procedure is the&#xD;
      complete coverage of the root surface and, in the same time, to obtain a similar appearance&#xD;
      of the regenerated soft tissues to the surrounding intact tissues. The use of palatal&#xD;
      connective tissue graft in conjunction with a coronally advanced flap (CAF) is a well&#xD;
      established clinical procedure for the treatment of gingival recessions. Its use has been&#xD;
      shown to result in predictable root coverage, higher increase in keratinized tissue and more&#xD;
      stable long-term outcomes compared to the use of CAF and is considered today state of the&#xD;
      art. Furthermore, recent data also appear to indicate that the combination of Emdogain and&#xD;
      CTG may additionally improve the clinical outcomes. Therefore, the standard surgical&#xD;
      procedure for the treatment of gingival recessions at the Department of Periodontology&#xD;
      includes the use of connective tissue graft either with or without the use of Emdogain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, despite the fact that Emdogain is commonly used, no information on its effects&#xD;
      upon early wound healing is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Emdogain on early wound healing, as&#xD;
      assessed by means of clinical parameters and inflammatory markers following recession&#xD;
      coverage surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and methodology Patient groups compared: in the treatment group, patients&#xD;
      undergoing a recession coverage surgery will be treated with Emdogain whereas in the control&#xD;
      group, patients will not receive Emdogain. A total of 40 patients, 20 in each group will be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative inflammatory markers will be assessed at the preoperative examination and two&#xD;
      days after surgery by dipping paper points into the crevicular fluid. Furthermore the&#xD;
      investigators will assess whether remnants of Emdogain are still traceable two days after&#xD;
      surgery. Wound healing after root coverage procedure is assessed using the &quot;early wound&#xD;
      healing index (EHI)&quot; defined by Wachtel et al. According to Wachtel et al., wound healing is&#xD;
      quantified and graded into 5 stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the post-operative healing process will be judged by a patient questionnaire.&#xD;
      Finally root coverage is measured as the distance from the CEJ (Cemento Enamel Junction) to&#xD;
      the Margo Gingivae in mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the benefit of intraoperative use of Emdogain on early wound healing&#xD;
           during the first two weeks after gingival recession coverage. Early wound healing&#xD;
           parameters will be assessed at both the site of explantation of the tissue graft as well&#xD;
           as at the site of implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the effect of Emdogain on inflammatory markers in crevicular fluid and&#xD;
           whether Emdogain is traceable after two days after application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate its influence on post-operative pain and interference with daily&#xD;
           activities during the first two weeks (patient's questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The post-operative result will also be assessed after 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present prospective study will include a total of 40 patients, 20 patients in each of the&#xD;
      2 groups (Emdogain group and control group). All procedures will be elective procedures.&#xD;
      After oral and written informed consent, the study will comprise the collection of crevicular&#xD;
      fluid sampling and clinical data as well as the filling of a patient questionnaire. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted as randomized prospective study. In the treatment group the procedure will&#xD;
      be performed with Emdogain, in the control group, root coverage will be performed without,&#xD;
      respectively. All procedures will be performed by one experienced operator. Patients will all&#xD;
      be treated with the standard surgical procedure of the University of Bern. In the patient&#xD;
      group with Emdogain, tissue graft and explantation site will be covered with Emdogain, in the&#xD;
      patient group without Emdogain, no Emdogain will be used. After inclusion of the patients,&#xD;
      the study duration will last 6 months for each patient.&#xD;
