  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many types of cancer are primarily treated with surgery and patient survival is directly&#xD;
      related to the extent to which the tumor is able to be removed. It is often difficult for&#xD;
      surgeons to distinguish tumor tissue from normal tissue or to detect tumor cells that have&#xD;
      spread from the original tumor site, resulting in incomplete removal of the tumor and reduced&#xD;
      patient survival. In some sites, such as the brain, it is critical to avoid damage to normal&#xD;
      tissue around the tumor to prevent adverse effects of surgery on function. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that BLZ-100 will improve surgical outcomes by allowing surgeons to visualize the edges of&#xD;
      the tumor and small groups of cancer cells that have spread to other sites in real-time as&#xD;
      operate. This is a safety study to assess the safety of BLZ-100 in patients with gliomas&#xD;
      undergoing surgery.&#xD;

      Subjects who provide voluntary written informed consent will be screened for eligibility.&#xD;
      Subjects meeting all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be required to arrive at the hospital (or phase 1 unit if applicable) for&#xD;
      dosing at least 2 hours before the planned surgical excision. Following dosing, subjects will&#xD;
      be monitored for safety and surgical excision will occur at least 2 hours after study product&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;

             I, II, III and IV glioma patients will be included (for example glioblastoma,&#xD;
             astrocytoma, and oligodendroglioma). Histological confirmation not required prior to&#xD;
             surgery. Subjects with recurrent disease will be eligible only if the duration between&#xD;
             last brain surgery and scheduled new surgery is ≥3 months. The grade of a recurrent&#xD;
             tumor will be presumed that of the primary tumor for purposes of group allocation.&#xD;
