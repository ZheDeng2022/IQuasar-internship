  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients using anticoagulants present an increased risk of bleeding when subjected to oral&#xD;
      surgery. Suspending or reducing the oral anticoagulant dose to perform invasive procedures,&#xD;
      may result in thromboembolic events, putting patients health in risk. Recent studies advocate&#xD;
      the dental surgery treatment without suspending the anticoagulant therapy, since the values&#xD;
      of the international normalized ratio (INR) are in acceptable therapeutic levels and local&#xD;
      measurements are taken for the hemostasis control. The aim of this study is to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness use of intra-alveolar epsilon amino caproic acid (EACA) associated to daily&#xD;
      rinses with the drug, with routine post-surgical procedures, to control the post-exodontic&#xD;
      bleeding in anticoagulated patients. Patients will be referred by the anticoagulation clinic&#xD;
      of the Clementino Fraga Filho University Hospital. Once the study criteria is met patients&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated into two groups and subsequently subjected to clinical and&#xD;
      periodontal examination, radiographic examination and pre-operative periodontal therapy.&#xD;
      Laboratory tests (partial thromboplastic time, prothrombin time, international normalized&#xD;
      ratio and platelet count) will be held on the day of the extraction. Patients in group 1 (&#xD;
      EACA ) will receive a paste composed of 01 macerated EACA tablet (500 mg), mixed with 0.9%&#xD;
      saline solution in the alveolar socket, and routine post-operative care. Additionally,&#xD;
      patients will perform oral rinses three times a day, on the first two post-operative days,&#xD;
      with a solution from the macerated EACA 500mg tablet diluted in 2 spoons of filtered water.&#xD;
      Patients allocated in group 2 (control) will receive routine post-operative care.&#xD;
      Classification of immediate bleeding will be held by the professional, on the day of the&#xD;
      surgery, immediately after the suture and twenty minutes later and the delayed bleeding,&#xD;
      recorded by the patient through a daily questionnaire. The Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences (SPSS)© (IBM, Chicago, USA) 20.0 is used as the database and the Chi-square,&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests will be applied to statistical analysis of the&#xD;
      results.The study was approved by the ethical and research committee of the Clementino Fraga&#xD;
      Filho University Hospital . All patients will sign a free consent and informed term.&#xD;

      All patients will be submitted to clinical and radiographic examination. Once selected,&#xD;
      patients will receive hygiene instruction and will be submitted to full mouth scaling one&#xD;
      week before the procedure with an ultrasonic device (CavitronR - Dentsply). The random&#xD;
      allocation of patients will obey the order obtained in the computerized program Allocation&#xD;
      1.0 Software© (Isfahan, Iran, 2004). All patients should have the prothrombin time (PT) and&#xD;
      INR, active thromboplastin partial time (aTPT) and platelet counts tests on the day of&#xD;
      surgery. Patients who present INR&lt; 2.0 e &gt; 4 will be assessed by the medical team about the&#xD;
      possibility of change in the dose of medication to the surgical procedure. Patients with&#xD;
      predisposing heart conditions the bacterial endocarditis will receive antibiotic prophylaxis&#xD;
      as recommendations from American Association of Cardiology (AHA) of 2007. All extraction&#xD;
      procedures will be performed by non-traumatic conventional surgical techniques, under local&#xD;
      anesthesia (2% lidocaine and epinephrine 1: 100,000). Just one extraction will be performed&#xD;
      in each surgical procedure, by the same surgeon. All patients will receive digital&#xD;
      compression of socket with sterile gauze for 5 minutes (Chompret 's manoeuver) and suture&#xD;
      with non-resorbable wire, silk 3.0 type . Everyone will receive the base analgesic&#xD;
      prescription Paracetamol 750 mg (Tylenol© - Johnson &amp; Johnson), 01 tablet every 6 hours, by&#xD;
      oral administration, for control of postoperative pain. Patients are divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (EACA) - patients will receive the intra-alveolar application of a 500 mg tablet of&#xD;
      the epsilon-amino caproic acid (EACA - Ipsilon® - Nikko Brazil, RJ) crushed in 0.9% saline.&#xD;
      Additionally, they will be instructed to rinse with 500mg EACA tablets macerated and diluted&#xD;
      in 2 tablespoons of water three times a day, in the two days after the extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (control) - patients will receive routine postoperative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classification of Bleeding will be performed by the professional on the day of surgery at two&#xD;
      times: one time (immediately after extraction) and time 2 (after 20 minutes). The bleeding&#xD;
      will be classified as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Light bleeding - blood in saliva&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate Bleeding - bleeding controlled with local measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe Bleeding - when surgical intervention is required&#xD;
&#xD;
      Late bleeding will be recorded by the patient through daily questionnaire. The bleeding will&#xD;
      be classified as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood stained saliva&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding that stopped after compression bandage and ice pack for 20 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding stopped only after professional intervention&#xD;
