  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how long it takes colorectal cancer resistant to standard&#xD;
      treatment to grow while receiving treatment with ziv-aflibercept, and how well adding&#xD;
      fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium to ziv-aflibercept works in treating patients with stage&#xD;
      IV colorectal cancer after they progress on ziv-aflibercept alone. Ziv-aflibercept may stop&#xD;
      the growth of colorectal cancer by blocking the formation of tumor blood vessels.&#xD;
      Fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium are drugs used in chemotherapy. Fluorouracil works to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumors cells by preventing the cells from growing and dividing. Leucovorin&#xD;
      calcium helps fluorouracil work better. Adding fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium to&#xD;
      ziv-aflibercept may be an effective treatment for patients who progress on ziv-aflibercept&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the progression-free survival during the first phase of the study (PFS1) in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with single agent ziv-aflibercept after&#xD;
      progressing on leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) and leucovorin calcium,&#xD;
      fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride (FOLFIRI) with bevacizumab +/- cetuximab or&#xD;
      panitumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS2) in patients with metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer treated with ziv-aflibercept and 5-fluorouracil (fluorouracil), after progressing on&#xD;
      ziv-aflibercept alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Overall survival. II. Response rate. III. Incidence and nature of adverse events. IV.&#xD;
      Growth modulation index (ratio of PFS2/PFS1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine relevant biomarkers which can distinguish patients with a progression free&#xD;
      survival greater than 3 months on single agent ziv-aflibercept (tumor vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor [VEGF], vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR]1 and 2, baseline&#xD;
      plasma phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class F [PlGF]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Plasma levels of VEGF-A, B, C, D, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM), chemokine&#xD;
      (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (melanoma growth stimulating activity, alpha) (Gro alpha), hepatocyte&#xD;
      growth factor (HGF), stem cell growth factor beta (SCGF beta) prior to treatment and with&#xD;
      each cycle of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of VEGFA, VEGFR1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3, interleukin (IL)8,&#xD;
      angiopoietin-2 (Ang2), IL-6, ICAM, PlGF, neuropilin (NRP)1 &amp; 2, chemokine (C-X-C motif)&#xD;
      receptor 2 (CXCR2) and others in the angiogenic pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Tumor messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels of VEGF B, C, D, VEGFR 3; NRP&#xD;
      1, 2, and VEGF isoforms on biopsy specimens taken at trial initiation and upon disease&#xD;
      progression and addition of 5-FU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Correlation of biomarkers with toxicity of ziv-aflibercept alone and with 5-FU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I: Patients receive ziv-aflibercept intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. At the&#xD;
      time of progression, patients proceed to Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II: Patients receive ziv-aflibercept IV over 1 hour, leucovorin calcium IV over 1&#xD;
      minute, and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;
