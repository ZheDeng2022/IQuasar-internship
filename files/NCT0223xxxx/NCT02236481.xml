      The TRACK [Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis and Comorbidities with Kineret&#xD;
      (anakinra)]-study: a randomized, open-label multicenter study assessing the efficacy of&#xD;
      anakinra in lowering HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) as well as changes in DAS28 in Rheumatoid&#xD;
      Arthritis (R.A.) patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) Authors: R. Giacomelli,(A,B) P. Cipriani&#xD;
      (A) and P. Ruscitti (A) on behalf of the TRACK study-group; (A) University of L'Aquila,&#xD;
      L'Aquila, Italy; Background: Interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays a pivotal role in R.A., joint erosion&#xD;
      and cartilage destruction.(1) Anakinra (a recombinant form of the naturally occurring IL-1&#xD;
      receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), which blocks the activity of both IL-1α and IL-1β) has shown in&#xD;
      a number of RCTs (2-6) to be effective in the treatment of R.A., in monotherapy,(2,4) as well&#xD;
      as associated to methotrexate (MTX).(3,5,6) IL-1β plays also an important role in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of T2D: Glucose has been shown to induce IL-1β hypersecretion through&#xD;
      inflammasome activation, while IL-1β induces impairment of β-cell secretory function and&#xD;
      β-cell apoptosis.(7) In prediabetic subjects, the expression of IL-1Ra is induced by IL-1β&#xD;
      and reflects the body's response to counterbalance increased IL-1β activity.(7) Levels of&#xD;
      IL-1Ra tend to rise up to 6 years before the diagnosis of T2D.(8,9) IL-1Ra has been&#xD;
      successfully used as a marker for the risk of developing T2D in subjects with metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome.(10) As a clinical proof of concept, IL-1 inhibition with anakinra in patients with&#xD;
      T2D has shown to improve the secretorial function of beta-cells as well as to lower the ratio&#xD;
      of proinsulin/insulin and glycated hemoglobin/hemoglobin significantly, favoring glycemic&#xD;
      control and possibly reducing the severity and prevalence of the associated complications of&#xD;
      this disease.(11) Summarizing, IL-1 inhibition with anakinra has a clinical impact on R.A. as&#xD;
      well as T2D. As from 6-10% of Italian R.A. patients have also T2D, this trial aims at&#xD;
      investigating the impact of IL-1 inhibition on both diseases. Very recent data also show that&#xD;
      T2D is a predictor of response to anakinra-treatment in R.A. patients,(12) which furthermore&#xD;
      justifies the use of anakinra in this subset of R.A. patients. Objectives: [Primary] To&#xD;
      evaluate the change in HbA1c between baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and at last follow&#xD;
      up of 2 years from the beginning; [Secondary] To evaluate the efficacy on controlling signs &amp;&#xD;
      symptoms of R.A., assessing the remission rate at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and at follow up&#xD;
      (2 years), using the evaluation scale of disease activity on 28 joints, DAS28 and SDAI&#xD;
      improvements from baseline conditions over time points, according to EULAR response criteria.&#xD;
      Methods: 200 patients in 28 Italian centers with active R.A. refractory to treatment with&#xD;
      methotrexate and T2D will be enrolled and randomized to receive either 100mg of anakinra once&#xD;
      daily by subcutaneous injection or any anti-TNF-alfa drug treatment. [84 subjects will be&#xD;
      required in each treatment arm to reach 90% power with an alpha error of 0.05 to detect a&#xD;
      mean difference between the study arms of 0.25 percentage points of HbA1c . The assumed&#xD;
      difference of HbA1c is rather conservative when compared to previously published changes in&#xD;
      T2D patients (11).] Anti-diabetic treatment is required to be unchanged for at least one&#xD;
      month prior to enrolment. Patients will be invited to maintain dietary habits and lifestyle&#xD;
      during the study period. Further details can be viewed on the trials website after&#xD;
      subscription.(13) References: (1) Arend &amp; Dayer, Adv. Imm. 1993; 54: 167-227. (2) Bresnihan,&#xD;
