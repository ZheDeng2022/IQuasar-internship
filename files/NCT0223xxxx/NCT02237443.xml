    <textblock>
      Anesthesia providers are taught to &quot;test&quot; that they can properly ventilate a patient's lungs&#xD;
      before administering a neuromuscular blocking drug (NMBD), rendering the patient apneic. This&#xD;
      is a traditional teaching, not based on empirical evidence. The investigators primary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that ventilation after the administration of NMBDs is non-inferior with that&#xD;
      before their administration with respect to the composite safety endpoint of inadequate (MVi)&#xD;
      and dead-space only (Vds) ventilation.&#xD;

      The following will be carried out per routine standard of care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be met in the pre-operative area by the attending anesthesiologist who&#xD;
      interviews and examines the patient. A full explanation of the general anesthetic including&#xD;
      risks and benefit will be given. Patients will be premedicated with 1-2 mg of midazolam at&#xD;
      the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. Once in the OR, standard American Society&#xD;
      of Anesthesiology (ASA) monitors are established. At a minimum, this includes non-invasive&#xD;
      monitoring of blood pressure by automated cuff, oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry, heart&#xD;
      rate and rhythm by 3-lead continuous electrocardiographic tracing, core body temperature,&#xD;
      expired carbon dioxide concentration, and depth of neuromuscular blockade when paralytic&#xD;
      medications are used. Additional monitoring may be applied as deemed appropriate by the&#xD;
      attending anesthesiologist on a case-by-case basis. At this time, the patient is given&#xD;
      fentanyl 1-2 mcg/kg. After a period of breathing 100% oxygen by facemask (typically for 3&#xD;
      minutes or until the anesthesia monitor shows the exhaled concentration of oxygen to be &gt;80%)&#xD;
      and when the primary anesthesia team judges denitrogenation to be sufficient, anesthesia will&#xD;
      be induced intravenously with propofol 2-3 mg/kg. Once the patient is unresponsive to a jaw&#xD;
      thrust, the patient is ventilated via a facemask. If the anesthesia provider feels that&#xD;
      ability to move air in and out of the patients lungs is difficult, the may reposition the&#xD;
      mask on the patient's face, reposition the head, neck, or shoulders of the patient, or place&#xD;
      a plastic oropharyngeal airway to maintain the mouth in an open position and to help keep the&#xD;
      base of the tongue from obstructing the upper airway. A drug that causes muscle paralysis is&#xD;
      given, which takes 1-5 minutes to work depending on the drug administered; during this period&#xD;
      the patient continues to be ventilated by facemask. However, there is not standard for the&#xD;
      timing of administration of the paralytic drugs as some anesthesia providers administer them&#xD;
      near simultaneous to the administration of the other drugs used to induce anesthesia. Often,&#xD;
      during this time, an inhaled anesthetic agent is started to avoid any gaps in the effect of&#xD;
      the intravenous medications. Once the muscle relaxant works, a breathing tube is placed in&#xD;
      the patient's windpipe, and ventilation occurs via the tube connected to a breathing machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study deviates from the standard anesthesia care described above in the following ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the patient arrives in the operating room, a small plastic device called a&#xD;
      pneumotachograph will be placed in-line between the facemask and the breathing circuit of the&#xD;
      anesthesia machine. This allows measurements of airway pressure and volumes to be recorded in&#xD;
      an accurate manner and later sent electronically to a computer for analysis. The in-line&#xD;
      portion of the device is no larger than a typical circuit connector already used and does not&#xD;
      hinder the performance of the anesthesia provider in any way. After routine intravenous&#xD;
      induction, once the patient is unresponsive to a jaw thrust patients will be ventilated by&#xD;
      facemask for 60 seconds. Breaths will be delivered using the breathing bag of the anesthesia&#xD;
      circuit as would otherwise be performed. The airway managers will be asked to follow a&#xD;
      treatment algorithm to resolve any difficulty encountered in providing mask ventilation. This&#xD;
      algorithm represents common practice. After the initial 60 seconds, the medication to induce&#xD;
      muscle paralysis will be given. A nerve stimulator placed on the patients wrist will then be&#xD;
      turned on and will indicate when the medication has taken full effect and the patient is&#xD;
      paralyzed. During this period of time, approximately 60-90 seconds, with the patients&#xD;
      unconscious and apneic, their breathing will be supported as would otherwise be done.&#xD;
      Post-paralysis, data collection will again begin and the anesthesia provider will start again&#xD;
      breathing for the patient via a facemask as described in figure 2 for another 60 seconds. The&#xD;
      operator will be blinded to the display on the ventilator machine, which provides information&#xD;
      about the amount of air going in and out of the patients lungs, but will be able to monitor&#xD;
      the patient's pertinent vital signs on the anesthesia machine. At all times, one member of&#xD;
      the primary anesthesia team will have full access to all monitoring as would normally take&#xD;
      place. After this time, the tracheal tube will be placed for the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate sizing of the adult facemask and oropharyngeal airway will be determined by the&#xD;
      primary anesthesia team. All breaths will be delivered by hand ventilation using the&#xD;
      breathing bag of the anesthesia machine. The returned tidal volume will be recorded for each&#xD;
      minute of the study period from the pneumotachograph placed inline with the anesthesia&#xD;
      circuit at the level of the mask/elbow connector interface as described above. The total time&#xD;
      from induction to placement of a breathing tube will be 4-5 minutes and represents an&#xD;
      additional minute of &quot;study&quot; time to the standard care. This timing was chosen as the&#xD;
      investigators feel that it will provide sufficient information about ventilation volumes&#xD;
      without unduly prolonging the anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study coordinator will remain in the room for the actual intubation to record its ease or&#xD;
      difficulty per the report of the primary anesthesia provider. The act of placing the&#xD;
      breathing tube is not part of the study protocol, however.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data points to be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding tidal volume, minute ventilation, airway pressures, and end-tidal carbon&#xD;
      dioxide will be recorded directly by the in-line pneumotachograph and then loaded into an&#xD;
      excel spreadsheet. No manual data collection will be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and Safety Monitoring Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study may be terminated by the primary anesthesia team if the one or more of the&#xD;
      following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inadequate ventilation by clinical criteria (inadequate chest rise, no fogging in the&#xD;
           mask, no positive tracing of end-tidal carbon dioxide and/or lack of measurable returned&#xD;
           tidal volumes on).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Low oxygen saturation (&lt; 90%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If for any reason, the primary anesthesia team feel that in their clinical judgment,&#xD;
           immediate tracheal intubation is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All unanticipated problems and adverse event will be recorded in the study sheet by a study&#xD;
      coordinator. At the earliest time, each unanticipated problem and adverse event will be&#xD;
      examined by at least 2 study investigators. In the event of an unanticipated problem of&#xD;
      adverse effect (eg inadequate mask ventilation), back-up will be provided by the primary&#xD;
      anesthesia team caring for the patient and may include placing a laryngeal mask airway or a&#xD;
      surgical airway. These are the same provisions that would be made for any non-study case as&#xD;
      mask ventilation by using one or two hands represents standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are aiming to show that administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent is&#xD;
      &quot;safe&quot; with respect to mask ventilation. In other words, that the average exhaled tidal&#xD;
      volume per breath over one minute after the administration of a NMBD will be non-inferior to&#xD;
      that measured before their administration. At the time of the planning of this study, no&#xD;
      studies had reported a mean±SD for tidal volumes before and after NMBDs. However, based upon&#xD;
      a prior comparative trial of two different mask-hold techniques, the standard deviation (SD)&#xD;
      of the average exhaled tidal volume after induction of anesthesia, using the anesthesia&#xD;
      ventilator and a two-hand jaw-thrust mask hold technique was 130 mL. With the equivalence&#xD;
      limit, d, set as 50 mL per breath, with a significance level (α) of 2.5% and a power (1-β) of&#xD;
      95%, a total sample size of 208 patients per group (before and after NMBD for a total sample&#xD;
      of 416 study periods) were required. In other words, if there is truly no difference between&#xD;
      the mask ventilation before and after NMBD, then 208 patients, each as their own control, are&#xD;
      required to be 95% sure that the limits of a 2-sided 95% confidence interval will exclude a&#xD;
      difference in means of &gt;50 mL.&#xD;
