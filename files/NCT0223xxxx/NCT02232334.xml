      Global osteopathic manual treatments will decrease the severity score of the Gastroparesis&#xD;
      Cardinal Symptom Index tool of patients with idiopathic gastroparesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this longitudinal controlled pre-test post-test group design, subjects with idiopathic&#xD;
      gastroparesis (IG) will be utilized to see if global osteopathic manual treatments can&#xD;
      decrease their symptoms. Patients with IG suffer from varying degrees of nausea, vomiting and&#xD;
      abdominal pain secondary to delayed gastric emptying. There is no known cause for people&#xD;
      suffering from IG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the power analysis, the population will be utilized as the experiment group and&#xD;
      the control group. The measuring tool to be used is the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index&#xD;
      (GCSI) which is the most widely used symptom score questionnaire for gastroparesis. The&#xD;
      subjects in the population will each fill out the GCSI initially and again after an two (2)&#xD;
      week period to measure their symptoms during a control period. The same subjects will then be&#xD;
      treated with global osteopathic manual treatments one (1) treatment every two (2) weeks for&#xD;
      four (4) weeks (day 1, 14, and 28). The GCSI will be filled out on the day of the first (1st)&#xD;
      treatment (which is the last day of the control period) and then two (2) weeks after the last&#xD;
      treatment (day 42). In order to reject the null hypothesis, with a p value of &lt; 0.05 and a&#xD;
      power of 0.8, a minimum of ten (10) subjects in the treatment group is required with a&#xD;
      treatment effect of 1 or more. A 'Treatment effect of 1' is defined by Cohen's d, where d =&#xD;
      mean difference/standard deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the results will show improvement of symptoms through the data collected&#xD;
      from the GCSI questionnaires in the treatment group. The results of this study could be&#xD;
      significant and contribute to the osteopathic community validating the effectiveness of&#xD;
      traditional osteopathic manual therapy as well as giving non-invasive options to people&#xD;
      suffering from the disease since those who struggle with it have minimal treatment&#xD;
      options--medicines with significant side effects, full or total stomach removal or gastric&#xD;
      electrical stimulator implants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroparesis is a disorder that presents with delayed gastric emptying, abdominal pain,&#xD;
      nausea, and vomiting. This condition can be found in people with complications from&#xD;
      diabetes-neuropathy of the vagus nerve and gastric surgery-damage to the vagus nerve. With&#xD;
      idiopathic gastroparesis (IG), the cause is poorly understood with theories suggesting viral&#xD;
      infections affecting gut motility, pyloric valve spasm as well as damage to the specialized&#xD;
      cells within the wall of the stomach. Unfortunately the treatment options are minimal for&#xD;
      people suffering from gastroparesis regardless of what type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the action of food propulsion that is poorly understood in regards to IG - specifically&#xD;
      smooth muscle, autonomic and enteric nerves and specialized cells in the gut named&#xD;
      Interstitial Cells of Cajal (ICC). ICC are the pacemakers cells in the gut that conduct&#xD;
      motility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to normalize structural abnormalities in patients with&#xD;
      idiopathic gastroparesis with global osteopathic manual treatments, using a quantitative&#xD;
      research method with a longitudinal controlled pre-test post-test design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator (PI), having a background as an emergency medicine registered&#xD;
      nurse, has seen patients in the emergency department suffering from idiopathic gastroparesis.&#xD;
      The acute attacks appear intense and debilitating often requiring anti-nausea, pain and&#xD;
      anti-anxiety medications. As an osteopathic student, the PI would often wonder what could be&#xD;
      achieved with osteopathic manual treatments (OMT) to help these people in the emergency&#xD;
      department suffering from these symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment available for people suffering from gastroparesis is limited. In his&#xD;
      article, Gastroparesis - Current Concepts and Considerations (2008), Dr. Hasler, summarized&#xD;
      research and the different treatment options for gastroparesis. There are several medications&#xD;
      available for gastroparesis however as discussed by Dr. Hasler, the side effects from these&#xD;
      medications are significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are invasive treatments, such as injection of botulinum toxin into the pyloric&#xD;
      sphincter, gastric electrical stimulator and gastric resection which have shown some&#xD;
      improvement in symptoms but carry heavy risks if utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research method used to determine if global osteopathic manual treatments can help&#xD;
      patients who suffer from idiopathic gastroparesis is a longitudinal pre-test post-test&#xD;
      controlled quantitative study. The tool used to measure data is the Gastroparesis Cardinal&#xD;
      Index Score (GCSI), which was created by Janssen Global Services, LLC. The GCSI is a reliable&#xD;
      and validated tool rating symptom intensity of fullness-early satiety, nausea-vomiting, and&#xD;
      bloating. The validation of this tool was tested with 169 subjects who filled out the GCSI&#xD;
      and those results were compared with clinician symptom ratings. Total scores of the GCSI were&#xD;
      &quot;responsive to changes in overall gastroparesis symptoms as assessed by clinicians (P =&#xD;
      0.0002) and patients (P = 0.002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of ten (10) subjects are required for the population according to the power&#xD;
      analysis, and at lease twelve (12) subjects will be enrolled to account for the potential 20%&#xD;
      drop out rate. However, (20) twenty subjects will be the goal for recruitment for this study.&#xD;
      Approval from an Institutional Review Board (IRB) has been acquired through Aspire-IRB,&#xD;
      gastroenterologists and family medicine physicians in the Sonoma County and Santa Rosa&#xD;
      California area will be given recruitment letters and consent forms with study information to&#xD;
      give to patients who qualify for the study. Flyers will be distributed throughout the&#xD;
      community (grocery stores, community centers, pharmacies etc.). Social media might be&#xD;
      utilized to acquire subjects as there appears to be a strong presence of support groups&#xD;
      online of people with gastroparesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire population, during the control group period, will fill out the GCSI initially and&#xD;
      then again at two (2) weeks. Those subjects will transition to the experimental group period&#xD;
      of the study-the GCSI filled out on the last day of the control period will be used as the&#xD;
      first day of treatment GCSI results. IN the experiment period: the subjects will receive&#xD;
      three (3) separate global osteopathic manual treatments over four (4) weeks (day 1, 14, and&#xD;
      28). Two weeks after the third (3rd) treatment (day 42), the subjects will fill out the GCSI&#xD;
      a final time. The subjects are waiting two (2) weeks to allow for full integration of the&#xD;
      last treatment and the GCSI is designed to record the prior two (2) weeks of patients&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects in the population will be screened via email and or telephone assuring they meet&#xD;
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once consented, each participant will be instructed to fill&#xD;
      out the first (1st) GCSI questionnaires and email the completed form back to the PI. The data&#xD;
      of the first GCSI completion establishes day one (1) of the two (2) week control period.&#xD;
      During the two (2) week control period, subjects are to continue their regular treatments for&#xD;
      IG (dietary, medicine). They are not to obtain any new therapies such as massage,&#xD;
      acupuncture, osteopathy or start any new conventional medical treatments. If there is an&#xD;
      acute attack requiring an emergency room visit, the subject will have to be excluded from the&#xD;
      study. At the end of the two (2) week period, those subjects will fill out the GCSI again and&#xD;
      those results will be anonymously stored for future data analysis. The subjects then will be&#xD;
      transitioned into the experimental period and assigned to have their first treatment. The&#xD;
      last day of the control period will start the experimental period. All treatments will occur&#xD;
      at the office/clinic of the PI in Santa Rosa California, USA. The PI will be working under&#xD;
      her massage practitioner license with malpractice insurance under Associated Bodywork and&#xD;
      Massage Professionals (ABMP) as well as Manual Therapy Insurance Plus through the Barral&#xD;
      Institute. Both of these institutions cover general and professional liability for massage&#xD;
      therapy as well as various forms of manual therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first treatment, day one (1) of the experimental period, the GCSI (Appendix A) and&#xD;
      health history questionnaire (Appendix I) will have been completed. An anamnesis will be&#xD;
      taken and the subject will then be assessed and treated with a global osteopathic manual&#xD;
      treatment to treat the lesions found in the assessment. The data from the GCSI will be&#xD;
      collected and stored anonymously for data analysis. The lesions found in assessment and&#xD;
      techniques used to treat will be stored for use in discussion if appropriate. The process&#xD;
      will be repeated at two (2) weeks and four (4) weeks from the first (1st) visit for each&#xD;
      participant except without the GCSI and without the health questionnaire as it is only&#xD;
      required on the first visit. Each treatment will last ninety (90) minutes. To keep results as&#xD;
      consistent as possible, subjects will be seen at the same time of the day for each treatment.&#xD;
      The results from two (2) weeks and four (4) weeks will be stored for possible discussion. To&#xD;
      allow time for integration of the treatments each participant will fill out the GCSI two (2)&#xD;
      weeks after the fourth (4th) week of the experimental period. The data from all GCSI tools&#xD;
      filled out from the control and experimental periods will be sent to the PI via email for&#xD;
      data analysis.&#xD;
