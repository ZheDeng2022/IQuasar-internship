    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are to study MMFS-202-302 in a double blind, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled 9-week study of its effect on ameliorating cognitive deficits in 60&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with stable levels of positive&#xD;
      symptoms. Secondary end points will include changes in positive and negative symptoms. One&#xD;
      dose of MMFS-202-302 will be studied and compared with placebo as adjunctive treatment to&#xD;
      atypical antipsychotic drug treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the symptoms of schizophrenia is a problem with specific domains of cognition, even&#xD;
      when the positive symptoms have been treated. The primary goal of this study is to determine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of 9 weeks of supplementation with MMFS-202-302 as augmentation of atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication, to improve a critical specific domain of cognitive function, i.e.,&#xD;
      working memory, in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. To support this&#xD;
      primary goal, global function will be assessed with the Clinical Global Impression assessment&#xD;
      of change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also examine the effect of MMFS-202-302 on other domains of cognition&#xD;
      (e.g. attention, executive function, declarative memory, etc.); negative symptoms of&#xD;
      schizophrenia; positive symptoms of schizophrenia; MRI measures of brain structure, resting&#xD;
      state functional connectivity, and function during evaluation of emotional/unemotional and&#xD;
      rewarding/aversive images and anticipation and receipt of reward and punishment, and working&#xD;
      memory; and EEG measurement of network interactivity during learning and memory recollection.&#xD;
