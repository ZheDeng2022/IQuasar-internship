  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to develop new ways to acquire MRI data and/or new&#xD;
      ways to analyze the acquired data.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The acquired data will be used to investigate the structure and function of the body. In&#xD;
      addition the developmental aspect of this study, certain information may be used to obtain&#xD;
      normal values for healthy adult structural and functional information. This information would&#xD;
      be valuable if and when the developed methods are incorporated into future clinical studies&#xD;
      involving patient populations which would be recruited under separate protocols. Our&#xD;
      hypotheses is that imaging and spectroscopy methods can be developed to a level where the&#xD;
      increased sensitivity and resolution of 7 Tesla (7T) MRI will improve the non-invasive&#xD;
      studies of the human body.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy male or female volunteer over the age of 18&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria include those associated with the use of MR as the imaging&#xD;
             modality. The specific set of exclusion criteria for a given study will depend on the&#xD;
             specific study to be performed which will be made clear on initial contact and during&#xD;
             consent. In addition, other medical conditions deemed by the PI or associates to make&#xD;
             the patient ineligible for protocol procedures may also arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria will be assessed during a safety screening interview and during&#xD;
             final consent. A questionnaire will be provided regarding general health and&#xD;
             exclusion/inclusion criteria. The investigator doing the interview will determine if&#xD;
             any of the exclusion criteria apply. Subjects will be asked:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. To describe any previous surgeries to help subjects and study staff open a&#xD;
                  dialogue as to any possible contraindications listed in the yes/no section below.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. If they are claustrophobic and to rate the severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. If they wear hearing aids and if they can be removed for the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. If they have a transdermal delivery system, and if yes where is it located and if&#xD;
                  it can be removed for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. If they wear colored contact lenses and, if yes, can they be removed for the&#xD;
                  study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. To provide a list of medications, dosages and time of last dose for medicines&#xD;
                  taken regularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. To identify if they have any pre-existing medical conditions including&#xD;
                  Hypertension, Hypotension, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease and Fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. To identify if they ever had an operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. To indicate if they have ever been injured by a metallic foreign body which was&#xD;
                  never removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. If they wear braces and/or if they have removable bridgework, false teeth or a&#xD;
                  permanent retainer.&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. If they have any tattoos, non-removable body piercings or hair extensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. If they are currently using/wearing an IUD or diaphragm.&#xD;
&#xD;
              13. If they have any reason to believe they are pregnant. (If the subjects are unsure&#xD;
                  about their pregnancy status, test kits will be available to subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In addition, a set of yes/no questions will be asked in the screening form for the&#xD;
             patient to confirm or deny the presence of items that may be hazardous to their safety&#xD;
             and/or some interfere with the MRI examination, including:&#xD;
