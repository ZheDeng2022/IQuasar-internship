  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that ligaments, both cardinal and uterosacral contain a considerable&#xD;
      amount of autonomic nerve tissues. The resection of deep infiltrating endometriotic nodules&#xD;
      at the level of the uterosacral ligaments or the rectovaginal space is supposed to damage the&#xD;
      supplying autonomic nerve fibers of the lower urinary tract. The bladder receives motor and&#xD;
      sensitive innervations from both the sympathetic fibers, most of which arise from the&#xD;
      hypogastric plexuses and nerves, and the parasympathetic fibers, which arise from the pelvic&#xD;
      splanchnic nerves and the inferior hypogastric plexus; therefore, even bladder function may&#xD;
      be impaired in women affected by deep endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very few data have been published regarding the urodynamic functional evaluation of bladder&#xD;
      in patient with deep endometriosis.So far, it is unknown if the surgery itself causes the&#xD;
      postoperative bladder dysfunction or if the surgery unmasks a subclinically pre-existing&#xD;
      detrusor pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the urinary postoperative complications have a strong impact on quality of life of the&#xD;
      deep endometriosis patients and often requires management (due to a poor spontaneous&#xD;
      remission), it is crucial a better understanding of the problem. That will help for a more&#xD;
      appropriate pre-operative counselling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of this study are to evaluate the bladder function before and after deep endometriosis&#xD;
      surgery, using standardized validated instruments and to correlate the localisation of the&#xD;
      endometriosis lesion, the type/area of surgical dissection with the postoperative bladder&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective multicenter cohort study involving the Department of General&#xD;
      Gynaecology and Gynecological Oncology of Medical University of Vienna (Austria) and the&#xD;
      Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of Insubria University, Varese (Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 50 patients are planned to be included. The study protocol consider a Preoperative&#xD;
      Assessment (clinical examination, transvaginal pelvic ultrasound, preoperative specific&#xD;
      questionnaire including obstetric, medical, and surgical history and standardized questions&#xD;
      on pelvic floor dysfunctions, standardized instrumental assessment of the pelvic floor) a&#xD;
      Intraoperative Assessment (during laparoscopy, the localizations of endometriotic lesions&#xD;
      recorded and identified by anatomical sites, numbers, and depth of infiltration). Before and&#xD;
      3 months after surgery a Urodynamic assessment is planned.&#xD;
