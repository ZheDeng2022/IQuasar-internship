    <textblock>
      -  The primary objective of the trial is to assess the single-dose relative bioavailability&#xD;
           of Chemi Enoxaparin (80 mg/0.8 mL) and Clexane® (80 mg/0.8 mL) administered by&#xD;
           subcutaneous (s.c.) injection, under fasting conditions in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary objective of the trial is to assess safety and tolerability of Chemi&#xD;
           Enoxaparin (80 mg/0.8 mL) and Clexane® (80 mg/0.8 mL) administered by s.c. injection,&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomised, single-dose, 2-way crossover study to determine the&#xD;
      comparative bioavailability of enoxaparin sodium from the Chemi Enoxaparin s.c. (80 mg/0.8mL)&#xD;
      with that from the reference IMP, Clexane® s.c. (80 mg/0.8mL), following single dose&#xD;
      administration in healthy male and female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject received each treatment over two separate treatment periods under fasting&#xD;
      conditions. Each dosing day for male subjects will be separated by a washout period of at&#xD;
      least 7 days. The study comprised a pre-study screen (within 14 days of the first dose),&#xD;
      followed by 2 Treatment Periods (1 and 2). During each treatment period, subjects will reside&#xD;
      at Simbec from the evening before dosing (Day 1), until at least 36 h post dose (evening of&#xD;
      Day 2). On admission (Day -1), subjects will provide a urine sample for a drugs of abuse&#xD;
      screen; this sample will also be tested to confirm a negative pregnancy result in female&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single dose of the randomised treatment will be given on the morning of Day 1 following an&#xD;
      overnight fast and blood PK/PD samples collected from pre-dose up to 36 h post dose (14&#xD;
      samples). Safety will also be evaluated at specified times throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post study visit will be conducted on Day 2 (36 h post-dose) of Treatment Period 2.&#xD;

    <description>Cmax is the maximum measured plasma activity/concentration. Blood samples (2 x 10 mL) for determination of plasma anti-FIIa and anti-FXa were collected from a forearm vein into a Citrate Sarstedt Monovette at the following time-points (At day 1(0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16h) and Day 2 (24 and 36h)) and kept frozen until analysis.&#xD;
Enoxaparin exerts its anti-coagulant effect primarily via interaction with anti-thrombin III (ATIII), thereby enhancing the inhibitory effect of ATIII on activated factor Xa (FXa) and thrombin/factor IIa (FIIa). As enoxaparin cannot be measured directly in blood, the PK of enoxaparin have been studied on the basis of its effect on clotting mechanisms, particularly the inhibition of FXa (anti-FXa) and FIIa (anti- FIIa) activity.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Forty-seven (47) subjects (23 male and 24 female) were enrolled in the study. The subjects were selected from a large panel who offered their services as healthy volunteers for the purpose of undertaking REC and Regulatory Authority-approved studies on drug safety, absorption and disposition.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study comprised a screening visit and 2 treatment periods. Only two doses were scheduled to be administered: first dose (period 1) - wash out (at least 7 days) - 2nd dose (period 2) - wash out period (at least 7 days). Each treatment period was of 2 days duration. Screening assessments: from Day -14 to Day -1.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Cmax is the maximum measured plasma activity/concentration. Blood samples (2 x 10 mL) for determination of plasma anti-FIIa and anti-FXa were collected from a forearm vein into a Citrate Sarstedt Monovette at the following time-points (At day 1(0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16h) and Day 2 (24 and 36h)) and kept frozen until analysis.&#xD;
Enoxaparin exerts its anti-coagulant effect primarily via interaction with anti-thrombin III (ATIII), thereby enhancing the inhibitory effect of ATIII on activated factor Xa (FXa) and thrombin/factor IIa (FIIa). As enoxaparin cannot be measured directly in blood, the PK of enoxaparin have been studied on the basis of its effect on clotting mechanisms, particularly the inhibition of FXa (anti-FXa) and FIIa (anti- FIIa) activity. Results are presented as derived plasma PK parameters.</description>

        <description>Tmax is the time to Cmax. Blood samples (2 x 10 mL) for determination of plasma anti-FIIa and anti-FXa were collected from a forearm vein into a Citrate Sarstedt Monovette at the following time-points (at day 1(0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16h) and Day 2 (24 and 36h)) and kept frozen until analysis.&#xD;
Enoxaparin exerts its anti-coagulant effect primarily via interaction with anti-thrombin III (ATIII), thereby enhancing the inhibitory effect of ATIII on activated factor Xa (FXa) and thrombin/factor IIa (FIIa). As enoxaparin cannot be measured directly in blood, the PK of enoxaparin have been studied on the basis of its effect on clotting mechanisms, particularly the inhibition of FXa (anti-FXa) and FIIa (anti-FIIa) activity. Results are presented as derived plasma PK parameters.</description>

Enoxaparin exerts its anti-coagulant effect primarily via interaction with anti-thrombin III (ATIII), thereby enhancing the inhibitory effect of ATIII on activated factor Xa (FXa) and thrombin/factor IIa (FIIa). As enoxaparin cannot be measured directly in blood, the PK of enoxaparin have been studied on the basis of its effect on clotting mechanisms, particularly the inhibition of FXa (anti-FXa) and FIIa (anti- FIIa) activity. Results are presented as derived plasma PK parameters.</description>

          <title>Cmin (Anti-FXa and Anti-FIIa)</title>
          <description>Cmin is the minimum plasma activity/concentration. Enoxaparin exerts its anti-coagulant effect primarily via interaction with anti-thrombin III (ATIII), thereby enhancing the inhibitory effect of ATIII on activated factor Xa (FXa) and thrombin/factor IIa (FIIa). As enoxaparin cannot be measured directly in blood, the PK of enoxaparin have been studied on the basis of its effect on clotting mechanisms, particularly the inhibition of FXa (anti-FXa) and FIIa (anti- FIIa) activity. Results are presented as derived plasma PK parameters.</description>
          <population>PK population: All subjects who received study medication in both treatment periods, had sufficient plasma activity/concentration-time profiles and who did not violate the protocol in such a way that may have invalidated or biased the results (major protocol violators) were included in the PK analysis.</population>
