    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, Phase II study of BBI503 administered to adult patients&#xD;
      with selected advanced urologic malignancies. The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the disease control rate of patients with renal cell cancer and urothelial carcinoma&#xD;
      treated with BBI503.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients with clear cell renal cancer must have received prior treatment with at&#xD;
                  least one line of standard systemic therapy which included treatment with a&#xD;
                  tyrosine kinase inhibitor; either alone or in combination. The patient must have&#xD;
                  had either progressive disease during treatment, or have had documented&#xD;
                  intolerance to first line tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with clear cell renal cancer who have received anti-cancer treatment&#xD;

                  currently available agents approved for treatment of patients with clear cell&#xD;
                  renal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with non-clear cell RCC which is metastatic may enroll without having&#xD;
                  received prior treatment in the metastatic setting&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A patient with urothelial carcinoma must also meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must have received at least one prior line of standard systemic cytotoxic therapy&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anti-cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or investigational agents&#xD;
             within 7 days of first dose of BBI503. Patients may begin BBI503 on a date determined&#xD;
             by the investigator and medical monitor for the sponsor provided there is a minimum of&#xD;
             7 days since last receiving anti-cancer treatment, and that all prior&#xD;

             within 2 weeks prior to starting on study. Patients with treated brain metastases must&#xD;
             be stable for 4 weeks after completion of that treatment. Post-treatment image&#xD;
             documentation of stability is required within 4 months of starting on study. Patients&#xD;
             must have no clinical symptoms from brain metastases and must be either off steroids&#xD;
             or on a stable dose of steroids for at least 2 weeks prior to protocol enrollment.&#xD;
             Patients with known leptomeningeal metastases are excluded, even if treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Unable or unwilling to swallow BBI503 capsules daily&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, clinically significant non-healing or healing wounds, symptomatic&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, significant&#xD;
             pulmonary disease (shortness of breath at rest or mild exertion), uncontrolled&#xD;
             infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements (e.g. no reliable transportation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of malignancies other than the tumor of interest except:&#xD;
             adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ cancer of the&#xD;
             cervix, or other solid tumors curatively treated with no evidence of disease for &gt; 3&#xD;
             years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal ECGs which are clinically significant such as QT prolongation - QTc &gt; 480&#xD;
             msec, clinically significant cardiac enlargement or hypertrophy, new bundle branch&#xD;
             block, or signs of active ischemia. Patients with evidence of prior infarction who are&#xD;
             New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II, III, or IV are excluded, as are&#xD;
             patients with marked arrhythmia such as Wolff Parkinson White pattern or complete&#xD;
             atrioventricular (AV) dissociation.&#xD;
