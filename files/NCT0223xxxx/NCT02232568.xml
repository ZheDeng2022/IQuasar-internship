      Trial of Feedback on Blood Use (TOFU)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TOFU study will represent the first attempt to rigorously assess the impact of&#xD;
      audit-feedback on changing transfusion practice. The primary hypothesis is that providing&#xD;
      individual feedback on transfusion practice to orthopedic surgeons will reduce elective RBC&#xD;
      transfusions in the postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TOFU is a two-arm, cluster-randomized controlled trial. Initially, baseline blood use data&#xD;
      will be collected at all study sites. Next, the PI at each site will give a short educational&#xD;
      presentation to the orthopedic surgeons. The presentation will consist of a standardized&#xD;
      10-minute presentation reviewing the data from the FOCUS trial and the recommended red blood&#xD;
      cell (RBC) transfusion trigger of 8 g/dL (or symptomatic anemia) based on that data. Clusters&#xD;
      of orthopedic surgeons will then be randomized to either the Control arm (no feedback) or the&#xD;
      Intervention arm (monthly feedback). All of the surgeons at a given site will either receive&#xD;
      or not receive feedback. The feedback will take the form of emailed monthly reports detailing&#xD;
      blood use by each surgeon post-hip surgery. Surgeons will be anonymized in the reports as &quot;A,&#xD;
      B, C . . .&quot; but each surgeon will know which data are his own. The primary end point is the&#xD;
      decrease from baseline in the proportion of patients transfused with a pretransfusion&#xD;
      hemoglobin of &gt; 8 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TOFU will be conducted at 8 sites in Europe and North and South America. Care has been taken&#xD;
      to minimize the labor and costs required to conduct this study. The only data collected will&#xD;
      be: patient age/gender; procedure; surgeon (anonymized); surgery &amp; discharge dates; RBC units&#xD;
      transfused; Hgb levels. The data will be entered at each site into a web-based Case Report&#xD;
      Form, and will be stored centrally by the Data Coordinating Center (DCC). The DCC will&#xD;
      generate monthly feedback reports and email them to each Intervention arm site PI. The site&#xD;
      PI will then email the reports to each local orthopedic surgeon.&#xD;

      Trial of Feedback on Blood Use (TOFU)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background &amp; Rationale Many studies have demonstrated substantial variability in blood use&#xD;
      among both physicians and hospitals, suggesting the need to standardize transfusion practices&#xD;
      and reduce unnecessary transfusions.To that end, national regulatory agencies in many&#xD;
      countries require that hospitals monitor local blood use. However, the utility of this&#xD;
      monitoring is unclear. A small number of prospective studies aimed at improving physician&#xD;
      transfusion behavior have been published, but well-supported, generalizable findings are&#xD;
      currently lacking. The proposed study will test the hypothesis that providing feedback of&#xD;
      individual blood use data to transfusing physicians will reduce unnecessary RBC transfusions.&#xD;
      A limited number of studies conducted in a range of settings have examined whether audit and&#xD;
      feedback can improve physician practice and clinical outcomes. Results have been mixed. The&#xD;
      proposed study would represent the first attempt to rigorously assess the impact of&#xD;
      audit/feedback on changing transfusion practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recently completed FOCUS trial presents a unique opportunity in that it provides&#xD;
      high-quality data on which to base transfusion practice recommendations for a specific&#xD;
      patient population. In the FOCUS trial, 2016 adult patients with a history of or risk factors&#xD;
      for cardiovascular disease undergoing surgical hip fracture repair were randomized to be&#xD;
      transfused with RBCs for a Hgb &lt;10 g/dL (liberal group) or for symptoms of anemia and/or a&#xD;
      Hgb &lt;8 g/dL (restrictive group). The primary end point was the ability to ambulate&#xD;
      independently at 60 days, and key secondary endpoints included 30-day and long-term&#xD;
      mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke. No significant difference was observed in any&#xD;
      end point, demonstrating that -- as in the earlier TRICC trial -- a restrictive strategy was&#xD;
      as safe as a liberal transfusion strategy. An earlier multicenter RCT similarly showed no&#xD;
      difference in the rate of silent myocardial ischemia among 260 knee and hip surgery patients&#xD;
      randomized to be transfused for a Hgb &lt;8 g/dL or &lt;10g/dL. With no demonstrable benefit of&#xD;
      transfusing at a higher Hgb, and given the high costs and multiple risks of transfusion,&#xD;
      adoption of the lower (8 g/dL) transfusion trigger in hip surgery patients seems logical. A&#xD;
      small preliminary study was conducted at 9 BEST institutions. Each participating institution&#xD;
      contributed data on a minimum of 10 consecutive patients who underwent total hip replacement&#xD;
      surgery during 2010-11. Out of 186 patients, 63 (34%) were transfused postoperatively. 41/122&#xD;
      (34%) of the postoperative RBC units were transfused at a pretransfusion hemoglobin of &gt; 8&#xD;
      g/dL, suggesting that a practice improvement opportunity exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question In orthopedic surgeons performing adult elective hip surgery, does&#xD;
      providing individual feedback data on transfusion practice in the context of the FOCUS trial&#xD;
      data reduce postoperative RBC utilization compared with providing no feedback?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis Providing individual feedback on transfusion practice to orthopedic&#xD;
      surgeons performing adult hip arthroplasty will reduce elective RBC transfusions in the&#xD;
      postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unit of study is orthopedic surgical attending physicians who perform hip arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no restriction by underlying causal orthopedic factors (e.g. arthritis or traumatic&#xD;
      fracture), or whether surgery is primary or secondary/revision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study type: Two-arm, multicenter, cluster-randomized controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Each cluster will be comprised of the set of orthopedic surgeons that perform hip&#xD;
      surgery at a single study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Baseline blood use in hip arthroplasty cases will be assessed for each surgeon&#xD;
      for the 3-month period just prior to the start of the intervention phase. Baseline blood use&#xD;
      measurements on each surgeon will consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hip arthroplasty cases (n).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Total postoperative RBC units (n) transfused to hip surgery patients. (Here,&#xD;
           &quot;postoperative&quot; is defined as the interval beginning the day after surgery&#xD;
           (&quot;postoperative day 1&quot;) and ending when the patient is discharged from the hospital or&#xD;
           at postoperative day 14, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pretransfusion hemoglobin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics for each orthopedic center will also be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facility type (e.g. academic hospital, community hospital) Orthopedic surgeons performing hip&#xD;
      surgery (n) Annual number of hip surgery procedures (n)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to randomization, the site PI will provide a brief educational presentation to the&#xD;
      orthopedic surgeons at each site. The presentation will consist of a standardized 10-minute&#xD;
      PowerPoint presentation reviewing the data from the FOCUS study and the recommended RBC&#xD;
      transfusion trigger of 8 g/dL (or symptomatic anemia) based on that data. The presentation&#xD;
      will also cover published data on hemoglobin levels and postoperative rehabilitation/quality&#xD;
      of life measures8. The surgeons will be advised that a study of blood use in hip surgery will&#xD;
      be commencing, and that they may be randomized to receive feedback about their individual&#xD;
      postoperative. Clusters of orthopedic surgeons will then be randomized to either the Control&#xD;
      arm (no feedback) or Intervention arm (monthly feedback).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention phase will be conducted for 12 months. Surgeons randomized to the&#xD;
      Intervention arm will be given feedback at the end of each month. The feedback will be&#xD;
      provided in the form of a standardized email report sent by the site PI to each surgeon&#xD;
      individually. The monthly feedback report will show:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of hip surgery cases performed and postoperative RBCs transfused by each surgeon&#xD;
      for the month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentage of postoperative RBCs transfused at a Hgb above or below 8 g/dL by each&#xD;
      surgeon for the previous month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentage of postoperative RBCs transfused at a Hgb below 8 g/dL by each surgeon,&#xD;
      trended over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the reports, surgeon names will be anonymized (e.g. Surgeon A, B, C etc.) However,&#xD;
      individual surgeons will be told which data is their own, so that they may compare themselves&#xD;
      with their peers. No blood utilization data will be reported to the Control arm surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: For data collection purposes, each attending orthopedic surgeon will be&#xD;
      assigned a letter code. Surgeon identity will be kept confidential within each site, and will&#xD;
      not be shared with other sites or the Data Coordinating Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: The following information will be collected for each patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Study Number Age/Gender Surgical procedure (primary or reoperative hip replacement,&#xD;
      hip fracture) Surgeon study number Date of surgery Date of discharge Postoperative RBC&#xD;
      transfusions (number of units and date) Pretransfusion Hgb levels (g/dL) Hgb (g/dL) at&#xD;
      admission/discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected using electronic CRFs completed by each site. If desired, sites may&#xD;
      first record data on an optional paper CRF, then upload the data electronically. The feedback&#xD;
      reports will be generated by a central data coordinating center. The feedback reports will be&#xD;
      emailed to each site PI monthly for subsequent email distribution to the local orthopedic&#xD;
      surgeons. Surgeon names and patient identifiers will be maintained locally at each site and&#xD;
      will not be shared with the data coordinating center or with other study sites. Read receipts&#xD;
      will be used for emailed reports to the surgeons; site PIs will track the number of feedback&#xD;
      reports read or not read each month by surgeon.&#xD;
