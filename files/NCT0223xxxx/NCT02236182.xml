        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients must have a diagnosis of COPD and must meet the following spirometric&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have relatively stable, moderate to severe airway obstruction with an&#xD;
             FEV1 &lt;=65% of predicted normal and FEV1 &lt;=70% of forced vital capacity (FVC).&#xD;
             Predicted normal value will be calculated according to Morris&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Males: FEV1 = 0.093 (Height in inches)-0.032 (age)-1.343&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females: FEV1 = 0.085 (Height. in inches)-0.025(age)-1.692&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients 40 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a smoking history of more than 10 pack-years. A pack-year is&#xD;
             defined as the equivalent of smoking one pack of 20 cigarettes per day for a year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to perform pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and maintain records&#xD;
             during the study period as required in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to be trained in the proper use of an inhalation aerosol and the&#xD;
             RESPIMAT™ device&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) with no clinical relevant&#xD;
             arrhythmias or conduction system disease (e.g. right or left bundle branch block,&#xD;
             second degree AV block or higher)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an oxygen saturation of &gt;=90% for &gt;=92% of the recording time on&#xD;
             overnight oximetry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must sign an Informed Consent Form prior to participation in the trial&#xD;
             (i.e., at least 24 hours (h) prior to the screening visit (Visit 1))&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically relevant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A&#xD;
             clinically relevant disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the study&#xD;
             or a disease with may influence the results of the study or patient's ability to&#xD;
             participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a recent history (i.e. one year or less) of myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;

             with any past history or active cardiac arrhythmia requiring drug therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a pacemaker&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically relevant abnormal baseline hematology, blood chemistry or&#xD;
             urinalysis. If the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion the&#xD;
             patient is excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients with serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase / Aspartate aminotransferase&#xD;
             (SGOT/AST) &gt;80 IU/L, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase / Alanine transaminase&#xD;
             (SGPT/ALT) &gt;80 IU/L, bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dl, or creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dl will be excluded&#xD;
             regardless of the clinical condition. Repeat laboratory evaluation will be not be&#xD;
             conducted in these subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a blood eosinophil count &gt;=600/mm3. A Repeat eosinophil count will&#xD;
             be not be conducted in these patients&#xD;

             weeks on a stable dose) or at a dose in excess of the equivalent of 10 mg of&#xD;
             prednisone per day or 20 mg every other day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are being treated with beta-blocker medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had changes in their therapeutic plan within the last six weeks&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to ant cholinergic drugs or any other components&#xD;
             of the ATROVENT® RESPIMAT™ solution including bacteriostatic agent benzalkonium&#xD;
