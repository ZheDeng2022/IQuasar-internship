  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas (DIPG) appear almost exclusively in children and&#xD;
      adolescents, representing 15 to 20% of posterior fossa tumours. Even if it is one of the most&#xD;
      common malignant brain tumours, there are only 30 to 40 new cases per year in France. Their&#xD;
      clinical presentation is stereotyped with a short clinical history and a unique MRI&#xD;
      appearance that was usually considered as sufficient to establish the diagnosis. The&#xD;
      prognosis of DIPG is always unfavourable; median overall survival is 9 to 10 months in&#xD;
      general and most patients will die within two years after diagnosis (Kaplan 1996,Hargrave&#xD;
      2006). Malignant gliomas infiltrating the brainstem represent the greatest challenge of&#xD;
      paediatric oncology; despite numerous collaborative studies performed, patients' survival has&#xD;
      not significantly increased in thirty years (Hargrave 2009). There is no validated prognostic&#xD;
      factor. There is currently no validated treatment except radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several targeted agents have been tested in DIPG (Pollack 2007 Haas-Kogan 2008, Geoerger,&#xD;
      2011), without knowing whether the target was present in the tumour. A critical review of the&#xD;
      paradigms of these trials tells us that there are long term survivors in these studies that&#xD;
      is to say patients who may have benefited from the tested therapy, but they are few. So far,&#xD;
      the new therapies that have been tried were evaluated one after the other in search of a&#xD;
      treatment that would be effective for all patients, measuring the treatment effect on median&#xD;
      survival. They were all rejected as ineffective. However the investigators can challenge the&#xD;
      endpoint to evaluate efficacy in these trials as the existence of long term survivors (&gt; 18&#xD;
      months, for example) and their number should not been ignored, especially if targeted&#xD;
      therapies are considered. The investigators propose a paradigm shift in the choice of&#xD;
      treatment; the issue raised would be to give to each patient the treatment associated with&#xD;
      the highest likelihood of efficacy based on the specific biological tumour profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of targeted therapies for malignant gliomas infiltrating the brainstem has&#xD;
      been hampered by the absence of biological data. It is therefore crucial to better understand&#xD;
      the biology of these tumours. Despite the safety of the biopsy in brainstem tumours, most&#xD;
      teams of paediatric neurosurgery limit the use of stereotactic biopsy only for clinically or&#xD;
      radiologically unusual forms. Until recently, there has been no systematic genetic study at&#xD;
      diagnosis to date and the few available data were confounded by the inclusion of autopsies or&#xD;
      clinically and radiologically unusual cases (Louis, 1993; Gilbertson 2003; Okada, 2008;&#xD;
      Zarghooni 2010; Broniscer, 2010; Wu, 2012 and Schwartzentruber, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      French teams gathered in the French Society of Paediatric Oncology and the European&#xD;
      consortium &quot;Innovative Therapies in Children with Cancer (ITCC)&quot; decided a few years ago to&#xD;
      perform biopsies of these tumours for diagnostic confirmation and to ensure the presence of&#xD;
      certain therapeutic targets prior to a possible inclusion in a trial evaluating a targeted&#xD;
      therapy (Geoerger, 2009; Geoerger, 2010). Part of this experiment was reported by the team of&#xD;
      the Necker Hospital in Paris, confirming the low rate of complications of stereotactic biopsy&#xD;
      procedure (Roujeau, 2007). The biopsy specimen analysis allowed practicing&#xD;
      immunohistochemical, genomic (CGHarray), gene expression (transcriptome) and direct&#xD;
      sequencing of candidate genes studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the majority of patients will receive a treatment assumed to specifically&#xD;
      target a biological abnormality identified on the biopsy. More importantly, patients will not&#xD;
      receive a drug for which the identified target is absent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this first step of the protocol, the patients will thus be allocated to one of the three&#xD;
      treatment groups as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the tumor overexpresses EGFR without PTEN loss of expression, patients may receive&#xD;
           erlotinib or dasatinib allocated by randomization (R1 randomisation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the tumor shows loss of PTEN expression without EGFR overexpression, patients may&#xD;
           receive everolimus or dasatinib allocated by randomisation (R2 randomisation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the tumor shows both EGFR overexpression and loss of PTEN expression, patients may&#xD;
           receive erlotinib, everolimus or dasatinib by randomisation (R3 randomisation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the tumor shows neither EGFR overexpression nor loss of PTEN expression (a very rare&#xD;
           situation in our experience), patients will receive dasatinib (no randomisation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the biopsy assessment is not contributive, the treatment will be allocated by&#xD;
           randomisation between erlotinib, everolimus and dasatinib (R3 randomisation).&#xD;
