  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether adding everolimus to hormone treatment before&#xD;
      breast surgery will increase the chances of shrinking the breast cancer in those patients&#xD;
      with hormone-responsive breast cancer and a lower Oncotype DX® Recurrence Score ( 25 or&#xD;
      less), compared to prior experience with hormone therapy alone. Everolimus is a drug&#xD;
      currently approved for use by the United States Food and Drug administration (FDA) for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic kidney or breast cancer. Everolimus is&#xD;
      considered investigational for non-metastatic breast cancer patients.&#xD;

    <description>(PEPI) preoperative endocrine prognostic index. The total PEPI score assigned to each patient is the sum of the risk points derived from the pT stage, pN stage, Ki67 level, and estrogen receptor status of the surgical specimen. An HR in the range of 1-2 receives one risk point; a HR in the 2-2.5 range, two risk points; a HR greater than 2.5, three risk points. The total risk point score for each patient is the sum of all the risk points accumulated from the four factors in the model.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Tumors must be estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive according to ASCO/CAP&#xD;
             2010 guidelines as either ER or PR ≥ 1% positive nuclear staining by&#xD;

             must not be positive (must be a ratio of &lt; 2), but otherwise FISH/CISH is not required&#xD;
             if IHC is 0 or 1+ by institutional standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have had prior ipsilateral breast-conserving surgery or total&#xD;

                  cm in size are not required to have an Oncotype Dx. One lesion (typically the&#xD;
                  largest) should be designated as the target lesion for which clinical and&#xD;
                  radiographic response to the neoadjuvant therapy will be judged.&#xD;
&#xD;
