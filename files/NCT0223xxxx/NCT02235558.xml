  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether super-selective intra-arterial&#xD;
      administration of verapamil immediately following successful intra-arterial thrombolysis is&#xD;
      safe as a potential neuroprotective agent. Standard procedures are cerebral angiography and&#xD;
      intra-arterial thrombolysis (intra-arterial administration of tPA and/or mechanical&#xD;
      thrombectomy). Experimental procedure is superselective injection of verapamil&#xD;
      intra-arterially.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial represents the first time that verapamil will be evaluated in human subjects as a&#xD;
      superselectively administered neuroprotective agent administered in an acute time frame as an&#xD;
      adjunct to intra-arterial thrombolysis. The methods for administration, along with the&#xD;
      routinized followup, will provide a paradigm for studying other potential neuroprotective&#xD;
      agents. Subjects will undergo cerebral angiography with intra-arterial thrombolysis, which is&#xD;
      standard of care. 'Intra-arterial thrombolysis will include possible intra-arterial&#xD;
      administration of tPA, as well as possible mechanical thrombectomy with an accepted&#xD;
      thrombectomy device. This includes the Mercí Retriever (Concentric Medical, Mountain View,&#xD;
      CA), the Penumbra System (Penumbra, Alameda, CA), the Solitaire stent-triever (EV3, Covidien,&#xD;
      Irvine, CA), and the Trevo stent-triever (Concentric Medical, Mountain View, CA). Immediately&#xD;
      after the intra-arterial thrombolysis component of the angiographic procedure is completed,&#xD;
      the microcatheter used during the procedure will be left in or guided into the vessel&#xD;
      location of the clot. 10mg of verapamil in 20cc of normal saline will be administered over 20&#xD;
      minutes (1cc/minute) through the microcatheter and into the vessel previously obstructed by&#xD;
      clot. At the conclusion of infusion, the microcatheter will be removed. Angiography through&#xD;
      the guide catheter of the cerebral circulation in question will be performed to ensure no new&#xD;
      thromboembolic event from the microcatheterization (standard of care). The catheters will be&#xD;
      removed, and the arterial puncture site closed in the standard fashion. Patients will receive&#xD;
      a noncontrast CT scan or MRI approximately 24 hours after intervention to determine the&#xD;
      presence or absence of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) after intervention. This would be&#xD;
      considered standard practice for intra-arterial thrombolysis. Both imaging studies can detect&#xD;
      ICH, and the choice of one or the other will be determined by clinical criteria; CT or MRI&#xD;
      may be preferable for different reasons depending upon the patient's clinical scenario. The&#xD;
      determination of hemorrhage will be made by the official dictation of a diagnostic&#xD;
      neuroradiologist not directly involved in the study. The hemorrhage will be considered an&#xD;
      adverse event if it is deemed symptomatic in accordance with the criteria used in the&#xD;
      International Management of Stroke (IMS) III study. Briefly, a hemorrhage is defined as&#xD;
      symptomatic if occurring within 24+/-6 hours after study inclusion, temporally related to the&#xD;
      intervention, and occurs with worsening neurological status as documented in the clinical&#xD;
      exam. A 4 point or more increase in the NIHSS stroke scale would qualify as a significant&#xD;
      worsening in status. Furthermore, hemorrhage that requires intervention surgically or&#xD;
      endovascularly would be deemed significant.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Suspected acute ischemic stroke based on clinical and radiographic evidence as&#xD;
             determined and documented by the Stroke Neurology team at University of Kentucky.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must meet criteria for intra-arterial thrombolysis as determined and&#xD;
             documented by Interventional Neuroradiology attending physician (JF or AA).&#xD;

          4. Patients must have an acute thromboembolus within an intracranial artery (internal&#xD;
             carotid, anterior cerebral, middle cerebral, posterior cerebral, basilar, vertebral)&#xD;

             (eg. Merci or Penumbra clot retrieval) thrombolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with impaired capacity may be included, as the pathology to be studied&#xD;
             (stroke) may impair their capacity (please see attached required documentation&#xD;
             regarding impaired capacity).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        0 = No Perfusion&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Patients with occlusion of the cervical common or internal carotid artery will be&#xD;
             excluded from the study.&#xD;
