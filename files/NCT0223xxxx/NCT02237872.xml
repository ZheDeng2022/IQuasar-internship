  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to assess the accuracy of conventional fat fraction proton&#xD;
      MRI for the detection of Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) in healthy subjects using&#xD;
      18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucosefluorodeoxyglucose -PET as gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study, MRI and PET imaging of BAT of healthy adult volunteers will be performed&#xD;
      on a combined PET/MRI scanner under mild cold condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the fight against obesity, brown adipose tissue (BAT) is considered to be the newest&#xD;
      target. The hypothesis is that this tissue is partially responsible for the imbalance between&#xD;
      energy intake and energy expenditure that keeps lean people lean and obese people obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detection of this tissue in adult humans represents an unmet need. BAT is difficult to&#xD;
      detect and measurements of tissue fat fraction performed by magnetic resonance imaging have&#xD;
      been proposed as a mean to differentiate the highly hydrated brown fat from the less hydrated&#xD;
      white adipose tissue and from muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, the objective of this study is to assess the accuracy of magnetic resonance fat&#xD;
      fraction measurements for the detection of BAT volume in adult humans, while using PET with&#xD;
      18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose as gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study subjects will undergo a combined MRI/PET scan. The scans will be done during&#xD;
      stimulation of thermogenic activity by mild cold exposure.&#xD;
