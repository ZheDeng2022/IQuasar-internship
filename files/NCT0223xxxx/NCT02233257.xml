  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a genetic disorder affecting the brain and adrenal&#xD;
      glands. Approximately one third of boys who are at risk will develop cerebral disease. Using&#xD;
      a specific diet and the compound Lorenzo's oil, it can be shown that very long chain fatty&#xD;
      acids may be lowered in the blood, but it is not known to what degree that may prevent the&#xD;
      onset of childhood disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal makes available Lorenzo's oil to individuals with ALD, a life threatening&#xD;
      disorder for which there are presently no other therapies.&#xD;

      Expanded Access for Lorenzo's Oil in X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy to Intermediate Size Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction/Rationale: A diet that consists predominantly of long-chain monounsaturated&#xD;
      fatty acids has been demonstrated to reduce the levels of very long chain fatty acids (VLCA)&#xD;
      in individuals with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). VLCFA are the primary biochemical&#xD;
      abnormality in this genetic disorder and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the&#xD;
      cerebral disease. It has been demonstrated in an open study that reduction of VLCFA for more&#xD;
      than a year is protective for childhood cerebral disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this expanded access proposal is to transition an open label study presently&#xD;
      ongoing in boys between the ages of 18 months and 13 years of age to an expanded access&#xD;
      study. The reason for this transition is lack of funding for the investigator to continue to&#xD;
      support this as a study. A study requires investigator involvement including the assistance&#xD;
      of research associates to monitor and track outcomes, perform neuropsychological assessments,&#xD;
      monitor adverse events, and coordinate periodic evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A move to expanded access would decentralize the coordination and monitoring of evaluations&#xD;
      which are clinically indicated even for participants who are not participating in a study.&#xD;
      This role would be undertaken by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected in such an open study could serve as safety material for a later filing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Males with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy; see inclusion/exclusion criteria below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Individuals who wish to obtain oil will submit clinical documentation of diagnosis to&#xD;
           Dr. Gerald Raymond. This will be either elevated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) or&#xD;
           DNA diagnosis of a mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify a provider who will be responsible for the supervision of the diet. It is&#xD;
           suggested that this be an individual who is experienced in managing individuals on a&#xD;
           special diets such as a biochemical geneticist or neurologist with experience in ALD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Studies required before prescription (It is important to emphasize that while many of&#xD;
           the following are performed solely for the use of Lorenzo's oil, the costs of these&#xD;
           investigations and consults will be the financial responsibility of the participants.)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Baseline VLCFA, complete blood count with platelets, and comprehensive metabolic&#xD;
                panel&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Nutrition consult with a determination of daily calories. Thirty percent of&#xD;
                calories will be provided by lipids and 2/3 of these lipid calories will be&#xD;
                provided by long chain monounsaturated fatty acids (Lorenzo's oil). This&#xD;
                nutritional evaluation will include the following.&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Present body parameters including weight, height, and BMI ii. Calculated daily&#xD;
           calories and other nutritional needs for growth. iii. Calculation of percent of diet as&#xD;
           lipids and amount of oil to be consumed daily iv. Instruction in diet restriction and&#xD;
           monitoring of said diet. v. Recommend supplements. vi. Instructions in providing diet&#xD;
           recall vii. Suggestions for maintaining and improving compliance. c. An MRI and adrenal&#xD;
           testing are clinically indicated and will be required as part of expanded access.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinical research forms (CRF) will be designed for the baseline and follow up&#xD;
           information for uniformity of documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Upon receipt of this information, Dr. Raymond will provide an authorization of the&#xD;
           prescription to the supplier, Nutricia N.A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Monitoring while receiving oil will consist of the following&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. VLCFA; Complete blood count (CBC), and Comprehensive metabolic panel every 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Nutrition consult yearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brain will be performed every 6-12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Appropriate monitoring of adrenal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. CRFs' will be forwarded every three months for all active participants on a&#xD;
                January, April, July, October schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. The identified provider will be responsible for providing this information to Dr.&#xD;
                Raymond's office. Failure to provide this information will result in withholding of&#xD;
                authorization and no dispensing of the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. No more than 3 months' supply of the product will be authorized or shipped at a&#xD;
                time.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. In the event of development of thrombocytopenia, Lorenzo's oil will be suspended&#xD;
                and glyceryl trioleate (GTO) substituted for one month and then reintroduced as&#xD;
                half dose of Lorenzo's oil followed by incremental increases as tolerated. We have&#xD;
                previously used 80,000 platelets as a lower limit and would recommend this as&#xD;
                providing an adequate margin of safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Adverse events will be tracked and if resulting in hospitalization or death will be&#xD;
           reported as required to the sponsor and FDA in the required period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Otherwise all reported adverse events will be tabulated and reported in the yearly IND&#xD;
      report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will include conversion of normal MRIs to those demonstrating cerebral disease&#xD;
      and any interventions including bone marrow transplantation or gene therapy which are&#xD;
      presently the only options to halt cerebral disease.&#xD;
