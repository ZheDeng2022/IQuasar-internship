      This Single-Arm Post-Marketing Evaluation will gauge the improvement in function and pain for&#xD;
      lumbar spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis patients with the TOPS System.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the TOPS™ SP System from (&quot;TOPS™ System&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;TOPS&quot;). TOPS is an alternative to spinal fusion and is designed to stabilize but not fuse&#xD;
      the affected vertebral level to alleviate pain stemming from degenerative spondylolisthesis&#xD;
      (abnormal/excessive movement of the vertebrae causing pain in the lower back and legs) and&#xD;
      spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal resulting in compression of nerves producing&#xD;
      symptoms of pain, numbness and tingling in the legs).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  One or both of the following at a single level from L3 to L5; (1) symptomatic&#xD;
             monosegmental lumbar spinal stenosis or facet arthrosis, (2) degenerative&#xD;
             spondylolisthesis up to and including grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least three (3) months of failed, conservative treatment prior to surgery (unless&#xD;
             deemed inadvisable due to progressive motor weakness or other evidence of rapidly&#xD;
             deteriorating condition) including the use of anti-inflammatory medications at maximum&#xD;
             specified dosage, administration of epidural/facet injections, rest, heat,&#xD;
             electrotherapy and/or physical therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal (central and/or foramenal) classified as moderate&#xD;
             to severe using CT scans/MRI;&#xD;
