    <textblock>
      Many individuals experience an acute change in thinking and reasoning skills after surgery.&#xD;
      This is called post-operative delirium (PD). PD symptoms typically start 1-3 days after&#xD;
      surgery. Advanced age has been identified as a risk factor for PD. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to determine if performing mental exercise, before surgery, will help reduce post-surgery&#xD;
      memory and thinking problems. Assuming a 30% incidence of PD and proposed 50% reduction of PD&#xD;
      in the intervention group (15% incidence), a total of 242 patients (1:1 ratio, 121 in each&#xD;
      group) will achieve 80% power to detect 50% reduction using chi-square test at a 5% type I&#xD;
      error rate. Assuming approximately 1/3 of consented patients either fail screening or do not&#xD;
      complete the study after consent, we expect to consent 358 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 8 days before surgery, subjects complete a series of questionnaires to assess&#xD;
      baseline cognition level (or thinking ability) and status of overall well-being. At the&#xD;
      completion of the screening visit, qualifying subjects are randomized into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized into the Cognitive Exercise group are expected to complete&#xD;
      tablet-based brain games provided by Lumosity. These subjects are given a handheld tablet for&#xD;
      the duration of the preoperative period. Participants in this group are expected to complete&#xD;
      a minimum of 10 hours within at least 8 days prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized into the Normal Activity group are encouraged to carry out their&#xD;
      baseline daily activities, and do not have any study-related cognitive exercise expectations&#xD;
      before surgery. These subjects still complete the same questionnaires and assessments as the&#xD;
      Cognitive Exercise group throughout the study, however, are asked not to alter their normal&#xD;
      daily routine of mental exertion (i.e. watching television, reading, puzzles, etc.) and are&#xD;
      not permitted to subscribe to Lumosity while in the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of surgery, a baseline delirium evaluation (CAM - Confusion Assessment Method) is&#xD;
      taken before surgery. During surgery, research personnel monitor vital signs and medications&#xD;
      given. After surgery, another CAM evaluation is taken in the post-operative recovery room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the subject's hospital stay, pain levels and medication usage are recorded. The&#xD;
      CAM and MDAS (Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale) are used to identify and determine severity&#xD;
      of PD. The evaluations are given twice daily, at at 7:30AM ± 1.5 hrs and 6:30PM ± 1.5 hrs,&#xD;
      for 7 days or until hospital discharge (whichever comes first). The Postoperative Quality of&#xD;
      Recovery Scale (PQRS) is used each post-operative day at 6:30PM ± 1.5 hrs until discharge,&#xD;
      and completed over the phone on POD 7 if patient discharged. The PQRS is also administered&#xD;
      over the phone on POD 30 and POD 90.&#xD;

      Potential study participants will be identified one of two ways, either by the treating&#xD;
      physician in clinic when the decision is made to pursue surgery or by researchers monitoring&#xD;
      the OR schedule. When a potential participant is identified by the treating physician in&#xD;
      clinic, they will ask the patient if study personnel may call them to discuss the study. If&#xD;
      the patient agrees to be contacted, the surgeon will alert study personnel who will call the&#xD;
      patient to explain the study and arrange the initial study (screening) visit. Study personnel&#xD;
      will monitor the OR schedule and call any potential patients the surgeons have not already&#xD;
      identified in clinic. In this case, patients will be informed over the phone that their&#xD;
      surgeon has granted permission to contact them regarding the study. Surgeons will be made&#xD;
      aware when their patients have been approached over the phone, and updated accordingly if the&#xD;
      patient agrees to the screening visit and is subsequently enrolled in the study. All&#xD;
      screening visits will occur at the OSU Pre-operative Assessment Center (OPAC). When possible&#xD;
      the screening visit will co-inside with pre-operative testing per the Anesthesia Department&#xD;
      at OPAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will occur at the initial screening visit which is to take place&#xD;
      approximately 2 weeks prior to surgery, but no less than 8 days pre-op. At this visit, a&#xD;
      member of the research team will obtain demographic information (gender, education level),&#xD;
      historical medical information, and information regarding medication usage. The researcher&#xD;
      will perform the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) - the modified version (see attached&#xD;
      document), Self Administered Gerocognitve Form (SAGE) - all four versions (see attached&#xD;
      questionnaires), Geriatric Depression Scale, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Postoperative&#xD;
      Quality Recovery Scale (PQRS), and Short-form 36 Health Related Quality of Life Measure.&#xD;
      Patients meeting inclusion criteria will be randomized to either the cognitive exercise or&#xD;
      control group. Patients in the cognitive exercise group will be given a tablet with&#xD;
      preinstalled access to Lumosity (Lumos Labs, San Francisco, CA, USA), a cognitive exercise&#xD;
      software application which will be used in this study. Each participant in the cognitive&#xD;
      exercise group will be expected to complete 1 hour of Lumosity brain exercise daily for a&#xD;
      minimum of 8 days prior to surgery, equaling an effective 'dose' at least 10 hours. Playing&#xD;
      time will be determined either by: (a) the actual in-game playing time; or (b) as calculated&#xD;
      by the research team during the Screening Visit (see the &quot;Subject Diary&quot;). The Lumosity&#xD;
      software allows for monitoring of participant compliance by researchers. Patients in the&#xD;
      control group will carry out their normal activities prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo surgery as planned. On the day of surgery, prior to proceeding to&#xD;
      the operating room, patients will be assessed with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) to&#xD;
      confirm no presence of delirium pre-operatively. In the Post-anesthesia Recovery Unit, a&#xD;
      different member of the research team (blinded to the patient's group assignment) will repeat&#xD;
      the CAM to assess for PD. While hospitalized, pain scores determined using the Verbal Analog&#xD;
      Scale and narcotic use will be obtained from the electronic medical record with at least 8&#xD;
      hour frequency (entered by registered nurses). All participants will be evaluated by a&#xD;
      blinded researcher using the combined CAM/Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS) at 7:30AM&#xD;
      ± 1.5 hrs and 6:30PM ± 1.5 hrs for PD on subsequent post-op days until discharge.&#xD;
      Additionally, the PQRS will be completed at each 6:30PM ± 1.5 hrs assessment. The PQRS, MMSE,&#xD;
      and SAGE will be repeated just prior to discharge or on POD 7. A different form for the SAGE&#xD;
      examination, as well as alternate number and word sequences for the PQRS and MMSE&#xD;
      assessments, will be used in order to reduce the potential influence of the learning effect.&#xD;
      At the end of this visit, active patient participation is complete. For subjects discharged&#xD;
      before POD 7, the PQRS will be given again via telephone. Follow-up visits will be conducted&#xD;
      on POD 30 and POD 90 via telephone. The PQRS will be obtained on POD 30, and the PQRS, GDS,&#xD;
      and SF-36 will be obtained on POD 90. The research team will also periodically check the&#xD;
      medical record during this time for readmissions and provider notes related to medical&#xD;
      events. Participation is complete after POD 90.&#xD;
