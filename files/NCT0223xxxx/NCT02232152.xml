  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of CPI-613 when given&#xD;
      together with fluorouracil in treating patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to&#xD;
      other parts of the body and cannot be removed by surgery. CPI-613 may kill tumor cells by&#xD;
      turning off their mitochondria. Mitochondria are used by tumor cells to produce energy and&#xD;
      are the building blocks needed to make more tumor cells. By shutting off these mitochondria,&#xD;
      CPI-613 deprives the tumor cells of energy and other supplies that they need to survive and&#xD;
      grow in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,&#xD;
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving CPI-613 with fluorouracil may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CPI-613 (6,8-bis[benzylthio]octanoic&#xD;
      acid), when used in combination with 5-FU (fluorouracil), in patients with non-resectable&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer who have failed FOLFOX (leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil and&#xD;
      oxaliplatin), FOLFIRI (leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and irinotecan hydrochloride) and,&#xD;
      if Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) wild type, then a epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor-based regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK), safety and efficacy of various doses of CPI-613, when&#xD;
      used in combination with 5-FU, in patients with non-resectable metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1-4&#xD;
      and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on days 2-4. Courses repeat every 2 weeks for 6 months in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 3 years.&#xD;
