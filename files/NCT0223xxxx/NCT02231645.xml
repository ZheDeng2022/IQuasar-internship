  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN DBS)&#xD;
      can affect moral and economic decisions in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of patients with idiopathic PD and with bilateral STN DBS implant (experimental&#xD;
      group) and a control group including patients with idiopathic PD and without DBS implant who&#xD;
      are treated with dopaminergic medications will be recruited from the IRCCS Fondazione Ca'&#xD;
      Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico of Milan and from the Istituto Neurologico Nazionale&#xD;
      IRCCS Casimiro Mondino of Pavia. Patients will be selected in order to balance groups for&#xD;
      gender, age, disease duration, cognitive and motor functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decision-making computerized tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moral task. The task consisted of 38 sentences divided into 13 neutral, 10 moral conflictual&#xD;
      and 15 moral non conflictual statements. Each statement was presented in a random order for a&#xD;
      maximum of 10 s. During this period, participants were instructed to read each sentence and&#xD;
      to respond if they agreed or disagreed with it by pressing the &quot;A&quot; (agreement) or the &quot;L&quot;&#xD;
      (disagreement) keys with the left or the right finger. After the key was pressed, a black&#xD;
      screen was displayed for 1 s before the next statement appeared on the screen (Fumagalli et&#xD;
      al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economics task. Pairs of stimuli (four letters from the Latin alphabet) are presented on the&#xD;
      screen in white on a black background. To maximize gains, subjects are asked to choose a&#xD;
      letter by pressing one of the two keyboard keys, corresponding to the stimulus on the left or&#xD;
      right of the screen. Each choice prompts two visual feedbacks, the first displaying the money&#xD;
      won or lost and the second indicating the total sum of money the subject was gaining. Each&#xD;
      stimulus pair is preceded by a black screen. Six different stimulus pairs (AB, AC, AD, BC,&#xD;
      BD, CD) are presented. Stimulus pairs comprised stimuli with the same probability to win&#xD;
      (conflictual trials) and different probability to win (non conflictual trials). The letters&#xD;
      &quot;A&quot; and &quot;D&quot; led to positive feedback (+60 Euros) 80% of the times and to negative feedback&#xD;
      (-30 Euros) 20% of the times (non risky letters). &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; letters led to high positive&#xD;
      feedback (+100 Euros) only 20% of the times and to a high negative feedback (-70 Euros) 80%&#xD;
      (risky letters). The task is designed to reward non risky choices, so that the larger the&#xD;
      number of non risky choices, the higher is the amount of money earned. The task comprises 102&#xD;
      trials, 68 non conflictual and 34 conflictual (Rosa et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be tested with the moral and the economics tasks during the best ON-drug&#xD;
      medication condition. The experimental group performed the tasks in the STN DBS ON condition&#xD;
      and in the STN DBS OFF condition. Following the end of the STN DBS ON session, the DBS&#xD;
      devices will be turned off by the physician 30 minutes prior to the STN DBS OFF session. The&#xD;
      order of stimulation conditions and of the versions of the task will be randomized and&#xD;
      counterbalanced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will similarly perform the moral and the economics tasks twice with the&#xD;
      same time intervals, without the STN DBS manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor, cognitive and psychological assessment. Patients will perform a short motor, cognitive&#xD;
      and psychological assessment using the UPDRS III, the MMSE and VASs for subjective evaluation&#xD;
      of mood, anxiety, movement difficulty and motor fatigue. VASs will be performed twice: in STN&#xD;
      DBS ON and OFF conditions for experimental group, and in the first and the second session for&#xD;
      the control group. UPDRS III and MMSE will be evaluated when patients from the experimental&#xD;
      group are in STN DBS ON condition and when control patients are in the first session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normality tests will be performed on behavioural data (reaction times and responses at&#xD;
      computerized tasks, scores obtained at MMSE, UPDRS III, VASs) with One-Sample&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioural data obtained by the experimental group in STN DBS ON and STN DBS OFF conditions&#xD;
      will be compared with analysis of variance (ANOVA). Also data obtained by patients from the&#xD;
      experimental group will be compared to data obtained by the control groups.&#xD;
