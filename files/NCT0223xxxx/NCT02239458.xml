  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is a common co-morbidity in patients with CF. The&#xD;
      underlying pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is still a matter of&#xD;
      investigation. In addition to localized tissue damage developing similar to that of the&#xD;
      exocrine pancreas, other mechanisms may be involved. We have shown that a potential&#xD;
      contributing factor to the patho-physiology of CFRD may be an abnormal gut derived hormonal&#xD;
      profile, specifically of lower incretin hormone responses, prior to development of CFRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose that an altered incretin response, probably due to impaired interaction of&#xD;
      nutrients with the gut mucosa due to thickened secretions, may play a role in the development&#xD;
      of the disease. Specifically, low GIP and GLP-1, may explain the poor β-cell function&#xD;
      observed in these patients prior to CFRD appearance. These incretins have known trophic&#xD;
      effects on β-cells, and thus their lower levels may contribute to the development of&#xD;
      quantitative as well as qualitative defects in β-cell function and thus may lead to the&#xD;
      development of CFRD. Thus, increasing levels of these incretins using a DPP-IV inhibitor may&#xD;
      improve glucose metabolism and delay/prevent the development of CFRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that Saxagliptin will increase the oDI compared to placebo and will thus&#xD;
      provide relative protection from diabetes development and in addition we expect that&#xD;
      Saxagliptin will lead to overall increased insulin concentrations and thus shift the&#xD;
      metabolic milieu to a more anabolic state. This will manifest as weight gain and reduction in&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;

      The following proposal includes testing the utility of DPP-IV inhibition in adult patients&#xD;
      with CF without CFRD. This will be achieved by a randomized double blind controlled trial of&#xD;
      Saxagliptin 5 mg vs. placebo which will be performed for 3 months in 60 patients with CF&#xD;
      without CFRD. The study will be for 3 months of use and will consist of two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Saxagliptin 5mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Placebo. the primary outcome of this study will be the oral disposition index oDI ,&#xD;
           derived from the OGTT. The oDI has been shown across age groups and metabolic phenotypes&#xD;
           to be an excellent predictor of diabetes development over time . We postulate that&#xD;
           Saxagliptin will increase incretin concentrations and thus improve insulin secretion.&#xD;
           This will manifest as an increased oral disposition index (oDI), reflecting an improved&#xD;
           beta cell response in the context of prevailing insulin sensitivity. The oDI is a useful&#xD;
           predictor of diabetes development over time and its increase will provide evidence for&#xD;
           protection from diabetes in this special study population&#xD;
