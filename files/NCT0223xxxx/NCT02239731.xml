    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of FDX104&#xD;
      Antibiotic Foam in the prevention of EGFRI skin toxicity in cancer patients receiving&#xD;
      Cetuximab or Panitumumab.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II multicenter, randomized, double blind, vehicle controlled clinical study&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Doxycycline Foam 4% for the prevention&#xD;
      of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibition Skin Toxicity, to Subjects with Cancer&#xD;
      Receiving Cetuximab or Panitumumab on a weekly or every 2 weeks basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a screening visit, a treatment period where patients will be treated&#xD;
      topically on the face twice daily for 5 weeks. A post-treatment follow up visit (4 weeks&#xD;
      after end of treatment), will be performed only for subjects who have experienced unresolved&#xD;
      possibly-related or related adverse events at the end of the treatment. Seven days after&#xD;
      randomization and study drug initiation, subjects will start their EGFRI treatment.&#xD;
