  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in cardiovascular care, the occurrence of heart failure (HF) is steadily&#xD;
      increasing. The increase in HF rates poses enormous challenges, as once an individual becomes&#xD;
      symptomatic or requires hospitalization with HF, the prognosis remains poor. Therefore,&#xD;
      prevention of HF is essential. HF prevention is a critical issue as HF risk factors that&#xD;
      include common medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes are also increasing.&#xD;
      However, not everyone with these risk factors develops HF. Using novel blood tests, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to identify and treat subjects at higher HF risk to see if the&#xD;
      investigators can stabilize or improve ultrasound measures known to be associated with HF&#xD;
      risk. This study will enroll only Veterans.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently the investigators have shown that HF risk prediction can be improved using cardiac&#xD;
      troponin T measured with a novel high-sensitivity assay (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal pro-B-type&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Furthermore, hs-cTnT seems to identify individuals at higher&#xD;
      risk among those with established risk factors (such as hypertension) for HF. In preliminary&#xD;
      results, the investigators have shown that individuals with systolic blood pressure of&#xD;
      120-129 mm Hg and elevated hs-cTnT have a higher rate of incident HF than those with systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure of 140-159 mm Hg and undetectable hs-cTnT. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      believe that by using hs-cTnT to estimate HF risk the investigators can identify individuals&#xD;
      in whom aggressive modification of risk factors such as high blood pressure will be&#xD;
      associated with a favorable risk-benefit ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' objective/specific aim therefore is to evaluate if treatment of selected&#xD;
      subjects with Stage A or B HF (i.e., those with hs-cTnT &gt;5 ng/L and an estimated 10-year HF&#xD;
      hospitalization risk of &gt;5%) who have reasonably well-controlled blood pressure with&#xD;
      antihypertensive agents (carvedilol or spironolactone) will be associated with improvement of&#xD;
      surrogate markers associated with incident HF (i.e., speckle-tracked cardiac and vascular&#xD;
      strain). Carvedilol and spironolactone were chosen for the following reasons: a) they are not&#xD;
      routinely used as first-line antihypertensive agents; b) beta-blockade was associated with&#xD;
      decreases in hs-cTnT in the preliminary analysis of subjects with established HF; and c) the&#xD;
      mechanism of actions of carvedilol and spironolactone provide a sound scientific rationale&#xD;
      for use in prevention of HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a prospective open-label blinded end point (PROBE) design, the investigators propose to&#xD;
      randomize 210 subjects aged &gt;40 years with systolic blood pressure between 120-155 mm Hg,&#xD;
      cardiac troponin T (measured with a novel high-sensitivity assay) level &gt;5 ng/L, and 10-year&#xD;
      HF risk &gt;5% (estimated using a validated laboratory model including demographic factors,&#xD;
      NT-proBNP, and hs-cTnT) to receive carvedilol (nonselective beta-blocker), spironolactone&#xD;
      (aldosterone antagonist), or usual care for 18 months. The primary end point will be change&#xD;
      in global longitudinal systolic myocardial strain estimated using 2D speckle tracking.&#xD;
      Additionally, changes in vascular strain and biomarkers will be evaluated. This study will&#xD;
      help us identify whether both or either of the medications can be further tested in large&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials to prevent the incidence of HF.&#xD;
