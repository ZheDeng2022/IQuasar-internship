  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) develops when there is impaired insulin production due to&#xD;
      loss of insulin producing cells (beta cells). The amount of insulin that can be produced is&#xD;
      imperfectly correlated with beta cell mass (BCM). The development of a reliable method to&#xD;
      noninvasively quantify the total amount of insulin producing beta cells would be of great&#xD;
      benefit by providing an important endpoint for the development of new treatments of diabetes.&#xD;
      The investigators have previously identified a specific marker on islet cells called&#xD;
      vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) that the investigators now propose to use in&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to determine islet beta cell mass. The PET&#xD;
      radiopharmaceutical 18F-fluoropropyl(FP)-dihydrotetrabenazine(DTBZ) has been used previously&#xD;
      in human subjects without adverse effects. It has shown promise in differentiating type 1&#xD;
      diabetes and non-diabetes. The investigators now hypothesize that repeat PET scans will be&#xD;
      reproducible in the same subject. Subjects with normal BCM will be recruited from among&#xD;
      normal weight non-diabetic people with plasma insulin levels within the normal range.&#xD;
      Subjects with predicted reduced BCM will be recruited from among patients with T1DM who have&#xD;
      low or non-measurable insulin levels. Two PET scan measurements will be taken in each subject&#xD;
      and the amount of VMAT2 in the pancreas will be and compared for reproducible findings.&#xD;
      Biochemical testing will also be performed and compared to PET scans as a potential indirect&#xD;
      marker of beta cell mass.&#xD;

      Diabetes results when the insulin secretory capacity of the beta cell population is lost or&#xD;
      severely compromised.Plasma insulin levels have been used as a surrogate marker of beta cell&#xD;
      mass (BCM) but insulin levels often do not correlate well. A &quot;gold standard of measurement&quot;&#xD;
      to obtain BCM would be of great value. The aim of the proposed study is to evaluate an islet&#xD;
      imaging technique using PET scanning to directly measure BCM and thus provide valuable&#xD;
      information for monitoring disease progress and response to therapy in people with diabetes&#xD;
      and in people at high risk for diabetes. Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) occurs when the beta cells&#xD;
      are selectively destroyed by a T cell mediated autoimmune process. People at high risk for&#xD;
      developing T1DM, such as first degree relatives of patients with T1DM, can sometimes be&#xD;
      identified before the disease develops by measuring autoantibodies to beta cells, however&#xD;
      this test is neither sensitive nor specific. Little is known about the natural history of&#xD;
      BCM, turnover and cell lifetime, or the course of inflammation in diabetes. This is&#xD;
      principally because the pancreas is a highly heterogeneous organ that is difficult to biopsy&#xD;
      without significant complications, and BCM only comprises 1 to 2% of the total volume.&#xD;
      Accurate assessment of BCM in human diabetes is limited to autopsy studies, which usually&#xD;
      suffer from inadequate clinical information; thus, the development of non-invasive means of&#xD;
      BCM measurement could be important for interventional therapies of T1DM, islet&#xD;
      regeneration/stem cell therapy and islet transplantation.&#xD;
