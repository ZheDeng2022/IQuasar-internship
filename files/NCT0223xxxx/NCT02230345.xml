  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The important role played by the GI tract microflora on the metabolic health of an individual&#xD;
      are increasingly recognized. In this respect, the initial studies of Metchinkoff that&#xD;
      suggested a role of fermented food (specifically yoghourts ) to modulate the gut microflora&#xD;
      have evolved into the concept of &quot;probiotics&quot;. Probiotics are living microorganisms that&#xD;
      bring a benefit to the host when administered in sufficient quantity (WHO/FAO, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here the investigators will study, in normal young male volunteers, the potential to modulate&#xD;
      post-prandial metabolic and inflammatory responses by the administration of a yoghourt&#xD;
      containing the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind and cross-over study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      potential of a probiotic (Lactobacillus rhamnosus) to modulate the post prandial metabolic&#xD;
      and inflammatory response of normale healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a wash out period during which volunteers will have to follow a diet devoid of all milk&#xD;
      or milk-derived products, they will receive, in random order, either a daily dose of the&#xD;
      probiotic, or a daily dose of acidified milk (control) for a total of three consecutive&#xD;
      weeks. At the end of each of these period, they will be submitted to a day of investigation,&#xD;
      during which their metabolic and inflammatory profile will be studied following the ingestion&#xD;
      of a standard test meal. The potential for the probiotic to modulate the metabolic and&#xD;
      inflammatory parameters will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test meal will provide 1004Kcal under the form of 45.4g proteins (17%), 69g total fatty&#xD;
      acids (62%), and 52.6g glucids (21%) as previously published (Schwander et al, J Nut 2014).&#xD;
