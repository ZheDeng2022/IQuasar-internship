  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the maternal and fetal outcomes of a new technique&#xD;
      for the fetoscopic repair of fetal MMC at Texas Children's Hospital Pavilion for Women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that this minimally invasive technique is feasible, and that&#xD;
      this approach will have the same efficacy as open fetal surgery for MMC, but with&#xD;
      significantly less maternal-fetal risk. Both mother and baby will benefit from the surgery.&#xD;
      The fetus will have a repaired MMC defect, and the mother will not have a uterine incision&#xD;
      (hysterotomy). A hysterotomy increases the risk of uterine rupture and requires that all&#xD;
      subsequent deliveries are by cesarean section. There may also be a decreased risk of Pre-term&#xD;
      Premature Rupture Of Membranes (PPROM) and prematurity when compared with the current open&#xD;
      operation. Finally, a vaginal delivery is possible following the fetoscopic fetal surgery if&#xD;
      the baby is shown to have a skin covered repair.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Spina bifida can be a devastating neurological congenital anomaly . It results from&#xD;
      incomplete closure of the neural tube between 22 and 28 embryological days. Its incidence is&#xD;
      approximately 1-2 per 1,000 births. It is considered the most common congenital anomaly of&#xD;
      the central nervous system that is compatible with life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The most frequent form is myelomeningocele (MMC), characterized by the extrusion of the&#xD;
           spinal cord into a sac filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and is associated with&#xD;
           lower limb paralysis and bowel and bladder dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The majority of MMCs can be diagnosed between 14 and 20 weeks of gestation. MMC is&#xD;
           associated with Chiari II malformation, which includes a constellation of anomalies such&#xD;
           as hindbrain herniation, brainstem abnormalities, low-lying venous sinuses and a small&#xD;
           posterior fossa.The Chiari II malformation can have deleterious effects on motor,&#xD;
           cranial nerve and cognitive functions. Postnatally most MMC patients develop&#xD;
           hydrocephalus and require a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Shunts require lifelong&#xD;
           monitoring and have a high failure rate due to infection, obstruction, and fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental studies using animal models have shown that prenatal coverage of a spina&#xD;
      bifida-like lesion can preserve neurological function and reduce or reverse hindbrain&#xD;
      herniation.These studies suggest a &quot;two-hit&quot; hypothesis in which the ultimate neurologic&#xD;
      deficit results from a combination of the failure of normal neural-tube closure (first hit)&#xD;
      with secondary spinal cord injury resulting from prolonged exposure of sensitive neural&#xD;
      elements to the amniotic fluid (second hit mechanism).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this hypothesis, open fetal surgical repair of MMC was proposed, and the recent&#xD;
      publication of the NICHD sponsored randomized controlled trial demonstrated clear neonatal&#xD;
      benefit of open in-utero fetal surgical repair of MMC. The study showed a reduction in the&#xD;
      incidence of hydrocephalus and in the radiographic severity of hindbrain herniation (relative&#xD;
      risk: 0.67; 95% confidence interval: 0.56-0.81).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open in-utero fetal surgery is not without risk and the NICHD study (MOMS Trial) showed an&#xD;
      elevation in maternal-fetal morbidity/risk when compared to the postnatally treated group,&#xD;
      including higher risk for chorioamniotic separation (26% vs. 0%, respectively), maternal&#xD;
      pulmonary edema (6% vs. 0%), oligohydramnios (21% vs. 0%), placental abruption (6% vs. 0%),&#xD;
      spontaneous membrane rupture (46%; RR: 6.15; 95% CI: 2.75-13.78), spontaneous labor (38%; RR:&#xD;
      2.80, 95%CI: 1.51-5.18), maternal blood transfusion (9%; RR: 7.18; 95%CI: 0.90-57.01), and&#xD;
      preterm delivery before 34 weeks (46%; RR: 9.2; 95%CI: 3.81-22.19). The reason for the&#xD;
      increased incidence of these complications is related to the nature of the open fetal&#xD;
      procedure, which involves a multi-faceted invasive approach including maternal laparotomy,&#xD;
      large hysterotomy with uterine edge stapling, and open fetal repair of the spina bifida&#xD;
      defect that may involve manipulation and exposure of the fetus for a significant amount of&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetal endoscopic surgery has progressed rapidly over the past decades and the investigators&#xD;
      are now able to perform a number of intricate procedures inside the uterus with specially&#xD;
      designed instruments. These procedures include laser therapy for Twin-twin-transfusion&#xD;
      syndrome, fetal cystoscopy and fulguration of posterior urethral valves, release of amniotic&#xD;
      bands, and placement of various shunts and balloons inside fetal structures and cavities&#xD;
      (peritoneal, pleural, cardiac, and trachea).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetoscopy offers a less invasive therapeutic option that could reduce a number of the&#xD;
      morbidities (both maternal and fetal) related to open fetal procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few animal studies and some clinical human experience with fetoscopic repair of MMC have&#xD;
      been reported showing the feasibility of covering the defect with a patch and sealant, or&#xD;
      even in performing a full repair. These repairs have been accomplished using at least two&#xD;
      (and sometimes more) entry ports through the uterine wall. Kohl et al. in Germany, have&#xD;
      demonstrated the feasibility of performing a complete percutaneous fetoscopic repair of MMC&#xD;
      using carbon dioxide to distend the uterus and provide a dry working area for the surgeon to&#xD;
      perform the repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These investigators described a two-layer covering technique using an absorbable patch&#xD;
      (Durasis, Cook, Germany) and sutures. However, while they showed that the procedure is&#xD;
      feasible, their percutaneous technique with complete two layer surgical closure of the defect&#xD;
      using sutures was associated with prolonged operative time and significant maternal and&#xD;
      obstetrical morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetoscopy in a CO2 gas filled uterus has been recently reported by groups in Bonn, Germany&#xD;
      (Kohl et al) and Sao Paulo, Brazil (Pedreira et al). The fetoscopic technique the&#xD;
      investigators use has been developed and tested in a fetal sheep model of MMC by the&#xD;
      investigators group and others (Peiro et al).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This fetoscopy technique has evolved over time to a 2-port technique developed by our team in&#xD;
      Houston, Texas and its feasibility and applicability to the human uterus and fetus have been&#xD;
      demonstrated and published (Belfort et al, 2017) and demonstrate an improved degree of&#xD;
      flexibility in terms of access to the fetus regardless of placental location. The technique&#xD;
      is designed to decrease the maternal risks of open uterus fetal surgery while maintaining a&#xD;
      similar level of fetal benefit as seen in the MOMS trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators technique employs an open abdomen/exteriorized (but closed) uterus&#xD;
      methodology that allows the minimally invasive multi-layer closure of the fetal neural tube&#xD;
      using the same closed skin repair currently employed at Baylor College of Medicine/Texas&#xD;
      Children's Fetal Center using the open uterus approach. The technique employs a novel&#xD;
      approach to low pressure uterine distention using the same carbon dioxide gas 8-12 mmHg that&#xD;
      others attempting fetoscopic repair have used, but employing a much lower gas flow rate and&#xD;
      pressure. In addition, our technique (as compared with the percutaneous method) allows&#xD;
      improved access to the fetus in anterior placentation, ability to manipulate and maintain the&#xD;
      fetus in the required position, and optimal port placement resulting from the exteriorized&#xD;
      maternal uterus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, because of the exteriorized uterus and the optimal placement this allows, we&#xD;
      require only two access ports and these can be sutured into the uterus allowing a closed seal&#xD;
      and minimizing gas leakage. The use of humidified, warmed CO2, which we pioneered in fetal&#xD;
      surgery, decreases membrane disruption and may prolong gestation without rupture of the&#xD;
      membranes. Finally, recent advances in miniature surgical instruments (Storz 1.5 - 3mm&#xD;
      surgical sets) allow unprecedented flexibility which enables a full surgical repair to be&#xD;
      performed via a fetoscopic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preparation for the human trial we were able to perform, in a sheep model, dual access&#xD;
      port fetoscopic neural tube closure using a 12 F cannula, a second 9F cannula, a cover patch,&#xD;
      and a medical sealant with similar results to that seen with open fetal surgical repair in&#xD;
      the same sheep model.26&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have now completed almost 50 cases using our 2 port exteriorized technique with results&#xD;
      that are reflect our initial hypothesis (Belfort et al , 2017). As with any technique there&#xD;
      have been advances in instrumentation and technique and the study is ongoing investigating&#xD;
      the multilayer closure technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, the repair of the open neural tube defect will follow the same principles&#xD;
      as we use in open repairs currently being done at this institution. This involves release of&#xD;
      the placode, dissection of the surrounding skin and attempted primary closure of the defect&#xD;
      using a Durepair patch, a muscle or duro-fascial flap, and available skin. In those cases&#xD;
      where we are able to complete the procedure with full skin closure of the defect, the only&#xD;
      difference between the open uterus procedure and the fetoscopic procedure, will be that the&#xD;
      surgery will be done fetoscopically rather than through an open uterine incision. If we are&#xD;
      unable to close the skin primarily despite best fetoscopic efforts, the option of&#xD;
      performing/completing the repair as an open procedure exists and will be offered to the&#xD;
      patient. The patient is monitored in hospital until ready for discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 6 weeks after the surgery a post-procedure fetal MRI will be performed. If&#xD;
      there is evidence of good closure of the neural tube defect and reversal of the Chiari II&#xD;
      malformation, a vaginal delivery can be attempted based on obstetric criteria. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed in person every 3-4 months after birth to 12 months at the Spina Bifida Clinic at&#xD;
      TCH. Remaining visits will be yearly up to 5 years. If this is not possible, questionnaire(s)&#xD;
      will be mailed to the child's parents and records will be requested from the treating&#xD;
      neurosurgeon on this same schedule.&#xD;
