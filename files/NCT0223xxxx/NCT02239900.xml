  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of ipilimumab&#xD;
      and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The safety and effectiveness of these&#xD;
      treatments given consecutively will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. SBRT is FDA approved for the control of metastatic and&#xD;
      primary tumors. Ipilimumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma that cannot be removed with surgery. The use of SBRT with ipilimumab is&#xD;
      investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 120 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants on this study are enrolled into Phase 1 (Dose De-Escalation, or Dose-Finding) or&#xD;
      Phase 2 (Dose Expansion), based on when they join the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Dose De-Escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 5&#xD;
      groups based on the type of disease you have.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Groups 1 or 3, you will receive SBRT and 1 dose of ipilimumab within a few&#xD;
           days after your SBRT treatment, and then you will receive 3 more doses of ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Groups 2, 4, or 5, you will receive 2 doses of ipilimumab, SBRT, and then&#xD;
           2 more doses of ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 5, SBRT will be given over a longer period of time (more days or weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose level of ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a separate consent form explaining SBRT and its risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each group, 3 participants will be enrolled at the first dose level. If no more than 1&#xD;
      participant has intolerable side effects, up to 3 more participants will be enrolled at that&#xD;
      dose level. If no intolerable side effects are seen at that dose level, that is considered&#xD;
      the highest tolerated dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If enough intolerable side effects are seen at the assigned dose level, the total dose amount&#xD;
      of radiation given in any group may be lowered up to 2 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Dose Expansion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerated dose combination is found in each study group, up to 14 more&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled at that dose level combination in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Groups 1 or 3 (early ipilimumab and SBRT), you will receive ipilimumab by vein&#xD;
      over about 90 minutes on Day 1 of all cycles. You will also receive SBRT over about 30-45&#xD;
      minutes on Days 1-4 of Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Groups 2 or 4 (late ipilimumab and SBRT), you will receive ipilimumab by vein&#xD;
      over about 90 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2 and then SBRT on Days 29-33. After your SBRT&#xD;
      treatment, you will take ipilimumab on Day 1 of Cycles 3 and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 5 (late ipilimumab and SBRT), you will receive ipilimumab on Day 1 of&#xD;
      Cycle 1 and SBRT over about 30-45 minutes on Days 1-5 and Days 9-12 of Cycle 1. After your&#xD;
      SBRT treatment, you will take ipilimumab on Day 1 of Cycles 2-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects and to help&#xD;
      support your immune system. You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs&#xD;
      are given and their risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 1 of all cycles and Week 2 of Cycle 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 3 of Cycles 2 and 4, you will have an MRI, CT scan, and/or PET/CT scan to check&#xD;
      the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Phase 2, during Week 3 of each cycle, blood (about 2 teaspoons) may be drawn&#xD;
      for biomarker testing, if the doctor thinks it is safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may have a chest scan if the doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive up to 4 cycles of treatment with ipilimumab and SBRT. About 8 weeks after you&#xD;
      have completed Cycle 4, if the size of the tumor does not change or it gets smaller while you&#xD;
      are receiving therapy, you may be able to continue to receive ipilimumab and/or radiation.&#xD;
      The study doctor will discuss this option with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will no longer be able to receive treatment if the disease gets worse, if intolerable&#xD;
      side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after you have completed the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 days after your last dose of ipilimumab and then every 3 months after that for up to&#xD;
      2 years, you will come to the clinic for follow-up visits. At these visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight..&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) may be drawn for biomarker testing, if the doctor thinks it is&#xD;
           safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an MRI, CT scan, and/or PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;

             epo-ProveraR) started at least 3 months before joining the study, plus a barrier&#xD;
             method, or Double-barrier method, such as a condom when used in combination with a&#xD;
