  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed translational study is to test a model, based upon basic&#xD;
      science studies, exploring multisystem impairments in PTSD including endocannabinoid (eCB)&#xD;
      and glucocorticoids in the modulation of fear memories by examining the cannabinoid type 1&#xD;
      (CB1) receptor in a PTSD fear circuit as well as glucocorticoid function. The investigators&#xD;
      propose that impaired eCB signaling in PTSD resulting in the maladaptive neurobehavioral&#xD;
      response to the stressor is associated with an upregulation of the CB1 receptors and&#xD;
      insufficient glucocorticoid signaling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The eCB - anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) - and their attending cannabinoid (CB)&#xD;
      receptors which are found in high densities in a fear circuitry involving the amygdala,&#xD;
      hippocampus, the anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex serve important functions in&#xD;
      the regulation of stress-coping behaviors. Besides eCB regulation there is strong evidence&#xD;
      from ongoing research of the investigators group and others suggesting an important role for&#xD;
      glucocorticoid signaling as an endpoint of the biochemical sequelae initiated by stressful or&#xD;
      aversive stimuli. One of the long-term research goals of our lab is to understand such&#xD;
      functions and determine their relevance to the pathogenesis of PTSD and to provide a more&#xD;
      integrative view on neurobiological mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of the&#xD;
      neuroadaptive response to stress. The objective of the proposed translational study is to&#xD;
      test a model, based upon basic science studies, exploring multisystem impairments in PTSD&#xD;
      including eCB and glucocorticoids in the modulation of fear memories by examining the CB1&#xD;
      receptor in a PTSD fear circuit as well as glucocorticoid function. The investigators propose&#xD;
      that impaired eCB signaling in PTSD resulting in the maladaptive neurobehavioral response to&#xD;
      the stressor is associated with an upregulation of the CB1 receptors and insufficient&#xD;
      glucocorticoid signaling.&#xD;

    <measure>Volume of distribution (VT) of cerebral CB1 receptor expression in PTSD and controls within a fear circuit of brain regions that regulate stress-related behaviors using the CB1 radioligand carbon - 11 (11C) [11C]OMAR and PET.</measure>

    <description>To examine group differences in cerebral CB1 receptor expression in PTSD and controls within a fear circuit of cortical and subcortical brain regions that regulate stress-related behaviors using the CB1 radioligand [11C]OMAR and PET.&#xD;
Hypothesis: PTSD patients will show greater [11C]OMAR VT (i.e. CB1 binding) values than both control groups, trauma-exposed and non-trauma exposed control subjects who will not be different.</description>
