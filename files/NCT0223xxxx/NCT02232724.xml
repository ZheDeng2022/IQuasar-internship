    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is currently the leading newly diagnosed cancer in the industrialized world.&#xD;
      Treatment of prostate cancer is highly dependent on the stage of the disease. Current methods&#xD;
      for staging of bone metastases are known to be inaccurate. Staging of lymph nodes requires&#xD;
      surgery associated with risk of bleeding etc. Prior studies from our department suggest that&#xD;
      PET/CT is useful in staging of bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to compare the usefulness of Dual time point FDG PET/CT with current methods&#xD;
      for the staging of bone and lymph node metastases in patients with newly diagnosed prostate&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Better initial staging will result in better treatment of the individual patient. If we are&#xD;
      able to develop a more accurate and non-invasive method of staging patients with undetected&#xD;
      metastases on current staging will be spared of the side-effects associated with current&#xD;
      treatment and staging- impotence, incontinence, radiation damage, bleeding, infection etc.&#xD;

      1. Introduction. Cancer of the prostate (PCa) is currently the leading newly diagnosed&#xD;
           cancer and the second most common cause of cancer deaths among men in the industrialized&#xD;
           world . In Denmark alone more than 4000 men are yearly diagnosed with PCa . As PCa&#xD;
           primarily affects elderly patients, one can assume that PCa will become one of the most&#xD;
           important medical issues in the developed world due to the already high incidence&#xD;
           combined with a growing population of elderly men.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aetiology of the disease is not well understood. In its most common form PCa evolves&#xD;
           from the glandular tissue of the prostate. Metastatic spread will most commonly happen&#xD;
           as lymphogenous spread to the regional lymph nodes or as haematogenous spread to the red&#xD;
           bone marrow .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intended curative treatment of PCa is associated with considerable side effects, in&#xD;
           particular incontinence, impotence and radiation damage to the surrounding tissues.&#xD;
           Furthermore, over 30% of patients with organ-confined disease, which was treated with&#xD;
           radical prostatectomy, will have biochemical relapse within 10 years . Relapse may be&#xD;
           due to local recurrent disease suggesting poor surgical quality or poor initial staging&#xD;
           with undetected metastases at the time of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At diagnosis patients are stratified as having low, intermediary or high risk of&#xD;
           dissieminatio according to D'Amico. Patients with intermediate or high risk of&#xD;
           dissemination will be examined further with whole-body bone scintigraphy (WBS) and&#xD;
           pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background. 2.1. Current staging and limitations. WBS has been the examination of choice&#xD;
           for evaluation of potential dissemination to bone. WBS utilizes 99mTc-labeled methylene&#xD;
           diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP) that binds to the bone matrix formed by the osteoblasts. Gamma&#xD;
           cameras detect the Î³-radiation emitted by the decaying tracer thereby creating a&#xD;
           2-dimensional image depicting local osteoblast activity .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Several limitations apply to the use of WBS in staging of patients with PCa. Sensitivity&#xD;
           has reported as low as 39% in lesion-based analysis in patients with a low number of&#xD;
           lesions . This combines with a low sensitivity due to many equivocal lesions caused by&#xD;
           other bone pathology than metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sensitivity and specificity is improved by the use of single-photon emission computed&#xD;
           tomography (SPECT), where the same tracer as with WBS is used to generate a&#xD;
           three-dimensional image using a rotating gamma camera. This method also gives better&#xD;
           anatomical information on the exact position of a potential metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The examination of choice for the evaluation of potential metastases to lymph nodes is&#xD;
           extended PLND . This procedure is done either prior to radiotherapy or during&#xD;
           prostatectomy in patients with intermediate or high risk of dissemination. The optimal&#xD;
           extent of the dissection is debated. The extended PLND performed at our institution&#xD;
           includes the nodes in the obturator fossa, the nodes over the external iliac artery and&#xD;
           vein, the nodes around the internal iliac artery and the nodes along the common iliac&#xD;
           artery up to the crossing of the ureter. This dissection is assumed to include&#xD;
           approximately 75% of lymph nodes known to harbor primary prostatic lymph node metastases&#xD;
           . Extended PLND is surgically demanding with risk of lymphocele formation, infectious&#xD;
           complications and severe bleeding due the lymph nodes' close proximity to the large&#xD;
           vessels in the pelvis. All in all extended PLND is perhaps the best option for lymph&#xD;
           node staging of PCa but it cannot be considered as optimal due to the above-mentioned&#xD;
           issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Positron Emission Tomography combined with&#xD;
           Computerized Tomography (PET/CT) is a well-established tool in diagnosing and staging of&#xD;
           several types of cancer . PET is an imaging technique where pairs of gamma rays emitted&#xD;
           by positron-emitting radionuclide tracer are detected, producing a three-dimensional&#xD;
           image of tracer concentration based on the amount of gamma rays emitted. The radioactive&#xD;
           tracer is coupled to a biologically active molecule depending on the organ or metabolic&#xD;
           process of interest . These images can then be fused with CT to create a combined&#xD;
           functional and high-resolution anatomical image. Several tracers have been developed for&#xD;
           use in cancer diagnostics and staging. As of now, PET/CT has no generally accepted role&#xD;
           in the diagnosing or staging of PCa neither in Europe nor in the US .&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.1 Choline. Choline is a precursor for phosphatidylcholine, a phospholipid that is&#xD;
           integrated in the cell membrane making it a marker for cell membrane turnover and&#xD;
           metabolism . 11C-Choline was first used as a PET tracer in 1997 . Since then many&#xD;
           studies have been performed with 11C-Choline and later 18F-Choline (FCH) having&#xD;
           approximately the same properties as 11C-Choline, but with a longer half-life (110 min&#xD;
           vs. 20 min) making it more versatile in every-day use. A recent study from our&#xD;
           department tested the use of FCH-PET/CT in detecting lymph node metastasis in 210&#xD;
           patients with PCa . The study concluded that FCH-PET/CT was not ideally suited for lymph&#xD;
           node staging but could give additional information about bone metastasis. Several other&#xD;
           investigators have also implied this , . A likely reason for the better detection of&#xD;
           metastasis to the bone is that bone metastasis in an early stage is actually bone-marrow&#xD;
           metastases rather than bone matrix metastasis and that it most likely that bone-marrow&#xD;
           metastases proceed to bone matrix metastases. These will not be detectable by WBS (and&#xD;
           probably not by CT and MRI either). Larger prospective series on the use of FCH-PET/CT&#xD;
           for imaging of bone metastasis in PCa-patients have not yet been produced.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.2 FDG. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most common PET-tracer used in more than&#xD;
           95% of oncologic PET studies. FDG is a metabolic tracer depicting cellular glucose&#xD;
           uptake, which is increased in cancer, inflammation and other conditions with a rapid&#xD;
           cellular turnover. It is trapped inside the cells depending on the presence and activity&#xD;
           of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which appear to be decreased in proportion to the&#xD;
           aggressiveness of the individual malignancy. Increased cellular FDG accumulation is,&#xD;
           therefore, not specific for malignancies, but at the same time an indicator of the&#xD;
           degree of malignancy, which may cover the entire spectrum ranging from insignificant and&#xD;
           non-aggressive to highly aggressive and rapidly metastasizing PCa FDG-PET imaging for&#xD;
           PCa has been intensively investigated, but so far without convincing success. The&#xD;
           reasons are several. Well-differentiated PCa's utilizes less glucose than other tumors&#xD;
           in general and thus may give rise to results considered false negative. Moreover, since&#xD;
           surplus radioactive FDG is excreted through the kidneys, intense accumulation in the&#xD;
           ureteres and urine bladder may hamper interpretation of the prostate gland and nearby&#xD;
           regional lymph nodes .&#xD;
&#xD;
           However, this does not necessarily mean that FDG is a poor tracer for imaging PCa. In&#xD;
           fact, it may be a very useful one, if considering several factors not taken into account&#xD;
           in the past. The traditional acquisition time point one hour after administration of&#xD;
           tracer may not be the ideal one. This time point is entirely arbitrary. The increase in&#xD;
           FDG accumulation seems to take place for several hours after administration in malignant&#xD;
           tissue, whereas FDG accumulation in normal or inflamed tissue may reach a maximal uptake&#xD;
           at an earlier time point . Thus, late imaging may result in increased FDG accumulation&#xD;
           and decreased blood and urine background and, therefore, a much better signal-to-noise&#xD;
           ratio and subsequently better results. A recent review on the use of dual-point&#xD;
           acquisition demonstrated an increased specificity and sensitivity for the detection of&#xD;
           several malignancies . The use of dual time point FDG-PET/CT in staging of PCa has not&#xD;
           been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Trial objective. To evaluate the diagnostic value of Dual time point-PET/CT in detecting&#xD;
           bone and lymph node metastases in 30 patients with newly diagnosed PCa&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Method. Patients included in this study will have Choline PET/CT perfomed as part of&#xD;
           another study. In addition a dual time point FDG-PET/CT will be performed. The&#xD;
           FDP-PET/CT will be performed with acquisition 1 and 3 hours after administration of&#xD;
           tracer. All scans are performed in random order within three weeks and the images&#xD;
           interpreted by a specialist in nuclear medicine and a specialist in radiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Images are interpreted based on visual evaluation with supplementary measurements of SUV.&#xD;
      Activity in lymph nodes will be recorded according to their location - external iliac vein,&#xD;
      obturator fossa and internal iliac artery and vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During extended PLND the tissue from the above mentioned stations will be removed and placed&#xD;
      in separate containers marked as followed - &quot;Iliaca externa dxt&quot;, &quot;Iliaca externa sin&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;Fossa obturatorius dxt&quot;, &quot;Fossa obturatorius sin&quot;, &quot;Iliaca interna dxt&quot; and &quot;Iliaca interna&#xD;
      sin&quot; Experts in pathology will examine the tissue samples. Results of PET/CT will not be&#xD;
      available to the pathologist.&#xD;
