      This is an open label, multi-center, multi-arm, dose-escalation study of BBI608 administered&#xD;
      in combination with either Gemcitabine and nab-Paclitaxel, mFOLFIRINOX, FOLFIRI, or MM-398&#xD;
      with 5-FU and leucovorin. A study cycle will consist of daily and continuous oral&#xD;
      administration of BBI608 for four weeks (28 days) in combination with Gemcitabine and&#xD;
      nab-Paclitaxel, mFOLFIRINOX, FOLFIRI, or MM-398 with 5-FU and leucovorin. Combination&#xD;
      treatment will continue in 28 day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      another discontinuation criterion is met. BBI608 may be continued post-progression if the&#xD;
      patient is obtaining potential clinical benefit, in the opinion of the investigator. If&#xD;
      administration of Gemcitabine and/or nab-Paclitaxel, mFOLFIRINOX, FOLFIRI, or MM-398 with&#xD;
      5-FU and leucovorin is discontinued due to chemotherapy backbone-related toxicities, the&#xD;
      administration of BBI608 can be continued.&#xD;
