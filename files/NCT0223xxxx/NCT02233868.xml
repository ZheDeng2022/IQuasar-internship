    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Brain inflammation due to high alcohol intake may affect thinking, memory, and&#xD;
      concentration. Researchers want to measure this using positron emission tomography (PET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study how excessive alcohol consumption affects brain function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults 30-75 years old who are moderate or severe alcohol drinkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, interview, and blood&#xD;
           and urine tests. Their breath will be tested for alcohol and recent smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will stay in the hospital 3 days. They will have blood and heart tests and&#xD;
           daily urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A small plastic tube will be inserted by needle in each arm. One will go in a vein, the&#xD;
           other in an artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 2 PET scans with 2 different radioactive compounds. Participants&#xD;
           will lie on a bed that slides in and out of the scanner with a cap on their head.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Participants will lie in&#xD;
           the scanner either resting with their eyes open or while performing an attention task.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have tests of memory, attention, concentration, and thinking. They may&#xD;
           answer questions, take tests, and perform simple actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2 of the study will only be done if Phase 1 results show brain inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2 will repeat Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For healthy volunteers, Phase 2 will begin 3 weeks after Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other volunteers must not have alcohol for at least 3 weeks and stay in a hospital up to&#xD;
           4-6 weeks between Phase 1 and Phase 2. After Phase 2, they will have 5 follow-up calls&#xD;
           over 3 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The abuse of high doses of alcohol is associated with cognitive impairment that in extreme&#xD;
      cases can result in dementia. However, the mechanisms underlying the neurotoxic effects of&#xD;
      alcohol to the human brain are poorly understood. Here we test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      alcohol-induced neuroinflammation contributes to its neurotoxic effects in humans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objectives in Phase I are to assess if there is inflammation in the&#xD;
      brain of alcoholics and if present to determine if it recovers after at least 3 weeks of&#xD;
      abstinence as compared between groups (alcoholic vs. healthy volunteers). Phase II objectives&#xD;
      are to assess between group differences in inflammation in the brain of AUD subjects who&#xD;
      either abstain from alcohol for at least 3 weeks or relapse (continue to drink alcohol) for&#xD;
      at least 3 weeks. Secondary outcomes are to evaluate the functional consequences of&#xD;
      inflammation as assessed by: regional brain glucose metabolism, functional brain activation&#xD;
      to cognitive tasks, structural brain imaging, resting functional connectivity and&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Participants diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (AUD) as per DSM IV or DSM&#xD;
      5 AUD and healthy controls. Males and females ages 30-75 will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This study has two phases (phase I and II). The two phases can be done as inpatient&#xD;
      (AUD subjects) or as outpatient (AUD and healthy controls) over a 2-3 day period. In phase I&#xD;
      participants will undergo two positron emission tomography (PET) scans, one with [11C]PBR28&#xD;
      (marker of neuroinflammation) and one with 18FDG (marker of brain glucose metabolism) and&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to assess brain structure, functional reactivity and&#xD;
      functional connectivity. In parallel we will perform neuropsychological tests (NP). Phase II&#xD;
      will include the same procedures as Phase I but it will be done at least 3 weeks later over a&#xD;
      2-3 day period only in AUD participants who successfully completed phase I who either&#xD;
      abstained from alcohol or relapsed/continued to drink alcohol after Phase I. Relapsers would&#xD;
      be eligible for Phase II if they continued to drink for at least 3 weeks prior scheduled&#xD;
      imaging studies. We will complete Phase II studies on up to 24 additional AUD subjects (n=12&#xD;
      abstainers and n=12 relapsers) to assess whether [11C]PBR28 uptake recovers after abstinence.&#xD;
      Since there are not much differences between test/retest studies in healthy volunteers in the&#xD;
      literature [1], there is no need to complete Phase II studies in controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome parameters: Main outcome measure is to assess if there is neuroinflammation with&#xD;
      alcoholism and if it recovers with detoxification. Secondary outcome measures are: to assess&#xD;
      if neuroinflammation is associated with markers of brain function, which include (1) regional&#xD;
      brain glucose metabolism; (2) MRI based voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess cortical&#xD;
      atrophy; (3) blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activation to a cognitive task, (4)&#xD;
      brain functional connectivity, (5) myo-inositol (mI) concentration, and (6) NP testing to&#xD;
      assess cognitive performance, and to evaluate if neuroinflammation predicts relapse in AUD&#xD;
      over a 3 month follow-up period.&#xD;
