  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is considerable variation in the incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA)&#xD;
      across Europe. The likelihood of attempted resuscitation also varies. To better understand&#xD;
      the factors that contribute to variation, more data on incidence, management and outcomes&#xD;
      from OHCA is required. A European, multi-centre study provides the opportunity to uncover&#xD;
      differences throughout Europe and may help find explanations for these differences. Results&#xD;
      may also have potential to support the development of quality benchmarking between European&#xD;
      Emergency Medical Services (EMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective European study will involve 27 different countries. It provides a common&#xD;
      Utstein-based dataset, data collection methodology and a common data collection period for&#xD;
      all participants, thereby potentially increasing comparability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study research questions will address the following: OHCA incidence in different European&#xD;
      regions; incidence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) attempted; initial presenting&#xD;
      rhythm in patients where bystanders or EMS starts CPR or any other resuscitation&#xD;
      intervention; rate of any return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC); patient status at&#xD;
      handover to a hospital i.e. ROSC, ongoing CPR, dead; incidence of patients still alive 30&#xD;
      days after OHCA; incidence of patients discharged alive from hospital.&#xD;

      The participating registries will transfer unprocessed anonymised data. Transmission of&#xD;
      aggregated data should be avoided whenever possible; only in case of limitations due to&#xD;
      national laws or ethical requirements should a participating registry transmit aggregated&#xD;
      data. Every single case requires a data sheet (DS). Data will be collected within the&#xD;
      national, regional or local participating registries (either as a computer-based export from&#xD;
      the national, regional or local registry or as a paper-based DS. After validation and&#xD;
      anonymisation of data by participating registries the data will then be transferred only via&#xD;
      the national coordinator (computer-based) to the study centre. National coordinators are&#xD;
      responsible for quality control i.e. the completeness reliability and accuracy of the of&#xD;
      data, including timely submission of data to the study management group. Every DS will be&#xD;
      identified by a unique number, including the country and region of origin. Registries that&#xD;
      cannot transfer unprocessed original data due to the reasons mentioned above will collect&#xD;
      data themselves. These registries will then send aggregated data to the study centre.&#xD;
      Participating registries must collect basic EMS data on the region and population served.&#xD;
      This registry-specific information must only be transmitted once during the study period.&#xD;
      Data (computer and paper-based) will be handled according to national laws concerning data&#xD;
      security; the national coordinator is responsible for maintaining the necessary standards.&#xD;
      Access to the data will be protected by username and password.&#xD;
