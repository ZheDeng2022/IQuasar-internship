    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is currently the leading newly diagnosed cancer in the industrialized world.&#xD;
      Treatment of prostate cancer is highly dependent on the stage of the disease. Current methods&#xD;
      for staging of bone metastases are known to be inaccurate. Staging of lymph nodes requires&#xD;
      surgery associated with risk of bleeding etc. Prior studies from our department suggest that&#xD;
      PET/CT is useful in staging of bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to compare the usefulness of MeAIB PET/CT with current methods for the staging&#xD;
      of bone and lymph node metastases in patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Better initial staging will result in better treatment of the individual patient. If we are&#xD;
      able to develop a more accurate and non-invasive method of staging patients with undetected&#xD;
      metastases on current staging will be spared of the side-effects associated with current&#xD;
      treatment and staging- impotence, incontinence, radiation damage, bleeding, infection etc.&#xD;

      1. Introduction. Cancer of the prostate (PCa) is currently the leading newly diagnosed&#xD;
           cancer and the second most common cause of cancer deaths among men in the industrialized&#xD;
           world . In Denmark alone more than 4000 men are yearly diagnosed with PCa . As PCa&#xD;
           primarily affects elderly patients, one can assume that PCa will become one of the most&#xD;
           important medical issues in the developed world due to the already high incidence&#xD;
           combined with a growing population of elderly men.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aetiology of the disease is not well understood. In its most common form PCa evolves&#xD;
           from the glandular tissue of the prostate. Metastatic spread will most commonly happen&#xD;
           as lymphogenous spread to the regional lymph nodes or as haematogenous spread to the red&#xD;
           bone marrow .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intended curative treatment of PCa is associated with considerable side effects, in&#xD;
           particular incontinence, impotence and radiation damage to the surrounding tissues.&#xD;
           Furthermore, over 30% of patients with organ-confined disease, which was treated with&#xD;
           radical prostatectomy, will have biochemical relapse within 10 years . Relapse may be&#xD;
           due to local recurrent disease suggesting poor surgical quality or poor initial staging&#xD;
           with undetected metastases at the time of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At diagnosis patients are stratified as having low, intermediary or high risk of&#xD;
           dissieminatio according to D'Amico . Patients with intermediate or high risk of&#xD;
           dissemination will be examined further with whole-body bone scintigraphy (WBS) and&#xD;
           pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. Current staging and limitations. WBS has been the examination of choice for&#xD;
           evaluation of potential dissemination to bone. WBS utilizes 99mTc-labeled methylene&#xD;
           diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP) that binds to the bone matrix formed by the osteoblasts. Gamma&#xD;
           cameras detect the γ-radiation emitted by the decaying tracer thereby creating a&#xD;
           2-dimentional image depicting local osteoblast activity .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Several limitations apply to the use of WBS in staging of patients with PCa. Sensitivity&#xD;
           has reported as low as 39% in lesion-based analysis in patients with a low number of&#xD;
           lesions . This combines with a low sensitivity due to many equivocal lesions caused by&#xD;
           other bone pathology than metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sensitivity and specificity is improved by the use of single-photon emission computed&#xD;
           tomography (SPECT), where the same tracer as with WBS is used to generate a&#xD;
           three-dimensional image using a rotating gamma camera. This method also gives better&#xD;
           anatomical information on the exact position of a potential metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The examination of choice for the evaluation of potential metastases to lymph nodes is&#xD;
           extended PLND . This procedure is done either prior to radiotherapy or during&#xD;
           prostatectomy in patients with intermediate or high risk of dissemination. The optimal&#xD;
           extent of the dissection is debated. The extended PLND performed at our institution&#xD;
           includes the nodes in the obturator fossa, the nodes over the external iliac artery and&#xD;
           vein, the nodes around the internal iliac artery and the nodes along the common iliac&#xD;
           artery up to the crossing of the ureter. This dissection is assumed to include&#xD;
           approximately 75% of lymph nodes known to harbor primary prostatic lymph node metastases&#xD;
           . Extended PLND is surgically demanding with risk of lymphocele formation, infectious&#xD;
           complications and severe bleeding due the lymph nodes' close proximity to the large&#xD;
           vessels in the pelvis. All in all extended PLND is perhaps the best option for lymph&#xD;
           node staging of PCa but it cannot be considered as optimal due to the above-mentioned&#xD;
           issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Positron Emission Tomography combined with&#xD;
           Computerized Tomography (PET/CT) is a well-established tool in diagnosing and staging of&#xD;
           several types of cancer . PET is an imaging technique where pairs of gamma rays emitted&#xD;
           by positron-emitting radionuclide tracer are detected, producing a three-dimensional&#xD;
           image of tracer concentration based on the amount of gamma rays emitted. The radioactive&#xD;
           tracer is coupled to a biologically active molecule depending on the organ or metabolic&#xD;
           process of interest . These images can then be fused with CT to create a combined&#xD;
           functional and high-resolution anatomical image. Several tracers have been developed for&#xD;
           use in cancer diagnostics and staging. As of now, PET/CT has no generally accepted role&#xD;
           in the diagnosing or staging of PCa neither in Europe nor in the US .&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.1 Choline. Choline is a precursor for phosphatidylcholine, a phospholipid that is&#xD;
           integrated in the cell membrane making it a marker for cell membrane turnover and&#xD;
           metabolism . 11C-Choline was first used as a PET tracer in 1997 . Since then many&#xD;
           studies have been performed with 11C-Choline and later 18F-Choline (FCH) having&#xD;
           approximately the same properties as 11C-Choline, but with a longer half-life (110 min&#xD;
           vs. 20 min) making it more versatile in every-day use. A recent study from our&#xD;
           department tested the use of FCH-PET/CT in detecting lymph node metastasis in 210&#xD;
           patients with PCa . The study concluded that FCH-PET/CT was not ideally suited for lymph&#xD;
           node staging but could give additional information about bone metastasis. Several other&#xD;
           investigators have also implied this , . A likely reason for the better detection of&#xD;
           metastasis to the bone is that bone metastasis in an early stage is actually bone-marrow&#xD;
           metastases rather than bone matrix metastasis and that it most likely that bone-marrow&#xD;
           metastases proceed to bone matrix metastases. These will not be detectable by WBS (and&#xD;
           probably not by CT and MRI either). Larger prospective series on the use of FCH-PET/CT&#xD;
           for imaging of bone metastasis in PCa-patients have not yet been produced.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.2 MeAIB. α-(N-methyl-11C)-methylaminobutyric acid (MeAIB) is an amino acid analog&#xD;
           that concentrates into cells only via the System A amino acid transport system, which&#xD;
           has been shown to be highly upregulated in malignant cells making it a potential target&#xD;
           for oncological imaging . The tracer has been developed by our local chief radiochemist&#xD;
           and studies on biodistribution and dosimetry conclude that MeAIB is a tracer usable in&#xD;
           humans with radiation doses lower than other used PET-tracers , . Clinical studies on&#xD;
           the use of MeAIB-PET/CT in oncology are sparse , . The use of MeAIB-PET/CT in PCa has&#xD;
           not been investigated. Unpublished data suggests that MeAIB could prove useful in&#xD;
           diagnosing PCa because of a high uptake in prostatic tumors . Due to the short half-life&#xD;
           of 11C (20 min.) an onsite cyclotron is required for performing the study, and thus this&#xD;
           is possible in Odense.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Trial objective. To evaluate the diagnostic value of MeAIB-PET/CT in detecting bone and&#xD;
           lymph node metastases in 30 patients with newly diagnosed PCa&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Method. Patients included will have a choline-PET/CT perfomed as part of another&#xD;
           project. In addition a MeAIB-PET/CT will be performed. The MeAIB PET/CT is performed&#xD;
           with a single acquisition 1 hour after injection of tracer. All scans are performed in&#xD;
           random order within three weeks and the images interpreted by a specialist in nuclear&#xD;
           medicine and a specialist in radiology. Images are interpreted based on visual&#xD;
           evaluation with supplementary measurements of SUV. Activity in lymph nodes will be&#xD;
           recorded according to their location - external iliac vein, obturator fossa and internal&#xD;
           iliac artery and vein.&#xD;
