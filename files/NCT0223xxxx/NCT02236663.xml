  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intimate partner violence (IPV), including violence in dating relationships (dating violence,&#xD;
      DV) is a widespread and serious public health problem. Among U.S. female IPV survivors, 47.1%&#xD;
      report their first abusive relationship occurred at college age (age 18-24). Similarly, in&#xD;
      national surveys, adults respondents 18-24 years of age report the highest rate of stalking&#xD;
      victimization, most commonly by a former intimate partner. Safety planning is the most widely&#xD;
      used intervention to prevent and respond to IPV, yet the vast majority of abused women never&#xD;
      access safety planning services. Our challenge is to increase college women's access to&#xD;
      safety planning, with the opportunity to consider their unique safety priorities and level of&#xD;
      danger during and when ending an abusive relationship. In addition, while &quot;bystander&quot;&#xD;
      interventions that train peers to safely intervene have been shown to be effective in sexual&#xD;
      assault prevention on campus, and college women in abusive relationships most frequently&#xD;
      disclose IPV to a friend, no similar interventions have been tested with friends for IPV&#xD;
      response on campuses. Therefore, the objective of the study is to evaluate the:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. effectiveness of an interactive, personalized smart phone and web based safety&#xD;
           application (&quot;App&quot;) intervention in Maryland and Oregon with: 1) college women (age&#xD;
           18-24) who experience IPV and 2) friends (age 18-24) of women experiencing IPV. The&#xD;
           safety decision App allows the user to enter information on: a) relationship health; b)&#xD;
           safety priorities; and c) severity of violence/danger in relationship. The App then uses&#xD;
           the information to provide the user with a personalized safety planning information and&#xD;
           resources; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. dissemination of the App nationally to determine the reach, adoption, implementation and&#xD;
           maintenance of App use among university/college students.&#xD;

    <description>The DCS consists of twelve items, with each question having three response options (yes, no, and unsure). The DCS provides a total score, which is a measure of the decision process, as well as scores for four subscales (feeling informed, certainty about decision, values clarity, and support), with higher scores on the DCS indicating a greater degree of decisional conflict (indicative of a poorer decision process). Will be used to assess decisional conflict with survivors and friends.</description>

    <description>Setting of priorities for safety: participants will establish priorities by making pairwise comparisons of importance between 5 factors.&#xD;
Danger Assessment: asks participants to report on well-established risk factors for repeat violence and lethal IPV. A weighted scoring algorithm provides participants with their validated level of danger and safety planning information and resources based on their level of danger.&#xD;
Personalized action plan: Based on a participant's answers to the previous sections, a list of safety strategies with links to resources will be presented tailored to their level of danger and priority settings. The participant is given the option to print results and the personalized plan.</description>
