  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ibuprofen is often taken by travelers to high altitude to treat the symptoms of acute&#xD;
      mountain sickness such as headache and malaise. However, the blunting of inflammation by&#xD;
      ibuprofen may slow the process of acclimatization to altitude, which relies on mediators of&#xD;
      inflammation for adjustments in breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study randomizes healthy subjects to receive ibuprofen or placebo and then ascend to&#xD;
      altitude (12,500 feet). Blood cytokines and non-invasive measurements of blood and tissue&#xD;
      oxygen levels will be made for 48 hours at altitude. The hypothesis being tested is that&#xD;
      subjects receiving ibuprofen will have lower blood and tissue oxygen levels after 48 hours at&#xD;
      altitude than will placebo subjects.&#xD;

      The study will begin with 2 days of studies in San Francisco (sea level baseline).&#xD;
      Measurements will include non-invasive measurements of blood and tissue oxygen and venous&#xD;
      blood draws for cytokine levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The altitude part of the study involves ascent to the University of California's White&#xD;
      Mountain Research Center Barcroft Laboratory, at 12,500 feet elevation. The subjects will&#xD;
      remain at that altitude for at least 48 hours for measurements of oxygenation and blood&#xD;
      cytokines.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  healthy subjects The group of subjects in this experiment will be composed of healthy&#xD;
             adult volunteers, over age 18 and under age 65, of any ethnic group, in good physical&#xD;
             and mental health. We expect to enroll approximately 20 subjects. The ethnic groups&#xD;
             represented will depend on the ethnicity of those who wish to be subjects, but no&#xD;
             ethnic groups will be specifically sought after or rejected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be specifically excluded according to the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of any clinically significant medical condition, particularly abnormal&#xD;
             respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, hematological, renal or hepatic function. A&#xD;
             medical history and physical exam will be performed at the screening session for each&#xD;
             subject. We will use this to determine whether the subjects are healthy and without&#xD;
             any history of these conditions. No laboratory workup will be required&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Regular smokers (more than 1 cigarette or cigar per day).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Currently active or recently treated systemic or serious local infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Recent regular use of prescription medications or regular physician care for any&#xD;
             significant medical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A history of high altitude pulmonary edema or high altitude cerebral edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Recent exposure to altitude (&gt;8000 ft) in the last month or having slept at an&#xD;
             altitude &gt;6000 feet in the last month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Inability to provide written informed consent or to be able to complete the&#xD;
             experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pregnancy as determined by a urine pregnancy test if subjects believe they might be&#xD;
             pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Allergy to non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or subjects reporting history&#xD;
             or symptoms of ulcers or other ibuprofen related contraindications discussed with the&#xD;
             screening physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Heavy coffee drinkers or caffeine users will be advised that they may suffer rebound&#xD;
             headache when restricted from caffeinated beverages on measurement days, and asked to&#xD;
             carefully consider any continuing participation in the study after abstaining from&#xD;
             caffeine during their first sea level measurements.&#xD;
