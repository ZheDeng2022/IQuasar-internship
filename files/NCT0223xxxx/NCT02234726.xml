    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a community-based early childhood&#xD;
      development (ECD) program on children's physical and cognitive development. Under the&#xD;
      program, targeted communities will be assigned a trained Child Development Agent (CDA) who&#xD;
      will have four main tasks and responsibilities: 1) biweekly screening and management&#xD;
      (including referral) of acute malnutrition in children; 2) encouragement of caregivers to&#xD;
      utilize routine care services for children; 3) screening for symptoms of acute diseases&#xD;
      including malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia and referral for diagnosis and treatment; and 4)&#xD;
      organization and mentoring of biweekly caregiver meetings to discuss parenting and promote&#xD;
      early childhood cognitive stimulation. The investigators will enroll at baseline around 600&#xD;
      children ages 6 - 12 months and their caregivers, and randomize them at the community-level&#xD;
      to receive the ECD program or to remain in the control group. The study period will be one&#xD;
      year. At end line, the investigators will collect important indicators of child physical and&#xD;
      cognitive development to assess program impact. If the program shows both feasibility and&#xD;
      impact, there is the potential to integrate program interventions into existing national&#xD;
      community-based health initiatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amendment: the study period has been extended for a second year. After a five month gap when&#xD;
      no intervention was provided, biweekly (i.e., fortnightly) community-based parenting groups&#xD;
      were restarted in intervention clusters. In the second year of the intervention, CDAs no&#xD;
      longer visit households.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a community-based early childhood&#xD;
      development (ECD) program on child physical and cognitive development. Central to the ECD&#xD;
      program is a cadre of community-based health workers called Child Development Agents (CDAs).&#xD;
      CDAs have four main tasks and responsibilities: 1) Biweekly screening and management&#xD;
      (including referral) of acute malnutrition in children; 2) Encouragement of caregivers to&#xD;
      utilize routine care services for children (immunizations, growth monitoring, and vitamin A&#xD;
      supplementation); 3) Screening for symptoms of acute diseases including malaria, diarrhea,&#xD;
      and pneumonia and referral for diagnosis and treatment; and 4) Organization and mentoring of&#xD;
      weekly meetings for caregivers to discuss parenting issues and promote early childhood&#xD;
      cognitive stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocols for the community-based evaluation and management of children with acute&#xD;
      malnutrition are based on the draft Zambian Community Integrated Management of Acute&#xD;
      Malnutrition (CIMAM) guidelines. Children with complicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM)&#xD;
      are referred to the nearest health center for evaluation and, if SAM is confirmed based on&#xD;
      mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), then referred to an inpatient feeding center for&#xD;
      management. All children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and uncomplicated SAM are&#xD;
      administered an appetite test at the health center. Children who pass the appetite test are&#xD;
      managed locally as outpatients. Children with acute infectious diseases are treated following&#xD;
      the Ministry of Health's adaptation of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI)&#xD;
      guidelines and those with complicated SAM or feeding difficulties are referred to higher&#xD;
      level facilities (feeding centers). As part of the ECD program, clinical staff members at&#xD;
      study health centers receive a short training to improve their adherence to IMCI and CIMAM&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One aspect of the IECDZ program that is of particular interest from a policy and evaluation&#xD;
      perspective is the explicit focus on improving communication between CDAs and clinical staff&#xD;
      at facilities handling undernourished children. As part of the ECD program, CDAs meet with&#xD;
      staff at referral health centers on a regular basis, and discuss strategies to improve&#xD;
      nutritional outcomes of children falling behind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to these regular meetings, the ECD program strengthens the linkages between CDAs&#xD;
      and health centers with a novel mHealth intervention. When a CDA refers a child to a health&#xD;
      center for evaluation of acute malnutrition, danger signs, or signs/symptoms suggestive of&#xD;
      malaria, pneumonia or diarrhea, the officer-in-charge at the health center receives an short&#xD;
      message service (SMS) and a paper referral form to make them aware of the child and their&#xD;
      provisional diagnosis. Once the referred child has been attended to at the facility, health&#xD;
      center staff members will then send an SMS back to the CDA to make them aware of the final&#xD;
      diagnosis and management plan. If the health center refers the child to a feeding center, an&#xD;
      SMS is sent to the feeding center along with a paper referral form. All text messages within&#xD;
      the proposed system are free of charge to the end users. The mobile health (mHealth) system&#xD;
      is meant to improve communication between health workers operating at various levels of the&#xD;
      health system. Caregivers themselves do not receive SMS updates. Rather, CDAs will&#xD;
      communicate all updates on the health and nutritional status of children directly to&#xD;
      caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the ECD program are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improve community-based screening for uncomplicated acute malnutrition and to strengthen&#xD;
           referral to and the quality of management of malnourished children at local health&#xD;
           centers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conduct community-based screening and referral for management of common childhood&#xD;
           diseases (malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Strengthen the continuum of care for children with acute malnutrition and disease using&#xD;
           an innovative mHealth intervention to link CDAs, the children that they are screening,&#xD;
           and health centers and feeding centers; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Improve early cognitive development through community-based weekly meetings with&#xD;
           caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed evaluation will be structured around the ECD program roll out, and will employ a&#xD;
      cluster-randomized trial design. For the purposes of the evaluation, a cluster is demarcated&#xD;
      by the boundaries of a health zone, a geographic unit defined and used by the Zambia Ministry&#xD;
      of Health to determine catchment populations for public health facilities. Each health zone&#xD;
      and the children recruited from within the zone comprise a cluster for the trial. The ECD&#xD;
      interventions will be implemented in 15 randomly selected health zones across five facilities&#xD;
      starting in August 2014. The remaining 15 health zones in the catchments of the five study&#xD;
      facilities will continue using current practices and will serve as controls. Within each&#xD;
      health zone, a total of around 20 child/caregiver pairs will be recruited and enrolled in the&#xD;
      evaluation. In total, the investigators anticipate around 300 child/caregiver pairs being&#xD;
      enrolled in each arm of the study, for a total of 600 child/caregiver pairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sample will be randomized at the level of the health zone to either the ECD program&#xD;
      or to the control group using stratified random sampling methods. Prior to randomization,&#xD;
      basic demographic information will be collected on all health zones, including: distance to&#xD;
      the study health center, total population, and number of eligible children ages 6 to 12&#xD;
      months. Next, zones will be stratified according to these demographic data. Finally, within&#xD;
      strata zones will be assigned to either the ECD intervention or to the control group using a&#xD;
      random number generator to achieve balance within strata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data will be collected from four main sources: 1) a baseline interview with study&#xD;
      caregivers; 2) an endline interview with caregivers and a child assessment; 3) IECDZ program&#xD;
      monitoring systems, including CDA records and SMS software; and 4) semi-structured interviews&#xD;
      with CDAs and clinic staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline caregiver interview - Study CDAs will conduct a baseline survey of both control and&#xD;
      intervention households which will include: a) basic demographic and socioeconomic status, b)&#xD;
      availability of books, toys and other reading material at home, time spent by caregivers&#xD;
      reading to the child, as well as time spent by caregivers playing with the child, c)&#xD;
      anthropometric screening (weight, height, and MUAC), d) review of vaccinations and child&#xD;
      health visits using child health card, e) assessment of maternal or caregiver mental&#xD;
      well-being, f) assessment of maternal depression with the self-reporting questionnaire-20&#xD;
      (SRQ-20), and g) presence of other early childhood development programs in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End line caregiver interview and child assessment - Twelve months after enrollment all&#xD;
      children will be visited for a final interview and assessment. This assessment will include&#xD;
      the questions asked at baseline as well as an assessment of child development using a&#xD;
      standardized test-the INTERGROWTH 21st century assessment tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECD program monitoring systems - Data on key process indicators will be collected from ECD&#xD;
      program records to assess the activities of CDAs and study clinics. Important indicators&#xD;
      include: a) volume of CDA household visits; b) volume of children identified and referred for&#xD;
      malnutrition and/or disease; c) volume of successful referrals; and d) volume of SMS sent&#xD;
      between CDAs and study clinics. Additional ECD program monitoring systems dedicated to the&#xD;
      caregiver groups' cognitive stimulation are: a) frequency of caregiver groups, b) caregiver&#xD;
      knowledge of topics covered by the curriculum, and c) measures of caregiver-child interaction&#xD;
      quality. These data do not exist for control areas, so they will not be used to evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of the ECD program. However, these data will provide important information that will&#xD;
      be used to better understand any program impacts that are identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews with CDAs and clinic staff - A series of semi-structured interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted with CDAs and clinic staff members to assess both awareness of child nutrition and&#xD;
      disease issues and general perceptions of the ECD program. These interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      with all study CDAs and staff from all study facilities at three time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For analyses, the primary independent variable of interest is receipt of the ECD program.&#xD;
      Assuming proper randomization, we anticipate that all factors that might potentially confound&#xD;
      the relationships of interest are uncorrelated with receipt of the program. We will compare&#xD;
      baseline characteristics between the two groups to assess balance. We will collect data on&#xD;
      potential confounders to increase precision, analyze heterogeneity and, if necessary, control&#xD;
      for any potential imbalance. Potential confounders include: maternal and paternal education,&#xD;
      assets, income and employment, family composition and child gender. We will also control for&#xD;
      baseline height-for-age z-score and other baseline child health measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical variables will be compared between groups using a chi-square test, or Fisher's&#xD;
      exact test if cell sizes are small; continuous variables using a t-test if normally&#xD;
      distributed or non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests, if non-normal. We will model our&#xD;
      impact measures as a function of treatment and controls using a standard regression&#xD;
      framework.&#xD;
