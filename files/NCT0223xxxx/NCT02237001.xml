  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Horizontal meniscus tears meeting specified criteria will be repaired by any commonly used&#xD;
      suture technique. Subjects will be followed for 2 years to evaluate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      repair, by assessing the re-operation rate, and by assessing improvements in knee pain and&#xD;
      knee function.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential subjects will undergo Screening for eligibility based on Inclusion/Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Screening will include an x-ray of the injured knee and evaluation of an MRI of the&#xD;
      injured knee within 6 months prior to the scheduled procedure. During the procedure, the&#xD;
      meniscal tear will be evaluated by arthroscopy to determine if the tear meets study&#xD;
      requirements. If the meniscal tear is determined to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, the&#xD;
      subject will be considered enrolled. If any inclusion/exclusion criteria is not met, the&#xD;
      subject will be considered a screen failure and will not be enrolled. For enrolled subjects,&#xD;
      specific information regarding the repair and repair technique will be collected during the&#xD;
      procedure, including still and video images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be contacted 7-15 days post-procedure for safety follow-up. Subjects will&#xD;
      return for follow-up visits at approximately post-procedure Days 90, 185, 365 and 730.&#xD;
      Identical questionnaires will be completed at each visit to assess knee pain and knee&#xD;
      function. Safety information will be collected at each post-procedure visit. Additionally, an&#xD;
      in-office arthroscopy of the treated knee will be performed at participating sites at Day&#xD;
      185, an MRI of the treated knee will be performed at Day 365 and an X-ray of the treated knee&#xD;
      will be performed at Day 730. The patient will exit the study at the Day 730 visit.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Knee Pain and Function by Completion of International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation Form (IKDC Knee Evaluation) at 3 Months, 6 Months, 1 Year, and 2 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Change in knee pain and function will be measured by completion of The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective score. The IKDC Score was developed to detect improvement or deterioration in symptoms, function, and sports activities due to knee impairment, including patients with meniscal injuries.&#xD;
There are three domains: 1) symptoms, including pain, stiffness, swelling, locking/catching, and giving way (7 items), 2) sports and daily activities (10 items), and 3) current knee function and knee function prior to knee injury (1 item, not included in the score). Responses vary for each item. The possible score ranges from 0-100, where 100 = no limitation with daily or sporting activities and the absence of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in Knee Pain and Function by the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS): Pain Score at 3 Months, 6 Months, 1 Year, and 2 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Change in knee pain and function will be measured by completion the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). There are five patient-relevant subscales of the KOOS, and each are scored separately: Pain (9 items), ADL function (17 items), Sport and Recreation Function (5 items), Symptoms (7 items), and Quality of Life (4 items).&#xD;
A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (no problems) to 4 (extreme problems). Each of the 5 scores is calculated as the sum of the items included and then each score is transformed to a 0-100 scale, with 0 representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as common in orthopedic assessment scales and generic measures. An aggregate score is not calculated so that each of the 5 dimensions can be assess separately.</description>

    <measure>Change in Knee Pain and Function by Tegner Activity Scale at 3 Months, 6 Months, 1 Year, and 2 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Change in knee pain and function will be measured by completion of the Tegner activity scale. The Tegner activity scale was designed as a score of activity level to complement other functional scores for patients with ligamentous injuries. The Tegner activity scale is a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 10. Each value indicates the ability to perform specific activities. An activity level of 10 corresponds to participation in competitive sports, including soccer, football, and rugby at the elite level; an activity level of 6 points corresponds to participation in recreational sports; and an activity level of 0 is assigned if a person is on sick leave or receiving a disability pension because of knee problems. An activity level of 5 to 10 is recorded only if the patient participates in recreational or competitive sports.</description>

        <title>Change in Knee Pain and Function by Completion of International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation Form (IKDC Knee Evaluation) at 3 Months, 6 Months, 1 Year, and 2 Years</title>
        <description>Change in knee pain and function will be measured by completion of The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective score. The IKDC Score was developed to detect improvement or deterioration in symptoms, function, and sports activities due to knee impairment, including patients with meniscal injuries.&#xD;
There are three domains: 1) symptoms, including pain, stiffness, swelling, locking/catching, and giving way (7 items), 2) sports and daily activities (10 items), and 3) current knee function and knee function prior to knee injury (1 item, not included in the score). Responses vary for each item. The possible score ranges from 0-100, where 100 = no limitation with daily or sporting activities and the absence of symptoms.</description>

        <population>30 participants in Safety Population (SAF) and 26 participants in Analysis Population (AS). Planned sample size of 30 participants was accrued for SAF; however, a total of 4 participants were excluded to comprise AS due to late screen failure or withdrawal by participant. Each row represents all enrolled participants at the referenced time point.</population>

        <title>Change in Knee Pain and Function by the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS): Pain Score at 3 Months, 6 Months, 1 Year, and 2 Years</title>
        <description>Change in knee pain and function will be measured by completion the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). There are five patient-relevant subscales of the KOOS, and each are scored separately: Pain (9 items), ADL function (17 items), Sport and Recreation Function (5 items), Symptoms (7 items), and Quality of Life (4 items).&#xD;
A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (no problems) to 4 (extreme problems). Each of the 5 scores is calculated as the sum of the items included and then each score is transformed to a 0-100 scale, with 0 representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as common in orthopedic assessment scales and generic measures. An aggregate score is not calculated so that each of the 5 dimensions can be assess separately.</description>

        <title>Change in Knee Pain and Function by the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS): Sport and Recreation Function (Sport) Score at 3 Months, 6 Months, 1 Year, and 2 Years</title>
        <description>Change in knee pain and function will be measured by completion the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). There are five patient-relevant subscales of the KOOS, and each are scored separately: Pain (9 items), ADL function (17 items), Sport and Recreation Function (5 items), Symptoms (7 items), and Quality of Life (4 items).&#xD;
A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (no problems) to 4 (extreme problems). Each of the 5 scores is calculated as the sum of the items included and then each score is transformed to a 0-100 scale, with 0 representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as common in orthopedic assessment scales and generic measures. An aggregate score is not calculated so that each of the 5 dimensions can be assess separately.</description>

        <title>Change in Knee Pain and Function by the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS): Quality of Life (QOL) Score at 3 Months, 6 Months, 1 Year, and 2 Years</title>
        <description>Change in knee pain and function will be measured by completion the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). There are five patient-relevant subscales of the KOOS, and each are scored separately: Pain (9 items), ADL function (17 items), Sport and Recreation Function (5 items), Symptoms (7 items), and Quality of Life (4 items).&#xD;
A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (no problems) to 4 (extreme problems). Each of the 5 scores is calculated as the sum of the items included and then each score is transformed to a 0-100 scale, with 0 representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as common in orthopedic assessment scales and generic measures. An aggregate score is not calculated so that each of the 5 dimensions can be assess separately.</description>

        <title>Change in Knee Pain and Function by Tegner Activity Scale at 3 Months, 6 Months, 1 Year, and 2 Years</title>
        <description>Change in knee pain and function will be measured by completion of the Tegner activity scale. The Tegner activity scale was designed as a score of activity level to complement other functional scores for patients with ligamentous injuries. The Tegner activity scale is a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 10. Each value indicates the ability to perform specific activities. An activity level of 10 corresponds to participation in competitive sports, including soccer, football, and rugby at the elite level; an activity level of 6 points corresponds to participation in recreational sports; and an activity level of 0 is assigned if a person is on sick leave or receiving a disability pension because of knee problems. An activity level of 5 to 10 is recorded only if the patient participates in recreational or competitive sports.</description>

          <title>Change in Knee Pain and Function by Tegner Activity Scale at 3 Months, 6 Months, 1 Year, and 2 Years</title>
          <description>Change in knee pain and function will be measured by completion of the Tegner activity scale. The Tegner activity scale was designed as a score of activity level to complement other functional scores for patients with ligamentous injuries. The Tegner activity scale is a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 10. Each value indicates the ability to perform specific activities. An activity level of 10 corresponds to participation in competitive sports, including soccer, football, and rugby at the elite level; an activity level of 6 points corresponds to participation in recreational sports; and an activity level of 0 is assigned if a person is on sick leave or receiving a disability pension because of knee problems. An activity level of 5 to 10 is recorded only if the patient participates in recreational or competitive sports.</description>
          <population>30 participants in Safety Population (SAF) and 26 participants in Analysis Population (AS). Planned sample size of 30 participants was accrued for SAF; however, a total of 4 participants were excluded to comprise AS due to late screen failure or withdrawal by participant. Each row represents all enrolled participants at the referenced time point.</population>
