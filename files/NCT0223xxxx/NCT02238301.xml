  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of functional MRI in pregnant women as a&#xD;
      non-invasive diagnostic tool to detect placental insufficiency and differentiate healthy&#xD;
      fetuses from the intra-uterine growth restricted ones. Functional MRI in pregnant women can&#xD;
      detect a variation of the MRI signal (called BOLD effect) from the placenta and the fetus&#xD;
      when the mother is breathing pure oxygen. This study aims hence to demonstrate the difference&#xD;
      in the BOLD effect between normal feto-placental units and growth restricted ones.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with important maternal and perinatal&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. IUGR is typically secondary to defective oxygenation, leading to&#xD;
      placental insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements made in the umbilical cord after puncture fetal blood showed that compared to&#xD;
      normal fetuses, fetuses with IUGR are often hypoxic, hypercapnic and acidotic. Pathological&#xD;
      placental and fetal oxygenation is considered as a main element of IUGR. To this day, there&#xD;
      is no non-invasive exploration method of this oxygenation. The only ways to monitor IUGR are&#xD;
      &quot;indirect&quot; ultrasonic analysis of fetal growth and uteroplacental Doppler spectra. Functional&#xD;
      BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level dependent) MRI, already used to investigate cerebral, tumor, cardiac&#xD;
      oxygenation, highlights local variations of oxygenation. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      obtain non invasive data of fetoplacental oxygenation through functional BOLD MRI. Comparing&#xD;
      data on eutrophic fetuses and IUGR fetuses will determine the potential contribution of this&#xD;
      technique in the diagnosis, treatment and medical management of dysfunctional placentas&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of IUGR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a fetal MRI in the pediatric radiology department of Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital or&#xD;
      Robert Debré Hospital, for fetal or placental indications as part of usual workup, will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in this protocol. At the waning of the scheduled fetal MRI, patients&#xD;
      will subsequently receive an additional BOLD and ASL sequence before and after maternal&#xD;
      hyperoxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included in three centers : Necker Hospital, Robert Debré Hospital and Louis&#xD;
      Mourier Hospital. Only at Necker Hospital: a subgroup of patients will be included at the&#xD;
      beginning of the protocol for the adjustment of the settings of the MRI machine, for the&#xD;
      determination of BOLD sequences' parameters, as well as the selection of the most adapted&#xD;
      type of oxygenation mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the three centers, investigators will include patients with IUGR fetuses and patients with&#xD;
      a eutrophic fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of two visits (selection visit and baseline) are scheduled for all patients in this&#xD;
      trial. Patient selection will be done during a ultrasound visit. Patients can give their&#xD;
      consent on the same day or on the MRI appointment day; in all cases the consent will be&#xD;
      signed on the day of the appointment MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The flow and duration of the oxygenation of the initial group &quot;test patients&quot; will be&#xD;
      determined before completion of the examination; for other patients, the flow rate will be&#xD;
      determined based on the results of this first group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the BOLD sequence will be around 10 minutes. The sequences will focus on the&#xD;
      feto-placental unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first BOLD sequence will be launched under ambient air. The second BOLD sequence will be&#xD;
      repeated after 5 minutes of maternal hyperoxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI data will be saved and analyzed at the Laboratory of Imaging Research of the team 2 of&#xD;
      Paris Cardiovascular Research Center (INSERM U970).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data necessary for the statistical analysis of the study are collected from the medical&#xD;
      file of patients included in the study. Data entry will be performed by a research technician&#xD;
      on electronic media via an internet browser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion period will be of 57 months. Each woman's duration of participation will be 1&#xD;
      hour. The maximum duration of the study will be 57 months.&#xD;
