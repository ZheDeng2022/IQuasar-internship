      STUDY BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a common type of blood cancer in adults, and is more&#xD;
      common with increasing age. AML is harder to treat in older patients, with typically poor&#xD;
      responses to standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with AML are typically given intensive induction chemotherapy, but many older&#xD;
      patients cannot tolerate the side effects of this therapy. Decitabine has been shown to be&#xD;
      active and better tolerated in frail patients with AML; however, most patients still relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies suggest that improving the performance status and fitness of older AML&#xD;
      patients prior to induction chemotherapy may help to lessen side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test the combination of decitabine treatment with physical exercise in&#xD;
      elderly patients with AML who are not candidates for standard induction chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESCRIPTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study to test the combination of decitabine treatment with an 8-week physical&#xD;
      exercise program in AML patients ≥ 60 years of age who are not candidates for standard&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy. Patients who are eligible to take part must give their written&#xD;
      agreement before they can be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll 20 patients who are not candidates for standard induction&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Patients will begin an 8-week program of physical exercise, including 2-3&#xD;
      sessions per week supervised by a physical therapist. During this 8-week period, patients&#xD;
      will be given 2 cycles of decitabine therapy (daily infusion for 5 consecutive days of a&#xD;
      28-day cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed to assess the safety and tolerability of the program. Patients will&#xD;
      also give blood samples that will be used to assess their response to treatment. Patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated for their physical fitness before and after the 8-week exercise program and&#xD;
      will complete questionnaires to assess their quality of life before and after the program.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Number of patients age 60 and older with newly diagnosed AML and who are not candidates for&#xD;
      standard induction chemotherapy who complete an 8-week program of physical conditioning and&#xD;
      decitabine treatment. The goal is set at 30% of 20 enrolled patients completing the 8 weeks&#xD;
      of decitabine and physical conditioning program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of patients with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
           physical conditioning program during decitabine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of patients with overall response (complete response, disease-free survival&#xD;
           [DFS], and overall survival [OS]) of the rehabilitated patients after conclusion of the&#xD;
           8-week program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in quality of life among study subjects before and after the 8-week exercise&#xD;
           program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in cytokine profiles drawn at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Twenty subjects, age 60 and older with newly diagnosed AML who are deemed by their&#xD;
           referring physicians not to be candidates for standard induction chemotherapy will be&#xD;
           recruited from the inpatient and outpatient services at Emory University Hospital and&#xD;
           the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After signing the informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability&#xD;
           Act (HIPAA) forms, a screening evaluation will be performed. Subjects who are eligible&#xD;
           will meet with the physical therapist and will enroll on an 8-week program of physical&#xD;
           conditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each patient will participate in 2-3 exercise sessions per week supervised by a physical&#xD;
           therapist and a home exercise program. Evaluations of physical fitness will be performed&#xD;
           before and after the 8-week exercise program. Each exercise session will be customized&#xD;
           based on each patient's baseline fitness level. Subjects' heart rate, blood pressure,&#xD;
           and rate of perceived exertion score will be monitored during the exercise treatment&#xD;
           session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' fitness at the conclusion of the physical therapy regimen will be assessed by&#xD;
           checking for improvement in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status&#xD;
           by at least 1 point from baseline and 25% improvement in the Special Forces (SF)-36&#xD;
           fitness scoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decitabine will be infused according to standard of care practice with daily infusions&#xD;
           for 5 consecutive days of a 28-day cycle for 2 cycles (1 cycle = 28 days) during the 8&#xD;
           week physical-conditioning period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be assessed by the hematology provider on a weekly basis, and adverse&#xD;
           events/toxicities will be recorded on an ongoing basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow biopsies will be obtained at baseline, at 8 weeks, and as clinically&#xD;
           indicated to assess for response. A sample of marrow will be collected for correlative&#xD;
           assays coincident with the standard of care collections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral blood (20 mL) will be collected for correlative studies at baseline, 4 weeks&#xD;
           and 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Disease Response:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete blood counts (CBC) with differential will be obtained weekly and bone marrow&#xD;
           biopsy and aspirates will be obtained as clinically indicated to assess response to&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active participation in the study will end 1 month after completion of the 8-week&#xD;
           exercise/decitabine program. Thereafter, long term follow-up for survival will be&#xD;
           performed by record review or telephone interview for patients who no longer follow-up&#xD;
           at Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be monitored by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee at the study institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility: Based on data showing that 50% of older fit AML patients tolerated a 4-week&#xD;
           exercise regimen, feasibility is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Completion of the 8-week physical conditioning regimen/decitabine program in at&#xD;
                least 30% of the study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The proportion of patients with full treatment delivery will be estimated with an&#xD;
                exact 90% confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment for fitness of the study population will be undertaken at 4 weeks from&#xD;
           enrollment and conclusion of the 8-week physical therapy regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kaplan-Meier curves will be used to estimate the distribution of time to relapse,&#xD;
           disease-free survival, and overall survival.&#xD;
