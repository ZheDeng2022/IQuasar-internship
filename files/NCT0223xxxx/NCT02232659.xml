      The SynCardia 70cc temporary Total Artificial Heart (TAH-t) is approved by the U.S. Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a bridge to transplant for patients at risk of imminent&#xD;
      (about to happen) death from irreversible biventricular heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether the TAH-t can support patients with&#xD;
      life-threatening irreversible biventricular heart failure who are not eligible for&#xD;
      transplantation. The TAH-t, when used for patients who are not eligible for transplant, is&#xD;
      considered to be an investigational (not approved by FDA) use. This use is called destination&#xD;
      therapy (DT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nineteen (19) patients with life-threatening, biventricular failure who are not eligible for&#xD;
      cardiac transplant will be enrolled in the Primary Arm of the study and followed for up to&#xD;
      six months post-TAH-t implant. Safety will be evaluated by reviewing the adverse events that&#xD;
      are experienced by the enrolled subjects and comparing them to previous experience of TAH-t&#xD;
      patients who were waiting for a heart transplant. Since approximately 74% of patients with&#xD;
      this condition would not be expected to live beyond six months, the benefit of the TAH-t for&#xD;
      DT will be confirmed based on survival to six months without experiencing permanent disabling&#xD;
      stroke-related deficits. After the six month follow-up visit, patients will continue to be&#xD;
      followed under the study for up to five (5) years postTAH-t implant [every six months for up&#xD;
      to two years while supported with the TAH-t implant and then annually for another three&#xD;
      years].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to an additional 19 patients may be enrolled in the Secondary Arm of the study to further&#xD;
      characterize the use of the TAH-t for DT in a broader patient population. Follow-up would be&#xD;
      the same for patients enrolled in both arms of the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      On 15 October 2004, the SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart (TAH-t) received Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) approval (Premarket Approval Application [PMA] #P030011) for&#xD;
      in-hospital use as a bridge to transplant (BTT) in cardiac transplant-eligible candidates at&#xD;
      risk of imminent death from biventricular failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On 2 March 2012, FDA granted a Humanitarian Use Designation (HUD) to the 70cc TAH-t System&#xD;
      for use as Destination Therapy (DT) in patients at risk of imminent death from irreversible&#xD;
      biventricular heart failure who are not eligible for transplant and have a body surface area&#xD;
      (BSA) &gt;1.7m. This clinical study is intended to determine the safety and probable benefit of&#xD;
      the 70cc TAH-t for use in DT and support a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application&#xD;
      for this new indication for the TAH-t System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SynCardia TAH-t System is a pulsatile biventricular device that replaces a patient's&#xD;
      native ventricles and valves by pumping blood to both the pulmonary and systemic circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TAH-t System for DT consists of the implantable TAH-t with SynHall Valves, powered by&#xD;
      PMA-approved external pneumatic drivers [the Circulatory Support System (CSS) Console, the&#xD;
      Companion 2 Driver System and the Freedom Driver System]. The TAH-t System is intended to be&#xD;
      implanted in the operating room by a qualified surgeon and is capable of supporting the&#xD;
      patients both inside and outside the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SynCardia TAH-t for DT is indicated for refractory advanced heart failure patients with&#xD;
      biventricular failure who are not candidates for cardiac transplant because of the presence&#xD;
      of contraindications to transplant, including cancer, advanced age, obesity, end-stage&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, high panel reactive antibodies (PRAs), non-cardiac congenital defects,&#xD;
      contraindications to immunosuppression, lack of social support, poor medical compliance,&#xD;
      neurological impairment or other co-morbidities with a poor prognosis for survival. Patients&#xD;
      with life-threatening, irreversible biventricular failure who are not eligible for transplant&#xD;
      currently have no alternative but death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for conducting this study is based on the results of clinical studies in the&#xD;
      bridge-to-transplant (BTT) patient population, together with the in vitro design verification&#xD;
      and validation testing, in vitro reliability testing, and clinical reliability experience of&#xD;
      more than thirty years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a prospective, non-randomized, two-treatment arm, multi-center study.&#xD;
      Nineteen (19) patients will be enrolled in the Primary Arm at up to 30 investigational sites&#xD;
      to support an HDE for the use of the TAH-t as DT. Up to an additional 19 patients may be&#xD;
      enrolled in the Secondary Arm to futher characterize the use of the TAH-t for DT in a broader&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients treated with the 70cc TAH-t System for DT under the Primary Arm will be adult male&#xD;
      and female patients between the ages of 19 and 75 years old with a BSA â‰¥1.7m2 with&#xD;
      life-threatening irreversible biventricular failure who are not eligible for a heart&#xD;
      transplant (as determined by the implanting center at the time of implant assessment) and who&#xD;
      meet the enrollment criteria defined in the clinical protocol. Patients treated with the 70cc&#xD;
      TAH-t System for DT under the Secondary Arm will be adult male and female patients who are at&#xD;
      least 19 years old, are not eligible for a heart transplant (as determined by the implanting&#xD;
      center at the time of implant assessment), and who meet the less restrictive enrollment&#xD;
      criteria defined in the clinical protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks to which the TAH-t subjects will be exposed in this clinical investigation are&#xD;
      expected to be no more than the well-characterized risks of the PMA-approved TAH-t System&#xD;
      when used for the bridge-to-transplant population and have been mitigated by the design and&#xD;
      testing of the TAH-t System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart (TAH-t) for DT Study&#xD;
      is to evaluate whether the TAH-t can support patients with life-threatening irreversible&#xD;
      biventricular heart failure who are ineligible for cardiac transplantation (as determined by&#xD;
      the implanting center at time of implant screening assessment), without experiencing&#xD;
      permanent disabling stroke-related deficits (as evidenced by a Modified Rankin Scale score of&#xD;
      0 - 2). The other primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether the safety profile of&#xD;
      the device, when used for DT, is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probable benefit is defined as survival to six months on TAH-t System support with the same&#xD;
      implanted TAH-t, without experiencing permanent disabling stroke-related deficits. This&#xD;
      patient population, without treatment, has a poor prognosis of survival. Per M.L.A. Haeck,&#xD;
      &quot;Patients with drug refractory end-stage HF [heart failure] receiving support with inotropic&#xD;
      drugs [have] a 3-, 6-, and 12-month survival of 51%, 26%, and 6%, respectively, with a mean&#xD;
      survival of only 3.4 months.&quot;1&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study success criteria are: alive on the original TAH-t and free from permanent disabling&#xD;
      stroke-related deficits (as evidenced by Modified Rankin Scale score of 0 - 2) at six months&#xD;
      post-implant (or transplanted prior to six months post-implant). For the study to be&#xD;
      considered a success, eight of the 19 subjects either must be alive at six months on the&#xD;
      original TAH-t implant, without experiencing a permanent disabling stroke deficit, or have&#xD;
      become transplant eligible (or have been transplanted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety endpoints will be captured according to the Intermacs Registry AE definitions and&#xD;
      will be assessed according to the same data collection schedule followed under the Intermacs&#xD;
      Registry protocol. Secondary safety endpoints will be the incidences of major infection&#xD;
      (sepsis), neurological events (ischemic or hemorrhagic cardiovascular accident [CVA]),&#xD;
      chronic renal dysfunction, and the rate of major device failures/malfunctions, each defined&#xD;
      per the Intermacs definitions. A performance goal for each has been established based on the&#xD;
      previous experience of TAH-t patients who were waiting for a heart transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be followed in the study from the date of TAH-t implant until six months&#xD;
      post-implant, cardiac transplantation, death, or withdrawal from study, whichever occurs&#xD;
      first. Data from the six month post-TAH-t implant period will be used to support an HDE&#xD;
      application. After the six month follow-up visit, patients will continue to be followed under&#xD;
      the study for up to five (5) years post-TAH-t implant [every six months for up to two years&#xD;
      while supported with the TAH-t implant and then annually for another three years].&#xD;
