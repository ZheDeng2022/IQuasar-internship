  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of rFVIIIFc (BIIB031) in&#xD;
      previously untreated participants (PUPs) with severe hemophilia A. The secondary objectives&#xD;
      were to evaluate the efficacy of rFVIIIFc in the prevention and treatment of bleeding&#xD;
      episodes in PUPs, to evaluate rFVIIIFc consumption for the prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      bleeding episodes in PUPs, and to describe experience with the use of rFVIIIFc for immune&#xD;
      tolerance induction (ITI) in participants with inhibitors.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Inhibitor Development as Measured by the Nijmegen-Modified Bethesda Assay</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>A positive/confirmed inhibitor result occurs when a participant has a value &gt;=0.6 BU/mL by central laboratory testing using Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay, that is confirmed on re-testing of a separate sample collected &gt;=2 weeks after the initial sample. Confirmed inhibitor development was based on all participants who had reached &gt;=10 EDs and had &gt;=1 inhibitor test performed at or beyond this milestone or who had an inhibitor. Exposure day (ED) is a 24-hour period in which participant received &gt;=1 dose of rFVIIIFc injections. Participants who did not develop an inhibitor but reached the milestone number of EDs were included in the denominator during calculation of percentage. Additionally, any participant who developed an inhibitor following the initial rFVIIIFc administration was included in the numerator and denominator during calculation of percentage.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Annualized Number of Bleeding Episodes (Spontaneous and Traumatic) Per Participant (Annualized Bleeding Rate [ABR])</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>ABR was annualized number of bleeding episodes during efficacy period (EP) per participant annualized to a 1-year interval of time. Bleeding episodes were classified as spontaneous if parent/caregiver/participant records bleeding event when there is no known contributing factor such as definite trauma or antecedent &quot;strenuous&quot; activity and as traumatic when there is known reason for bleed. ABR=(Number of bleeding episodes during EP divided by total number of days during EP)*365.25. EP was sum of all intervals of time during which participants were treated with rFVIIIFc per treatment regimens of study excluding surgical/rehabilitation periods and large injection intervals (greater than [&gt;]28 days). Participants were included in summary of more than 1 treatment regimen if their regimen changed during study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Annualized Number of Spontaneous Joint Bleeding Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Bleeding episodes were classified as spontaneous if parent/caregiver/participant records a bleeding event when there was no known contributing factor such as a definite trauma or antecedent &quot;strenuous&quot; activity. Annualized spontaneous joint bleeding episodes = (Total number of spontaneous joint bleeding episodes during EP divided by total number of days during EP)*365.25. EP reflects sum of all intervals of time during which participants were treated with rFVIIIFc per treatment regimen excluding major and minor surgical/rehabilitation periods and large injection intervals (&gt; 28 days). Bleeding episodes were summarized by treatment regimen. Participants were included in summary of more than 1 treatment regimen if their regimen changed during study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of rFVIIIFc Injections With Excellent or Good, Moderate or None Treatment Response Assessed Using a 4-Point Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Using e-diary, each participant's parent/caregiver rated treatment response to any bleeding episode at approximately 8-12 hours from time of injection and prior to additional doses of rFVIIIFc given for same bleeding episodes, using 4-point scale: 1=Excellent: abrupt pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8 hour after initial injection; 2=Good: definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8 hour after injection, but possibly requiring more than 1 injection after 24-48 hour for complete resolution; 3=Moderate: Probable/slight beneficial effect within 8 hour after initial injection and requires more than 1 injection and 4=None: No improvement or condition worsens within approximately 8 hour after initial injection. Participants included in more than 1 treatment regimen if their regimen changed during study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Number of Exposure Days (EDs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>An ED was defined as a 24-hour period in which a participant received one or more doses of rFVIIIFc injections, with the time of the first injection of rFVIIIFc defined as the start of the ED. Participants who did not have a particular injection type were counted as having zero injections for that type.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Annualized rFVIIIFc Consumption Per Participant for the Prevention and Treatment of Bleeding Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Total annualized rFVIIIFc consumption (in IU/kg) was calculated for each participant as: Annualized consumption = (Total IU/kg of rFVIIIFc during EP divided by total number of days during EP)*365.25. EP reflects the sum of all intervals of time during which participants are treated with rFVIIIFc according to the treatment regimens of the study excluding surgical/rehabilitation periods and large injection intervals (&gt;28 days). Participants were included in summary of more than 1 treatment regimen if their regimen changed during study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Injections of rFVIIIFc Required to Resolve a Bleeding Episode</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Number of Injections of rFVIIIFc required to resolve a bleeding episode during EP were reported. EP reflects the sum of all intervals of time during which participants were treated with rFVIIIFc according to the treatment regimens of the study excluding surgical/rehabilitation periods and large injection intervals (&gt;28 days). All injections given from the initial sign of a bleed, until the last date/time within the bleed window were counted. Participants were included in summary of more than 1 treatment regimen if their regimen changed during study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Dose Per Injection of rFVIIIFc Required to Resolve a Bleeding Episode</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The average dose of rFVIIIFc per injection per bleeding episode was calculated as the average of all doses (IU/kg) administered to treat the bleeding episode during EP. EP begins with the first treatment regimen dose of rFVIIIFc and ends with the last dose (regardless of the reason for dosing). Surgery/rehabilitation periods were not included in the EP. Participants were included in summary of more than 1 treatment regimen if their regimen changed during study.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in rFVIIIFc Incremental Recovery (IR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108 and 120</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were taken at trough (predose) and Cmax (maximum concentration) for assessment of incremental recovery, measured by the one-stage clotting assay. IR (International Units per deciliter [IU/dL] per IU/kg) = (Cmax for FVIII activity - Pre-dose FVIII activity) (IU/dL) divided by actual dose (IU/kg), where Cmax (maximum concentration) is 30-minute FVIII activity post-dose and FVIII activity less than (&lt;)0.5 IU/dL was set to 0 IU/dL for calculation of IR.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Response to Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Complete Success was defined as meeting all of the following criteria: Negative inhibitor titers in 2 consecutive determinations at least 4 weeks apart; IR &gt;=66% of baseline in 2 consecutive determinations at least 4 weeks apart; Half life &gt;=6 hours. Partial Success was defined as meeting the first criteria for complete success and one of the other 2 after 33 months of ITI.</description>

          <description>Participants were to receive rFVIIIFc as follows -Prophylaxis regimen (PR): rFVIIIFc 25-80 international units per kilogram (IU/kg), at 3-5 day intervals until participant reached &gt;= 50 exposure days (ED: 24-hour period in which &gt;=1 injection/dose of rFVIIIFc was given), or study withdrawal/end of study. Adjustments to dose/dosing interval was done as needed by investigator; Treatment with an optional ER (Episodic regimen) can be initiated before PR at investigators discretion; ITI: rFVIIIFc 200 IU/kg, daily for participants who, after exposure to rFVIIIFc, had positive high titer inhibitor (&gt;=5.00 Bethesda Units per milliliter [BU/mL]) or positive low titer inhibitor (&gt;=0.60 and &lt;5.00 BU/mL) and had poorly controlled bleeding despite increased rFVIIIFc doses, or required bypassing agent to treat bleeding.</description>

          <description>Bleeding episodes were classified as spontaneous if parent/caregiver/participant records a bleeding event when there was no known contributing factor such as a definite trauma or antecedent &quot;strenuous&quot; activity. Annualized spontaneous joint bleeding episodes = (Total number of spontaneous joint bleeding episodes during EP divided by total number of days during EP)*365.25. EP reflects sum of all intervals of time during which participants were treated with rFVIIIFc per treatment regimen excluding major and minor surgical/rehabilitation periods and large injection intervals (&gt; 28 days). Bleeding episodes were summarized by treatment regimen. Participants were included in summary of more than 1 treatment regimen if their regimen changed during study.</description>
