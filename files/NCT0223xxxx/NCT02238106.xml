  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial was to establish non-inferiority of lung function&#xD;
      response to two doses [25 μg (1 capsule) and 50 μg (2 capsules of 25 μg)] salmeterol,&#xD;
      administered as the xinafoate salt, in an inhalation powder delivered from hard polyethylene&#xD;
      (PE) capsules via the HandiHaler® 2 compared to Serevent® Diskus® (salmeterol 50 μg,&#xD;
      administered as the xinafoate salt) following single dose inhalation in patients with COPD. A&#xD;
      hard capsule with half the strength (12.5 μg) was included to investigate a dose ordering&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives were to characterize the pharmacokinetics of salmeterol inhalation&#xD;
      powder delivered by HandiHaler® 2 from the PE hard capsule(s) and salmeterol xinafoate&#xD;
      delivered by Serevent® Diskus®, and to compare the safety of the different pharmaceutical&#xD;
      forms and/or doses.&#xD;
