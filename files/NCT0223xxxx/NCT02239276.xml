  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access use of Stiripentol in Dravet Syndrome or epileptic&#xD;
      encephalopathies associated with sodium channel mutations who have failed other drugs in an&#xD;
      effort to give them the best chance at seizure control and quality of life. As a treatment&#xD;
      protocol and not a research study, children will only be monitored on a clinical basis for&#xD;
      seizure improvement and side effects predominantly by parent and caregiver report.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initial dose of Stiripentol will be determined by the prescribing neurologist and&#xD;
      titrated up to an initial goal dose of 50 mg/kg/day divided into 2 to 3 doses per day.&#xD;
      Further dose increases by 10-20 mg/kg/day increments up to a max of 100 mg/kg/day or 4000 mg&#xD;
      total daily dose may be necessary for improved seizure control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stiripentol is available as gelatin capsules and powder sachets (250 mg, 500 mg). The same&#xD;
      granule formulation (i.e. active, PVP and portion of sodium starch glycolate) used for the&#xD;
      capsule is used in the final powder blend with a few additional excipients. Depending upon&#xD;
      patient weight, the 250 mg or 500 mg formulation will be utilized for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caretakers will be queried about common adverse effects including drowsiness, tremor, ataxis,&#xD;
      nausea, anorexia, weight loss, and emesis. Intolerable adverse effects will prompt dose&#xD;
      reduction or withholding medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of these and other potential AEs will occur during study visits and&#xD;
      participant-initiated telephone calls throughout the study. Safety events and tolerability&#xD;
      will be recorded as adverse events (AE) or serious adverse events (SAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination, weight, vital signs, and laboratory tests (cbc, complete metabolic&#xD;
      panel, and AED levels) will be conducted at baseline and at least every 6 months and as&#xD;
      clinically warranted.&#xD;
