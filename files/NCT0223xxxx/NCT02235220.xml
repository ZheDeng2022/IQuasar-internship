    <textblock>
      In this study it is to be evaluated wether a restoration with composite resin fillings to&#xD;
      reestablish a canine guidance will reduce masticatory muscle activity in patients with&#xD;
      bruxism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 patients showing clinical symptoms of bruxism receive treatment within this clinical&#xD;
      trial. Typical symptoms like pain or tenseness of the masticatory muscles, headache or&#xD;
      abrasions are mandatory preconditions. Exclusion criteria are a present treatment with a&#xD;
      biteguard or a sufficient canine guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first session a detailed history, a dental status and a clinical functional status are&#xD;
      recorded. The baseline situation is documented by taking impressions with alginate of the&#xD;
      maxilla and mandible for diagnostic study models. Following this procedure a first&#xD;
      measurement of the muscular activity is conducted for seven days with the Grindcare device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After four weeks without any intervention a second measurement is conducted again for seven&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the next session the canine cusps are restored with composite fillings. Finally a&#xD;
      sufficient canine guidance should be present. In the same session a second impression of the&#xD;
      maxilla is taken. A third measurement is conducted, again followed by four weeks without any&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At last another impression of the maxilla is obtained and a final measurement for seven days&#xD;
      is conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first examination and after the third measurement of the masticatory muscle activity&#xD;
      the patients fill out the questionnaire of the Oral Health Impact Profile in order to allow&#xD;
      for the assessment of possible functional restraints and mental interferences.&#xD;

A first measurement is conducted, followed by 4 weeks without any intervention. A second measurement is then carried out before restoration of the canine cusps with composite fillings. A third measurement is conducted, again followed by 4 weeks without any intervention. At last a final measurement is conducted.</description>
