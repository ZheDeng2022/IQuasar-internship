    <textblock>
      This Phase IV study is an a multi-centre, randomised open label, two way cross-over design to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of NEUMOTEROL 400 in subjects with asthma.&#xD;
      The study will be used to demonstrate the non-inferiority of Budesonide/Formoterol Fumarate&#xD;
      combination (BFF) 400/12 micrograms (mcg) single capsule inhaler (NEUMOTEROL 400) compared&#xD;
      with BFF 320/9 mcg SYMBICORT Forte TURBUHALER® inhaler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population for this study will be adult subjects (&gt;=18 and &lt;=80 years) with a diagnosis&#xD;
      of asthma who have a pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 40%&#xD;
      to 85% of the predicted normal value, and are receiving a stable dose of inhaled&#xD;
      corticosteroid inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with or without long-acting beta-adrenergic&#xD;
      agonist (LABA) prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of six phases: Prescreening, Screening/Run-in (4 weeks), Treatment&#xD;
      Period 1 (4 weeks), Washout (minimum 4 weeks), Treatment Period 2 (4 weeks) and Follow-up (1&#xD;
      week). The total duration of the study for each subject will be at least 17 weeks. There will&#xD;
      be up to 6 study visits and a follow-up telephone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-screening Visit will allow subjects who had recent asthma medication changes to be&#xD;
      stabilized prior to Screening. During the run-in and wash-out periods, all the subjects will&#xD;
      receive budesonide dry powder inhaler (DPI) 400 mcg twice daily (BID) (NEUMOTEX™ 400) and&#xD;
      salbutamol 100mcg pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) on demand, as rescue medication.&#xD;
      The dose of NEUMOTEROL 400 (400/12 mcg) and SYMBICORT Forte (320/9 mcg) will be one&#xD;
      inhalation BID, and each treatment will be given to all subjects for 4 weeks (with a 4-week&#xD;
      Washout Period between treatments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 300 subjects for screening so that at least 210 will be randomised and&#xD;
      a minimum of 168 subjects complete the study/are evaluable. Half the subjects will be on&#xD;
      Regimen A in Treatment Period 1and will then be crossed over to Regimen B in Treatment Period&#xD;
      2, and vice versa. Regimen A: BFF (400/12 mcg) by single capsule inhaler. Regimen B: BFF&#xD;
      (320/9 mcg) TURBUHALER inhaler. The treatment periods will be separated by a washout Period&#xD;
      of 4 weeks.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline (BL) in Trough Morning Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Day (D)29</measure>
    <time_frame>BL (D1) and D29 (each TP)</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is maximal amount of air, forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 is defined as morning prebronchodilator and predose: 12 hours (h) after last evening dose D28 at end of each TP. Measured by spirometer in morning, before using bronchodilator and pre-dosing at wk1 D1 and wk4 D29 of each TP and test was performed within 30 minutes prior to dosing. Change from BL was analysed using mixed effects ANCOVA model fitting terms for subject-level (SL) BL, Adjusted period-specific (PS) BL, treatment group and period, with participant as random effect. PS BL value is pre-dose assessment collected on D1 of each TP. SL BL is arithmetic mean of PS BL values of participant. If only one of PS BL value is missing for participant, SL BL took value of other BL. If both PS BL values were missing, SL BL was set to missing. Period level BL=PS BL - associated SL BL.</description>

    <measure>FEV1 Area Under the Curve (AUC) (0-10 h) at D1 of Each TP</measure>
    <time_frame>(0-10 h) at D1 (each TP)</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. FEV1 AUC (0 to 10h) was measured at beginning of each TP. AUC was derived using values observed at the following timepoints: 0 minute (pre-morning dosing), 5 minutes (m), 15m, 30m, 1, 2, 5, and 10h; post morning dosing FEV1 values on D1 of each TP. Pre-dose was taken as, 0h timepoint on the visit of interest, and all subsequent timepoints were calculated relative to that timepoint. FEV1 AUC was analysed using mixed effects ANCOVA model fitting terms for subject-level (SL) BL, Adjusted period-specific(PS) BL, treatment group and period, with participant as random effect.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From BL in Asthma Control Test (ACT) at 4 Wks for Each TP</measure>
    <time_frame>BL up to W4 (each TP)</time_frame>
    <description>ACT was basically a five item questionnaire, to measure participant's asthma control. It comprised of five possible answers to each question, associated with a score of 1 to 5 (1=poor control and 5=good control), wherein the scores from each question were summed to give an overall score (5=poor control and 25=complete control). ACT was recommended during each visit and was completed by the participant before any procedures were performed, avoiding any influence of the participants response. Change from BL was analysed using mixed effects ANCOVA model fitting terms for subject-level (SL) BL, Adjusted period-specific(PS) BL, treatment group and period, with participant as random effect. PS BL value, is pre-dose assessment collected on D1 of each TP. SL BL, is arithmetic mean of PS BL values of participant. Participants with an ACT below 15 were excluded from the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female &gt;=18 and &lt;=80 years of age with a diagnosis of asthma at the time of&#xD;
             signing the informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-child bearing potential&#xD;
             defined as premenopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or&#xD;
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a&#xD;
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone &gt;40 milli-international&#xD;
             unit/milliliter (mIU/mL) and oestradiol &lt;40 picogram/millilitre (pg/mL) [&lt;147&#xD;
             picomol/litre] is confirmatory) ; Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and&#xD;
             whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception&#xD;
             methods (i.e., in accordance with the approved product label and the instructions of&#xD;
             the physician for the duration of the study from Screening to follow-up contact) if&#xD;
             they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT&#xD;
             to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrolment. For most forms&#xD;
             of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks should elapse between the cessation of therapy and the&#xD;
             blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. After confirmation of&#xD;
             their postmenopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use&#xD;
             of a contraceptive method; Child-bearing potential and is abstinent or agrees to use&#xD;
             one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by&#xD;
             the product label or investigator) before the start of dosing to sufficiently minimise&#xD;
             the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception&#xD;
             until at least 2 days post the last dose of study treatment ; Abstinence from&#xD;
             penile-vaginal intercourse must be consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
             of the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severity of disease: A best pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of &gt;=40% to &lt;=85% of the predicted&#xD;
             normal value at Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit). . Percent predicted will be&#xD;
             calculated using the European Respiratory Society Global Lung Function Initiative&#xD;
             reference equations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reversibility of disease: Demonstrated &gt;=12% and &gt;=200 mL reversibility of FEV1 within&#xD;
             10 to 40 minutes after 2 to 4 inhalations of salbutamol inhalation aerosol (or&#xD;
             equivalent nebulised treatment with salbutamol solution) at Visit 1 (Screening and&#xD;
             Run-in Visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current anti-asthma therapy: All subjects must be using an ICS with or without LABA&#xD;
             for at least 8 weeks and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening&#xD;
             and Run-in Visit). Two populations are eligible for enrolment: Subjects maintained on&#xD;
             ICS monotherapy (Budesonide 400 mcg to 800 mcg BID or equivalent) for at least 8 weeks&#xD;
             and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit) or&#xD;
             Subjects maintained on an ICS/LABA combination product (e.g., NEUMOTEROL 200/6 BID or&#xD;
             400/12 mcg BID or equivalent by other combination products or by separate inhalers)&#xD;
             for at least 8 weeks and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening&#xD;
             and Run-in Visit). Subjects taking budesonide/formoterol as needed must switch to&#xD;
             maintenance dosing (excluding the highest dose) with use of a SABA for symptom relief&#xD;
             at least 8 weeks and a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Screening and&#xD;
             Run-in Visit). NOTE: Subjects on low dose ICS monotherapy should only be enrolled, if,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the investigator, after review of their medical history and clinical&#xD;
             examination, they will be able to benefit from both an increase in ICS dose and the&#xD;
             addition of LABA therapy arising from and ICS/LABA combination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to withhold LABA therapy : Other than what is provided during the study, LABA&#xD;
             therapy is not permitted on the day of Visit 1(Screening and Run-in Visit) and&#xD;
             throughout the entire study. The last dose of pre-study LABA and LABA/ICS combinations&#xD;
             are to be taken on the day before Visit 1. According to investigators judgement,&#xD;
             patients should be able to withhold LABA therapy during the run-in and wash-out&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SABA: All subjects must be able to replace their current SABA treatment with rescue&#xD;
             salbutamol at Visit 1 (Screening and Run-in Visit) for use as needed for the duration&#xD;
             of the study. Subjects must be able to withhold salbutamol for at least 6 hours before&#xD;
             each study visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver safety criteria: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;=2×the upper limit of normal&#xD;
             (ULN), Alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5×ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5×ULN is&#xD;
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin is &lt;35%) at Visit 1&#xD;
             (Screening and Run-in Visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Electrocardiography (ECG) safety criteria : The subject must have no ECG abnormalities&#xD;
             that would, in the opinion of investigator, compromise subject safety, or&#xD;
             significantly affect subject's ability to complete the trial. As such, the&#xD;
             investigator will determine the clinical significance of any ECG abnormality and&#xD;
             determine if a subject is precluded from entering the study. At Visit 1 (Screening and&#xD;
             Run-in Visit), ECG safety criteria must be: QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc)&#xD;
             &lt;450 microseconds (msec) or QTc &lt;480 msec for patients with bundle branch block. The&#xD;
             QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to either Bazett's formula&#xD;
             (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), or another method, machine or manual overread.&#xD;
             The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate ECGs obtained&#xD;
             over a brief recording period. Investigators will be responsible for ensuring&#xD;
             appropriate clinical interpretation of ECGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject and/or the subject's legal guardian (if applicable) must be capable of&#xD;
             giving informed consent/assent, which includes compliance with the study requirements&#xD;
             and restrictions listed in the consent/assent form&#xD;

Regimen A: 1 inhalation of budesonide/formoterol fumarate (BFF), 400/12 microgram [mcg] (NEUMOTEROL 400) by single capsule inhaler each morning and evening. Regimen B: 1 inhalation of BFF 320/9 mcg (SYMBICORT FORTE) by turbuhaler inhaler each morning and evening. Additionally all participants were allowed to take rescue medication (salbutamol 100 mcg) during the study.</description>

        <description>FEV1 is maximal amount of air, forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 is defined as morning prebronchodilator and predose: 12 hours (h) after last evening dose D28 at end of each TP. Measured by spirometer in morning, before using bronchodilator and pre-dosing at wk1 D1 and wk4 D29 of each TP and test was performed within 30 minutes prior to dosing. Change from BL was analysed using mixed effects ANCOVA model fitting terms for subject-level (SL) BL, Adjusted period-specific (PS) BL, treatment group and period, with participant as random effect. PS BL value is pre-dose assessment collected on D1 of each TP. SL BL is arithmetic mean of PS BL values of participant. If only one of PS BL value is missing for participant, SL BL took value of other BL. If both PS BL values were missing, SL BL was set to missing. Period level BL=PS BL - associated SL BL.</description>

It comprised of five possible answers to each question, associated with a score of 1 to 5 (1=poor control and 5=good control), wherein the scores from each question were summed to give an overall score (5=poor control and 25=complete control). ACT was recommended during each visit and was completed by the participant before any procedures were performed, avoiding any influence of the participants response. Change from BL was analysed using mixed effects ANCOVA model fitting terms for subject-level (SL) BL, Adjusted period-specific(PS) BL, treatment group and period, with participant as random effect. PS BL value, is pre-dose assessment collected on D1 of each TP. SL BL, is arithmetic mean of PS BL values of participant.
