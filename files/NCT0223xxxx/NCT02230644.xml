  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 4.6 million operations are undertaken each year in England alone. Of these, many&#xD;
      patients experience psychological distress, which has negative implications for patient&#xD;
      recovery. Indeed, psychological stress, in particular both trait and state anxiety, anger and&#xD;
      distress, has been linked with slower wound healing (Broadbent et al., 2003) and more&#xD;
      complicated post-operative recovery (Johnston and Wallace, 1990).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, pre-operative psychological interventions can have significant positive effects on&#xD;
      components of of post-operative recovery (Navros et al., 2011; Weinman and Johnston, 1988).&#xD;
      In particular, music has been studied in a series of randomised control trials as a way of&#xD;
      reducing pre-surgical stress. Studies have shown the effects of music in reducing levels of&#xD;
      stress hormones such as cortisol (Leardi et al., 2007) and reducing both heart rate and blood&#xD;
      pressure, and have also found music to be more effective than benzodiazepine at reducing&#xD;
      pre-surgical anxiety (Bringman et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust is a major surgical hospital,&#xD;
      performing over 15,000 adult operations annually. Consequently, strategies to reduce patient&#xD;
      anxiety and improve experience are amongst the hospital's priorities. A renovation of the&#xD;
      Surgical Admissions Lounge is currently underway with plans to incorporate visual arts and&#xD;
      music in waiting booths to relax and distract patients. When asked how relaxing they found&#xD;
      the space, patients at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital involved in a public consultation&#xD;
      rated the current unenhanced waiting area as 5.8/10, but 93% of patients said that relaxing&#xD;
      music would help them feel less anxious. This project will test whether music and art in the&#xD;
      SAL actively reduce adult patient stress compared to normal unenhanced waiting spaces, with a&#xD;
      view to extending the arts interventions to other surgical waiting areas such as the day&#xD;
      treatment centre if there are significant positive findings.&#xD;

      Stress can be measured via a number of methods, including both psychological and&#xD;
      physiological. This study proposes to examine three signatures of stress in order to&#xD;
      triangulate data and achieve a more comprehensive understanding of patients' stress response:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Psychological - we will use validated psychological questionnaires including STAI to&#xD;
           measure both trait and state anxiety. We will also be using a simple prospective time&#xD;
           perception test and a Stroop test to assess whether patients' attention capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physiological - We will use biosensors and bioharnesses to gather electrocardiogram&#xD;
           (ECG) data in order to test the complexity loss hypothesis. This hypothesis states that&#xD;
           the physiological responses of organisms under constraints (ageing, illness, stress)&#xD;
           exhibit grossly reduced dynamics and lose the ability to adopt to the changes in the&#xD;
           environment. We will examine whether patients exhibit these reduced dynamics as their&#xD;
           operation approaches and whether the arts can be used to increase the complexity of&#xD;
           their responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Biological - we will take two small saliva (spit) samples from patients to test whether&#xD;
           levels of stress hormones such as cortisol are elevated in patients, and whether other&#xD;
           immune biomarkers such as pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1 are reduced by&#xD;
           pre-surgical stress but maintained when music and art are present. Previous research&#xD;
           within the field of psychoneuroimmunology suggests that alterations in psychological&#xD;
           stress levels have consequences for biological response (Ader, 2007).&#xD;
