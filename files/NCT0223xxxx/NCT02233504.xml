    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to examine the hematologic response rate of Exjade® in patients&#xD;
      with AML and high risk MDS and chronic iron overload from blood transfusions. Deferasirox has&#xD;
      been developed as an iron-chelating agent, and unlike deferoxamine, a previously developed&#xD;
      iron chelator, deferasirox has the advantage of oral administration.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  AML that is refractory or relapsed after treatment with a non-intensive regimen, and&#xD;

             drugs while participating in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption,&#xD;
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of study drug&#xD;
