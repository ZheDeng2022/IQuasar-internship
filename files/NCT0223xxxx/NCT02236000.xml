      This study is being done for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study has two parts. The purpose of the first part (Phase I) of the study is to find&#xD;
           out the highest dose of neratinib that can be given safely with T-DM1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The purpose of the second part of the study (Phase II) is to find out whether the dose&#xD;
           of neratinib with T-DM1 determined in Phase I will keep breast cancer from getting worse&#xD;
           for a period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order to learn more about study therapy levels in blood and discover genetic and&#xD;
           protein changes associated with cancer, the study includes special research tests using&#xD;
           samples from blood and from breast tumor. Blood samples will be collected before study&#xD;
           treatment, once during treatment, and after study treatment stops.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the optional part of this study, three biopsies will be performed to obtain fresh&#xD;
           tumor samples from an area where your cancer has spread.&#xD;

      The FB-10 study is designed as an open label, single arm, Phase Ib/II study with a&#xD;
      dose-escalation phase and an expanded cohort (phase II) to evaluate the combination of&#xD;
      trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) with neratinib in women with metastatic, HER2-positive breast&#xD;
      cancer. The primary aim of the phase Ib portion of this study is to determine the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the two-drug combination. The primary aim of the phase II portion is to&#xD;
      demonstrate efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive concurrent therapy with T-DM1 (3.6 mg/kg IV) on Day 1 of a 3-week (21&#xD;
      day) cycle and neratinib as a continuous daily oral dose. The neratinib dose-escalation will&#xD;
      include 4 dose levels (120 mg, 160 mg, 200 mg, and 240 mg). At the recommended phase II dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) of the T-DM1 and neratinib combination, up to 39 additional patients will be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of the phase I portion of the study will be between 2 and 24 patients. The&#xD;
      sample size of the Phase II portion will be 42 patients. Approximately 6 patients at the&#xD;
      Phase I RP2D level will be included in the Phase II portion. The total study enrollment will&#xD;
      be a maximum of 63 patients. Accrual is expected to occur over 16 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Submission of diagnostic tumor samples and blood samples for FB-10 correlative science&#xD;
      studies will be a study requirement for all patients. Blood samples will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline, at Cycle 2, Day 1, and at progression. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      determination will be collected at Phase 1 sites from consenting patients at various time&#xD;
      points during the first 24 hours of study therapy (Cycle 1, Days 1 and 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An optional tumor biopsy will be procured from consenting patients from an accessible site of&#xD;
      metastasis before study dose level assignment (after the patient has signed the consent form&#xD;
      and has been screened for eligibility), after Cycle 1 of treatment, and at the time of&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
