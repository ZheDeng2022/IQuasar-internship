  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uterine artery embolization (UAE) is commonly used to treat symptomatic uterine leiomyomata&#xD;
      through induction of infarction and subsequent hyaline degeneration. This could be followed&#xD;
      with variable severity of pain that lasts for several days after the procedure secondary to&#xD;
      the resulted global uterine ischemia and fibroid infarction. Pain after UAE has been&#xD;
      described as moderate to severe cramping increasing over the first 2 hours after UAE to reach&#xD;
      plateaus for 5 to 8 hours before it rapidly decreases to a much lower level.1 The severity of&#xD;
      pain after UAE seems unrelated to the uterine or fibroid size which makes the severity of&#xD;
      pain is unpredictable.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain management after UAE most often consists of a combination of a non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen and an opioid. However severe pain following&#xD;
      embolization of the uterine arteries may require large doses of parenteral opioids for relief&#xD;
      with added unwanted effects.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, patients received morphine intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA)&#xD;
      after UAE needed considerable amounts of morphine (median [range] 24 mg [0-86 mg]) during the&#xD;
      first 24 h after embolization.3 The addition of ketamine to IV-PCA failed to reduce morphine&#xD;
      consumption for the first 24 hours after UAE. 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, the use of lumbar epidural anesthesia has been standardized as the anesthetic&#xD;
      choice for uterine artery embolization as it improves patients satisfaction and reduces the&#xD;
      severity of post-procedural pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although some investigators suggest an epidural analgesia for pain control after UAE,4 the&#xD;
      use of continuous lumbar epidural infusion of ropivacaine does not improve quality of pain&#xD;
      management after UAE.5&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus in an observational study included few patients, the investigators demonstrated&#xD;
      considerable postoperative analgesia lasted for 24 hours after UAE with the combined use of&#xD;
      patient-controlled thoracic epidural analgesia (PCEA) and rectal diclofenac.6 However, the&#xD;
      catheterization of thoracic epidural space in such low-risk patients has many logistic&#xD;
      issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to the best of our knowledge, there is no available comparative randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      compares the use of continuous and patient-controlled lumbar epidural analgesia after UAE.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the use of a patient-controlled lumbar epidural analgesia&#xD;
      (PCEA) will reduce pain scores and improve patient's satisfaction after uterine artery&#xD;
      embolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is aiming to compare the efficacy of PCEA and continuous epidural infusion&#xD;
      of bupivacaine 0.125% with fentanyl 2 µg/ml on the quality of postoperative analgesia after&#xD;
      UAE. Furthermore, the investigators aim to study the correlations between the severity of&#xD;
      pain after UAE and the number and size of uterine leiomyomata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following obtaining of the Local Ethics Committee approval and informed patient consent,&#xD;
      sixty patients, aged 18years or older, undergoing routine elective UAE embolization for&#xD;
      uterine leiomyomata under epidural anesthesia will be included in this prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, controlled, double-blind, comparative study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the morning before embolization, the patients will be instructed in the use of the PCA&#xD;
      pump and a VAS. The patients will be asked to rate their experienced pain using the VAS from&#xD;
      0 to 100 mm with 0 representing no pain and 100 representing the worst imaginable pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the procedure an 18 to 20 G intravenous access will be established. Patient monitors&#xD;
      includes electrocardiograph, non-invasive blood pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, and&#xD;
      respiratory rate. All patients will be premedicated with iv midazolam 0.03 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lumbar epidural catheter (22-G, B. Braun, Germany) will be placed in L2-4 position using&#xD;
      loss of resistance to air and saline on the morning of the procedure. Aspiration and&#xD;
      injection of a 3-mL test dose with 2% lidocaine will be used to exclude accidental&#xD;
      intravascular or subarachnoid catheter position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia technique will be standardized for all women. A loading epidural dose of 20 ml of&#xD;
      0.25% bupivacaine with 2 μg/ml of fentanyl will be administered in divided 5 ml top-up doses.&#xD;
      Epidural catheterization and anesthesia will be done by the attending anesthesiologists who&#xD;
      will not be involved in the postoperative assessment of the patient and who is unaware of the&#xD;
      patient's group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Femoral artery will be cannulated with a 2.0 mm sheath of the embolization catheters and UAE&#xD;
      will be performed by the same expert interventional radiologist with use of 355-500 μm&#xD;
      polyvinyl alcohol particles (Boston Scientific and Cordis, Natick, MA, USA) suspended in 10&#xD;
      ml of iodixanol 270 mg I/ml (Visipaque; Nycomed Amersham, London, UK) mixed with 20 ml of&#xD;
      isotonic saline. Embolization will be continued until cessation of UAE blood flow occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of the procedure and decannulation of the femoral artery, the patients&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated into two groups using computer generated randomization codes&#xD;
      included in sealed opaque envelopes&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to our adopted protocol, all patients will receive iv infusion of paracetamol 1 g&#xD;
      every 6 hours and lornoxicam 8 mg every 12 hours. if patients reached a VAS of ≥ 70 mm&#xD;
      despite achieving the maximum preset hourly infusion rates (i.e. 15 ml/hour and 6 ml/hour in&#xD;
      the CEA and PCEA groups, respectively), the protocol allows the attending anesthesiologist,&#xD;
      who will not be involved in collection of patient data, to unlock the pump temporarily to&#xD;
      administer epidural top-up doses of 5 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine plus 2 μg/ml fentanyl every 10&#xD;
      min as required irrespective of the randomization code. If the top-up doses exceeds 25 ml&#xD;
      without pain reduction of ≥ 20 mm, an iv bolus injection of 100 mg tramadol will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, side effects like as nausea, vomiting, itching, hypotension and bradycardia&#xD;
      will be assessed and recorded. Nausea and vomiting will be treated with iv granisetron 1 mg.&#xD;
      Troublesome pruritus will be treated with chlorpromazine hydrochloride 25 mg im. The patients&#xD;
      will be discharged from the hospital after a one-night stay in the hospital. After discharge,&#xD;
      pain will be controlled with oral lornoxiacam and paracetamol-codeine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using retrospective data from our centre in women received the standard continuous epidural&#xD;
      analgesia, a sample size of minimum 30 patients per group was calculated with a study power&#xD;
      of 90% to detect a 20% statistically significant difference in the cumulative consumption of&#xD;
      bupivacaine for 24-hours after UAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be expressed as mean ± SD and analysed using Student 't' test, Mann-Whitney U test&#xD;
      and chi square test where appropriate. Linear regression will be performed to define the&#xD;
      correlation between the severity of pain as regarding the VAS and the number and size of&#xD;
      uterine leiomyomata. P &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
