  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to build a mathematical model to explain the effect of two doses of&#xD;
      azilsartan (40 and 80 mg) upon metabolic (insulin resistance, glucose) and inflammatory&#xD;
      parameters (cytokines) in function of &quot;metabolic strata&quot; like obesity, type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, hypertension and their combinations.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are data supporting angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1) antagonist have beneficial&#xD;
      effects on metabolic control due to some pleiotropic effect mediated by peroxisome&#xD;
      proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma induction. Azilsartan is a prodrug absorbed in&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract that can improve metabolic milieu under diverse conditions like&#xD;
      obesity, hypertension (can be considered a metabolic disease) or type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      Clinical studies that have been raised in this regard are few, and still show controversial&#xD;
      issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of any study with AT1 antagonist drug interested in pleiotropic effects should&#xD;
      not only focus on antihypertensive improvement, but also the effect on other areas such as&#xD;
      metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates in obese and/or type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, open labeled, clinical study. The aim is to build a mathematical&#xD;
      model for supporting the effect of azilsartan 40 or 80 mg on metabolic and inflammatory&#xD;
      measurements in function of metabolic conditions (i.e. obesity, type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      hypertension, and their combinations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified according to their metabolic status and randomized by blocks of&#xD;
      four for each strata. This strategy will help to maintain each treatment group in balance.&#xD;
      All subjects will receive the treatment for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who attend the outpatient consultation at the Hospital General de Mexico will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in the study. Those who meet the inclusion criteria must sign an&#xD;
      informed consent approved by the ethics committee. This document describes the follow-up&#xD;
      visits as described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit (V-1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This visit includes patient history, physical examination (weight, height, waist&#xD;
      circumference and blood pressure) and a blood sample for measurement of: complete blood&#xD;
      count, fasting glucose, HbA1c, creatinine, adiponectin, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, liver&#xD;
      function tests, C-reactive protein, blood chemistry, proteinuria, 24-hours urinary glucose&#xD;
      and creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial visit (V0):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination will be performed and blood samples for oral glucose tolerance test will&#xD;
      be drawn at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes, with these data points the Matsuda insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity index will be calculated. Pharmacological treatment of 40mg or 80mg azilsartan 4&#xD;
      weeks will be assigned (open labeled but randomized).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 and 2 (V1, V2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      These visits performed at 4 and 8 weeks respectively include: physical examination, recording&#xD;
      of adverse events and medication count to check adherence to treatment accomplishment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (V3):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 12 include physical examination, adverse events registration, complete blood count,&#xD;
      fasting glucose, HbA1c, creatinine, adiponectin, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-10, TNF - α, liver function&#xD;
      tests, C reactive protein, blood chemistry, proteinuria, 24-hours urinary glucose and&#xD;
      creatinine. Furthermore an oral glucose tolerance test with samples at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120&#xD;
      minutes will be taken, to calculate the index of insulin sensitivity by the Matsuda method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and sample size. The sample size was calculated for ANCOVA analysis&#xD;
      considering 8 groups with 5 covariates. Considering an alpha error of 5%, effect size of 30%,&#xD;
      and statistical power of 90% a total sample of 250 patient was calculated. If we consider a&#xD;
      20% attrition of the sample, giving a total of 300 patients, i.e. 150 patients per treatment&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive analysis will be done. The contrast among groups will be analyzed by an ANCOVA&#xD;
      model and the function fitness will be calculated using ordinary least squares. Dependent&#xD;
      variables will be insulin sensitivity, proteinuria, stiffness of the carotid artery,&#xD;
      cytokines. Fixed factors: sex, blood pressure category, metabolic status, drug treatment.&#xD;
      Covariates: Age, waist circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The greatest expected size of effect would be within the group of patients with obesity,&#xD;
      hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (all three) treated with 80 mg and the lowest size&#xD;
      of effect within the group of only obesity treated with 40 mg.&#xD;
