  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first randomized, open-label, national, multicenter, phase II study&#xD;
      assessing the efficacy and safety of OCLU in subjects with pretreated progressive pancreatic,&#xD;
      inoperable, somatostatin receptor positive, well differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine&#xD;
      tumors (WDpNET). Subjects must have experienced documented progression of disease within 1&#xD;
      year prior to the start of the study. The control group of patients receiving Sutent will be&#xD;
      used as internal control to assess the hypothesis of 12 months PFS equal to 35% in patients&#xD;
      receiving Sutent.&#xD;
