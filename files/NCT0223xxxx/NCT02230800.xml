  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Side effects are common after treatment with radiotherapy for tumours in the pelvis and can&#xD;
      affect the way the bowel and urinary system work as well as causing sexual difficulties, skin&#xD;
      damage and bone problems. Problems in the bowel, bladder, sexual organs and skin mostly&#xD;
      result from thickening of the tissues in response to radiotherapy, a process called&#xD;
      &quot;fibrosis&quot;. Fibrosis often worsens over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been progress in treating bowel symptoms which usually are the worst problem after&#xD;
      radiotherapy. However, even after receiving the best possible treatments, while many patients&#xD;
      are better, they are often not cured of all their difficult problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For some years, it has been hypothesised that if fibrosis could be treated then symptoms&#xD;
      would improve. Recent research in laboratory animals has suggested that an effective&#xD;
      treatment for radiation-induced fibrosis is combination therapy with a drug called&#xD;
      Pentoxifylline together with a nutritional supplement containing gamma-tocotrienol (Tocovid&#xD;
      SupraBio), a substance derived from palm oil. Both of these agents are simple to take and&#xD;
      side effects are rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit volunteers who continue to have difficult side effects after previous&#xD;
      radiotherapy to the pelvis despite receiving the best treatments available from a unique&#xD;
      clinic at The Royal Marsden which has pioneered treatment for bowel problems after&#xD;
      radiotherapy. Two out of every three volunteers who take part, will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      treatment with Pentoxifylline and Tocovid SupraBio, while one out of three will receive dummy&#xD;
      pills. Neither the patients nor the staff assessing them will know which treatment they have&#xD;
      been given. Volunteers take the active treatments or dummy tablets for a year and will be&#xD;
      assessed regularly while on treatment and for a year afterwards. This study will show whether&#xD;
      active treatment is more effective than dummy pills in improving the symptoms caused by&#xD;
      radiation-induced fibrosis.&#xD;
