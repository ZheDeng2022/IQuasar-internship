  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last few years, early treatment of HIV-infected individuals, or &quot;treatment as&#xD;
      prevention (TasP), and pre-exposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs among HIV-negative&#xD;
      people at very high-risk of acquiring the infection (PrEP) have emerged as highly promising&#xD;
      biological preventive interventions to tackle the HIV pandemic within the framework of&#xD;
      combination prevention, a multi-component strategy that has been promoted for the last five&#xD;
      years. In West Africa, the evidence strongly suggests that female sex workers (FSWs)&#xD;
      contribute very disproportionally to the HIV spread. This is why the investigators propose&#xD;
      this TasP and PrEP demonstration project in Benin, where our group has been involved in HIV&#xD;
      prevention research in the sex work milieu for the last two decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a run-in phase for community preparedness and the development of a specific education&#xD;
      program on adherence, the investigators plan to recruit 100 HIV-infected FSWs in the TasP&#xD;
      component of the project (these women will receive a first-line antiretroviral treatment&#xD;
      (ART) regimen as per the Benin guidelines) and 250 HIV-negative FSWs in the PrEP component&#xD;
      (these women will receive Truvada®). The recruitment period will last for one year, followed&#xD;
      by an additional one year of follow-up, for a total follow-up period varying between 12 and&#xD;
      24 months, depending on when a given woman is recruited in the study. During follow-up visits&#xD;
      every three months, the investigators will closely monitor treatment adherence and changes in&#xD;
      sexual behaviour, including the use of viral load testing among TasP participants and&#xD;
      Truvada® plasma level testing for PrEP participants, as well as detection of&#xD;
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and Y-chromosome DNA in vaginal fluids in all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the feasibility of TasP and PrEP through a set of indicators,&#xD;
      including uptake, coverage, adherence, condom migration, occurrence of side effects and&#xD;
      development of drug resistance, whereas mathematical modeling will be used to predict the&#xD;
      potential impact of both interventions in the sex work milieu and the general population,&#xD;
      based on the actual set of indicators observed. The study will be completed by an economic&#xD;
      evaluation of the interventions and a cost-effectiveness analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the investigators will disseminate the results to the study population and to the&#xD;
      Beninese health authorities and ensure the broad implementation of these interventions in&#xD;
      Benin if the demonstration project shows that they are feasible and relevant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the end of 2012, sub-Saharan Africa was home to 71% of the 35.3 million people living with&#xD;
      HIV worldwide. Despite all the preventive and therapeutic efforts accomplished so far, the&#xD;
      epidemic is persisting with approximately 1,600,000 new HIV infections occurring yearly in&#xD;
      this region that is characterized by different epidemiological profiles. In West Africa, the&#xD;
      epidemic is disproportionally concentrated among female sex workers (FSWs) who are involved&#xD;
      directly or indirectly in 75% to 90% of HIV transmission cases towards the general population&#xD;
      through &quot;bridging&quot; populations, essentially their clients and other male sexual partners.&#xD;
      Hence, to achieve the control of the epidemic in this sub-region, especially in West Africa&#xD;
      where the epidemic is much less generalized than in many other parts of the continent, it is&#xD;
      important to tailor combination prevention including behavioural, structural, and biological&#xD;
      components for the sex work milieu in general and FSWs in particular, in addition to ensuring&#xD;
      adequate treatment of those already HIV-infected. However, despite substantial efforts in&#xD;
      usual prevention methods in the last 10 years and effective reductions in the prevalence of&#xD;
      HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) with concomitant increases in condom use&#xD;
      in some countries, HIV prevalence is still high among FSWs in West Africa, with these highly&#xD;
      vulnerable women having an HIV prevalence over 12 times higher than other women of&#xD;
      reproductive age. Such a situation could constitute a threat to the progress achieved in&#xD;
      controlling the HIV epidemic in this region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, in addition to previous preventive methods, such as consistent condom use and male&#xD;
      circumcision, early treatment (treatment as prevention, TasP) has been shown to decrease HIV&#xD;
      transmission by 96% in serodiscordant couples, whereas pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) based&#xD;
      on Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or on the latter drug plus Emtricitabine (Truvada®) has been&#xD;
      found to be 45 to 75% protective against HIV acquisition in four randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      when used orally; no protection at all was observed in two trials conducted among women at&#xD;
      high risk in African countries. These failures have now been shown to be mainly related to&#xD;
      issues of poor adherence to the study drugs rather than poor biological efficacy. On the&#xD;
      other hand, when combining data from several trials, the level of protection against HIV&#xD;
      acquisition reached 90% among the sub-groups of trial participants achieving high levels of&#xD;
      compliance. Based on the generally positive results obtained. Truvada® is now approved for&#xD;
      PrEP by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA. According to the Centers for&#xD;
      Disease Control and Prevention, PrEP is largely considered a preventive individual-level&#xD;
      intervention. However, it could potentially also have an impact at the population-level and&#xD;
      help control the HIV epidemic if rolled out and adopted on a large scale for HIV prevention,&#xD;
      especially among the most vulnerable populations. However, the feasibility of this approach&#xD;
      is somewhat questioned by the low treatment adherence levels achieved in trials recruiting&#xD;
      specifically highly vulnerable women in Africa. On the other hand, TasP can be viewed as a&#xD;
      more classical public health intervention, as its population-level impact will largely depend&#xD;
      on the coverage achieved in people at risk of transmitting HIV. However, the trial&#xD;
      demonstrating TasP efficacy was carried out in serodiscordant couples, a population where&#xD;
      treatment adherence may well be higher than in high-risk women who do not have a stable&#xD;
      partner and who have shown lower levels of compliance than most other groups in the PrEP&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all HIV-infected people, irrespective of their CD4&#xD;
      levels or clinical status (equivalent to TasP), is only recommended in the USA. However, the&#xD;
      World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) have&#xD;
      recently changed their recommendations on HIV treatment initiation of HIV positive&#xD;
      individuals, increasing the eligibility criteria to treat when CD4 levels reach 500 cells/mm3&#xD;
      compared to the previously recommended threshold of CD4&lt;350 cells/mm3. However, these changes&#xD;
      have so far not been widely implemented at the country-level. Despite the proven efficacy of&#xD;
      TasP and PrEP as prevention strategies in clinical trials, their efficiency must be evaluated&#xD;
      in 'real life' situations, in various countries with specific cultural contexts, largely&#xD;
      because the uptake of HIV testing, the acceptance of early treatment and PrEP as well as drug&#xD;
      adherence may vary considerably according to personal, social and cultural characteristics,&#xD;
      as clearly reflected by the variability in PrEP trial results. The absence of clear&#xD;
      recommendations on both prevention strategies in different countries is partly due to the&#xD;
      lack of evidence based on real world implementation especially amongst FSWs. The&#xD;
      investigators are thus proposing this demonstration project among FSWs in Cotonou, Benin, to&#xD;
      identify the best way to successfully implement TasP and PrEP in this specific setting. Benin&#xD;
      is facing a concentrated epidemic with HIV prevalence estimated at 1.2% in a recent general&#xD;
      population household survey, whereas HIV prevalence was estimated at 21% among FSWs in the&#xD;
      latest integrated biological and behavioural survey (IBBS) carried out in 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will use a field approach readily inserted within an ongoing combination&#xD;
      prevention intervention, including clinical (for ex.: HIV testing and care, STI care) ,&#xD;
      behavioural (for ex.: non-governmental organization- and peer-led condom promotion) and&#xD;
      structural components (for ex.: community empowerment, advocacy to decrease police&#xD;
      harassment; community development activities leading to the constitution of FSW-led community&#xD;
      based organizations), that the investigators implement in close collaboration with the&#xD;
      National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) in most of the major cities and towns of Benin through&#xD;
      a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR). The Dispensaire IST (DIST), a&#xD;
      STI clinic dedicated to FSWs in Cotonou, will be the study clinic for this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TasP makes sense as a public health intervention as long as high levels of coverage are&#xD;
      achieved in the high-frequency transmitter population targeted by this intervention. Hence,&#xD;
      the TasP component of the project will benefit from the ongoing CIHR/NACP interventions aimed&#xD;
      at increasing HIV testing among FSWs. Indeed, within this context, the investigators are&#xD;
      currently carrying out a study on the determinants of regular HIV testing, based on the&#xD;
      Theory of planned behaviour. The results of this study will be used to develop an education&#xD;
      program promoting 3-monthly HIV testing among FSWs that will be ready to implement prior to&#xD;
      the beginning of recruitment in the proposed study. The development of this program will use&#xD;
      the intervention mapping approach. Its implementation is already planned in all the coverage&#xD;
      area of our ongoing CIHR project. The latter project will also contribute by defining precise&#xD;
      indicators of success specifically for professional FSWs (e.g. those whose main source of&#xD;
      income is sex work who will constitute our target population), based on accurate estimations&#xD;
      of their population size. Indeed, the investigators are currently conducting a detailed&#xD;
      scientific mapping of the FSW population in the cities and towns covered by our ongoing&#xD;
      intervention. The results of this size estimation study will be available before the end of&#xD;
      2013 and will be used to establish the denominators for the testing and TasP coverage&#xD;
      indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrary to TasP, PrEP is an individual preventive intervention for which the coverage level&#xD;
      is of less importance. However, as the investigators are expecting that at least 60% of&#xD;
      HIV-negative FSWs will accept PrEP, it may also have preventive benefits at the overall FSW&#xD;
      population level. We have decided to combine TasP and PrEP in the same project for efficiency&#xD;
      and ethical reasons. Indeed, this approach implies that all FSWs consulting at the project&#xD;
      clinics will be offered some form of antiretroviral drugs with provision of adherence&#xD;
      counseling. In addition, on an ethical point of view and considering the community&#xD;
      perspective, it would be difficult to justify an approach where antiretroviral drugs would be&#xD;
      given to HIV-negative women while asymptomatic HIV-positive FSWs with &gt;350 CD4/mm³ are not&#xD;
      treated. Note that according to the current Benin national guidelines, ART is provided for&#xD;
      free to HIV-infected subjects with CD4&lt;350 CD4/mm³, but this could change during the course&#xD;
      of the study following the recently revised WHO guidelines proposing a threshold of 500&#xD;
      CD4/mm³ for treatment eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project is planned for three years: a 6-month phase-in period (submission of the&#xD;
      project to all relevant ethics committees, community preparedness activities, conduction of a&#xD;
      study on the determinants of the intention to adhere to ART regimens, for both HIV-positive&#xD;
      and HIV-negative women, and development of an adherence education program based on&#xD;
      theoretical frameworks and approaches similar to the ones used for the education program on&#xD;
      regular testing mentioned above, development of study procedures), a 25-month follow-up&#xD;
      period (including 12 months of active recruitment, and follow-up varying between 12 and 24&#xD;
      months) and a 5-month phase-out period to complete all the data entry, carry out the data&#xD;
      analysis and disseminate the study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the catchment area of the DIST, the investigators estimate that there are approximately&#xD;
      600 professional FSWs. Overall, the investigators are expecting to reach approximately 500&#xD;
      FSWs and to recruit and follow-up at least 90% of the HIV-positive (n~100) and at least 60%&#xD;
      of the HIV-negative under PreP (n~250). Women eligible to ART under current guidelines and&#xD;
      asymptomatic women with CD4 &gt;350 cells/mm³ (TasP component) will be offered locally approved&#xD;
      first line ART regimens while HIV-negative ones (PrEP component) will receive Truvada®. For&#xD;
      all the analyses on TasP, the investigators will compare the women enrolled under the TasP&#xD;
      component to those treated based on current national guidelines. Pregnant women and those&#xD;
      still breastfeeding will be excluded from the PrEP component of the project. Women eligible&#xD;
      to ART under current guidelines will receive their drugs through the NACP program, while&#xD;
      those on TasP or PrEP will be supplied in drugs by this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the potential impact of the combined TasP and PrEP interventions, the&#xD;
      investigators will first compare the HIV incidence observed during the study to the 1.4 per&#xD;
      100 person-years incidence estimate from a follow-up study carried out among FSWs in Cotonou&#xD;
      in the early 2010s. However, more importantly in terms of impact assessment, the&#xD;
      investigators will use sophisticated carefully calibrated mathematical modelling techniques&#xD;
      to estimate the impact of the intervention and each component on HIV transmission amongst&#xD;
      FSWs, their clients and the general population, following modelling and impact assessment&#xD;
      approaches previously developed for Cotonou and for the evaluation of Avahan, the India AIDS&#xD;
      Initiative of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the investigators will carry out prospective top down and patient level cost data&#xD;
      collection mainly using a provider perspective approach, but also some patients perspective&#xD;
      elements, and combine cost estimates with modeled impact projections in order to estimate the&#xD;
      incremental cost-effectiveness of TasP and/or PrEP per HIV infection and disability adjusted&#xD;
      life years (DALY) averted. Regression analysis will be used to determine if patient level&#xD;
      costs are related to FSW characteristics (frequency of commercial sex, level of condom use,&#xD;
      duration of sex work or age, and CD4 cell count at initiation of ART), ART provider or&#xD;
      TasP/PrEP adherence and outcomes, and if deemed important these heterogeneities in the costs&#xD;
      will be incorporated in modelling.&#xD;
