  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this research study to learn about how the skin heals after many&#xD;
      microscopic skin biopsies are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin-grafting is a life-saving procedure for people with large area skin wounds caused by&#xD;
      burns or trauma. Conventional autologous (self) skin grafting techniques require the creation&#xD;
      of large donor site wounds, causing numerous complications including pain, infection,&#xD;
      blistering, discoloration, and scarring. Based on previous research, many of these adverse&#xD;
      effects can be improved, or even eliminated, by harvesting skin tissue in very small&#xD;
      biopsies. These &quot;micro-biopsies&quot; are less than the size of a sewing pin. Then, they are put&#xD;
      back together into a skin graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This concept is based on clinical observations from fractional photothermolysis laser&#xD;
      therapy, an FDA approved laser that has been previously developed by the investigators&#xD;
      research group for the treatment of scars and ageing skin. With this laser technique,&#xD;
      thousands to millions of small burns are produced by laser on a patient's skin, and the skin&#xD;
      responds by healing the damaged areas to create new healthy skin within days and without&#xD;
      scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the results of laser treatment are well-known, it is not known what happens when we&#xD;
      harvest the skin using needles instead of using the laser to cut the skin. The investigators&#xD;
      also would like to understand how the body heals the skin. Understanding how this works helps&#xD;
      in understanding wound healing, and may lead to future treatments for healing large wounds,&#xD;
      disfiguring burn scars, and preventing scar formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A tummy tuck (abdominoplasty surgery) is done to remove excessive skin of the belly. This is&#xD;
      an elective surgery, in other words, it is optional and usually done for cosmetics reasons&#xD;
      (to improve the appearance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skin of the belly that is removed during an abdominoplasty surgery (tummy tuck) is&#xD;
      discarded. The skin of the area removed is called &quot;pre-abdominoplasty skin&quot;. The&#xD;
      investigators would like to study the effects of the micro-biopsies on pre-abdominoplasty&#xD;
      skin to exam how the skin heals over time and to study the skin that will be removed during&#xD;
      the abdominoplasty surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study. Pilot studies are done on a small group of subjects to learn if a&#xD;
      larger study would be useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are asking subjects to take part in this study who are healthy with an&#xD;
      abdominoplasty surgery (tummy tuck) scheduled at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) by a&#xD;
      plastic surgeon .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll about 28 subjects in this research study, all at MGH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Department of Defense is paying for this study to be done.&#xD;

    <time_frame>day 0, 24 h, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>A Major side effect is defined as an intolerable side effect that would warrant the cessation of treatment because of a risk to the subject's health or because the subject could not tolerate the treatment due to a subjective personal measure (e.g. severe pain). A Minor side effect is a side effect that while uncomfortable would not threaten the subject's health or cause the cessation of treatment due to lack of comfort.&#xD;
Major side effects include: severe pain (Pain ≥ 8/10 on VAS scale), severe blistering (with potential for secondary infection) and ulceration with scarring. Subjects will be asked for each site to fill in the following sentence: &quot;The side effects I experienced with micro biopsies were: &quot;0: Did not have this side effect / 1: Mild / 2: Moderate / 3: Severe Swelling, Redness, Scabs, Pus or pus blisters, Scaling, Itchy skin, Erosion, Tanning, Lightening of the skin, Minor blistering, Wheals, Bleeding, Folliculitis, Oozing, Numbness</description>

    <description>The VAS will be completed by study subject at baseline and at each follow-up visit for each test site.&#xD;
Pain is any of the following: sensation of tingling, stinging, prickling, or burning feeling, heat under the skin, tenderness, mild, moderate or severe pain).&#xD;
Specific VAS form is attached&#xD;
Subjects will be asked to circle the number below that most closely corresponds to pain associated with each treatment site.&#xD;

    <description>After the subject's elective abdominoplasty procedure, the excised skin will be collected. Samples will be taken from the excised skin in areas where micro skin biopsies were harvested at time 0 (visit 2). Since all tissue samples are collected from skin that has already been excised during abdominoplasty surgery, the collection of samples for histopathology poses no additional risk for the subjects.</description>

    <measure>Subject Satisfaction Survey - Change from baseline side-effects at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, 24h, 1, 2, 4 &amp; 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In this survey, subjects are given a list of the side effects of the micro-biopsies before treatment (Visits1-7) and are asked to rate each question on a scale of 1 to 5. After treatment, they are given this specific survey (but specific to each treatment site) after each month of treatment as a repeated measure of side effects, before and after each procedure. They will be asked the question based on the treatment site name, if they consider the treatment cosmetically acceptable. For example:&#xD;
Answer the questions bellow with a number:&#xD;
5 Agree Strongly 4 Agree 3 Neutral 2 Disagree 1 Disagree Strongly The treatment performed on the SITE 1 (same for other sites SITES) SITE 1 treatment is safe SITE 1 treatment is cosmetically sound (Do you think it looks ok?). The side effects of SITE 1 treatment are tolerable.</description>

    <description>This is a prospective, self-controlled study of the healing response after collecting micro skin biopsies of different sizes (from 200 µm to 2 mm in diameter) from up to seven 1.5 x 1.5 cm biopsy sites in pre-abdominoplasty skin areas that are scheduled for surgical removal. The collection procedure will be performed using similar techniques as standard skin biopsies: the skin area involved will be cleaned with alcohol pads, and 1% buffered lidocaine with epinephrine anesthesia will be administered locally, then micro biopsies of skin will be removed by biopsy punch/harvesting needle. No more than 10% of the skin area within each biopsy site will be collected. Tattoo ink as described will be applied to 4 micro-biopsies at the corners of each biopsy test site</description>
