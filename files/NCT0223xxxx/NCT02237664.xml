  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic surgery is commonly associated with severe postoperative pain and marked impairment&#xD;
      of respiratory function.1 Minimally invasive video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) is&#xD;
      assumed to result in better quality of life and less postoperative pain compared with&#xD;
      standard open thoracotomy, other investigators have reported comparable patient-reported&#xD;
      physical component summary and pain scores after VATS and thoracotomy during the first 12&#xD;
      months after lung resection.2 That study was non-randomized and 41% of the included patients&#xD;
      did not complete the follow-up period.2 VATS has recently been increasing in popularity as a&#xD;
      fast-track surgery with potential enhanced recovery after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variety of approaches exist to manage pain after thoracotomy which could attenuate&#xD;
      post-thoracotomy pulmonary dysfunction. Epidural analgesia has been considered for many&#xD;
      decades to be the best method of pain relief after major thoracic surgery. In previous&#xD;
      meta-analyses,3-5 many investigators have reported that thoracic paravertebral blockade (PVB)&#xD;
      has comparable analgesic effects to thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) in patients undergoing&#xD;
      thoracotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, PVB has a better side-effect profile, lower rates of failed block and is&#xD;
      associated with a reduction in pulmonary complications.3-5 This could be extended to VATS to&#xD;
      enhance recovery after surgery owing to effective analgesia and fewer side effects.6-7&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) has been advocated as a favourable model for postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia, that allows a perfect match between intensity of pain and analgesic delivery,&#xD;
      improves the quality of analgesia and decreases the cumulative analgesic consumption.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the introduction of patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) with background&#xD;
      infusion during labour gave patients a sense of control over their analgesia, reduced the&#xD;
      total dose of local anesthetic administered, and had less motor block than those who receive&#xD;
      continuous epidural analgesia.8-9Patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) has become&#xD;
      increasingly popular for pain control after thoracotomy.10-12 In a previous preliminary&#xD;
      study, McElwain et al.13 have reported satisfactory analgesia after breast cancer surgery&#xD;
      with the use of PC-PVB, using either 15-min or 30-min lockout, that study did not include a&#xD;
      comparative arm with a continuous paravertebral infusion. Furthermore, Abou Zeid et al. have&#xD;
      reported comparable analgesia after thoracic surgery with the use of either&#xD;
      patient-controlled PVB had with the use of intrathecal morphine, that study was not&#xD;
      controlled and included few patients.14&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of the patient-controlled paravertebral blockade (PC-PVB) on the quality of&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia and pulmonary function after VATS has not yet been studied.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesizes that the use of patient-controlled paravertebral blockade (PC-PVB) after VATS&#xD;
      will be associated with lower pain scores and less pulmonary dysfunction than continuous&#xD;
      paravertebral blockade (PVB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following obtaining of the Local Ethics Committee approval and informed patient consent, 62&#xD;
      patients, aged 18 -70 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status&#xD;
      II-III, undergoing elective VATS using postoperative thoracic paravertebral analgesia will be&#xD;
      included in this prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before operation, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and&#xD;
      peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), were measured. On the morning before surgery, the patients&#xD;
      will be instructed in the use of the PCA pump and a VAS. The patients will be asked to rate&#xD;
      their experienced pain using the VAS from 0 to 100 mm with 0 representing no pain and 100&#xD;
      representing the worst imaginable pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the procedure an 18 to 20 G intravenous access will be established. Patient monitors&#xD;
      includes electrocardiograph, non-invasive blood pressure, and pulse oximeter. All patients&#xD;
      will be premedicated with iv midazolam 0.01-0.03 mg kg-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the induction of general anesthesia, paravertebral space ipsilateral to the&#xD;
      thoracostomy will be identified 3 cm lateral to the spinous process of T5-8 with&#xD;
      ultrasound-guidance (USG) using a high-frequency linear array probe of a Sonosite MTurbo&#xD;
      ultrasound machine (MicroMaxxs ultrasound system, Sonosite Inc, Bothell, WA). After the probe&#xD;
      was placed at the level of the T5-6 interspace, the apex of the paravertebral space will be&#xD;
      visualized as a wedge-shaped hypoechoic space surrounded by the hyperechoic line of the&#xD;
      pleura below and the internal intercostal membrane above. An 18 G Tuohy needle (B. Braun,&#xD;
      Germany) will be inserted in a lateral-to-medial direction using an in-plane approach and&#xD;
      will be kept advancing until the needle tip penetrates the internal intercostal membrane.7 A&#xD;
      20-G epidural catheter (B. Braun, Germany) will be introduced through Tuohy needle and&#xD;
      advanced 3 cm into the paravertebral space. After gentle aspiration, a test dose of 3 mL of&#xD;
      bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine 5 µg mL-1 will be administered through the catheter. If no&#xD;
      significant rise in heart rate or arterial pressure will be observed, a bolus of 0.3 mL kg-1&#xD;
      of bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine (5 µg mL-1), followed by continuous paravertebral&#xD;
      infusion of bupivacaine 0.25% and fentanyl 2 µg mL-1 at 0.1 mL kg-1 h-1 intraoperatively.15&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, standard monitors and state and response entropy (SE and RE, respectively,&#xD;
      GE Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland) based-depth of anesthesia will be applied. The radial&#xD;
      artery will be catheterized. Anesthetic technique will be standardized in all studied&#xD;
      patients. After preoxygenation, general anesthesia will be induced with propofol 1.5-3 mg&#xD;
      kg-1 and target-controlled infusion (TCI) of remifentanil at an effect-site concentration&#xD;
      (Ce) of 4 ng mL-1, to achieve the SE values below 50 and the difference between RE and SE&#xD;
      below 10. Rocuronium (0.5 mg kg-1) will be given to facilitate the endobronchial intubation&#xD;
      with a left-double lumen endobronchial tube and the correct position of its tip will be&#xD;
      confirmed with a fiberoptic bronchoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia will be maintained with 0.7-1.5 minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane and&#xD;
      remifentanil Ce of 2-4 ng mL-1 to maintain the SE values below 50, the difference between RE&#xD;
      and SE below 10 and the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate &lt;20% of baseline&#xD;
      values. Rocuronium increments will be used to maintain surgical relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two lung ventilation (TLV) will be instituted using fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.4&#xD;
      in air, tidal volume (VT) of 8 mL kg-1, inspiratory to expiratory (I: E) ratio of 1:2.5 and&#xD;
      PEEP of 5 cm H2O, and respiratory rate will be adjusted to achieve an arterial carbon dioxide&#xD;
      tension (PaCO2) of 4.7-6 kPa. During one-lung ventilation (OLV), the dependent lung will be&#xD;
      ventilated with a FiO2 of 1.0, VT of 6 mL kg-1 and I: E ratio, PEEP, and respiratory rate,&#xD;
      will be maintained as during TLV. The dependent lung will be recruited at 30-minute intervals&#xD;
      by increasing the inspiratory pressure to 40 cmH2O for 10 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgical procedures will be performed by the same surgeons who will be blinded for the&#xD;
      study group. The VATS procedure will begin with the exploration of the pleural cavity using a&#xD;
      30° video thoracoscopic camera through 1.5 cm single skin incision with the use of 1-3&#xD;
      trocars which enables the thoracoscopic instruments to move the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of surgery, the nondependent lung will be re-expanded, the remifentanil and&#xD;
      sevoflurane will be discontinued after chest closure and skin closure, respectively, and the&#xD;
      residual neuromuscular blockade will be antagonized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During working hours of the first 48 hours, the patients will be visited by an acute pain&#xD;
      nurse and/or a consultant anesthesiologist, who will interview each patient regarding&#xD;
      satisfaction with postoperative analgesia. After hours, an anesthetic registrar will be&#xD;
      available to review analgesia management. All patients will receive multimodal analgesia&#xD;
      consisting of regular IV paracetamol (1 g four times a day) and IV lornoxicam (8 mg two times&#xD;
      a day) for postoperative pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breakthrough pain, defined as pain VAS &gt; 30 mm, will be treated with a bolus of 0.1 mL kg-1&#xD;
      of paravertebral medication administered through the pump. No additional medication will be&#xD;
      given if the pain VAS &lt; 30 mm. If after 15 minutes pain VAS persists greater than 30,&#xD;
      additional 0.1 mL kg-1 of the paravertebral medication will be given. If the patient still&#xD;
      has a pain VAS &gt; 30 despite breakthrough pain intervention, then the patient will be&#xD;
      connected to PCA with intravenous morphine 1 mg, with a lockout interval of 8 minutes and a&#xD;
      maximum 4-hourly limit of 30 mg.5&#xD;
