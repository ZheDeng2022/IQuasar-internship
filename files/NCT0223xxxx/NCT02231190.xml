  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As per non-clinical studies, prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor GSK1278863 can protect muscle from&#xD;
      unaccustomed exercise induced muscle damage and enhance functional muscle repair. This study&#xD;
      is designed to investigate arm function, pain and other pharmacodynamic (PD) markers after&#xD;
      unaccustomed maximal eccentric exercise with concurrent administration of GSK1278863 or&#xD;
      placebo. Primary objective of the study is to evaluate the protective effects of GSK1278863&#xD;
      on eccentric exercise induced muscle injury. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (1&#xD;
      subject on GSK1278863 for every 1 subject on placebo). Each subject will be given five oral&#xD;
      doses of GSK1278863/placebo in total. The first dose will be administered immediately after&#xD;
      completion of eccentric exercise and then 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours later. Subjects will be&#xD;
      housed till day 4 in unit and will return for a follow-up visit 7-10 days after discharge.&#xD;
      After enrolment of approximately 30 subjects, enrolment will be paused and planned interim&#xD;
      analysis will be performed to decide whether to terminate enrolment/study, continue dosing or&#xD;
      to reduce the dose to 5 milligrams (mg).&#xD;
