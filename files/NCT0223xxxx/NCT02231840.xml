      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - About 17 million adults had an alcohol use disorder in 2012. Researchers want to follow&#xD;
      people that have alcohol problems and want treatment, as well as those who do not want&#xD;
      treatment and healthy volunteers. They also want to gather information on people with and&#xD;
      without alcohol problems, including information on genes and biological processes in the&#xD;
      body.. This will help them better understand, prevent, and treat alcohol problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To look at a broad range of traits in people who are healthy people and people with alcohol&#xD;
      problems. To study them for potential eligibility for other research protocols conducted at&#xD;
      the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults age 18 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not being pregnant or imprisoned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a physical exam. They will answer questions about their health&#xD;
           and alcohol and drug use. They will have an electrocardiogram to check their heart. They&#xD;
           will have blood, urine, and breath alcohol tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants without alcohol problems, or who have them but do not want treatment, can&#xD;
           sign the second consent for screening and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants that have alcohol problems and want treatment will be treated at the NIH&#xD;
           Clinical Center. They will be offered to sign the second consent at a later time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may join an inpatient treatment and detox program. It could last up to 6&#xD;
           weeks. Or they may join an outpatient program. Some may do both.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After discharge, participants may be called and asked questions about their drinking and&#xD;
           health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If participants sign the second consent, they:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  will complete paper- and computer-based questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  will give blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  may have a brain scan using magnetic resonance imaging. They will lie on a table that&#xD;
           slides in and out of a cylinder that takes pictures. The machine makes loud noises. They&#xD;
           will get earplugs.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study represents the natural history protocol for NIAAA with the main objectives of&#xD;
      providing deep phenotyping of patients across the alcohol use spectrum. This includes Alcohol&#xD;
      Use Disorders (AUD) patients, patients with problematic drinking, social drinking, and&#xD;
      patients who are abstinent (healthy volunteers, and other volunteers). We have two groups in&#xD;
      this study. Treatment-seeking individuals (Patients that want to stop alcohol use and will&#xD;
      require medical management to achieve sobriety) and non-treatment-seeking participants&#xD;
      (Patients who want to continue their current alcohol use). A standard set of data will be&#xD;
      collected in all patients allowing us to study the impact of alcohol use in their overall&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gather a set of characterization measures, including a standardized dataset of clinical,&#xD;
      behavioral, biochemical, and structural MRI-based phenotypic assessments, as well as whole&#xD;
      genome genotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized set of data collected consistently under this protocol that will allow&#xD;
      exploratory, descriptive, or correlational studies of alcohol use and AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll a total of 7500 participants. Any individual &gt;=18 years of age who expresses&#xD;
      interest in participating in this study and/or other research studies offered at NIAAA during&#xD;
      the brief telephone pre-screening may be enrolled. Participants may be individuals with no&#xD;
      current or past AUD, as well as individuals who meet current or past DSM criteria for AUD.&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and other volunteers will also be enrolled in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be seen at the Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be either admitted to the NIAAA 1SE unit for inpatient treatment and/or&#xD;
      will be seen in the NIAAA Outpatient Alcohol Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 years (12/31/2044)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment-seeking individuals will also be offered outpatient follow up for up to 3 months&#xD;
      after discharge from the inpatient unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two phone/email follow ups will be done at about 6 and 12 months from admission into the&#xD;
      inpatient unit. They might also be readmitted into the inpatient unit if they have a relapse.&#xD;
      If that is the case, a new set of data to assess progression of the illness will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-treatment-seeking participants will primarily be seen as outpatients and will have an&#xD;
      approximately 8-hour clinic visit. A second visit might be needed to finish collection of&#xD;
      characterization measures. These participants will only be brought back if they call&#xD;
      requesting treatment for AUD, in which case they will switch arms in the study (From&#xD;
      non-treatment-seeking to Treatment-seeking) and a new set of data might be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be considered active for up to one year after they sign consent. During&#xD;
      that year they might complete any testing described in this protocol, but most study&#xD;
      procedures are optional.&#xD;

        We will enroll a total of 7500 participants. Any individual (Bullet)18 years of age who&#xD;
        expresses interest in participating in this study and/or other research studies offered at&#xD;
        NIAAA during the brief telephone pre-screening may be enrolled. Participants may be&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        As this is a natural history protocol of alcohol use as a continuum, in order to be&#xD;
        eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet the following criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;=18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to complete the study including genetic and MRI tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will assign participants to one of two groups in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment-seeking individuals (Patients that want to stop alcohol use and will require&#xD;
             medical management to achieve sobriety) and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-treatment-seeking participants (Patients or healthy volunteers who want to&#xD;
             continue their current alcohol use).&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants are initially phone-screened for eligibility and their desire for&#xD;
        treatment of AUD (or lack of it) will determine their group allocation. Their self-report&#xD;
        of health status, pregnancy, legal status, and willingness to complete the study including&#xD;
        the genetics and MRI test will be assessed in the phone screen and determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        This is a natural history protocol of alcohol use as a continuum. Potential participants&#xD;
        are pre-screened on the phone and, based on the information provided on the phone, the&#xD;
        following categories are excluded because they are not suitable study participants for this&#xD;
        protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals &lt; 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant candidates&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidates having a severe medical or mental health disorder that would impair&#xD;
             participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants are initially phone-screened for eligibility: age, legal status,&#xD;
        pregnancy, and severe medical conditions will be assessed using information reported in the&#xD;
        phone screen to determine eligibility for the study.&#xD;
