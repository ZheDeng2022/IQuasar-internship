      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - WHIMS (Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections, and Myelokathexis Syndrome) is a rare&#xD;
      disease. It can cause cancers, infections, and warts. Researchers want to see if a drug&#xD;
      called plerixafor can treat WHIMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To compare plerixafor versus granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for preventing&#xD;
      infections in people with WHIMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People ages 10-75 with WHIMS who have a CXCR4 gene mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine&#xD;
           tests. They may have heart and spleen tests and body scans. They may have samples of&#xD;
           skin or warts taken. Researchers may take photographs of warts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will start twice daily self-injections of G-CSF. Their doctors will decide&#xD;
           the dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial Period (4-12 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  continue the injections and their usual antibiotics and/or immunoglobulin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have blood drawn&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  keep a daily health diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will visit the clinic for 2 days without injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjustment Period 1 (8 weeks):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  continue twice daily injections from home&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  continue the daily health diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have blood tests every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Year 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  receive either plerixafor or G-CSF injections twice daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  continue the health diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have blood tests every 2 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  visit the clinic about every 4 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of year 1, participants will visit the clinic for an evaluation. They will&#xD;
           switch to the other study drug. They will have an 8-week adjustment and 1-year treatment&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of year 2, participants will visit the clinic to complete their injections&#xD;
           and go back to their previous G-CSF regimen. Participants will continue their daily&#xD;
           health diary and have blood tests for 5-6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis syndrome (WHIMS) is a rare&#xD;
      combined primary immunodeficiency disorder caused by gain-of-function mutations in the gene&#xD;
      for the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Normally, CXCR4 is expressed on most leukocyte subsets and&#xD;
      functions in part to promote hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and neutrophil homing to and&#xD;
      retention in bone marrow. WHIM mutations alter the CXCR4 carboxyl terminus, which enhances&#xD;
      and prolongs receptor signaling. As a result, egress of normally produced and functional&#xD;
      neutrophils from the bone marrow to the blood is impaired causing neutropenia, a bone marrow&#xD;
      pathologic finding referred to as myelokathexis. A similar mechanism may also affect other&#xD;
      leukocyte subsets since WHIM patients usually are panleukopenic. Consequently, WHIM patients&#xD;
      are predisposed to frequent acute bacterial infections, especially in the sinopulmonary&#xD;
      tract, that may cause chronic morbidity, respiratory insufficiency and in some cases&#xD;
      premature death. WHIM patients also have marked difficulty clearing infections with Human&#xD;
      Papillomavirus (HPV), resulting in persistent cutaneous and anogenital warts that in several&#xD;
      reported cases have evolved into cancer. Several deaths have also occurred due to cancer&#xD;
      associated with Epstein -Barr virus (EBV) infection. Therapies currently used for WHIMS are&#xD;
      non-specific and expensive, and include Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) (the&#xD;
      drug currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat severe congenital&#xD;
      neutropenia), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and prophylactic antibiotics. None of these&#xD;
      measures has been formally evaluated for efficacy in WHIM syndrome (WHIMS); however, in our&#xD;
      clinical experience based on the treatment of 24 WHIM patients seen at the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health (NIH) since 2006, recurrent bacterial infections continue to occur,&#xD;
      despite the fact that the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) can be readily maintained above 500&#xD;
      cells/microliter by G-CSF and IgG levels can be restored to the normal range by IVIg. Thus,&#xD;
      there continues to be a major unmet medical need for effective therapy in WHIMS despite the&#xD;
      availability and application of best therapy for neutropenia and hypogammaglobulinemia in&#xD;
      these patients. Plerixafor (Mozobil ) is a specific small molecule antagonist of CXCR4,&#xD;
      licensed by the FDA for HSC mobilization for transplantation in cancer, and is therefore a&#xD;
      logical candidate for molecularly targeted treatment of WHIMS. The goal of treatment would be&#xD;
      to reduce CXCR4 signaling to normal, not to zero, thus, absent any off-target effects,&#xD;
      targeted chronic treatment with this agent may be safe. In this regard, 2 recent short term&#xD;
      Phase I dose-escalation studies of plerixafor, one from our group, in a total of 9 patients&#xD;
      demonstrated that the drug could safely mobilize not only neutrophils, but also all other&#xD;
      leukocyte subsets that are decreased in the blood of WHIM patients. A follow-up Phase I&#xD;
      study, conducted by our group, in 3 patients given plerixafor 0.02-0.04 mg/kg/d for 6 months&#xD;
      demonstrated that these hematopoietic effects were durable. Moreover, the frequency of&#xD;
      infection was reduced on plerixafor as compared to retrospective data mined for the three&#xD;
      years before starting therapy and prospective data collected for one year after ending&#xD;
      therapy, even though 2 of the patients were taking GCSF during the comparison time periods.&#xD;
      No new warts occurred during treatment and several existing warts improved or resolved.&#xD;
      Although these results are encouraging, the small number of patients studied, limited&#xD;
      duration of drug treatment, and retrospective mining of control data leave open to question&#xD;
      whether plerixafor is truly efficacious for clinical outcomes in WHIMS. The randomized,&#xD;
      double blinded, crossover trial described here is designed to answer this question by&#xD;
      establishing the long-term safety and clinical efficacy (primary endpoint: infection&#xD;
      severity; multiple secondary endpoints including wart control) of plerixafor as compared to&#xD;
      G-CSF in the treatment of WHIMS patients 10-75 years of age. G-CSF as a comparator is&#xD;
      required because of its approved use in patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief outline of study we intend to randomize 20 patients and treat them in a double-blinded&#xD;
      manner for 1 year with G-CSF and 1 year with plerixafor using a crossover design to allow&#xD;
      direct comparison of infection severity during treatment with both agents, at doses&#xD;
      determined by the patient s individual neutrophil response. A schedule of events has been&#xD;
      provided in Appendix A. Data will be analyzed as specified in the Statistics section (Section&#xD;
      14) after randomization. Tolerability and patient drug preference will also be assessed.&#xD;
