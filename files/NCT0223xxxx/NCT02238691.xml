  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous positive pressure during anesthetic induction is today not routinely used partly a&#xD;
      to the risk of gastric insufflation because of higher ventilatory pressures. However there&#xD;
      are conflicting data with improvement of GERD symptoms in CPAP treated OSA patients. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to compare the risk of gastric insufflation regarding mask ventilation&#xD;
      technique, with or without positive end expiratory pressure. For measurements a High&#xD;
      Resolution Impedance Manometry Catheter is used.&#xD;

      Anesthetic induction agents cause a number of physiological changes within the respiratory&#xD;
      system. Almost every induction agent causes apnoea. There is a reduction of FRC and an&#xD;
      increase in airway resistance. Combined with preoxygenation with a high fraction of oxygen&#xD;
      there is a significant risk of pulmonary atelectasis. Adding a continuous positive pressure&#xD;
      during ventilation of the apnoeic patient improves many of the respiratory effects caused by&#xD;
      induction agents. However the added continuous pressure will increase the total inspiratory&#xD;
      pressure and a high inspiratory pressure is associated with an increased risk of gastric&#xD;
      insufflation during mask ventilation. On the other hand there are data suggesting that&#xD;
      continuous positive pressure is beneficial in treatment of GERD-symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is, if performed correctly, that the continuous positive&#xD;
      pressure will not increase the risk of gastric insufflation. In order to investigate this&#xD;
      matter 30 healthy human subjects will undergo anesthetic induction, 15 with no PEEP added and&#xD;
      15 with a PEEP of 10 cm H2O during mask ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preoxygenation, 100 % oxygen via Face mask for 3 minutes with 0 PEEP or 10 cm H2O PEEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Start of Remifentanil Target Controlled Infusion, target concentration 6 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Propofol 2-2.5mg/kg to adequate depth of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 30 seconds after apnea mask ventilation with Dräger ZEUS IE starting with an inspiratory&#xD;
           pressure of 3cm H2O that is gradually increased to a maximum of 30 cm H20 or to signs of&#xD;
           air insufflation in the esophagus. Group 1 with 0 PEEP and group 2 with 10 cm H2O PEEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. End of Remifentanil- and Propofol infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressures and passage of air or liquid from pharynx to stomach will be continuously&#xD;
      registered during the procedure. For measurements a High Resolution Impedance Manometry&#xD;
      Catheter with the ability to measure pressures and impedance simultaneously will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The esophagus and the stomach is divided into four functional units for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The upper esophageal sphincter&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The esophageal body (3 cm below upper esophageal sphincter to 3 cm over the lower&#xD;
           esophageal sphincter)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The lower esophageal sphincter&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The stomach (3 cm below the lower esophageal sphincter)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different units are detected in pressure plots where the levels of pressure reflects the&#xD;
      anatomical units. Manometric values is specified in mmHg. For detection of passage of air and&#xD;
      flow of liquid an impedance baseline is set before measurements start. Passage of air is&#xD;
      defined as a sudden rise in impedance of 1 kΩ in anterograde direction. Detection of fluid is&#xD;
      defined as a 50% decline in impedance. For analysis of data Mano View analysis software is&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressures and impedance will be continuously recorded during the time frame from&#xD;
      preoxygenation to maximum inspiratory pressures are reached. Data will be analysed at each&#xD;
      level of pressure 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 cm H2O. Contained data will be statistically&#xD;
      compared between groups.&#xD;
