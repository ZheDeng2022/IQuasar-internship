      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Dopamine is a chemical signal linked to the rewarding effects of drugs. Certain genes make&#xD;
      these effects sensitive to the time of day they are taken. Cocaine can affect these genes in&#xD;
      the brain. Researchers want to measure brain dopamine at different times of day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To look for changes to a person s biological clock in the function of the dopamine reward&#xD;
      system. To test if cocaine disrupts this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults age 21-55 with a cocaine use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers age 21-55.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, interview, and blood&#xD;
           and urine tests. Their breath will be tested for alcohol and recent smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 3 overnight clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1: They will have blood and urine collected and a heart test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A plastic tube (catheter) will be placed into a vein in each arm by needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a PET scan in a donut-shaped machine. They will lie on a bed that&#xD;
           slides in and out of it, wearing a cap. A radiotracer (measures dopamine) and a drug&#xD;
           (blocks dopamine removal) will be injected via catheter. Vital signs will be measured&#xD;
           and blood will be drawn throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2: repeats Visit 1, except at night.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3, participants will have urine collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will have MRI scans in a metal cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field. They will&#xD;
           lie on a table that slides in and out of it, with a coil over their head.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may answer questions, take computer or paper tests, and perform simple&#xD;
           actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For 1 week, participants will wear a wrist device that measures daily activity.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess if there is disruption of circadian DA rhythms in cocaine&#xD;
      addiction. The secondary objective is to assess if dopamine modulates the sensitivity of the&#xD;
      brain reward network in a circadian dependent manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-treatment seeking cocaine abusers (moderate or severe cocaine use disorder as per DSM-IV&#xD;
      or DSM 5) and healthy controls. Males and females will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo two PET scans with [11C]raclopride using a bolus infusion paradigm&#xD;
      to assess baseline D2R availability followed by an infusion to assess changes in DA as&#xD;
      measured by [11C]raclopride s displacement following an intravenous injection of&#xD;
      methylphenidate (MP). They will also undergo a total of 4 MRI scans, two after placebo and&#xD;
      two after MP to assess the circadian variations in the sensitivity of the brain reward&#xD;
      network. The two [11C]raclopride scans will be done on separate days at least one week apart,&#xD;
      one in the morning starting between (7-9 AM) and one in the early evening (5-7 PM) and they&#xD;
      will be followed by an MRI scan to assess the sensitivity of the brain reward network under&#xD;
      the influence of MP in the morning (9-11AM) and in the evening (7-9 PM). For the Placebo MRI&#xD;
      scans participants will be tested either on separate days or on the morning of the evening&#xD;
      session or on the evening prior to the morning session. We will use the MRI scans to assess&#xD;
      the sensitivity of the brain reward circuit to visual presentation of drug or food cues and&#xD;
      to evaluate resting functional connectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measure is to assess if there are differences in DA release between the morning&#xD;
      and the evening (displacement of [11C]raclopride binding after MP) and to determine if these&#xD;
      diurnal patterns differ in cocaine addiction. Secondary outcome measures are: To assess if DA&#xD;
      signaling correlates with reactivity of brain regions to exposure of food and drug cues and&#xD;
      with functional connectivity of the reward network and to assess if the reactivity of the&#xD;
      reward network shows circadian variability. We will also assess if differences in DA&#xD;
      signaling between morning and evening correlate with circadian typology and with measures of&#xD;
      spontaneous motor activity and with sleeping patterns.&#xD;

             exclude participants from this study unless they have been taken within the last 24&#xD;
             hours prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current or past DSM-IV or DSM-5 diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder (other than&#xD;
             cocaine for the cocaine abusers, and nicotine/caffeine for any of the participants)&#xD;
             that required hospitalization (any length), or chronic medication management (more&#xD;
             than 4 weeks) and that could impact brain function at the time of the study as&#xD;
             determined by history and clinical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The following current chronically used medications are exclusionary from the study:&#xD;
             stimulant or stimulant-like medications (amphetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil) ;&#xD;
             analgesics containing narcotics (for controls only); anorexics (sibuteramine);&#xD;

             antineoplastics; antiobesity; antipsychotics; antivirals (except for treatment of HSV&#xD;
             with agents without CNS activity, e.g. acyclovir, ganciclovir, famciclovir,&#xD;
             valacyclovir); anxiolytics (benzodiazepine or barbiturates); hormones (exceptions:&#xD;
             thyroid hormone replacement, oral contraceptives, and estrogen replacement therapy);&#xD;
             insulin; lithium; muscle relaxants; psychotropic drugs not otherwise specified (nos)&#xD;
             including herbal products (no drugs with psychomotor effects or with anxiolytics,&#xD;
             stimulant, antipsychotic, or sedative properties); sedatives/hypnotics. Note that&#xD;
             nicotine and/or caffeine use will not exclude participants and that the use of cocaine&#xD;
             will not exclude participants with CUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Major medical problems that can permanently impact brain function (e.g., CNS including&#xD;
             seizures and psychosis; cardiovascular including hypertension [BP &gt; 140/90] and&#xD;
             clinically significant arrhythmias except bradycardia; metabolic, autoimmune,&#xD;
             endocrine; +HIV) as determined by history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any clinically significant laboratory finding as determined during the screening&#xD;
             procedures that could impact brain function or study procedures as evidenced from&#xD;
             clinical laboratory results. Since half of the participants in the study will have a&#xD;
             diagnosis of cocaine use disorder (CUD), we expect some clinically significant&#xD;
             findings that would reflect their recent cocaine use. As an example, a participant&#xD;
             might have a mildly elevated Creatinine Kinase as a result of recent cocaine use. The&#xD;
             test would reflect an acute rhabdomyolysis due to recent cocaine use, and it would be&#xD;
             clinically significant. Nevertheless, if it is a mild episode as expected with cocaine&#xD;
             use, it would not affect brain functioning or increase the risk of the procedures for&#xD;
             the participants in the study. Therefore, not all abnormal laboratory findings that&#xD;
             have clinical significance will be excluded. If a finding reflects altered brain&#xD;
             function (e.g., arrhythmias or renal failure) it will be exclusionary for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have had previous radiation exposure (from X-rays, PET scans, or other exposure) that,&#xD;
             with the exposure from this study, would exceed NIH annual research limits as&#xD;
             determined by medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Head trauma with loss of consciousness for more than 30 minutes as determined by&#xD;
             medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pregnant or breast feeding: Females must have negative urine pregnancy test and are&#xD;
             not currently breastfeeding. Post-menopausal or surgically sterile (tubal ligation or&#xD;
             hysterectomy); or not sexually active with a male partner and able to get pregnant; or&#xD;
             documented agreement to use an effective form of birth control. Acceptable forms of&#xD;
             contraception include: hormonal contraceptives (birth-control pills, injectable&#xD;
             hormones, vaginal-ring hormones); IUD; diaphragm with spermicide; condom with&#xD;
             spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of coagulation disorder as evidenced from clinical laboratory results, medical&#xD;
             history.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of glaucoma as determined by medical history. Since glaucoma is screened for&#xD;
             clinically at about the age of 40, any subjects 40 or older will undergo a glaucoma&#xD;
             screening test if they have not been tested by their primary care physician. A result&#xD;
             of 21 mmHg or higher will exclude.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Presence of ferromagnetic objects in the body that are contraindicated for MRI of the&#xD;
             head (pacemakers or other implanted electrical devices, brain stimulators, some types&#xD;
             of dental implants, aneurysm clips, metallic prostheses, permanent eyeliner, implanted&#xD;
             delivery pump, or shrapnel fragments) or fear of enclosed spaces - self-report&#xD;
             checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Personal or family history for cerebral aneurism.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Past or present history of chest pain and trouble breathing with activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Diabetes as assessed by medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. High risk for silent heart diseases as evidenced by high levels of high-sensitivity&#xD;
             C-reactive protein or homocysteine in blood, or being overweight or obese. In addition&#xD;
             patients with high cholesterol or a family history of heart disease will be evaluated&#xD;
             by a cardiologist to determine their eligibility for participation. The cardiologist&#xD;
             might request additional tests if he deems it necessary to ensure fitness for&#xD;
             participation (ie treadmill stress test). Specifically the cardiologist involved will&#xD;
             review the findings of 1) an inability to reach these endpoints, 2) the development of&#xD;
             chest pain, 3) significant ST segment changes, 4) significant arrhythmias, and 5) an&#xD;
             inability to appropriately increase blood pressure or heart rate with exercise in&#xD;
             order to determine if the participant is suitable for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Cannot lie comfortably flat on your back for up to 2 hours in the PET and MRI scanners&#xD;
             - self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Weight &gt; 400 pounds which is the maximum weight the PET scanner can hold.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Study investigators and staff, as well as their superiors, subordinates and immediate&#xD;
             family members (adult children, spouses, parents, siblings).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note that subjects will not be excluded from enrollment onto this study if their&#xD;
                  urine test is positive for drugs on initial screening. The following guidelines&#xD;
                  will be followed for positive drug screens on study procedure days:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  If a Healthy Volunteer subject s urine drug screen test is positive on days&#xD;
                       involving imaging (MRI and/or PET) and NP testing, the procedures will be&#xD;
                       postponed and rescheduled. We will allow for up to 3 rescheduled study days&#xD;
                       resulting from positive urine drug screens. If the drug test is positive on&#xD;
                       the third rescheduled visit, the participant will be withdrawn from the&#xD;
                       study.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  If a CUD subject s urine drug screen test is positive for drugs (except&#xD;
                       cocaine), the procedures will be postponed and rescheduled to another day.&#xD;
                       We will not place a limit on rescheduling study days in this participant&#xD;
                       group.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Note: At any time a subject expresses that he/she wants to get&#xD;
                            treatment for their cocaine use, we will immediately refer him/her to a&#xD;
                            treatment program. The subject will be withdrawn from the study at that&#xD;
                            time.&#xD;
