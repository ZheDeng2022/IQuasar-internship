  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lu-DOTA-TATE (Lutetium-177 octreotate) is a radiopharmaceutical that has been reported as&#xD;
      being effective in controlling symptoms and increase quality of life; induce stable disease&#xD;
      and extend progression free survival; induce a (good) partial remission and induce a complete&#xD;
      remission in patients with a somatostatin receptor positive tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of Lu-DOTA-TATE by measuring progression&#xD;
      free survival and overall survival. This study will also asses the safety of Lu-DOTA-TATE,&#xD;
      and the quality of life of the patients treated with Lu-DOTA-TATE.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine (NET) tumours have secretory and metabolic pathways not typically found in&#xD;
      other cancers that can be utilized for molecular imaging and therapeutic targeting. The most&#xD;
      important is somatostatin. Somatostatin receptors are useful tools in the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of NET tumours because the somatostatin analogue octreotate can be radiolabeled&#xD;
      with lutetium-177 for imaging and therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In selected populations of patients, radioisotope therapy in expert hands has been shown to&#xD;
      be a safe and effective palliative therapy with stable disease, progression free survival&#xD;
      benefit, symptom control and improvements in quality of life. Lutetium-177 (DOTA0, Tyr3)&#xD;
      octreotate has been used in a significant number of clinical studies shown to be safe and&#xD;
      effective as a therapeutic agent in patients with NET tumours. The investigators intend to&#xD;
      further confirm these benefits with lutetium-177 octreotate, which could form the basis for a&#xD;
      national registry study leading to registration of this therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
