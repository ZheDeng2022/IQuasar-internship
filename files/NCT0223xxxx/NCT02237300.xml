      Introduction: The purpose of this research is to develop a new component for&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT), empirically validated, for binge eating behavior in&#xD;
      patients with bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED), by means of cue-exposure&#xD;
      therapy (CET) with virtual reality. While CBT is an effective treatment for these eating&#xD;
      disorders, an important percentage of patients do not improve despite treatment. It is&#xD;
      necessary to explore how to enhance the effectivity of usual treatments with the&#xD;
      incorporation of new technologies and procedures. The innovation of this investigation is&#xD;
      based on the use of VR for cue-exposure therapy, which has been found effective with patients&#xD;
      resistant to conventional treatments (CBT and pharmacological intervention), and seeks to&#xD;
      enhance this efficacy by increasing possibilities of generalization and providing more useful&#xD;
      tools to clinicians, diminishing the logistic complications of the exposure to real cues&#xD;
      (food).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 60 patients with a diagnosis of BN or BED according the DSM-5 who had been&#xD;
      proposed for participation in the study by their referral mental health's professional after&#xD;
      conducting unsuccessfully a first level treatment (CBT structured intervention) at the&#xD;
      clinical sites involved will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Participants with active episodes of binge eating (and purging, in the case of BN)&#xD;
      during the last 2 weeks of the structured intervention of CBT will be provided with detailed&#xD;
      information about the study. All patients who agree to participate in the study and who sign&#xD;
      the informed consent form will be randomly assigned to one of the two second-level treatment&#xD;
      conditions: virtual reality based cue-exposure therapy (VR-CET) or additional&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral treatment (A-CBT). Both second-level treatment conditions consist of six&#xD;
      60-minute sessions that are held two times per week over a period of three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an interview setting, all of the participants will be administered several questionnaires&#xD;
      (BN, DT and BD subscales of EDI-3, FCQ-T/S, and STAI-Y) and participants assigned to the&#xD;
      VR-CET will also be exposed to various types of virtual foods in different virtual&#xD;
      environments (kitchen, dining-room, bedroom, and café) where they will be asked about their&#xD;
      food cravings and anxiety experienced in each situation to develop a proper exposure&#xD;
      hierarchy according to the specific characteristics and needs of each patient.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sample Sixty patients who have been diagnosed with BN or BED according to the Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and who have been found to be&#xD;
      resistant to an initial structured program of CBT (Fairburn, Marcus, &amp; Wilson, 1993) will&#xD;
      participate in the study. Participants will be recruited from collaborating hospitals and&#xD;
      health centers including Hospital de Bellvitge (Barcelona, Spain), Adult Mental Health Center&#xD;
      of the Consorcio Sanitario de la Anoia (Igualada, Spain), Hospital Universitari Joan XXIII&#xD;
      (Tarragona, Spain), Centro ABB (Tarragona, Spain) and the Instituto Auxologico Italiano&#xD;
      (Milano, Italy). Suicidal ideation and diagnoses of other severe mental disorders (substance&#xD;
      use disorders, bipolar disorder, psychosis) are exclusion criteria. Patients with active&#xD;
      episodes of binge eating (and purging, in case of BN) during the last two weeks of the&#xD;
      structured program of CBT will be considered for participation in the study. All prospective&#xD;
      participants will be comprehensively informed about the characteristics of the study and will&#xD;
      be required to sign an informed consent form. Authorization of the research ethics committees&#xD;
      of the applicant organization (University of Barcelona) and the collaborating institutions&#xD;
      will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who agree to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      second-level treatment conditions: the VR-CET group will receive cue-exposure sessions using&#xD;
      VR environments (six 60-minute (maximum) sessions over the course of three weeks; two per&#xD;
      week) and the A-CBT group will receive six additional sessions of the usual cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral treatment. Consistent with the American Psychological Association and the CONSORT&#xD;
      guideline recommendations regarding sample size in this type of research, 30 patients will be&#xD;
      included in each group. If necessary, dropout cases will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure At the end of the first level of treatment with the structured program of CBT, all&#xD;
      patients will be assessed relative to their status and will complete several questionnaires&#xD;
      (BN, DT and BD subscales of EDI-3, FCQ-T/S, and STAI-Y) (pre-randomization assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those with active behavioral symptoms who agree to participate in the intervention study and&#xD;
      who have signed the informed consent form will be randomly assigned to one of the two&#xD;
      second-level treatment conditions: VR-CET or A-CBT sessions. Also, participants assigned to&#xD;
      the VR-CET condition will be assessed through a validated VR-based cue exposure software&#xD;
      (Gutiérrez-Maldonado, Pla-Sanjuanelo et al., 2016) in order to construct the exposure&#xD;
      hierarchy of 3D interactive (environment and food) situations, used in the VR-CET sessions.&#xD;
      For that, participants assigned to the VR-CET condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Will be exposed to 30 graphic representations of different foods. The level of craving&#xD;
           elicited by each food will be assessed by means of a visual analog scale (VAS) that&#xD;
           ranges from 0 (not at all) to 100 (extreme).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. These participants will also be exposed to four graphic representations of different&#xD;
           environments (kitchen, dining room, bedroom, and café). The level of craving elicited by&#xD;
           each environment will be assessed by means of a VAS that ranges from 0 (not at all) to&#xD;
           100 (extreme).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. They will be individually exposed to the ten different virtual foods assessed as&#xD;
           eliciting the highest levels of craving in each of the four virtual environments&#xD;
           (kitchen, dining room, bedroom, and café) for a total of 40 virtual situations from&#xD;
           lowest to highest craving scores as previously registered in phases 1 and 2. Once in the&#xD;
           virtual situation, the participant will be asked to sit at a virtual table where the&#xD;
           food is placed. Once the participant sits, the time is measured. During the first 20&#xD;
           seconds, the patient can handle the virtual food by means of the laptop's mouse but&#xD;
           cannot eat the food. When time runs out, the levels of craving and anxiety will be&#xD;
           assessed by means of visual analog scales that range from 0 (not at all) to 100&#xD;
           (extreme). Virtual environments will be displayed by means of a 3D laptop with specific&#xD;
           software that is capable of creating a stereoscopic effect that is duly processed by&#xD;
           polarized glasses. Headphones will also be used. This assessment will be conducted in a&#xD;
           quiet darkened room to increase the participant's immersion in the virtual scenarios.&#xD;
           The therapist will remain behind the patient during the assessment so as not to&#xD;
           interfere with the task but to be available in the event a participant requires&#xD;
           assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Anxiety scores obtained from each of the 40 situations will be used to develop the&#xD;
           exposure hierarchy that will be used in the VR-CET sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality based cue-exposure therapy (VR-CET) sessions: There will be six 60-minute&#xD;
      (maximum) exposure sessions (two sessions per week for three weeks). Participants (n=30) will&#xD;
      be exposed to different VR environments related to binge behaviors, according to the&#xD;
      previously constructed hierarchy. During exposure, patients will face high risk situations to&#xD;
      diminish or extinguish the conditioned response of anxiety when exposed to food related cues.&#xD;
      In each session, the patient will be exposed to the corresponding steps of the hierarchy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional cognitive-behavioral treatment (A-CBT) sessions: Participants (n=30) in this&#xD;
      condition will receive six CBT booster sessions (twice weekly) over the course of three weeks&#xD;
      to improve the output of treatment. CBT sessions are based on the approach described by&#xD;
      Eldredge and colleagues (Eldredge et al., 1997). In this treatment, patients are trained to&#xD;
      self-monitor their food patterns and to identify and manage thoughts, emotions, and&#xD;
      environmental factors related to disrupted eating behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VR based cue-exposure booster sessions The cue-exposure procedure used in this study is an&#xD;
      adaptation of the cue-exposure treatment for BN proposed by Martinez-Mallen et al. (2007).&#xD;
      Exposure sessions will be conducted individually in a quiet, darkened room. In each session,&#xD;
      the participant will sit in front of a 3D laptop with software that is capable of creating a&#xD;
      stereoscopic effect that is duly processed by polarized glasses. Headphones with active noise&#xD;
      cancellation will also be used to expose the participant to the auditory stimuli in the&#xD;
      virtual environments and, at the same time, to isolate the patient from external noises.&#xD;
      Participants can interact within the virtual environments in real time. They can move around&#xD;
      the scenarios, sit at a table, and they can handle foods displayed using the keyboard and the&#xD;
      laptop's mouse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first minutes of the session, patients will be reminded of the purpose of the&#xD;
      exposure, that is, to place them in contact with food despite the high levels of anxiety they&#xD;
      experience. Doubts and questions raised by the participants will be attended to at this time.&#xD;
      The participants will be exposed to the corresponding virtual environments and foods based on&#xD;
      the previously established hierarchy. Along the VR-CET sessions, craving and anxiety levels&#xD;
      were assessed periodically. Exposure will terminate when subjective anxiety has decreased a&#xD;
      40% in relation to the level registered at the initiation of the exposure session or after 60&#xD;
      minutes. Once the anxiety level has decreased significantly, the patient will be exposed to&#xD;
      the next level in the hierarchy. In the event the session terminates before the anxiety level&#xD;
      has been sufficiently reduced in the virtual situations, the patients will be exposed to the&#xD;
      same situation in the following session. Subjective craving and anxiety will be recorded&#xD;
      using visual analogic scales (VAS) that range from 0 (not at all) to 100 (extreme) at the&#xD;
      beginning, every minute, and at the end of the virtual scenario exposures. During exposure,&#xD;
      the therapist will remain behind the patient and will only intervene if instruction is needed&#xD;
      or if the patient needs assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment During each VR-CET session, subjective craving and anxiety will be assessed using&#xD;
      VAS (range from 0 to 100) and will be recorded at the beginning, every minute, and at the end&#xD;
      of the exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following questionnaires will be administered to the participants of the two groups&#xD;
      before initiating treatment (pre-randomization phase), at the end of the second level-level&#xD;
      treatment conditions, and at the six-month follow-up: STAI-Y (State-Trait Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory-Form Y), BN, DT and BD subscales of EDI-3 (Eating Disorders Inventory-3) and&#xD;
      FCQ-T/S (Food Craving Questionnaire-Trait/State).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, outcome assessment for core behavioural features included frequency (i.e., number)&#xD;
      of binge eating episodes and purging during the two weeks prior to beginning the second-level&#xD;
      treatment conditions, during the two weeks after the end of the intervention, and during two&#xD;
      weeks after six-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses Mixed between-within subject analysis of variance will be conducted.&#xD;
      Between-subject variable refers to both conditions, the VR-CET versus A-CBT. The&#xD;
      within-subject variable refers to the assessment time: prior to beginning the second-level&#xD;
      treatment conditions (both VR-CET and A-CBT conditions), at the end of the treatment, and at&#xD;
      the six-month follow-up. Thus, comparisons between results obtained by both groups before&#xD;
      treatment, after treatment and at follow-up for each of the assessed measures will be&#xD;
      conducted. Using a similar analysis, anxiety measures registered during each exposure session&#xD;
      will also be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant interaction between condition (VR-CET vs. A-CBT) and time is expected in the&#xD;
      first block of analyses. This would indicate that the results of the questionnaires as well&#xD;
      as the number of binges and purges would remain stable before the second-level treatment&#xD;
      conditions (pre-randomization phase), after the treatment and at follow-up in the control&#xD;
      group (A-CBT), whereas these measures would be reduced in the experimental group (VR-CET)&#xD;
      after treatment and at follow-up. In the second analysis block, it is expected that measures&#xD;
      of subjective anxiety will decrease as each exposure session progresses.&#xD;
