    <textblock>
      Early adenocarcinoma of the lung has an excellent five-year survival after resection.&#xD;
      However, its clinical and radiologic presentation is highly variable. Traditional means for&#xD;
      preoperative diagnosis such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET-CT) and trans-thoracic&#xD;
      needle biopsy demonstrate unacceptable false positive and negative rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telomere biology is activated aberrantly is most lung cancers but has not been studied in&#xD;
      early stages to the best of our knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate telomere length and activity with suspected early&#xD;
      stage adenocarcinoma of the lung.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchoalveolar carcinoma has been traditionally used to refer to a subset of adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      distinguished by its peripheral location, typical &quot;lepidic&quot; growth pattern and tendency for&#xD;
      both bronchogenic and lymphatic spread. For the purpose of this discussion and consistency&#xD;
      with the revised 2011 criteria, BAC subtypes will be collectively referred to as early&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical presentation of early adenocarcinoma subtypes is highly variable ranging from a&#xD;
      small solitary nodule to extensive lobar consolidation. Many peripheral lesions have a&#xD;
      characteristic ground glass opacity appearance on Chest CT, which may correlate with an&#xD;
      improved prognosis. The reported five-year disease-free survival after resection for isolated&#xD;
      lesions may approaches 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative diagnosis of such lesions is complicated by several limitations. First, the&#xD;
      differential diagnosis is broad including an extensive number of inflammatory and infectious&#xD;
      processes. Second, positron emission tomography (PET), which identifies regions of increased&#xD;
      metabolic activity, may be falsely negative due to the slow growth of early adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      lesions. Transbronchial needle biopsy is also unreliable to confirm or exclude disease in&#xD;
      non-solid type lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of lung cancers classified as adenocarcinoma has steadily increased and now&#xD;
      comprises nearly Â½ of cases. However, the proportion of adenocarcinoma in situ is uncertain.&#xD;
      Previous reports range from 5-10% in a large series to as high as 24% in the large&#xD;
      Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. Thus, these early adenocarcinoma lesions&#xD;
      may represent a disproportionately large number of lung cancers which are PET negative yet&#xD;
      carry an excellent prognosis after early resection. The early adenocarcinoma subtypes&#xD;
      represent a clinical entity requiring further characterization to distinguish lesions more&#xD;
      likely to be malignant from benign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telomerase is activated aberrantly in most lung cancers and mutations in telomerase&#xD;
      components predispose to solid malignancies. For patients with non-small cell lung cancer,&#xD;
      numerous studies correlate increased tumor telomerase activity with increased likelihood of&#xD;
      Stage IIIB and Stage IV disease and/or reduced survival. Furthermore, telomerase inhibition&#xD;
      is currently being studied in clinical trials of patients with advanced non-small lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The semi-solid lung lesion may represent early stage adenocarcinoma which has an excellent&#xD;
      prognosis upon early diagnosis and prompt surgical resection. However, the semi-solid lesion&#xD;
      has a broad differential diagnosis and preoperative features characteristic of adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      are needed to distinguish malignant from benign lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study telomere length and telomerase activity in patients with suspected early&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma of the lung whom are referred for surgical biopsy of lung lesions.&#xD;

    <description>According to our previous experience with telomore biology in different disease states, we estimate a standard deviation (SD) of 1.3 of telomere capture (%) for the controls (healthy patients without known lung disease) and a SD of 2.4 (TC%) for biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the lung. For a clinically significance of at least 2%, we estimate a sample size of at least 16 patients with biopsy-proven disease to detect a statistically significant of 5% with a power of 80% (calculated by the independent t-test).</description>
