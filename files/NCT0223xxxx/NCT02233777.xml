  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study was conducted to find out whether the bioavailability of 150 mg pregabalin&#xD;
      capsules produced by Dexa Medica was equivalent to the reference products (Lyrica速 capsule&#xD;
      150 mg, Pfizer Manufacturing Deutschland GmbH, Germany).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, open label, two-period, two-sequence, crossover study under fasting&#xD;
      condition. The participating subjects were required to have an overnight fast and in the next&#xD;
      morning were given orally one capsule of the test drug (Pregabalin 150 mg produced by Dexa&#xD;
      Medica) or one capsule of the reference drug (Lyrica速 150 mg, Pfizer Manufacturing&#xD;
      Deutschland GmbH, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were drawn immediately before taking the drug (control), at 20, 40 minutes, and&#xD;
      1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36 hours after drug administration. Seven days after the&#xD;
      first drug administration (washout period), the procedure was repeated using the alternate&#xD;
      drug. The plasma concentrations of pregabalin were determined by using validated liquid&#xD;
      chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS/MS) method.&#xD;
