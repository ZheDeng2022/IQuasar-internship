      Chronic sinusitis is a disease involving severe swelling of your facial sinuses and nasal&#xD;
      cavity. Chronic sinusitis is a common disorder and roughly 5% of adult men and women have&#xD;
      chronic sinusitis in Canada. Surgery has shown to have benefits for people suffering from&#xD;
      chronic sinusitis. There are two surgeries which have been shown to help people: 1)&#xD;
      Endoscopic sinus surgery with septoplasty and 2) Septoplasty alone. Both surgeries have&#xD;
      research which show they help improve quality of life and reduce symptoms. However, it is&#xD;
      unknown which surgery is better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      'Endoscopic sinus surgery with Septoplasty' uses special telescopes through the nostrils to&#xD;
      make the nasal septum straight and open the facial sinuses without any incisions. The sinuses&#xD;
      are opened using special microscopic instruments and the procedure takes approximately 90-120&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      'Septoplasty alone' is a shorter (take approximately 25-30 minutes) and less invasive (do not&#xD;
      open the facial sinuses) that might provide the same benefits compared to the larger and&#xD;
      longer endoscopic sinus surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, performing 'Endoscopic Sinus Surgery and Septoplasty' together is the standard of&#xD;
      care, however, there is limited evidence to support just performing 'Septoplasty alone'&#xD;
      provides similar results but it is shorter and has lower risks. This represents a significant&#xD;
      gap in the investigators' knowledge, which adversely impacts a doctor's ability to counsel&#xD;
      patients who have chronic sinusitis and elect to undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to understand which surgery (endoscopic sinus surgery plus&#xD;
      septoplasty OR septoplasty alone) is the most appropriate for people with chronic sinusitis.&#xD;
      You are being asked to participate in this study because you have chronic sinusitis and are&#xD;
      also going to have surgery to improve your quality of life.&#xD;

      Chronic sinusitis, officially known as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), is a common yet&#xD;
      under-recognized chronic inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses affecting&#xD;
      approximately 5% of the Canadian population. Aside from gaining a reputation for its&#xD;
      detrimental effects on patient quality-of-life (QoL) and daily productivity, CRS is&#xD;
      associated with a lifetime of medical and surgical resource consumption resulting in&#xD;
      significant health care expenditure. The estimated direct cost of CRS to the Canadian health&#xD;
      care system is $990 million per year, which is comparable to the annual direct costs of&#xD;
      asthma. The large economic burden of chronic sinusitis provides a strong incentive to improve&#xD;
      both the quality and value of care for this chronic inflammatory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the etiology of CRS is considered multi-factorial without one single unifying&#xD;
      factor, several studies have investigated the role of a septal deviation as a predisposing&#xD;
      factor of CRS. A systematic review and meta-analysis quantified the outcomes and concluded&#xD;
      that there was statistical evidence for the association between CRS and septal deviation,&#xD;
      especially those with a septal deviation angle &gt; 10-degrees. However, the clinical relevance&#xD;
      of septal deviation as an etiologic factor for CRS is still unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on several recent evidence-based guidelines, sinonasal 'surgery' can be considered for&#xD;
      patients with medically refractory CRS as defined by having persistent symptoms despite a&#xD;
      minimum of 3 months with topical sinonasal corticosteroid therapy along with a minimum of a&#xD;
      7-day course of systemic corticosteroid +/- 2-week course of broad-spectrum antibiotic. The&#xD;
      important question remains, what is the most appropriate surgical intervention for patients&#xD;
      with refractory CRS? Currently there are two surgical options for CRS and both procedures&#xD;
      have non-randomized evidence to support their beneficial effects in this patient population:&#xD;
      (1) Septoplasty alone (ie. only correcting the deviated septum and not dissecting into the&#xD;
      paranasal sinuses), and (2) Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) along with a septoplasty (ie.&#xD;
      correcting the septal deviation and opening up the paranasal sinuses). With an estimated&#xD;
      direct health care cost exceeding $100 million spent on sinonasal surgery in Canada for&#xD;
      management of CRS, optimizing the allocation of scarce surgical resources toward&#xD;
      interventions with the most proven benefit would result in significant improvements in both&#xD;
      the quality and value of care to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2005, a prospective non-randomized study compared septoplasty alone to septoplasty plus&#xD;
      ESS. They demonstrated that septoplasty alone had a 93% subjective success rate for patients&#xD;
      with CRS which was no different than the 88% success rate of ESS plus septoplasty. Although&#xD;
      this study has provided some insight into this topic, it was limited by the lack of&#xD;
      randomization, lack of stringent inclusion criteria for refractory CRS, and lack of using a&#xD;
      validated patient-reported outcome measure. Since 2004, there have been several prospective&#xD;
      observational cohort studies evaluating the role of ESS in patients with refractory CRS.&#xD;
      Overall the outcomes from these studies suggest that ESS provides improved patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes and objective outcomes. However, despite excellent observational evidence supporting&#xD;
      both septoplasty and ESS, there has never been a robust randomized controlled trial (RCT) to&#xD;
      prove additional benefit of ESS compared to septoplasty alone for patients with CRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In real world practice, ESS is commonly performed in combination with septoplasty despite the&#xD;
      lack of a RCT. The lack of level-1 evidence continues to raise questions regarding the true&#xD;
      effectiveness and appropriateness of ESS for patients with CRS as opposed to just performing&#xD;
      a septoplasty alone. This current gap in the literature provides a strong incentive to&#xD;
      evaluate the role of ESS using a RCT design and is the impetus behind this research project.&#xD;
