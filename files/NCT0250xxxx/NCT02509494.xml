    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is the evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of two candidate&#xD;
      Ebola vaccines Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo, in a 2-dose heterologous regimen.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is staged Phase 3 study to gather information on the safety and immunogenicity of a&#xD;
      2-dose heterologous regimen. In this regimen, Ad26.ZEBOV will be administered as a Dose 1&#xD;
      vaccination followed by the candidate vaccine MVA-BN-Filo (Dose 2 56 days later) and a&#xD;
      booster dose of A26.ZEBOV will be administered 2 years post Dose 1 vaccination to&#xD;
      participants in Stage 1 who consent to this. The study will take place in Sierra Leone and&#xD;
      will consist of a screening phase, an active phase (vaccination) and a follow-up phase. The&#xD;
      active phase of the study will be conducted initially in two stages. In the first stage&#xD;
      approximately 40 adults aged 18 years or older will be vaccinated to gain information about&#xD;
      the safety and immunogenicity of the 2-dose heterologous vaccine regimen. In stage 2 a larger&#xD;
      group of approximately 976 individuals will be vaccinated to further evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the 2 dose heterologous vaccine regimen across different age groups. In&#xD;
      this stage, children aged 1 year or older, adolescents and adults will be included. Solicited&#xD;
      local and systemic adverse events will be collected until 7 days after the Dose 1 and Dose 2&#xD;
      vaccination. Unsolicited adverse events will be collected from signing of the informed&#xD;
      consent form (ICF) onwards until 56 days after the Dose 2 vaccination in Stage 1 and then&#xD;
      again from the day of the booster vaccination until 28 days after the booster vaccination,&#xD;
      and until 28 days after each vaccination in stage 2. Serious adverse events will be collected&#xD;
      from signing of the ICF onwards until 12 and 36 months after the Dose 1 vaccination in Stage&#xD;
      2 and Stage 1, respectively. These data will be reviewed by an independent data monitoring&#xD;
      committee (IDMC) to assess whether initiation of vaccination in the next stage or age group&#xD;
      can be provided. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, which will be&#xD;
      monitored throughout the study. Participants in Stage 2 will be followed up for safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity until 12 months (children and adolescents) or 24 months (adults) after the&#xD;
      Dose 1 vaccination. Participants in Stage 1 will be followed up for safety and immunogenicity&#xD;
      until 36 months after the Dose 1 vaccination or until 1 year after the booster vaccination.&#xD;
