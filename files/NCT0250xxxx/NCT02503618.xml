  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scientific purpose of this study is to look at how substance use may relate to human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among young black men who have sex with men in&#xD;
      Atlanta.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) are a critically at-risk population in the&#xD;
      United States and Atlanta that faces extremely high incidence rates of HIV and other sexually&#xD;
      transmitted infections (STIs). The understanding of what places this group of men at high&#xD;
      risk is incomplete, and the role of substances in amplifying that risk is unclear. This study&#xD;
      will fill a number of gaps about how substances and partnerships place YBMSM at increased HIV&#xD;
      risk. The study includes several innovative aspects. First, the investigators are using a&#xD;
      theoretical framework to understand multilevel associations between substance use and HIV&#xD;
      risk behavior in YBMSM in the southeastern United States, a critically at-risk but&#xD;
      understudied population. Second, the investigators are using a variety of enhanced&#xD;
      measurement methods to understand these associations. The investigators are supplementing&#xD;
      self-reported substance use with objective measures to enhance the sensitivity of classifying&#xD;
      recent use. The investigators will analyze incident HIV/STI endpoints in addition to&#xD;
      self-reported sexual behaviors. The investigators will use detailed, event-based and dyadic&#xD;
      measures of substance use and its covariates, which will capture both sexual and non-sexual&#xD;
      contexts of use. Although previous cohort studies have explored alcohol and drug use during&#xD;
      sexual events among men who have sex with men (MSM), few studies have described both sexual&#xD;
      and non-sexual patterns of, and motivations for, substance use among YBMSM, and none have&#xD;
      incorporated longitudinal biomarkers of substance use and related these to incident infection&#xD;
      outcomes. Finally, the investigators are using a mixed-methods approach to provide context to&#xD;
      the quantitative findings. By recruiting subjects to a nested qualitative study within the&#xD;
      larger cohort based on their interval-specific risks, the investigators will gain in-depth&#xD;
      information regarding the emergence, persistence, and resolution of these complex&#xD;
      relationships between substances and sexual risk behaviors among YBMSM and how these&#xD;
      relationships emerge and are resolved over time.&#xD;
