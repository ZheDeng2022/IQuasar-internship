  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently the process for stroke recovery is slow with majority of its treatments focused&#xD;
      around physical therapy. Among the many methods employed to facilitate recovery in stroke,&#xD;
      the use of motor imagery (MI) training may be beneficial towards stroke rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, we propose 2 aims. Our first aim is to determine the feasibility and&#xD;
      efficacy of a novel brain-computer interface-assisted MI train program (BCI-MI) in patients&#xD;
      with chronic ischemic stroke. This is designed as a proof-of-concept study that only require&#xD;
      a single-session trial. If patients successfully activate the BCI-MI system without much&#xD;
      difficulty, our second aim is to enroll patients into a 4-week training program using the&#xD;
      BCI-MI. Both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (TMS) will be done to determine the effects of the 4-week training program.&#xD;
      Subjects may potentially see improvements in walking gait as preliminary data from previous&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated positive results.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first study, we propose 20 subjects who have sustained their first ever haemorrhagic&#xD;
      or ischaemic subcortical stroke with lower limb impairment more than 9 months prior to study&#xD;
      enrollment. Subjects will be recruited from the existing patients on the study physician's&#xD;
      cohort of patients and from referrals from attending physicians. During the initial screening&#xD;
      visit, it will be ascertained that subject fulfills criteria for participation and informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained by study staff. Subjects will be fully briefed in detail regarding&#xD;
      the experimental procedure, risk and benefits involved and their responsibilities during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consent is provided, subjects will undergo a MI-BCI usability session, they will be&#xD;
      seated comfortably in front of a computer screen. An EEG cap will be comfortably worn over&#xD;
      the head of the subject to record EEG traces of any activated cortical areas. Subjects will&#xD;
      then be instructed to perform a mental imagery task whereby they will imagine themselves&#xD;
      walking properly with their affected leg. The accuracies in classifying correct motor imagery&#xD;
      from the idle condition from EEG will be recorded for each subject. Subjects who obtain an&#xD;
      accuracy of more than 57.5% are considered eligible for the MI-BCI training program. Subjects&#xD;
      eligible for the MI-BCI training will then undergo a series of functional assessments,&#xD;
      including (1) functional clinical measures (10 meter walk test and Up-to-Go test), (2) gait&#xD;
      analysis , (3) cortical activity assessment using TMS, and (4) MRI and DTI scan. (5)&#xD;
      Psychological tests including Beck Depression Inventory, fatigue severity scale, digital span&#xD;
      test. Before the start of MI-BCI training, subjects will undergo one more MI-BCI session of&#xD;
      calibration, which will be performed totally the same with BCI usability session to gather&#xD;
      more valuable data for analyzing. After finishing all 5 assessments and MI-BCI calibration&#xD;
      session, the MI-BCI training can be started at the frequency of 3 times a week lasting for 4&#xD;
      weeks. The procedure of MI-BCI training is identical to the one in BCI usability session&#xD;
      except that a cartoon character in the computer screen will be activated to walk forward if&#xD;
      subjects successfully perform an accurate mental imagery. Subjects undergoing MI-BCI training&#xD;
      will be required to perform 160 trials of MI altogether with assigned rest periods (5 mins)&#xD;
      every 40 trials. Each session will last approximate 45 minutes excluding set-up time. The&#xD;
      number of times subjects can successfully perform the MI task and the ease in which they are&#xD;
      able to perform the task will be recorded. Distinct brain signals such as event-related&#xD;
      desynchronization or synchronization (ERD/ERS) are detectable on EEG for both real and&#xD;
      imagined motor movements in healthy subjects. Using this technique, MI-BCI, which translates&#xD;
      the imagination of movements into online commands, provides a promising neural communication&#xD;
      system for stroke patients who suffer from motor disabilities. We have previously&#xD;
      collaborated with I2R-A*STAR BCI to design a custom-built BCI software to sync with an EEG&#xD;
      amplifier. We have demonstrated the efficacy of this custom-built MI-BCI device on upper limb&#xD;
      stroke impairments, therefore, the procedure and equipment used will be kept identical except&#xD;
      for the software interface, which shows a cartoon character on the screen. Subjects will&#xD;
      undergo the same five assessments again at the end of the 4-week's MI-BCI training and 4-6&#xD;
      weeks after the last session of MI-BCI training, respectively, including (1) functional&#xD;
      clinical outcome measures (10 meter walk test and Up-to-Go test), (2) gait analysis, (3)&#xD;
      cortical activity assessment using TMS, and (4) MRI and DTI. (5) Psychological tests&#xD;
      including Beck Depression Inventory, fatigue severity scale, digital span test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timed up-and-go test is a measurement of mobility. It includes a number of tasks such as&#xD;
      standing from a seating position, walking, turning, stopping, and sitting down. For the test,&#xD;
      the person is asked to stand up from a standard chair and walk a distance of approximately 3&#xD;
      meters, turn around and walk back to the chair and sit down again. The 10 meter walk test is&#xD;
      a test of walking speed. Timed up-to-go test and 10 meter walk test will be assessed by&#xD;
      certified physical therapist or trained research staff, and will take approximate 30 minutes&#xD;
      including set-up time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait analysis is the systematic study of locomotion. It will be performed in NUH, by a&#xD;
      certified medical technician or a trained research staff. Subjects will be required to wear&#xD;
      shorts and the whole trial process might be video-recorded for future analyzing the quality&#xD;
      of subjects' movement (face will not be captured and consent will be obtained in advance).&#xD;
      Markers might be worn at various points of reference of the body such as iliac spines of the&#xD;
      pelvis, ankle malleolus, and the condyles of the knee. Electromyography (EMG) sensors might&#xD;
      be worn at the area of quadriceps femoris,hamstring, gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior&#xD;
      muscles for both legs. Gait parameters of temporal and spatial measures and joint kinematics&#xD;
      will be recorded while the subject is walking along the walkway with a force platform,&#xD;
      according to the instruction of the medical technician or the trained research staff. Each&#xD;
      session will last approximate 1 hour including set-up time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS will be performed to investigate the mechanisms of this training on cortical plasticity&#xD;
      as indexed by cortical excitability changes. For the MEP study, we will initially adjust TMS&#xD;
      intensity to achieve a baseline MEP in the tibialis anterior muscle of the leg to about 1 mV&#xD;
      peak-to-peak amplitude before intervention. Stimulation intensity will be kept constant for&#xD;
      each subject throughout the study. The MEPs will be recorded in a computer for off-line&#xD;
      analysis. We will record 10 MEPs for each time and average their peak-to-peak amplitude. For&#xD;
      the paired pulse stimulation, a first subthreshold conditioning stimulus will be applied,&#xD;
      followed at a variable interstimulus interval (ISI), by a second suprathreshold stimulus. We&#xD;
      will use the following ISIs - 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 ms. The percentage of change for each&#xD;
      ISI before and after treatment will be calculated from the MEPs and will therefore important&#xD;
      to measure changes in intracortical facilitation and inhibition. Each session will last&#xD;
      approximate 1 hour including set-up time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI/DTI scan will be performed at CIRC, NUS. Prior to the scan, all patients will be briefed&#xD;
      of the test procedure and safety aspects. A medically-trained physician will be on standby&#xD;
      throughout the procedure. All participants will be scanned on a 3-T GE scanner using a&#xD;
      standard radiofrequency head coil. Head motion was minimized by foam padding and&#xD;
      forehead-restraining straps. A T1-weighted high-resolution scan and a set of axial fluid&#xD;
      attenuated inversion recovery images will be acquired. T1-weighted and fluid attenuated&#xD;
      inversion recovery images will be realigned and spatially normalized into images of isotropic&#xD;
      voxel size implemented in Matlab. Each session will last approximate 1 hour including set-up&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research staff will administer Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Fatigue Severity Scale&#xD;
      (FSS), forward and backward digit span for controlling for confounding effect of cognitive&#xD;
      improvement in this study.&#xD;
