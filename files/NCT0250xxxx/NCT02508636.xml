  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the safety of giving enzalutamide with leuprolide acetate before&#xD;
      and after radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with prostate&#xD;
      cancer that is at high risk of returning. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill&#xD;
      tumor cells and shrink tumors. Most types of prostate cancer also need testosterone to grow&#xD;
      and spread. After radiation therapy, patients often receive treatments to reduce testosterone&#xD;
      to prevent the cancer from returning. Leuprolide acetate works by reducing the amount of&#xD;
      testosterone that the body makes. Enzalutamide is a stronger treatment that may block&#xD;
      testosterone from reaching cancer cells. Adding enzalutamide to treatment with leuprolide&#xD;
      acetate after radiation therapy may help prevent high-risk prostate cancer from returning and&#xD;
      improve patient survival.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility and safety of the combination of enzalutamide and leuprolide&#xD;
      acetate (leuprolide) in patients undergoing definitive radiation therapy for high-risk&#xD;
      prostate cancer or with pelvic nodal involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) complete response rate with the&#xD;
      combination of enzalutamide and leuprolide (PSA-complete response (CR) as determined by PSA&#xD;
      nadir =&lt; 0.3) in patients undergoing radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer or&#xD;
      pelvic nodal involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine time to biochemical failure as determined by the American Society for&#xD;
      Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Phoenix definition of nadir + 2 ng/mL, local progression, regional&#xD;
      progression, and distant metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine time to clinical progression free survival III. To assess changes in PSA&#xD;
      nadir and PSA and testosterone levels. IV. To assess changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c),&#xD;
      fasting glucose, fasting insulin and fasting lipid and cholesterol levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To document changes in quality of life outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify potential mutations and changes gene copy number associated with enzalutamide&#xD;
      resistance in patients with high risk prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To identify gene expression patterns, splice variants, and gene signatures associated&#xD;
      with enzalutamide treatment and enzalutamide resistance in patients with high risk prostate&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify changes in the immune response with enzalutamide treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive enzalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) and leuprolide acetate&#xD;
      intramuscularly (IM) every 1, 3, 4, or 6 months for 24 months. Patients also undergo standard&#xD;
      of care intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) 5 days per week for 5 weeks beginning at&#xD;
      week 8, followed by optional brachytherapy. Treatment continues in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, 3-4 months, 6, 12,&#xD;
      18, 24, and 36 months.&#xD;

The PROMIS measures the responses use a T-score metric in which 50 is the mean of a relevant reference population and 10 is the standard deviation (SD) of that population. A score of 40 is one SD lower than the mean of the reference population and a score of 60 is one SD higher than the mean of the reference population. For PROMIS measures, higher scores equals more of the concept being measured (e.g., more Fatigue). Changes in the PROMIS fatigue scores will be assessed during treatment and the overall median change in scores will be reported.</description>

    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. The health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension by selecting one of the following responses: no problems (0), slight problems (1), mild problems (2), moderate problems (3), or severe problems (4) with a particular dimension. Lower scores indicate less issues/problems with that particular health dimension. Changes in the EQ-5D scores will be assessed during treatment and the overall median change in scores will be reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Median Change in EuroQol Group Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS) During Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, similar to a ruler, where the endpoints are labelled with 100='The best health you can imagine' on one end and 0='The worst health you can imagine' on the other, with 50 being the midpoint and participants mark an X on the scale to indicate how their health is on the day of the visit. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement. Changes in the EQ-VAS scores will be assessed during treatment and the overall median change in scores will be reported.</description>

        <description>A PROMIS score of 50 is the average (or mean) score for a specific, relevant group of people under investigation. That group is the reference population. The PROMIS measures the responses use a T-score metric in which 50 is the mean of a relevant reference population and 10 is the standard deviation (SD) of that population. A score of 40 is one SD lower than the mean of the reference population and a score of 60 is one SD higher than the mean of the reference population. For PROMIS measures, higher scores equals more of the concept being measured (e.g., more Fatigue). Changes in the PROMIS fatigue scores will be assessed during treatment and the overall median change in scores will be reported.</description>

        <title>Overall Median Change in EuroQol Group Five Dimensional Questionnaire (EQ-5D) During Treatment</title>
        <description>EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. The health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension by selecting one of the following responses: no problems (0), slight problems (1), mild problems (2), moderate problems (3), or severe problems (4) with a particular dimension. Lower scores indicate less issues/problems with that particular health dimension. Changes in the EQ-5D scores will be assessed during treatment and the overall median change in scores will be reported.</description>

        <title>Overall Median Change in EuroQol Group Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS) During Treatment</title>
        <description>The EQ-VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, similar to a ruler, where the endpoints are labelled with 100='The best health you can imagine' on one end and 0='The worst health you can imagine' on the other, with 50 being the midpoint and participants mark an X on the scale to indicate how their health is on the day of the visit. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement. Changes in the EQ-VAS scores will be assessed during treatment and the overall median change in scores will be reported.</description>
