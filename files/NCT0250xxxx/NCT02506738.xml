      The aim of the study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of telemonitoring functional status&#xD;
      and vital signs to early detect heart failure exacerbation, and to minimize readmissions and&#xD;
      length of hospitalisations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients over 75 with heart failure were included after a hospitalisation due to heart&#xD;
      failure exacerbation. Patients were assigned randomly into intervention or control. The&#xD;
      intervention group comprised 47 patients who were assessed through telemonitoring, while 40&#xD;
      followed traditional clinical pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were followed-up for 3 months after discharge, collecting emergency visits and&#xD;
      readmissions due to a new heart failure exacerbation. Those patients in the intervention&#xD;
      group used a commercial telemedicine system: Careline H@me, which was provided by the company&#xD;
      SALUDNOVA. They system was personalized by adding the functional status monitoring&#xD;
      capabilities. Thus, the system collected vital signs (i.e. blood pressure, heart rate,&#xD;
      respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, glucose, and weight); symptoms of decompensated heart&#xD;
      failure (i.e. dyspnoea and orthopnoea); and functional status (i.e. part of the Short&#xD;
      Physical Performance Battery, SPPB) and a brief questionnaire (i.e. Do you have the&#xD;
      medication?) every 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two staff geriatricians at the Hospital Universitario de Getafe accessed, during working&#xD;
      days, a secured dedicated web-portal to assess the progression of their patients, evaluated&#xD;
      through the monitored variables and the self reported symptoms. They reacted to the data, if&#xD;
      needed, making a phone call or visiting the patient. Besides, patients could contact the&#xD;
      geriatricians or attending the emergency room as usually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion, we analysed the results. First, we carried out a descriptive analysis of&#xD;
      the data. Later, we analysed the effects of the intervention with telemedicine and the&#xD;
      predictive values of the different measured variables through logistic regressions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient registries were carried out in two different Databases: one included general&#xD;
      information on patients and epidemiological data. The other database stored the monitored&#xD;
      data obtained every 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance and source data verification was achieved by retrieving general information&#xD;
      on patients from the Hospital Electronic Medical Record. Moreover epidemiological information&#xD;
      was assessed by the Principal Investigator who removed outlier values and assessed the&#xD;
      occurrence of sharp changes in temporal series (e.g. changes &gt;0.5Kg in two days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were recruited at the acute unit of the Geriatrics Service. When they were admitted&#xD;
      due a heart failure exacerbation a trained nurse performed the initial assess. If the patient&#xD;
      was suitable, a geriatrician explained to him /her the study and if the patient accepted we&#xD;
      was asked to sign the informed consent. Then he was assigned randomly to a group. For those&#xD;
      in the intervention group, they were trained by the geriatrician and the nurse on how to&#xD;
      perform the measurements in the mobile phone. For those in the control group, the staff&#xD;
      recorded the baseline characteristics, and during the follow-up the emergency visits,&#xD;
      readmissions and death was recorded. These latter variables were also recorded in the&#xD;
      patients of the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data dictionary included variables identifying patients and others describing their&#xD;
      status and evolution:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxygen saturation, measured as an integer (80-100)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rate, measured in beats/minute (0-200)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diastolic blood, measured in mmHg (0-100)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systolic blood pressure, measured in mmHg (0-100)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory rate, measured in breaths/minute (0-100)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin temperature, measured in Celsius&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight, measured in kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose, measured in mg/dl (0-500)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short Physical Performance Battery, time to walk for 4.3 meters, measured in seconds&#xD;
           (0-100)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short Physical Performance Battery, gait speed for 4.3 meters, measured in decimal&#xD;
           meters/second (0-1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Short Physical Performance Battery, chair stand test once, measured in seconds (0-100)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptom question Q1: Do you feel worse than the last time?, measured as a Boolean&#xD;
           variable (YES/NO)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptom question Q2: Do you feel worse than the day of the hospital discharge?, measured&#xD;
           as a Boolean variable (YES/NO)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptom question Q3: Do you feel shorten of breath?, measured as a categorical variable&#xD;
           (effort/DLA/at rest)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptom question Q4: Do you feel your legs swollen? ?, measured as a Boolean variable&#xD;
           (YES/NO)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptom question Q5: Have you woken up during the night feeling fatigue? ?, measured as&#xD;
           a Boolean variable (YES/NO)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptom question Q6: Have you needed more pillows to sleep than last time? ?, measured&#xD;
           as a Boolean variable (YES/NO)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptom question Q7: Have you taken all your drugs? ?, measured as a Boolean variable&#xD;
           (YES/NO)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptom question Q8: Have you followed the food and drinks indications of your&#xD;
           physician?, measured as a Boolean variable (YES/NO) Sample size was calculated to reduce&#xD;
           readmission rate by 10% in 3 months time. Having a significant level of 0.05. Sample:&#xD;
           50-60 per group. With the first 20 patients included, sample size was recalculated, only&#xD;
           40 were needed in each group. However, we included more patients in the intervention (up&#xD;
           to 50) to face drops, only 3 dropped the study, so we obtained data from 47 in the&#xD;
           intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data were excluded from the analysis, the registry was excluded. If a patient&#xD;
      registered more than one measurement for the same expected data, the latest remained, and the&#xD;
      rest was deleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, we carried out a descriptive analysis of the data. Later, we analysed the effects of&#xD;
      the intervention with telemedicine and the predictive values of the different measured&#xD;
      variables through logistic regressions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive data are presented as median values (IQR). Baseline characteristics between&#xD;
      control and intervention groups were compared using non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine the effects of the intervention, the analysis was divided in two parts.&#xD;
      First, a logistic regression model was fitted to determine if the patient monitorization&#xD;
      (yes/no) significantly predict worsening using age and sex as covariates. Then, a new&#xD;
      variable, hospitalization length of stay, was created with the length of stay for any&#xD;
      readmission in each group to assess whether the use of telemonitoring affected the length of&#xD;
      hospitalisation. Both control and intervention groups were compared using Mann-Whitney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, in the intervention group, the same logistic regression model was fitted to&#xD;
      determine the factors that significantly predict worsening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses were made with the Statistical Package R for windows (Vienna, Austria)&#xD;
      (http://www.r-project.org), version 3.1.1. P-value was set at level &lt;0.05.&#xD;
