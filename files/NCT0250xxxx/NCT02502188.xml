  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part study to be conducted at multiple study centers. Part 1 is a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of CC-90005 following a single oral dose in healthy subjects. During the&#xD;
      course of Part 1, each subject will participate in a screening phase, baseline phase(s),&#xD;
      treatment phase(s) and a follow up visit. There will be a total of 3 planned cohorts, each of&#xD;
      which will consist of a different dose level, with 8 subjects per cohort. In each cohort, 6&#xD;
      subjects will receive a dose of CC 90005 and 2 subjects will receive placebo depending on the&#xD;
      randomization schedule. Each cohort will receive a minimum of 2 doses, with one of the&#xD;
      cohorts receiving a third dose (up to three study periods per cohort). Administration of&#xD;
      study drug at the next higher dose level will not begin until the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      the preceding dose have been evaluated and deemed acceptable by the investigator and&#xD;
      sponsor's medical monitor. Part 2 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of CC-90005 following multiple oral&#xD;
      doses in subjects with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis. During the course of Part 2,&#xD;
      each subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase, a treatment phase and a&#xD;
      follow up visit. There will be a total of 4 planned cohorts, each of which will consist of a&#xD;
      different dose level, with 12 subjects per cohort. In each cohort, 9 subjects will receive a&#xD;
      dose of CC-90005 and 3 subjects will receive placebo depending on the randomization schedule.&#xD;
      It is planned for study drug to be administered twice daily for 28 days. Proposed dose levels&#xD;
      in Part 2 may be modified and/or eliminated based on data obtained from Part 1 and/or from&#xD;
      previous data obtained in Part 2.&#xD;
