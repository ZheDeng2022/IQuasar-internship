&#xD;
          5. Female subject is either post-menopausal for one year prior to screening or surgically&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Abnormal ECG with clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias or other conduction&#xD;
             abnormality that in the opinion of the investigator warrants exclusion of the subject&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or has New York Heart&#xD;
