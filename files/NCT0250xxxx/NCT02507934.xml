    <textblock>
      Dry eye is a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface that results in symptoms&#xD;
      of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability with potential damage to the&#xD;
      ocular surface. It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and inflammation&#xD;
      of the ocular surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lubricin is a mucin-like glycoprotein originally discovered in synovial fluid, as a secreted&#xD;
      product of cells that line the joint tissues, which is present at the surface of articular&#xD;
      cartilage and it has been investigated on its roles at the ocular surface, in normal and&#xD;
      pathologic conditions such as dry eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to assess the tolerability, safety and efficacy of Lubricin eye&#xD;
      drops solution administered over 4 weeks versus sodium hyaluronate (Na-HY) eye drops solution&#xD;
      in subjects with moderate dry eye.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dry eye, or keratoconjunctivitis sicca, is a chronic inflammatory condition of the ocular&#xD;
      surface that may cause severe symptoms an 2007 international dry eye workshop (DEWS) defined&#xD;
      the disease as follows: &quot;Dry eye is a multifactorial disease of the tears and oc symptoms of&#xD;
      discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular&#xD;
      surface. It is accompanied the tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lubricin is a mucin-like glycoprotein originally discovered in synovial fluid, as a secreted&#xD;
      product of cells that line the joint tissues, surface of articular cartilage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro studies have shown that lubricin in saline buffer acts as a lubricant between&#xD;
      various surfaces, as well as in synovial fluid, pr lubricin is a principal lubricating&#xD;
      protein in joints. Besides the lubricating property, lubricin has been shown to exert&#xD;
      anti-adhesive ac dissipation, and a protective effect on underlying cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lubricin has been investigated on its roles at the ocular surface, in normal and pathologic&#xD;
      conditions such as dry eye. In fact, Lubricin is the protein with most potent lubricant and&#xD;
      anti-adhesive properties present on the ocular surface and on meibomian gland. The presence&#xD;
      on the ocular surface was first described by the team of Sullivan D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the available preclinical studies lubricin may be an important barrier to the&#xD;
      development of corneal and conjunctival epitheliopathies in dry eyes and its use as a novel&#xD;
      lubricating and anti-adhesive eye drop is under investigation in this clinical investigation.&#xD;
      A clinical investigation is currently ongoing to demonstrate that a Lubricin 150 µg/ml eye&#xD;
      drop formulation is non-inferior to an ocular surface lubricant sodium hyaluronate 0.13%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to now, there are no known anticipated adverse events associated with the use of lubricin,&#xD;
      anyway the occurrence of side effect It must be considered that topical treatment with&#xD;
      lubricin or hyaluronic acid could cause local irritation or allergic reactions. There ar&#xD;
      contraindications to the use of lubricin or hyaluronic acid eye drops. All examinations and&#xD;
      assessments that will be carried out durin invasive, are commonly used in the management of&#xD;
      subjects with dry eye and pose no risk to the subjects. There are no known co lubricin or&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid eye drops. . No data are available about the embryo and fetal toxicity,&#xD;
      therefore the experimental treatment will not be allowed to pregnant women or nursing mothers&#xD;
      and women of childbearing potential not using appropriate birth control methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate tolerability, safety and efficacy of Lubricin 150&#xD;
      µg/ml eye drops when compared to a widely used commercial 0.18% sodium hyaluronate eye drop&#xD;
      formulation in moderate dry eye patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. History of any ocular surgery (including laser or refractive surgical procedures) in&#xD;
             either eye within the 90 days before study enrolment. Ocular surgery will not be&#xD;
             allowed during the study treatment period and elective ocular surgery procedures&#xD;

             possibly interfere with the interpretation of study results, or could be judged by the&#xD;
             investigator to be incompatible with the study visit schedule or conduct of trail&#xD;
             procedures (e.g. ocular trauma, progressive or degenerative corneal conditions,&#xD;
             uveitis, systemic infection.)&#xD;
