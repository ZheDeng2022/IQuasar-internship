      The Miami Heart Study at Baptist Health will be an observational, longitudinal and&#xD;
      prospective cohort study in a target population of 4000 healthy subjects (40-65 years old)&#xD;
      consisting of members from the Greater Miami Area (including eligible BHSF(Baptist Health&#xD;
      South Florida) employees). Baseline examination will consist of (1) assessment for&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors (including lifestyle and psychosocial factors); (2) screening for&#xD;
      subclinical atherosclerosis using Coronary CT angiogram, Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC)&#xD;
      testing, vascular 2D/3D ultrasound, endothelial function, arterial stiffness and (3) blood&#xD;
      sampling for determination of traditional risk factors, advanced &quot;omics&quot; and biobanking.&#xD;
      Participants will be followed yearly via telephone, email, or mail for change in health&#xD;
      status with a focus on cardiovascular disease events, including acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
      and other forms of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and congestive heart failure;&#xD;
      mortality; and for cardiovascular disease interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Miami Heart Study at Baptist Health is expected to identify new imaging and biological&#xD;
      factors associated with the presence and feature of earliest markers of subclinical&#xD;
      atherosclerotic disease and provide opportunities for discovery/validation of novel&#xD;
      biomarkers to identify these high-risk features. This is expected to lead to advances in&#xD;
      understanding of evolution and progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease starts&#xD;
      with an ultimate goal of establishing more personalized, evidence-based approach to medical&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

      What is this study about? The Miami Heart Study is a long term observational research study&#xD;
      which is designed to identify new and novel relationships between risk factors, genetics,&#xD;
      lifestyle behaviors and cardiovascular disease in the greater Miami area. Miami is uniquely&#xD;
      situated to capture a diverse, multi-ethnic population. As an employee of Baptist Health and&#xD;
      a very important stakeholder in Baptist Health's mission, you are being asked to take part in&#xD;
      this research study. The investigators expect approximately 4,000 members of the South&#xD;
      Florida community and/or employees of Baptist Health to participate in this study over the&#xD;
      next 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study aims to better understand heart disease and what causes it. Heart disease&#xD;
      often starts many years before a person has a heart attack or develops symptoms of heart&#xD;
      disease. This is called subclinical disease - and it refers to heart disease and the body&#xD;
      processes causing heart disease, at a stage before any symptoms are experienced. Although&#xD;
      doctors and researchers have a good understanding of heart disease in some areas, subclinical&#xD;
      disease is not very well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Better understanding subclinical disease can allow doctors and healthcare staff to intervene&#xD;
      and prevent the process from developing further and causing symptomatic (with symptoms) heart&#xD;
      disease. Progression refers to the process by which subclinical (without symptoms) heart&#xD;
      disease develops into clinical (with symptoms) disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this research study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the presence and severity of subclinical disease in the South Florida&#xD;
           community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine what unique factors contribute to development of subclinical disease and&#xD;
           appearance of clinical symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the future, the investigators hope this information will allow us to better predict and&#xD;
      prevent the development heart disease in diverse populations. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      come to the Miami Heart Study clinic for an examination that may take 4 to 6 hours to&#xD;
      complete. During the examination, information about the participant's health will be&#xD;
      collected and standard procedures routinely done a physician's office such as height, weight,&#xD;
      and blood pressure will be performed.&#xD;

      Approximately 115 mls of blood will be drawn by a Registered Nurse. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      tested for markers of the diseases and health conditions under investigation. These will&#xD;
      include standard markers (cholesterol, blood sugar, etc) and novel markers which are not&#xD;
      commonly evaluated by a physician. Additionally, any remaining blood samples will be stored&#xD;
      and kept for future risk factor evaluation, biomarker testing and genetic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole blood and serum will be retained.&#xD;

        Since the MiHEART Study is primarily concerned with the determinants and natural history of&#xD;
        subclinical cardiovascular disease, participants with known clinical disease will not be&#xD;
        recruited. Most exclusion criteria relate to the long-term nature of the study or to&#xD;
        incompatibility with certain study procedures. Eligibility (or ineligibility) status will&#xD;
        be determined from self-reported information.&#xD;
