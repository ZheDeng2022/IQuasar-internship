    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is look at the possible side effects of two different doses of&#xD;
      CXA-101/tazobactam, a low dose and a high dose, on participant's heart.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Some drugs can have effects on the cardiovascular system (hearts and blood vessels) including&#xD;
      the QT interval. The QT interval is the time between the contraction and relaxation of the&#xD;
      chambers of the heart, called ventricles, which collect and pump blood. The use of some drugs&#xD;
      can lead to serious issues such as QT interval prolongation (lengthen) and potentially&#xD;
      serious arrhythmias (abnormal heart beat), and sudden death. Therefore, it is important to&#xD;
      study effect of medications on the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug, Moxifloxacin, will be introduced as a control to be able to compare the effect, if&#xD;
      any, that CXA 101/tazobactam might have on participant's heart.Moxifloxacin is an approved&#xD;
      antibiotic commonly used to treat common bacterial infections. Moxifloxacin is known to&#xD;
      slightly increase the electrical conduction of participant's heart.&#xD;
