    <textblock>
      M.M.A.TECH Ltd. product is an Acetabular Liner Family produced of an advanced polyimide -&#xD;
      MP-1™.&#xD;
&#xD;
      M.M.A.TECH Ltd. produces the Liners according to EN ISO 13485:2012 approved manufacturing&#xD;
      process and supplies them to the customer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate, in the frame of PMCF, the safety and performance of&#xD;
      using AL-X MP1 Polyimide Acetabular liners in Total Hip Replacement surgery by clinical&#xD;
      following up of patients for a period of 2 years .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The procedure involves removal of the diseased parts of the joint, that is the damaged&#xD;
      cartilage and adjacent bone, and replacing them with artificial parts which closely resemble&#xD;
      in structure and/or function the removed native parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The artificial parts fit onto the reshaped bone and are fixed either with bone cement (e.g.,&#xD;
      polymethylmethacrylate) and press fit of the part(cemented), or by self-anchorage with bone&#xD;
      ingrowth to its porous surface(cementless).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of the artificial parts may include a stem, a keel or pegs, which fit onto the&#xD;
      medullary canal of the bone or into a hole pre-prepared in the bone. An artificial part may&#xD;
      fit loosely and be fixed with bone cement, press-fit for self- anchorage or include&#xD;
      extendible anchors which are retracted upon placement and extended thereafter so as to secure&#xD;
      the implant in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following fixation of the components, the joint is reduced and the soft tissue tension is&#xD;
      appropriately checked to reassure stability of the joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MP-1™ acetabular liner will be tapper locked in acetabular metal shells to resurface the&#xD;
      acetabular socket in cementless total hip replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MMaTech Ltd will manufacture the liners to perfectly fit into the external metallic shell of&#xD;
      the following sizes (mm):&#xD;
&#xD;
      LINER CUP SIZE LINER SIZE HEAD Liner thickness AL-2MP132040 44-48 32 ID 40 OD 32 4 mm&#xD;
      AL-2MP136044 50-54 36 ID 44 OD 36 4mm AL-2MP136048 56-66 36 ID 48 OD 36 6mm AL-2MP140048&#xD;
      56-66 40 ID 48 OD 40 4mm&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MP-1™ Acteabular liners are intended to be used only against ceramic femoral heads-&#xD;
