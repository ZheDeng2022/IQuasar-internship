      1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE OF THE STUDY The long term prognosis of&#xD;
           patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has progressively improved&#xD;
           since the introduction of reperfusion therapies and in particular primary angioplasty&#xD;
           [1]. In the setting of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the immediate&#xD;
           reopening of acutely occluded coronary arteries via primary angioplasty is the treatment&#xD;
           of choice to salvage ischemic myocardium. However, the sudden re-initiation of blood&#xD;
           flow can lead to a local acute inflammatory response with further endothelial and&#xD;
           myocardial damage. This phenomenon, described as 'reperfusion injury', may explain why,&#xD;
           despite optimum myocardial reperfusion, the short-term mortality after AMI approaches 7%&#xD;
           [1] and the incidence of heart failure approaches 15-20% [2][3]. Despite the use of full&#xD;
           conventional treatment, including ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, aldosterone inhibitors&#xD;
           and diuretics, in the context of randomised controlled trials yearly mortality rates of&#xD;
           patients with post-infarction heart failure are still in the range of 10-13% and&#xD;
           rehospitalisation for worsening of heart failure occurs at a yearly rate of 6-8 % [4].&#xD;
           Registry data indicate a more dismal outcome in real world clinical experience. A major&#xD;
           reason for the high morbidity and mortality is that the heart has an inadequate&#xD;
           regenerative response to the myocardial necrosis sustained following AMI; cell death&#xD;
           from the ischemic damage can lead to progressive ventricular dilation and dysfunction&#xD;
           through the processes of adverse left ventricular remodelling. However, the discovery of&#xD;
           tissue resident cardiac stem cells in the mammalian heart [5] has challenged the long&#xD;
           held belief that the heart is a terminally-differentiated organ and opens up the&#xD;
           possibility of using bone marrow derived stem cells to repair the heart. Indeed, recent&#xD;
           experimental studies documented that bone marrow-derived cell (BMC) injection into the&#xD;
           infarcted heart stimulates the formation of newly formed cardiac myocytes, although the&#xD;
           origin of these myocytes is still a matter of debate[6]. Numerous pre-clinical studies&#xD;
           provided high degree of evidence that bone marrow derived cells do contribute to cardiac&#xD;
           repair after acute myocardial injury, limit infarct expansion and improve cardiac&#xD;
           function most likely via a paracrine mechanism of action. Pre-clinical evidence is&#xD;
           corroborated by several small to intermediate size clinical trials demonstrating&#xD;
           beneficial effects of bone marrow derived cells on top of the state-of-the-art&#xD;
           reperfusion treatment [7]. For this reason, European Community has recently funded&#xD;
           within FP-7 &quot;The effect of intracoronary reinfusion of bone marrow derived mononuclear&#xD;
           cells (BM-MNC) on all cause-mortality in acute myocardial infarction (BAMI)&quot; project&#xD;
           aimed to definitively demonstrate the efficacy of BM-MNC in patients with myocardial&#xD;
           infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Considering that recovery of post-infarction LV function is favourably correlated to&#xD;
           bone marrow derived stem cell mobilization induced by endogenous Granulocyte-Colony&#xD;
           Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) [8-9], therapeutic stem cell mobilization was proposed as an&#xD;
           alternative method to ameliorate post-infarction LV function. Several basic studies have&#xD;
           supported this notion suggesting that stem cell mobilization might improve LV function&#xD;
           by increasing stem cell homing in the damaged myocardium in addition to a favourable&#xD;
           direct effect of G-CSF on LV myocardium [10-12].&#xD;
&#xD;
           On these bases several studies have evaluated the effect of G-CSF on LV function in&#xD;
           patients with myocardial result with mixed results [13]. In general, G-CSF was proven&#xD;
           safe but the effect appeared modest. However, in patients with large myocardial&#xD;
           infarction the effect was significant and clinically relevant approaching a 5% increase&#xD;
           in LVEF. In particular in the Rigenera Trial conducted at the Catholic University of the&#xD;
           Sacred Heart of Rome 41 patients with large anterior wall AMI at high risk of&#xD;
           unfavorable remodeling were randomized 1:2 to Lenograstim (rhu G-CSF, Myelostim 34,&#xD;
           Italfarmaco) (10 μg/kg/day for 5 days) or to conventional therapy. After a median&#xD;
           follow-up of 5 months patients treated with Lenograstim exhibited improvement of 5% in&#xD;
           LVEF, in the absence of LV dilation. In contrast, patients treated conventionally&#xD;
           exhibited significant LV dilation in the absence of an improvement in LVEF [14]. In the&#xD;
           present study, a subgroup of 8 patients randomized to Lenograstim received also the&#xD;
           administration of a second-generation ultrasound contrast agent containing sulphur&#xD;
           hexafluoride (SonoVue®, Bracco, Milan, Italy) administered intravenously (5 ml at 1&#xD;
           ml/min) for myocardial opacification to collect diagnostic images by Myocardial Contrast&#xD;
           Echocardiography. Interestingly, a post hoc analysis, revealed that only patients&#xD;
           receiving Sonovue® showed a significant benefit on LV function [unpublished data]. This&#xD;
           could be due to an increased homing effect of mobilized bone marrow derived stem cells&#xD;
           due to the myocardial destruction of contrast medium-microbubbles by 3.5 MHz ultrasounds&#xD;
           produced by the Echo machine. As this regard, two basic studies demonstrated that the&#xD;
           highly focused ultrasound-mediated stimulation of microbubbles increased the migration&#xD;
           of stem cells across the myocardial endothelium into the post-ischemic myocardium in&#xD;
           vivo [15-16]. Moreover, long term (10 years) follow up data of the RIGENERA trial have&#xD;
           been recently collected, confirming the safety of the procedure and a significant&#xD;
           improvement of the quality of life assessed by NYHA functional class, Seattle Heart&#xD;
           Failure Model, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (p&lt;0.005) when&#xD;
           compairing patients treated with G-CSF versus standard therapy. Data regarding efficacy,&#xD;
           in terms of LVEF, end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume are currently under&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On the basis of the previous results, The Recupero dall'Infarto miocardico con G-CSF E&#xD;
           Nuovi Esempi di Rigenerazione Avanzata (RIGENERA 2.0) trial will specifically test the&#xD;
           efficacy of the combined effect of subcutaneous Granulocyte - Colony Stimulating Factor&#xD;
           and sulphur hexafluoride on post-infarction left ventricular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT In every clinical trial, anticipated benefits need to be&#xD;
           weighed against the study associated risks. In previous investigations where G-CSF has&#xD;
           been used, no G-CSF associated adverse reactions were reported. Only the MAGIC trial was&#xD;
           prematurely stopped due to possible safety concerns in treated patients in terms of an&#xD;
           unexpectedly high restenosis rate in stented vessels [17]. However, only three patients&#xD;
           in the G-CSF group received angiographic follow-up, thus no clear conclusion about the&#xD;
           incidence of restenosis should have reasonably be drawn from this study. In all other&#xD;
           studies using G-CSF adverse events were comparable between patients and controls [13].&#xD;
           Nevertheless G-CSF is largely used in oncology for treatment of febrile neutropenia and&#xD;
           in hematology for this indication and for mobilization of stem cells for&#xD;
           transplantation. As this regard G-CSF is considered reasonably safe without any&#xD;
           association with a documented increase in malignancies [18].&#xD;
&#xD;
           SonoVue has been shown to be safe and well tolerated with minimal risk to patients. In&#xD;
           clinical trials, the overall incidence of adverse events was relatively low (10.7%&#xD;
           overall, 5.2% investigational product-related) in subjects receiving SonoVue. The most&#xD;
           frequently reported adverse events were headache (2.1%), nausea (0.9%), chest pain&#xD;
           (0.8%), and chest discomfort (0.5%). All other adverse events occurred at a frequency of&#xD;
           &lt;0.5%. Most adverse events were mild and resolved spontaneously within a short time&#xD;
           without sequelae. Serious adverse events occurred in 0.43% of patients and only 0.08% of&#xD;
           events were considered to be of some relationship to the administration of SonoVue&#xD;
           (probable, possible, or unlikely). No product- related deaths were reported within&#xD;
           MAH-sponsored trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The anticipated benefits of RIGENERA 2.0 trial for study participants are expected&#xD;
           better LV function, a parameter that is well-known to influence long-term outcome.&#xD;
           Nevertheless, chiefs of the different Units involved in the present study will form a&#xD;
           Data Monitoring Committee that will stop the study in case of an observed increase in&#xD;
           the rate of adverse events.&#xD;

        3. OVERALL DESIGN AND PLAN OF THE STUDY 3.1. OVERVIEW OF STUDY FLOW The RIGENERA 2.0 trial&#xD;
           is a phase II placebo-controlled, randomized, open label, with Blinded Evaluation of&#xD;
           end-points. One hundred and twenty STEMI patients are planned to be enrolled in 4&#xD;
           Italian centers (Rome - Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Ferrara, Pisa and&#xD;
           Padua). Patients with an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction as defined by the&#xD;
           universal definition of AMI undergoing acute revascularization (i.e. either acute PCI&#xD;
           within 24 hours of symptom onset or thrombolysis within 12 hours followed by acute PCI&#xD;
           within 24 hours of symptom onset) will be screened at investigational sites. Patients&#xD;
           who had acute PCI at institutions different from the investigational sites (recruiting&#xD;
           centers) can also be included: interested patients may be referred for screening to any&#xD;
           of the participating study sites within 3 to 4 days. Informed consent and assessment of&#xD;
           eligibility of patients with respect to in- and exclusion criteria will be done at the&#xD;
           recruiting centers. If all other eligibility criteria are met, echocardiography will be&#xD;
           performed 3 to 6 days after the acute PCI and ejection fraction will be quantified. In&#xD;
           case of LVEF≤45% the patient will be 1:1 electronically randomized to G-CSF and MCE or&#xD;
           placebo and MCE according to site. Patients will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
           subcutaneous Granulocyte - Colony Stimulating Factor (group 1) or Placebo (group 2) both&#xD;
           added on top of optimal standard of care and Myocardial Contrast Echocardiography with&#xD;
           intravenous infusion of sulphur hexafluoride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenograstim (rhu G-CSF, Myelostim 34, Italfarmaco) (5 µg/kg twice daily for 5 days,&#xD;
      subcutaneously) or placebo (saline solution twice daily for 5 days, subcutaneously) will be&#xD;
      administered at least 5 days after admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both in patients treated with Lenograstim (rhu G-CSF, Myelostim 34, Italfarmaco) and in&#xD;
      patients treated with placebo, immediately before the first dose of Lenograstim (rhu G-CSF,&#xD;
      Myelostim 34, Italfarmaco) or placebo and in the morning of the last day of treatment in&#xD;
      which the peak of BMSC mobilization is expected, an echocardiogram using an echocardiographic&#xD;
      contrast agent (Sonovue, Bracco) will be performed. In the days of administration of the drug&#xD;
      or placebo, ECG, blood pressure, blood count and coagulation analyses will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of muscle and bone pain or severe headache patients will be treated with&#xD;
      paracetamol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of leukocytosis (&gt; 40000/mcl) dose of G-CSF in 24 hours will be halved and in the&#xD;
      case of leukocytosis (&gt; 70000/mcl) completely stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After hospital discharge, all study patients will return to the clinical centre for a follow&#xD;
      up visit after 30 days. Six months after randomization all the patients will undergo&#xD;
      outpatient Cardiac Magnetic Resonance and Conventional Echocardiography. At the same time,&#xD;
      all patients will undergo Myocardial Contrast Echocardiography. At 1 year all patients will&#xD;
      attend a final site visit at the clinical centers collecting any clinical event. However, all&#xD;
      clinical endpoints will be reported as occurring throughout the follow up. Clinical Major&#xD;
      adverse cardio-cerebrovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, stroke and&#xD;
      re-hospitalization due to heart failure) at 1 year will be adjudicated by a clinical event&#xD;
      committee blinded to the patient treatment allocation. This will ensure a consistent and&#xD;
      unbiased adjudication of events across all investigational sites.&#xD;
&#xD;

      4.2. PATIENT SCREENING AND RANDOMISATION Patients will be recruited based on the existing&#xD;
      medical information from the pool of AMI patients at the clinical centres. Patients who had&#xD;
      the primary PCI performed at clinical centres that are different from the recruiting centre&#xD;
      can also be included: interested patients may be referred for screening to any of the&#xD;
      participating study sites within 3 to 4 days. Informed consent and assessment of eligibility&#xD;
      of patients with respect to inclusion and exclusion criteria will be done at the recruiting&#xD;
      centre. Written informed consent must be obtained from patients prior to any study specific&#xD;
      procedures. After consenting, patients undergo the procedures listed for the screening visit.&#xD;
      After ensuring that a patient meets all other eligibility criteria, the investigator will&#xD;
      perform the echocardiography and an electronic record of the echocardiography will be kept&#xD;
      and transferred to the central Echocardiography Core Laboratory for following analyses. After&#xD;
      local quantification of left ventricular ejection fraction, randomisation will be allowed for&#xD;
      all patients with LVEF ≤ 45%. At randomization a patient number that will be used as the key&#xD;
      identifier for the entire study period, will be supplied. Patients will be randomised to&#xD;
      investigational therapy or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Patients with a LVEF &gt; 45% will not be&#xD;
      randomised, but will be classified as screening failures. Patients randomised but not treated&#xD;
      will be replaced. Patients who discontinue the study after treatment, will not be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Class I: Absence of rales over the lung fields and absence of S3. No heart failure. No&#xD;
      clinical signs of decompensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Class II: Rales over 50% or less of the lung fields or the presence of an S3. Heart failure.&#xD;
      Diagnostic criteria include rales, S3 gallop and venous hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Class III: Rales over more than 50% of the lung fields. Severe heart failure. Frank pulmonary&#xD;
      edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Class IV: Cardiogenic shock. Hypotension (a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mmHg for&#xD;
      at least 30 minutes or the need for supportive measures to maintain a systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      of greater than or equal to 90 mmHg), end-organ hypoperfusion (cool extremities or a urine&#xD;
      output of less than 30 ml/h, and a heart rate of greater than or equal to 60 beats per&#xD;
      minute). The hemodynamic criteria are a cardiac index of no more than 2.2 l/min per square&#xD;
      meter of body-surface area and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of at least 15 mmHg.&#xD;
      Signs include hypotension (systolic pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg) and evidence of peripheral&#xD;
      vasoconstriction such as oliguria, cyanosis and diaphoresis. Heart failure, often with&#xD;
      pulmonary oedema, has also been present in the majority of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.3. Physical examination All patients will undergo standard or abbreviated physical&#xD;
      examinations. The standard examination is based on the following body systems: body&#xD;
      temperature, HEENT (head, eyes, ears, nose, throat), respiratory system, cardiovascular&#xD;
      system, abdomen, extremities, neurological system. The abbreviated physical examination&#xD;
      consists of body temperature, respiratory system, cardiovascular system, and lymph nodes. The&#xD;
      body weight will be determined at each physical examination. The body height will be obtained&#xD;
      at screening only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.4. Vital signs Blood pressure and heart rate at rest will be determined using a standard&#xD;
      method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.5. Electrocardiography A 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be recorded. ECGs will be&#xD;
      recorded while the patient is resting in supine position. Abnormal findings in ECG recordings&#xD;
      will be documented and the clinical relevance will be judged. A de-identified copy of the&#xD;
      baseline ECG will be digitally stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.6. Clinical laboratory Blood sampling and sample analysis will be performed at the&#xD;
      clinical centre. The local investigator is responsible for proper judgment of abnormal blood&#xD;
      test results, and is responsible for appropriate patient care following clinically&#xD;
      significant pathological results. Please refer to section 6.4.5 to determine whether an&#xD;
      abnormal laboratory value may constitute an adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following analysis will be obtained at screening, daily during the five days of treatment&#xD;
      (from day 0 to day 5) and at 5, 30 and 180 days:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematology: Hemoglobin, hematocrit, Red blood count, white blood count, platelets&#xD;
      Biochemistry: Serum creatinine, serum urea, serum uric acid, glutamic-oxaloacetic&#xD;
      transaminase (GOT), glutamic-pyruvate transaminase (GPT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total&#xD;
      cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high density lipoprotein cholesterol&#xD;
      (HDL), triglycerides, glycosylated hemoglobin(HbA1c), Creatine kinase (CK), Creatine kinase&#xD;
      muscle-brain(CK-MB), high sensitive troponin T hs-TnT, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor&#xD;
      (VEGF), Insulin Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), Stromal Derived&#xD;
      Factor 1 alpha (SDF-1 alpha) Urine: Pregnancy test for woman of childbearing potential&#xD;
      Coagulation: Prothrombin Time (PT), International Normalised Ratio (INR), activated partial&#xD;
      thromboplastin time (aPTT) 4.3.7. Concomitant medications All patients participating in the&#xD;
      trial should receive treatment according to evidence based guidelines. Concomitant&#xD;
      medications will be recorded throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.8. Standard Echocardiography A resting echocardiogram at enrollment and at 4-6 months&#xD;
      will be recorded and digitally stored. See details in 5.3.1 Only if the patient qualifies&#xD;
      with LVEF ≤ 45% in the local reading, the patients will be randomised&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3.9. Investigational therapy/placebo Lenograstim (rhu G-CSF, Myelostim 34, Italfarmaco) (5&#xD;
      µg/kg twice daily for 5 days, subcutaneously) or placebo (saline solution twice daily for 5&#xD;
      days, subcutaneously) will be administered at least 5 days after admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both in patients treated with Lenograstim (rhu G-CSF, Myelostim 34, Italfarmaco) and in&#xD;
      patients treated with placebo, immediately before the first dose of Lenograstim (rhu G-CSF,&#xD;
      Myelostim 34, Italfarmaco) or placebo and in the morning of the last day of treatment in&#xD;
      which the peak of BMSC mobilization is expected, an echocardiogram using an echocardiographic&#xD;
      contrast agent (Sonovue, Bracco) will be performed in the days of administration of the drug&#xD;
      or placebo, ECG, blood pressure, blood count and coagulation analyses will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of muscle and bone pain or severe headache patients will be treated with&#xD;
      paracetamol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of leukocytosis (&gt; 40000/mcl) dose of G-CSF in 24 hours will be halved and in the&#xD;
      case of leukocytosis (&gt; 70000/mcl) completely stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be safely discharged on the basis of laboratory data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4. DURATION OF THE STUDY 4.4.1. Study duration for study patients Each enrolled patient&#xD;
      will remain in the study throughout the entire study duration, with a minimum follow-up of 1&#xD;
      year for each patient. A study patient's participation may be terminated early for reasonable&#xD;
      cause, such as the investigator's medical decision. At any time, the patient has the right to&#xD;
      withdraw consent without a negative impact on her/his medical treatment. However, the&#xD;
      investigators are encouraged to ask for the patient's permission for further follow-up&#xD;
      telephone contacts from those whose decision for discontinuation was based on the need for&#xD;
      further outpatient visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4.2. Duration of the whole study Patients will be enrolled during a recruitment phase of&#xD;
      approximately 2 years. Since minimum study duration for one patient is one year, the overall&#xD;
      study duration is approximately 3 years. The Data Monitoring Committee may terminate the&#xD;
      study earlier based on safety concerns at any time, or based on the interim efficacy&#xD;
      analysis. Competent authorities/ethics committees retain the right for premature termination&#xD;
      of the study according to applicable regulations. At an individual study centre, the study&#xD;
      may be terminated early if the work performed is not compliant with Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
      (GCP).&#xD;
