      The aim of the study is to investigate how effective is zonal acupuncture method compared to&#xD;
      balance method to obtain a short coming pain relief effect, which takes place several minutes&#xD;
      after needle insertion.&#xD;

      Main purpose of the study is to estimate the efficiency of the zonal acupuncture method&#xD;
      compared to control group and the balance acupuncture method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes random completion of 3 groups of participants : zonal acupuncture,&#xD;
      control group, balance acupuncture approximately 20 participants each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The zonal acupuncture group will receive a treatment according to a zonal method and a pain&#xD;
      level will be estimated by the investigator according to a visual analog pain scale (VAS)&#xD;
      before and 10 minutes and 15 minutes after the beginning of the treatment and the change of&#xD;
      the pain level will be recorded. If possible the pain level will be measured again&#xD;
      approximately 24 hours after the treatment and the change of the pain level will be again&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will provide only the estimation of the the pain level according to a&#xD;
      visual analog pain scale (VAS) but receive no acupuncture treatment. Then if possible the&#xD;
      pain level will be measured again approximately 24 hours after the first measurement and the&#xD;
      change of the pain level will be recorded for a control group too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The balance acupuncture group will receive a treatment according to a balance method, and a&#xD;
      pain level will be estimated according to a visual analog pain scale (VAS) before and 10&#xD;
      minutes and 15 minutes after the beginning of the treatment and the change of the pain level&#xD;
      will be recorded. If possible the pain level will be measured again approximately 24 hours&#xD;
      after the treatment and the change of the pain level will be again recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These measurements are primary outcome of the experiment. Provided statistically consistent&#xD;
      they will be treated to extract method efficiency estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants from all tree groups may receive drug analgesia at some recorded moment of&#xD;
      time before the procedure, however the investigators want to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      acupuncture analgesia at the time when no other analgesia effect is present, so the&#xD;
      investigators can exclude possible interference.&#xD;
