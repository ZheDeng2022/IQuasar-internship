  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In many countries, numerous steps are taken to minimize the risk of infection from transfused&#xD;
      blood products. Typically, blood banking organisations will screen for an array of infectious&#xD;
      pathogens as part of their quality control protocol. While transmission of these tested&#xD;
      agents via transfusion has become exceedingly rare, the risk of transfusion-transmitted&#xD;
      infections for which testing is not currently performed continues to be a concern. Among&#xD;
      these untested infectious agents is Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, also known as human&#xD;
      herpesvirus-4). Most notably, infection with this virus in transplant recipients can give&#xD;
      rise to a malignant disorder called post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), a&#xD;
      life-threatening complication which is due to the uncontrolled expansion of EBV-infected&#xD;
      cells. It is also associated with other complications such as hepatitis, hemophagocytic&#xD;
      syndrome, etc. in transplant population. It is recognised that EBV infection can occurred in&#xD;
      transfused immune suppressed graft recipients but the origin of the viral infection is still&#xD;
      a matter of debate. It is a known fact that the EBV already present in the recipient's blood&#xD;
      can undergo reactivation due to immune suppression. However, because it is known to occur&#xD;
      more frequently in patients who are EBV-seronegative at the time of transplant, it is also&#xD;
      accepted that primary infection contracted via an infected graft can be a source of virus.&#xD;
      The question we are seeking to answer is whether immune suppressed graft recipients can&#xD;
      acquire primary EBV infection via transfusion of blood products. EBV is present in the blood&#xD;
      of most adults and cases of EBV transfusion-related infection have been reported. Transplant&#xD;
      populations are generally transfused with very large volumes of blood products and our recent&#xD;
      pilot study supports the possibility that transfusion-related EBV infection can be&#xD;
      transmitted to pediatric hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) recipients (Trottier et al, 2012).&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to analyse the risk of EBV transmission through blood product&#xD;
      transfusion in pediatric allogeneic HSCT patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be recruited approximately 1 month before transplantation (before&#xD;
      pre-transplant conditioning chemotherapy and pre-surgery evaluation) and followed-up to 1&#xD;
      year post-transplantation. Thus, each subject will be followed-up for a 13-month period. At&#xD;
      entry, a questionnaire will document socio-demographic data and pre-transplant clinical&#xD;
      indicators such as age, gender, primary diagnosis, previous chemotherapy, previous&#xD;
      transfusion, etc. During follow-up, case report forms (CRF) will allow prospective reporting&#xD;
      of all variables pertaining to EBV serology, transplantation, blood product transfusion and&#xD;
      EBV complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EBV PCR and serology testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is observational and will use the results of EBV PCR and EBV serology allowing our&#xD;
      objectives to be achieved with considerable cost reduction. Time zero is when the patient&#xD;
      receives his graft. Some tests are done before time zero (pre-transplant array of test&#xD;
      including EBV serology). After time zero, in all sites, there is a follow-up treatment&#xD;
      protocol including EBV PCR testing. Pre-transplant sera from recipients and donors are tested&#xD;
      by standard methods for mmunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to the EBV capsid antigen (VCA), IgG&#xD;
      antibodies to EBV early antigens (EA) and anticomplement antibodies to the EBV nuclear&#xD;
      antigens (EBNA). EBV DNA testing is performed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (PCR). Each centre has an established threshold value for determining viral load. In order to&#xD;
      properly interpret the patients' viral load data from each participating center, all will be&#xD;
      required to fill out a site report form (SRF) to describe their testing method for EBV PCR&#xD;
      and EBV serology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-transplant measurement of EBV antibodies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serology testing, including EBV seroprevalence, is always done in all participating sites&#xD;
      during the pre-transplant evaluation (before conditioning chemotherapy) in both donors and&#xD;
      recipients. Serology testing is the test that is used to confirm the presence of the virus in&#xD;
      the blood. For grafts provided by external sites, donor blood samples are always available&#xD;
      and will allow for serology testing at the laboratory center where the transplantation is&#xD;
      performed. Serology testing will not be done on cord-blood donor as it is virtually always&#xD;
      negative for EBV. Donors and recipients will be classified according to their pre-transplant&#xD;
      serology status as: 1) having past infection (VCA and EBNA IgG titers &gt; 10), 2) having recent&#xD;
      infection or being immune suppressed (VCA IgG titers &gt; 10 and EBNA IgG titers &lt; 10), 3)&#xD;
      having reactivated infection (VCA, EBNA and EA IgG titers &gt; 10), or 4) being na√Øve (no&#xD;
      serological sign of prior infection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-transplant EBV DNA PCR testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HSCT recipients are closely followed for EBV infection in the post-transplant period.&#xD;
      Although most of the blood product transfusions occur during the peri-transplant period, it&#xD;
      is possible that patients receive blood products at a later time post-transplantation.&#xD;
      Follow-up on EBV PCR results and complications related to EBV will therefore continue up to&#xD;
      one year post-transplant (or time of death). This time window will allow documentation of the&#xD;
      entire clinical trajectory of HSCT. Protocols for follow-up after transplant, and for the&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of EBV disease in allogeneic graft recipients have been reviewed in&#xD;
      all participating sites. The incidence of EBV infection in recipients is measured by&#xD;
      quantitative real-time PCR testing performed AT MINIMUM every 1-2 weeks from the time of&#xD;
      transplant until hospital discharge (which is usually around 6 weeks post-transplantation).&#xD;
      After hospital discharge, EBV PCR monitoring is performed at every clinical follow-up visit:&#xD;
      AT LEAST twice per month for approximately 4-6 months post-transplant or as long as the&#xD;
      patient remains immune suppressed. Thereafter, approximately one EBV PCR per month is&#xD;
      performed until 1-year post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In sum, the incidence of EBV infection will be adequately measured during a 1-year follow-up&#xD;
      period. In all sites, AT LEAST 1 EBV PCR test is done per 1-2 weeks during hospitalization, 2&#xD;
      EBV PCR tests per month from hospital discharge to 6 months post-transplantation and&#xD;
      approximately 1 EBV PCR test per month from 6 months to 12 months. The total number of EBV&#xD;
      PCR results that will be collected per patient for the entire follow-up will be approximately&#xD;
      18. These results will be retrieved from patient charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTLD and other complications related to EBV:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes such as high and increasing viral load EBV infection and PTLD will be&#xD;
      routinely screened until one year post-transplant. PTLD diagnosis will be made according to&#xD;
      WHO criteria (Swerdlow et al, 2008) based on clinical or radiologic signs coexisting with an&#xD;
      EBV-positive PCR on blood specimens. Information related to PTLD will be collected in the&#xD;
      case report form. All other complications possibly related to EBV (for example:&#xD;
      hemophagocytic syndrome, hepatitis, etc.) will also be documented. An adjudicating committee&#xD;
      (C. Buteau and C Alfieri) will review patient-specific data elements to confirm PTLD and&#xD;
      other complications related to EBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfused blood products:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on all blood products transfused will be collected and will include descriptors of the&#xD;
      blood product unit (type of blood product, number of units, length of storage, etc.), volume&#xD;
      transfused (milliliters), duration of the transfusion, as well as the date and time of each&#xD;
      transfusion. Total volume received of every blood products will be considered in our analysis&#xD;
      as well as the number of transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A site report form (SRF) will also be filled by each participating center to document its&#xD;
      transfusion protocol such as the type of blood products used for HSCT, leukoreduction, type&#xD;
      of red blood cells (RBCs) (washed, irradiated, CMV negative, etc.), type of plasma (fresh&#xD;
      frozen plasma, frozen plasma, solvent detergent plasma), type of platelet concentrates&#xD;
      (apheresis, pooled, etc,), maximum length of storage (days), etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining the source of EBV in severe EBV infections:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to demonstrate definitively that virus from transfused blood products can be linked&#xD;
      to severe complications such as high and increasing viral load EBV infection/PTLD, we will&#xD;
      genotype the EBV strain from these patients. Blood units administered to these patients will&#xD;
      be traced back to the donors who in turn (with consent) will be serologically assessed for&#xD;
      EBV, and all seropositive donors will have their EBV strain genotyped for comparison to the&#xD;
      patient's strain. Many blood donors per case will have to be traced as recipients receive&#xD;
      blood products from many blood donors (1 unit of RBC is provided by 1 donor, 1 unit of plasma&#xD;
      is provided by 1 donor and 1 unit of platelet is provided by 4 donors). In average, we&#xD;
      expected that about 25 donors will have to be traced per case (estimated with pilot data;&#xD;
      Trottier et al, 2012). We are used in tracing blood donors of graft recipients as reported in&#xD;
      Alfieri et al. (1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief procedure for EBV genotyping :&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 ml of blood (2 ml for infected pediatric patients) is separated by density centrifugation&#xD;
      on Ficoll-hypaque gradients. The mononuclear cell fraction is harvested, washed and cultured&#xD;
      in the presence of cyclosporine so as to allow outgrowth of the donor's EBV-positive cells&#xD;
      and establishment of an immortalized EBV-positive B cell line. The viral DNA within this line&#xD;
      can then be amplified by PCR using primers from the BamHI-K region of the EBV-genome, which&#xD;
      is known to be highly polymorphic among the various EBV strains. The different sized&#xD;
      fragments of the amplified region can be distinguished by migration on an agarose gel&#xD;
      (Alfieri et al, 1996). In order to verify our results for identity between patients and blood&#xD;
      donors we will also employ the EBNA-typing technique which is performed by western blot&#xD;
      analysis using a defined EBNA-positive serum (Alfieri et al, 1996).&#xD;
