  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The threat of premature birth (MAP) is the leading cause of hospitalization during pregnancy&#xD;
      complicated by preterm delivery in 5-10% of cases in developed countries. Psychological&#xD;
      stress that encompasses anxiety and anxiety resounding including sleep quality can be a work&#xD;
      of preacher and premature delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm birth before 37 has an impact on the survival and health of the newborn. It is the&#xD;
      leading cause of mortality and obstetric complications. It has a cost both for the newborn,&#xD;
      the term parturient health but also the financial cost by the management before delivery and&#xD;
      the consequences of a premature birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual management of MAP is hospitalized with tocolysis, monitoring and rest. The&#xD;
      hospitalization and invasive procedures contribute to increasing stress. It therefore seems&#xD;
      necessary to seek to diversify and master reputable techniques for their effectiveness on&#xD;
      mastering stress and improving sleep quality as hypnosis and feel relaxing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypnosis in obstetrics is used primarily to control pain, nausea and postpartum depression.&#xD;
      It also reduces preoperative anxiety and during induction of anesthesia, as well as&#xD;
      behavioral disorders during the first postoperative week. Hypnosis can play an important role&#xD;
      in the prevention of preterm birth. In a non-randomized study, hypnosis combined with drug&#xD;
      therapy has prolonged pregnancy of patients followed in high risk pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relaxing touch brings relaxation and well being. In obstetrics, it has an influence on&#xD;
      the anti-stress hormones and plays a role in reducing pain during childbirth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies interested in hypnosis and relaxation therapies in pregnant women, especially in&#xD;
      case of MAP. The published data relate to a small number of patients and a low level of&#xD;
      evidence. Although there seems promising results, prospective studies are needed to conclude&#xD;
      its effectiveness in improving the stress, pain or other parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health workers trained in these techniques could observe during their production improved&#xD;
      sleep disorders, stress, better communication between doctor and patient. Moreover, these&#xD;
      treatments could induce an improvement in the overall care of patients, and therefore have an&#xD;
      impact on the continuation of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings are based on these hypothesis. There is a clinical gain the contribution of&#xD;
      hypnosis and relaxing touch in women hospitalized for MAP before 32 weeks of gestation. This&#xD;
      would, among other improvements in sleep disorders and stress, decrease pain, and acting on&#xD;
      the extension of the term of pregnancy in women followed by these techniques and a decrease&#xD;
      in hospitalizations of newborns premature neonatology and neonatal intensive care units.&#xD;
