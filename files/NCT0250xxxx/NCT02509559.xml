  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the present study is to combine two lines of research, investigating&#xD;
      the interaction between emotional processing and memory performance (on both behavioral and&#xD;
      electrophysiological levels) and its modulation by ß-blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning pharmacological manipulations with ß-blockers, there are no studies, which&#xD;
      investigated the effects of propranolol on electrophysiological (ERPs) and behavioral&#xD;
      measures of recognition memory along with their codependence on individual variations of&#xD;
      adrenergic receptors' polymorphisms. Till now, also the findings about genetic influences of&#xD;
      ADRB1 and ADRB2 on recognition memory for emotional contents are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the current investigation has been designed to replicate the former results which&#xD;
      revealed reduced ERP correlates of recognition memory for emotional pictures due to&#xD;
      administration of ß-blocker propranolol. Furthermore investigators goal is to test, whether&#xD;
      there are any differences between carriers of genetic variants of the ADRB1 and ADRB2 in&#xD;
      memory performance and/or changes in event-related potentials and in propranolol influences&#xD;
      on the above mentioned processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, investigators hypothesize: (1) a memory advantage of emotionally arousing&#xD;
      stimuli over emotionally neutral pictures; (2) more pronounced ERP components (EPN, LPP,&#xD;
      old-new effect) associated with encoding and memory for emotional stimuli; (3) a reduction of&#xD;
      electrocortical correlates of emotional recognition memory (old-new effect) caused by&#xD;
      propranolol; (4) a potential impact of genetic variants of the ADRB1 and ADRB2 on the&#xD;
      emotional information processing and memory formation alone, and on the propranolol&#xD;
      modulation of those processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, investigators hypothesize additional pharmacodynamic effects of propranolol such&#xD;
      as influence on skin- conductance, pulse waves, burdening heart frequency, pulmonary function&#xD;
      and metabolomics, which might depend on the ADRB1 and ADRB2 genotype.&#xD;

    <description>ERPs were extracted from the continuous electroencephalography signal (EEG). ERPs analyzed during encoding were late positive potentials (LPPs) in the time-range 550-1000 ms after stimulus onset. ERPs analyzed during recognition were late positive complexes (LPCs) for stimuli associated with hit responses (learned pictures correctly recognized as known) and correct rejections (unlearned pictures correctly categorized as unknown) in time range 550-700 ms after stimulus onset. Subtraction of amplitude values for both types of LPCs results in ERP old/new effects.</description>
