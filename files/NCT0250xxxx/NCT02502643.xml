      The purpose of this study is (1) The success rate of OK-432 pleurodesis after thoracic&#xD;
      surgery that air leak over 48 hours (2)The side effects and treatments of OK-432 pleurodesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Methods] This study was a prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled study to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of OK-432 pleurodesis of persistent air Leak after pulmonary Resection. The&#xD;
      adult patient have persistent air leak &gt;48 hours after thoracic surgery, will randomized to&#xD;
      OK-432 pleurodesis (OK-432 group) or normal saline pleurodesis (NS group). The trial will be&#xD;
      conduct from May 25, 2015 to May 25, 2018 in the Department of Surgery at national Taiwan&#xD;
      University Hospital, a medical center. The study protocol was approved by the hospitals'&#xD;
      Institutional Review Boards. A total of 80 cases, the subjects will be the hospital thoracic&#xD;
      surgery ward and received outpatient programs. Eligible Subjects : adults (minimum age&gt; 20&#xD;
      years; maximum age ≦ 70 years old) patients with thoracic surgery and over48 hours of&#xD;
      continuous air leak. The exclusion criteria include: penicillin allergy,primary pneumothorax,&#xD;
      esophageal cancer, immune dysfunction, those who can not sign a consent form, and pregnant or&#xD;
      lactating, other serious concomitant illness such as uremia or liver cirrhosis. Study steps:&#xD;
      eligible Patients will randomize according to computer-generated random numbers, with 1:1&#xD;
      ratio in sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes by a study nurse who was masked to the&#xD;
      study. Randomization envelopes were opened, and randomization was performed by the study&#xD;
      nurse after informed consent was obtain. Eligible inpatients were randomized to the OK-432&#xD;
      group or the normal saline (NS) group，each group are 40 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects were observed by the physician who was masked to the study， about air leak stop&#xD;
      time, chest tube removal time, discharge time, outpatient chest X-ray, pulmonary function&#xD;
      tests as necessary. cases if persistent air leak more than seven days, the attending&#xD;
      physician determines whether pleurodesis again or surgery or other medical treatment.&#xD;
      Finally, the researcher who do not know groups will collection data by &quot;air leak case record&#xD;
      form&quot; including diagnosis, surgical site，the start and end time of the surgery, the use of&#xD;
      antibiotics, discomfort problems (pain , stomach discomfort, cough, fever&gt; 38 ℃, allergic&#xD;
      reactions and respiratory discomfort), postoperative air leak time, air leak stop time ,&#xD;
      chest tube removal time, discharge time, the data will be use SPSS20.0 version of the&#xD;
      statistical software package, and T-test, pair T-test ，Anova ,linear correlation statistical&#xD;
      methods for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: OK-432 success rate, OK-432 side effects, air leak time, chest tube remove&#xD;
      time, length of hospital stay.&#xD;

      [Background and Objective] :Air leak produced after thoracic surgery is a common&#xD;
      phenomenon.Prolonged chest tube placement can lead to empyema or infection, and extended&#xD;
      hospitalization or even death. In 2010 many researchers reported that The incidence of lung&#xD;
      resection produce air leak about 8-26% (Singhal et al., 2010), and even up to 50% (Mueller &amp;&#xD;
      Marzluf, 2014).How to effectively treatment is still not clear.The chemical pleurodesis is an&#xD;
      effective option in management of air leak.There are several chemical agents for pleurodesis,&#xD;
      such as tetracycline and minocycline, talc, Taurolidine, bleomycin, iodopovidone, picibanil&#xD;
      (OK-432), silver nitrate, quinacrine. What kind of chemical agent effective remain&#xD;
      controversial. A study evaluated after thoracoscopic operation for primary spontaneous&#xD;
      pneumothorax the safety and efficacy of chemical pleurodesis with a comparison between&#xD;
      minocycline and OK-432. The OK-432 pleurodesis (19 patients) as the primary treatment and the&#xD;
      primary success rate was 95%.(How et al., 2014).Another retrospective case-control study&#xD;
      examining post-isolated lobectomies and bilobectomies by thoracotomy of Persistent air&#xD;
      leak，sclerosis (talc, bleomycin, minocycline, doxycycline)for the treatment of prolonged air&#xD;
      leak was successful in 40 of 41 patients (the success rate of 97.6%) (Liberman et al., 2010).&#xD;
      The prolonged air leaks after major pulmonary resection still no empirical treatment of&#xD;
      clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: patients were persistent air leak after 48 hours chest surgery will perform&#xD;
      OK-432 pleurodesis .The chest tube time can reduce and length of hospital stay. Extended&#xD;
      applications can significantly reduce medical costs and manpower, and to explore OK -432&#xD;
      pleurodesis side effects and treatment.&#xD;
