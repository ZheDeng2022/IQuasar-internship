  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the effects that ageing may have on the drug levels,&#xD;
      the safety and the efficacy of Dolutegravir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These effects will be measured in people who are aged 60 or over and taking antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy for HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dolutegravir is a newly licenced anti HIV medication, which belongs to a class of drugs&#xD;
      called Integrase Inhibitors. It is taken with two other wellknown agents, Abacavir and&#xD;
      Lamivudine, as part of a one tablet once a day regimen, called Triumeq. There is little data&#xD;
      available on Dolutegravir in the context of older age. The HIV population is ageing and the&#xD;
      investigators know that older age can significantly change the effects and side effects of&#xD;
      medications, including that of antiretrovirals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to investigate the treatment outcomes in older people taking&#xD;
      Dolutegravir including the tolerability, efficacy and safety of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also assess the quality of life (wellbeing of individuals) and cognition&#xD;
      (mental abilities) of people aged 60 or over, taking Dolutegravir. The results from this&#xD;
      study may inform treatment choices and monitoring in this population in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of involvement in the study will be 6 months with an additional screening visit&#xD;
      and a checkup visit 10 days after end of study visit.&#xD;

      Name of Investigational Product:Triumeq®&#xD;
&#xD;
      Name of active ingredients:Abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study title: An open label study to investigate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir and the pharmacokinetic profile of dolutegravir in&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients of 60 years of age and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the steady state pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir 50 mg once daily in&#xD;
           HIV-infected subjects of 60 years or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety, tolerability, patient quality of life and sleep quality and&#xD;
           maintenance of HIV viral load control of abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir once daily in&#xD;
           HIV-infected subjects of 60 years or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the metabolic profile in patients over the age of 60 with HIV infection who&#xD;
           switch antiretroviral regime (metabonomics)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate cerebral function via cognitive testing before and after a switch in&#xD;
           antiretroviral therapy to dolutegravir containing regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and exposure to&#xD;
           dolutegravir&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:Multi -centre, 180 days (excluding screening and follow up), open label,&#xD;
      prospective, one phase pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication:HIV-1 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:HIV-1 infected subjects will be recruited from four different HIV clinics.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects currently receiving stable antiretroviral therapy with an undetectable&#xD;
      plasma HIV RNA and with no evidence of previous HIV resistance mutations on genotypic&#xD;
      resistance testing, will switch their treatment to abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir and&#xD;
      undergo a 24 hour pharmacokinetic assessment at day 28 (+/- 1). Monitoring of adverse events&#xD;
      (not at screening), viral load, quality of life and sleep quality, will occur at screening&#xD;
      and on days 1, 28, 90, and 180. Cognitive function will be tested at screening, baseline and&#xD;
      day 180. A sleep diary will be completed between day 1 and day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned sample size:A sample size of 40 patients would provide at least 80% power to detect&#xD;
      changes in dolutegravir exposure in older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 45 subjects may be screened to have 40 patients completing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of eligibility criteria:HIV-1 infected subjects currently receiving stable&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy with undetectable plasma HIV RNA and no evidence of previous HIV-&#xD;
      resistance mutations on genotypic resistance testing, 60 years old or older (approximately&#xD;
      30% between 60 and 64 and approximately 70% above the age of 65)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of study centres: 4 centres:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton St. Mary's&#xD;
      Hospital Clinical Trials Centre, London Mortimer Market Centre, UCL, London&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment: 180 (+/- 7) days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose and route of administration: All study drugs will be administered orally to subjects&#xD;
      with the following schedule: Abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir one pill once daily&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic parameters of dolutegravir will be evaluated on blood drawn on day 28 (+/- 1)&#xD;
      at 0 (pre-dose), 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours post dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of adverse events (not at screening), viral load, quality of life and sleep&#xD;
      quality will occur at screening and days 1, 28, 90, and 180. Cognitive function will be&#xD;
      tested at screening, baseline and day 180.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Steady state plasma concentrations of dolutegravir when administered to HIV-infected&#xD;
           individuals over the age of 60/65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety, tolerability, maintenance of HIV viral load control, quality of life and sleep&#xD;
           quality with abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir once daily in HIV-infected subjects of 60&#xD;
           years or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of the metabolic profile in patients over the age of 60 with HIV infection&#xD;
           who switch antiretroviral regime (metabonomics)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cerebral function via cognitive testing before and after a switch in antiretroviral&#xD;
           therapy to dolutegravir containing regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relationship between genetic polymorphisms and exposure to dolutegravir.&#xD;
