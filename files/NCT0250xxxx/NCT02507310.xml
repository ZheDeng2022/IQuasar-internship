  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on preliminary data and previous studies, we hypothesize that the ambient temperature&#xD;
      experienced by an individual influences his or her food intake. Specifically, exposure to&#xD;
      temperatures above the thermoneutral zone (TNZ) will decrease consumption in young adults in&#xD;
      a sedentary situation. Researchers will execute a crossover randomized control trial&#xD;
      specifically testing thermal exposure and its effect on individual female's food consumption.&#xD;

      Participants will receive and wear a t-shirt. They will have a thermal image taken of the&#xD;
      inner canthus of their eye and middle finger nail bed, representing a baseline of core and&#xD;
      peripheral temperatures, respectively. They will also have their metabolic rate measured via&#xD;
      a canopy hood method. At their initial visit, they will be randomized to either a colder&#xD;
      environment (66-68°F) or a warmer environment (77-79°F) under the artifice of monitoring&#xD;
      routine office work with abnormal temperature conditions. Their knowledge of the experiment&#xD;
      will be limited until the end. They will experience this temperature while filling out&#xD;
      paperwork and performing basic office tasks for a 7 hour work day. At the beginning and end&#xD;
      of each day they will fill out a questionnaire on their appetite and thermal comfort. After&#xD;
      the first 3.5 hours, another thermal image will be taken and the participant will be&#xD;
      presented with lasagna and water and directed to eat at their leisure and subsequently finish&#xD;
      the office tasks over the next 3.5 hours. A thermal image will be taken and metabolic rate&#xD;
      will be assessed at the end of the day. Snacks will be available throughout the day. The&#xD;
      participants will return approximately 1 week later to experience the other thermal&#xD;
      environment following the same protocols. The participants will then be debriefed on the&#xD;
      parameters of the experiment and body measurements will be taken at the end so as to prevent&#xD;
      bias of the subject by limiting their food intake. We will quantify energy intake by weighing&#xD;
      remaining food and comparing to known caloric content by weight from bomb calorimetry tests.&#xD;
      The infrared thermal images will determine whether the temperatures experienced were extreme&#xD;
      enough to initiate a change in thermoregulation.&#xD;
