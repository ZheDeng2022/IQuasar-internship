    <textblock>
      Distal biceps ruptures occur most commonly among young males in their third and fourth decade&#xD;
      of life. These injuries are becoming more common, however, as the aging population is&#xD;
      remaining active through sport or labour demands. Distal biceps tears or ruptures follow a&#xD;
      heavy eccentric load being placed on a shortened or flexed muscle, and often require surgical&#xD;
      repair. Functionally, distal biceps injuries cause impairment as this portion of the muscle&#xD;
      is largely responsible for supination and flexion at the elbow. Currently there is no&#xD;
      consensus regarding post-operative immobilization protocols, and little evidence is available&#xD;
      regarding timeframe for early return to functional activities. Existing evidence on&#xD;
      functional outcomes post distal biceps tendon repair (DBTR) is of low quality with small&#xD;
      sample sizes, and no known RCTs exist comparing early mobilization to immobilization on&#xD;
      functional return. Reported timeframes for immobilization range from early controlled motion&#xD;
      on day 1 post-operatively to complete immobilization for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study goal is to determine the effect of immobilization compared to unrestricted&#xD;
      mobility post DBTR on early functional return to activities. It has been previously reported&#xD;
      that those with DBTR related to a workers compensation injury returned to full duties in 3.95&#xD;
      months, while those with a non-workers compensation related injury returned to full work&#xD;
      duties in 1.35 months. In Alberta, near 100 WCB claims were made for DBTR in both 2013 and&#xD;
      2014. Early mobilization of these repairs may allow an earlier return to modified and full&#xD;
      work duties, thereby improving the functional quality of life of the individual as well as&#xD;
      reducing the overall cost of disability payments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the 1) time to return to pre-injury work level and 2) time to return&#xD;
      to modified duties among those who have no movement restriction post-repair and those who are&#xD;
      splinted for 6 weeks. Re-rupture rates between groups will also be assessed as will strength,&#xD;
      range of motion (ROM) and quality of life. These findings will assist in developing a&#xD;
      standardized protocol for immobilization to optimize functional and clinical outcomes while&#xD;
      expediting return to work.&#xD;

      Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients who are immobilized for 6 weeks and those who are allowed unrestricted movement&#xD;
      following DBTR, Are there differences during the first post-operative year in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Time to return to work (modified and pre-injury levels)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The proportion of subjects (if any) who re-rupture&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Strength (flexion, supination) of the elbow b. ROM (flexion, supination) of the elbow c.&#xD;
      Self-reported functional quality of life d. Pain between groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A shorter time to return to work (modified and pre-injury levels) will be identified for&#xD;
           the unrestricted movement group compared to the immobilized group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Less than 2% of patients in either group will re-rupture during the first post-operative&#xD;
           year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients in the unrestricted movement group will have greater early improvements in a)&#xD;
           strength; b) ROM; c) functional quality of life scores; and d) pain in the first 3-6&#xD;
           postoperative months compared to those in the immobilized group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretical significance and practical importance Currently there is no consensus regarding&#xD;
      post-operative immobilization protocols, and little evidence is available regarding timeframe&#xD;
      for early return to functional activities following DBTR. Existing evidence on functional&#xD;
      outcomes post DBTR is of low quality with small sample sizes, and no known RCTs exist&#xD;
      comparing early mobilization to immobilization on functional return. Reported timeframes for&#xD;
      immobilization range from early controlled motion on day 1 post-operatively to complete&#xD;
      immobilization for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study goal is to determine the effect of immobilization for 6 weeks&#xD;
      post-operatively compared to unrestricted mobility post DBTR on early functional return to&#xD;
      activities. It has been previously reported that those with DBTR related to a workers&#xD;
      compensation injury returned to full duties in 3.95 months, while those with a non-workers&#xD;
      compensation related injury returned to full work duties in 1.35 months. In Alberta, near 100&#xD;
      WCB claims were made annually for DBTR in both 2013 and 2014. Early mobilization of these&#xD;
      repairs may allow an earlier return to modified and full work duties, thereby improving the&#xD;
      functional quality of life of the individual as well as reducing the overall cost of&#xD;
      disability payments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research plan and methodology Design/Setting: This study is a parallel randomized control&#xD;
      trial with computer generated randomization blocks stratified by surgeon. Patient enrollment&#xD;
      and follow-up will occur primarily at Sturgeon Community Hospital (SCH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size To ensure that the study is properly powered to detect a difference between&#xD;
      groups with a power = 0.90, α = 0.05, µ1 = 14 (unrestricted mobility), µ2 = 21 (immobilized),&#xD;
      δ = 10, a total of 88 participants is required (44 to each group). To allow for attrition of&#xD;
      sample size in the first year, we will enroll up to 100 subjects (50 in each study arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This calculation is based on a conservative estimate of a 1 week difference in return to work&#xD;
      between groups. If the group differences is greater than 1 week we will remain well-powered.&#xD;
      If the group difference is less than 1 week, this is likely not a clinically important&#xD;
      difference between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This sample size of 100 should also be sufficient to allow for further sub-analyses between&#xD;
      participants who are WCB claimants and those who are not and is adequately powered to compare&#xD;
      the secondary and tertiary outcomes between groups, with the exception of re-ruptures, which&#xD;
      is expected to be very low in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Enrollment Patients will be screened for study eligibility at their initial&#xD;
      preoperative clinic visit by the attending surgeon and research coordinator. The research&#xD;
      coordinator will track reasons for exclusion, either by patient refusal or surgeon exclusion&#xD;
      based on patient characteristics. Those who consent will sign and complete an informed&#xD;
      consent form and undergo a baseline evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Evaluation: Consented subjects will undergo a pre-operative assessment by a study&#xD;
      therapist who is independent of their clinical care. The assessment will consist of 1)&#xD;
      baseline demographics form (age, mechanism of injury, past and current medical status, work&#xD;
      and activity demands; dominant hand), 2) work-related questions (i.e. occupation, employment&#xD;
      status, type of work performed) 3) the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand&#xD;
      questionnaire (Q-DASH), 4) visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain at rest and with activity 5)&#xD;
      bilateral elbow ROM in the planes of supination and flexion, 6) bilateral elbow strength for&#xD;
      flexion and supination using a handheld dynamometer (microFET3, Hoggan Health Industries&#xD;
      Inc., West Jordan, UT), and 7) an ultrasound or MRI to confirm the diagnosis. Imaging at this&#xD;
      pre-operative stage is standard of care, and not dependent on study involvement. All data&#xD;
      will be collected using standardized forms and entered into a password-protected database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon the surgeons' ability to perform a tension free repair, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized following surgery to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. immobilized for 6 weeks postoperative or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. unrestricted mobility Those in the immobilized group will be splinted as per current&#xD;
           care for 6 weeks, and will remove the splint only for personal care or active-assisted&#xD;
           ROM and gentle stretching exercises, as prescribed by an occupational/physical&#xD;
           therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those with unrestricted mobility will be able to move the joint as tolerated&#xD;
      post-operatively, but will avoid heavy lifting (&gt;5 pounds) in the first six postoperative&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients who consent, but are excluded at time of surgery will be noted to determine&#xD;
      the proportion of patients who are able to participate in an early mobilization regimen.&#xD;
      Reasons for exclusion will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Each patient will be referred for a course of physiotherapy post-operatively.&#xD;
      Although principles of tissue healing will be followed for both groups, patients in the&#xD;
      unrestricted mobility group are likely to start progressive resisted activities by 6-8 weeks&#xD;
      post-operatively while the immobilized group will likely not start progressive resisted&#xD;
      activities until 8-10 weeks post-operatively. Time (days) of splinting in the immobilized&#xD;
      group will be recorded as the time from when the splint was applied post-operatively to the&#xD;
      date the splint was fully discontinued. Start and end dates for physiotherapy will be&#xD;
      recorded as will the timing of commencing resisted activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Evaluation Participants will be reassessed by the research coordinator and surgeon&#xD;
      at their usual clinic follow-ups at 6 weeks, and 3 and 6 months. Participants will be&#xD;
      reassessed by the research coordinator only at 12 months post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit outcomes to be recorded will include: current working status (not yet working,&#xD;
      modified, full duties) and date of return to any work, ROM measurements, Q-DASH&#xD;
      questionnaire, and VAS pain scale. Any complications related to their injury or causing a&#xD;
      delay in return to work will also be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commencing at the 3 month visit and continuing for all subsequent visits, strength will also&#xD;
      be assessed using a myometer. Start and end dates of physiotherapy treatment will be recorded&#xD;
      to compare the rehabilitation course between groups. Ultrasound imaging will be performed at&#xD;
      12 months, or if there is any history of re-injury to confirm the integrity of the repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis We will be using quantitative analytical methods. Descriptive statistics&#xD;
      (frequencies, proportions, means and variation) will be determined for all variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary outcome (time [days] for return to modified duties) we will use an unpaired&#xD;
      t-test to assess for differences between both groups. T-tests will also be used to analyze&#xD;
      secondary outcomes (time to return to pre-injury level of work, re-rupture rates, and Q-DASH&#xD;
      scores), and time (days) of splinting in the immobilized group will be reported descriptively&#xD;
      (mean). Tertiary outcomes (strength, ROM, Q-DASH) will be analyzed using a two-way repeated&#xD;
      measure ANOVA to examine the trajectory of recovery between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further sub-analysis will be performed to assess primary and secondary outcomes between&#xD;
      immobilized and unrestricted mobility groups for those who are identified as work related&#xD;
      injury compared to non-work related injury using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be two-tailed with a level of significance of α=0.05.&#xD;
