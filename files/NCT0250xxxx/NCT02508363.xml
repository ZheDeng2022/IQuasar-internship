  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of providing the usual health fair&#xD;
      service and follow-up alone plus additional interventions of Navigation Case Management (NCM)&#xD;
      or mobile text messaging (mTECH) and Taxi health Improvement Promoter (TIP). The addition of&#xD;
      NCM or mTECH and TIP to the usual follow-up could prove to be more effective in finding the&#xD;
      best way to make sure taxi drivers go to important medical appointments and have a regular&#xD;
      doctor to help with their health problems. This study will help researchers find out whether&#xD;
      the different approaches are better, the same as, or worse than the usual approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that participants are unable to meet in person for biometric measurements, staff&#xD;
      will accept their self-reported weight, blood pressure, and waist circumference over the&#xD;
      phone. Staff may mail blood pressure machines (to participants who did not receive them at&#xD;
      baseline), scales, and measuring tapes to participants to assist in the completion of&#xD;
      self-reported biometric measures. Along with supplies, participants may also receive a letter&#xD;
      asking for the confirmation of supply receipt.&#xD;

             and noted for potential limitations with study retention and intervention&#xD;
             contamination. Drivers will be allowed to continue the study even if they are no&#xD;
             longer working with the initial garage base.&#xD;
