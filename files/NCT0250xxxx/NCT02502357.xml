  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial comparing the severity of post-operative pain and use of&#xD;
      pain medication in women who are and are not exposed to healing statements before undergoing&#xD;
      vaginal hysterectomy with minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy. The investigators' hypothesis is&#xD;
      that those who are read healing statements before surgery will require less post-operative&#xD;
      pain medications and experience less severe pain than those who do not hear the statements.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial of women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy with minimally&#xD;
      invasive sacrocolpopexy. Eligible patients will be approached for study participation after&#xD;
      they have decided to proceed with the vaginal hysterectomy with minimally invasive&#xD;
      sacrocolpopexy. After enrollment, demographics including age, race, prolapse stage, and&#xD;
      medical history will be collected. Before vaginal hysterectomy with minimally invasive&#xD;
      sacrocolpopexy in the OR, they will be randomized to the group that will be read healing&#xD;
      statements or to the group without healing statements. Women randomized to the healing&#xD;
      statement group will have the following statements read to them by a trained research staff&#xD;
      member, using Peggy Huddleston's technique. Before the patient is placed under general&#xD;
      anesthesia, the study staff member will repeat 5 times:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Following this operation, [the participant] will feel very comfortable and [the participant]&#xD;
      will heal very well&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toward the end of the surgery, the study staff member will say 5 times:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;The operation has gone very well.&quot; &quot;Following the operation, [the participant] will be&#xD;
      hungry. [The participant] will be thirsty and urinate easily.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to reading these statements to the patient, the research staff member will listen to a&#xD;
      previously recorded audio sample of how the statements should be read with regard to tone of&#xD;
      voice and attitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then fill out the VAS pain scale 6 and 24 hours after surgery. Pain medication&#xD;
      use, dosage, type of medication will be assessed by examining electronic medical records.&#xD;
      Time to pass void trial and time to first bowel movement will be recorded on paper and&#xD;
      brought to the patient's 2-week follow up visit. Nausea will be assessed 6 and 24 hours after&#xD;
      surgery using the Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV) Intensity Scale. Patients will be&#xD;
      given standard post-operative instructions for a vaginal hysterectomy with minimally invasive&#xD;
      sacrocolpopexy, and be told to come to the clinic in 2 weeks for a follow up visit. During&#xD;
      this time, the will be told to keep a daily diary of pain medication use including name,&#xD;
      dosage, and amount taken. At the 2-week visit, the patient will fill out another VAS pain&#xD;
      scale and PFDI-20 and their pain medication diaries will be collected. The patient's overall&#xD;
      sense of recovery will be assessed using the PGI. Once the data is collected, statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be performed.&#xD;
