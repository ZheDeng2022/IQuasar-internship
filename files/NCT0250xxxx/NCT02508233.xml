  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many recent randomised multi-centre trials have used the AOS and the involvement of the&#xD;
      French-speaking population is limited by the absence of a French version. The goal of our&#xD;
      study was to develop a French version and validate the psychometric properties to assure&#xD;
      equivalence to the English original.&#xD;

      Power and sample size calculation The required number of patients has been estimated based on&#xD;
      qualities to assess. The reproducibility (test-retest) of the questionnaire is one of the&#xD;
      main properties and assess the lower acceptable limit is .85. However, knowing that the&#xD;
      reproducibility of the English version was .97, the investigators estimated that the French&#xD;
      version would be at least .90. A sample of 10 patients would be sufficient to obtain a power&#xD;
      of 99% with a reproducibility of .901,9. Regarding validity, the investigators wish to obtain&#xD;
      a statistically significant correlation with the three selected tests. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that the lowest correlation between the AOS-Fr and the SF-36 questionnaire would&#xD;
      provide the lowest correlation, because the SF-36 is not specific to ankle OA. By estimating&#xD;
      an average correlation of .50, 30 patients are required to obtain a significant correlation&#xD;
      with a power of 80% and p &lt; .051,9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translation The study was approved by a local ethics committee (protocol #09-130). Following&#xD;
      the guidelines for the cross cultural adaptation process written by the American Association&#xD;
      of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) in 2000, the translation was performed using this six-step&#xD;
      process 2: 1) Initial translation; 2) Synthesis; 3) Back translation; 4) Expert committee; 5)&#xD;
      Test of the Pre-final version; and 6) Submission of document to the developer. For the&#xD;
      &quot;Initial translation&quot;, two independent translators whose mother tongue was French translated&#xD;
      the scale from English to French. The second step of &quot;Synthesis&quot; required these two&#xD;
      translators to meet, discuss and compose a synthesised version of the AOS. Two independent&#xD;
      translators, blind to the original scale, whose mother tongue was English, translated the&#xD;
      synthesised version back to English. An &quot;Expert committee&quot; composed of a linguist, two&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgeons and the four translators revised the whole process and consolidated the&#xD;
      pre-final version. The &quot;Test of the Pre-final version&quot; was performed using 60 subjects, with&#xD;
      no ankle osteoarthritis, who answered the questionnaire and evaluated their comprehension of&#xD;
      each item. From the data collected in this step, some sections of the test were changed to&#xD;
      improve comprehension and readability. For the final step the investigators submitted the&#xD;
      corrected version to Dr. Charles Saltzman, the developer of the English version, who approved&#xD;
      its translation and use (Supplementary data 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of psychometric properties In order to validate the use of the French AOS version,&#xD;
      the investigators set out to evaluate the psychometric properties of the test on ankle&#xD;
      osteoarthritis patients using the same process as the original study validating the English&#xD;
      version of the AOS 6. Patients with isolated ankle degenerative changes at the orthopaedic&#xD;
      outpatient clinic of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke (CHUS) were included.&#xD;
      To be included, patients had to consider French as their mother tongue and be able to read&#xD;
      and write in French. Patients under 18 years old and those with additional foot and/or ankle&#xD;
      pathologies were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, socio-demographic data (age, sex, BMI, occupation) and pertinent past&#xD;
      medical history (Diabetes, neuropathy, ankle or foot fractures)) were collected and patients&#xD;
      were asked to perform single heel lift tests of both affected and unaffected side. The&#xD;
      participants completed three questionnaires: AOS-French version, SF-36, and WOMAC. Criterion&#xD;
      validity was assessed by comparing the AOS to the WOMAC and the SF-36 scores. Construct&#xD;
      validity was established by the examination of the correlation between the AOS scores and the&#xD;
      single heel lift test. Finally, to measure test-retest reliability, the patient was asked to&#xD;
      complete the AOS a second time and a small questionnaire detailing any modification to the&#xD;
      treatment (shoes, orthotics, medication, surgery, injection) one week following the first&#xD;
      visit and return it by mail. Any modification to their treatment between the completion of&#xD;
      the two AOS questionnaires would nullify the test-retest reliability, so these patients would&#xD;
      be excluded in the analysis.&#xD;

        The &quot;Test of the Pre-final version&quot; will be performed using subjects with no ankle&#xD;
        osteoarthritis who will answer the questionnaire and evaluate their comprehension of each&#xD;

        Patients with isolated ankle degenerative changes at the orthopaedic outpatient clinic of&#xD;
        the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke (CHUS) will be used to validate the&#xD;
