    <textblock>
      Anthroposophic therapeutic speech is a complementary method that indirectly influences&#xD;
      breathing and uses specific vowels, consonants, syllables and metres depending on the&#xD;
      indication. The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of anthroposophic therapeutic&#xD;
      speech in patients with asthma regarding clinical and physiological parameters, asthma&#xD;
      control and quality of life.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathing retraining techniques receive increased attention in the management of asthma,&#xD;
      since the evidence for safety and usefulness of such procedures is growing.&#xD;
      Physiotherapist-guided breathing programs, such as the Papworth method and the Buteyko&#xD;
      method, are most systematically investigated and hence yield the best evidence of&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active breathing modulation techniques are frequently assigned to complementary and&#xD;
      alternative medicine CAM, comprising of a variety of systems and modalities other than the&#xD;
      politically dominant healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, patients may take a different perspective, since the prevalence of CAM use in the&#xD;
      treatment of asthma is at a level of 20-30% among adults and 50 - 60% for children, even if&#xD;
      rigorous estimates are being applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthroposophic therapeutic speech applies sounds and syllabic rhythm, e.g. the hexameter, for&#xD;
      improving articulation, breathing and cardiorespiratory interaction. The method has been used&#xD;
      for many years as a breathing retraining method for asthma in all settings. This study is the&#xD;
      first to systematically investigate the effects of ATS in asthma patients in a real-life&#xD;
      outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following hypotheses are tested: i) anthroposophic therapeutic speech improves relevant&#xD;
      parameters of pulmonary function in patients with asthma. ii) anthroposophic therapeutic&#xD;
      speech reduces the use of as-needed medication in patients with asthma. iii) anthroposophic&#xD;
      therapeutic speech improves asthma control and quality of life in patients with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomised, controlled, multicentre, 2-period cross-over clinical trial&#xD;
      conducted at 3 centres in Switzerland and Germany. Participants are randomly assigned in a&#xD;
      1:1 allocation ratio to either firstly receive 11 speech therapy sessions or to wait&#xD;
      (control), followed by a cross-over to the other group.&#xD;
