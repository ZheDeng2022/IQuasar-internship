  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Kinesio Taping (KT ) method was developed more than thirty years ago in order to cause&#xD;
      sensory effects through the epidermis and dermis, generating a variety of physiological&#xD;
      effects in other systems. Clinical effects are well known levels in muscle, neurological&#xD;
      system, injuries, inflammation, edema, among other physiological effects are thus largely in&#xD;
      the theoretical framework. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      Electromyographic (EMG), Electroencephalographic (EEG), muscle temperature and flexibility&#xD;
      effects with the Rectus Femoral muscle KT application. Methods: This is a pilot study with&#xD;
      six subjects in which they were divided into two groups, A and B. Group A received the&#xD;
      application of KT from muscle Origin to Insertion and group B Insertion to Origin, with both&#xD;
      groups taped the non-dominant limb and the dominant limb was used as control group. The first&#xD;
      application was conducted at 0% and the second with 75 to 100% tension. Evaluations were&#xD;
      performed before the first application, immediately and 24 hours later. After this last&#xD;
      evaluation, was withdrawn taping, evaluated without taping, reapplied 75 to 100 % of rated&#xD;
      voltage and in sequence. The sixth last review was conducted 24 hours after this last&#xD;
      application. Before every application a specific vibration was performed on the patellar&#xD;
      tendon in order to trigger a neurophysiological imbalance rectus femoral.&#xD;
