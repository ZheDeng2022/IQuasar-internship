    <textblock>
      Paravertebral block (PVB) combined with light intravenous sedation was associated with a&#xD;
      short hospital stay, less post-operative nausea and vomiting and reduced analgesic&#xD;
      consumption compared to general anesthesia for ventral hernia repair. Given the effectiveness&#xD;
      of PVB in the ventral hernia repair, it would be beneficial to study the effect of PVB with&#xD;
      versus without clonidine in elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly allocated to one of 2 groups with 30 patients in each, using the&#xD;
      sealed envelope technique. Group one will receive PVB with clonidine while group 2 will&#xD;
      receive PVB with placebo.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral block (PVB) showed to be successful in both children and adults. It has been&#xD;
      reported to be an excellent pain reliever and it reduces post-operative nausea and vomiting,&#xD;
      in patients undergoing breast surgery. PVB has proven to be very useful as a regional&#xD;
      anesthetic technique when it comes to surgeries involving lumbar and thoracic dermatome. It&#xD;
      was shown that the PVB combined with light intravenous sedation was associated with a short&#xD;
      hospital stay, less post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and reduced analgesic&#xD;
      consumption compared to general anesthesia for ventral hernia repair. Given the effectiveness&#xD;
      of PVB in the ventral hernia repair, it would be beneficial to study the effect of PVB with&#xD;
      versus without clonidine in elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the hemodynamic stability in a ventral&#xD;
      hernia repair using paravertebral block with clonidine versus the PVB without clonidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives include a comparison of PONV and postoperative analgesic&#xD;
      consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and sampling This is a prospective study with a randomized double- blinded&#xD;
      design that will be conducted between August 2015 and August 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for ventral hernia repair whose age is 65 years and older with American&#xD;
      Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) greater or equal to 2 will be included. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      comprised history of allergic reactions to local anesthetics, bleeding diatheses and spinal&#xD;
      abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly allocated to one of 2 groups with 30 patients in each, using the&#xD;
      sealed envelope technique. Group one will receive PVB with clonidine while group 2 will&#xD;
      receive PVB with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic techniques Since this trial is double-blinded, a specialized nurse will prepare&#xD;
      the syringes for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral nerve block techniques Bilateral nerve-stimulator PVB will be performed at the&#xD;
      levels of T9-T10 or T9-T11 according to the type of ventral hernia and the planned incision&#xD;
      type. The patient will be anesthetized in the lateral decubitus position. Supplemental oxygen&#xD;
      will be given by facemask and regular anesthetic monitors will be attached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each local anesthetic mixture will contain:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For group 1, the syringes will contain: lidocaine 2% 6 mL, lidocaine 2% 6 mL with epinephrine&#xD;
      5µg.mL-1, bupivacaine 0.5% 5 mL, fentanyl 1 mL (50µg) and clonidine 2 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for the group 2, the same anesthetic mixture will be administrated however the clonidine&#xD;
      will be substituted with 2 mL saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data, ASA score, type and duration of surgery will be recorded. Haemodynamics&#xD;
      will be registered such as the mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, preoperatively (baseline), intra-operatively (incision of skin, dissection of&#xD;
      hernia, traction over the sac and closure of incision) and postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for postoperative analgesia consumption, patients with a VAS score between three and four&#xD;
      are given Tramadol Hydrochloride 50-100 mg every 4- 6 hours. If the VAS score is greater or&#xD;
      equal to five, patients receive 1 mg/kg Dolosal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative nausea and vomiting will be recorded in the recovery room and in the regular&#xD;
      ward. Pain assessment will be taken from patients by a verbal statement using Numeric Rating&#xD;
      Scale.&#xD;
