    <textblock>
      The UNCODE Study seeks to better identify the neurological causes of muscle weakness&#xD;
      associated with advancing age. The main study consists of 4 laboratory-based testing sessions&#xD;
      that involve testing muscle strength and physical and cognitive function as well as a battery&#xD;
      of tests to 1) quantify brain excitability (using non-invasive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation), 2) modulate brain excitability (using non-invasive transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation), 3) spinal motor nerve firing characteristics, and 4) brain structure and&#xD;
      function characteristics based on magnetic resonance images of the brain. Additionally, three&#xD;
      option sub-studies are also available for enrollment. The first is a genetics sub-study where&#xD;
      a cheek swab will be used to examine associations between certain genes and the physiological&#xD;
      and functional measures obtained from the main study. The other two sub-studies are&#xD;
      interventions. The first sub-study is a progressive resistance exercise training study where&#xD;
      study participants will undergo 12-weeks of exercise training (3x/wk) and at the completion&#xD;
      of the exercise training the measures obtained in the main study will be re-assessed. The&#xD;
      other sub-study is a mental imagery sub-study where subjects are randomly assigned to perform&#xD;
      a mental imagery training program consisting of imaging strong muscle contractions and&#xD;
      mobility tasks (5x/wk) or to serve as a control (i.e., to not modify lifestyle) for 6-weeks.&#xD;
      At the completion of the respective intervention period the measures obtained in the main&#xD;
      study will be re-assessed.&#xD;

      that involve testing muscle strength and physical and cognitive function as well as a battery&#xD;
      of tests to 1) quantify brain excitability (using single and paired pulse transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation of the upper and lower extremity muscles), 2) modulate brain&#xD;
      excitability of the upper extremity muscles (using non-invasive transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation), 3) spinal motor nerve firing characteristics using decomposition surface&#xD;
      electromyography, and 4) brain structure and function characteristics based on magnetic&#xD;
      resonance images of the brain. Additionally, three optional sub-studies are also available&#xD;
      for enrollment. The first is a genetics sub-study where a cheek swab will be used to examine&#xD;
