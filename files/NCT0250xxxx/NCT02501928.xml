    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs): Merged Data of Studies A0221047 and A0221109</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to a maximum of 56 weeks (24 weeks of treatment in A0221047 and 32 weeks [28 weeks treatment + 4 weeks follow up post last dose] in A0221109)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational product without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly; medically important events. A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events. TEAEs were summarized for each cohort (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, irrespective of treatment received), each treatment group and the total of treatment groups, using the merged data of studies A0221047 and A0221109 as planned.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Visual Acuity at Week 12: Study A0221109</measure>
    <time_frame>A0221109: Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Visual acuity (VA) was assessed for each eye using the Snellen method, where logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units were derived from the Snellen ratios. Participants had to read letters from the chart at a distance of 20 feet/6 meter or 4 meter. VA (Snellen ratio) = distance between the chart and participant, divided by distance at which participant was able to see/read chart without impairment; expressed as decimal. logMAR = log10 (1/decimal VA). In this outcome measure, data have been reported for right and left eye separately. Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for each treatment group of study A0221109 only.</description>

    <time_frame>A0221109: Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. Participants were asked to insert 10 grooved pegs into holes within the given time limit up to 300 seconds. The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand. Time taken to complete the test was inversely correlated to the cognitive ability. Participants were assigned to either a 10 or 25-peg assessment based on their age. 10-peg assessment was done on participants below age of 9 years. In this outcome measure data for dominant and non-dominant hand have been reported separately.

The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand. Number of pegs dropped while putting in the holes were measured. Participants were assigned to either a 10 or 25-peg assessment based on their age. 25-peg assessment was done on participants of age 9 years and above. In this outcome measure data for dominant and non-dominant hand have been reported separately. Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for each treatment group of study A0221109 only.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This (A0221109) was a long term extension (LTE) study only among Japanese participants who participated and completed the precedent study A0221047 (NCT01557244). Per plan, efficacy outcome measures and treatment-emergent adverse events were reported using merged data of studies A0221047 and A0221109.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A0221047 had 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 had an active comparator phase and Cohort 2 had an efficacy phase followed by a safety extension phase for each cohort. Japanese participants from both cohorts, if consented continued in this LTE study and received the same treatment as in A0221047, per investigator judgment on safety and tolerance of participants.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs): Merged Data of Studies A0221047 and A0221109</title>
        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational product without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly; medically important events. A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events. TEAEs were summarized for each cohort (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, irrespective of treatment received), each treatment group and the total of treatment groups, using the merged data of studies A0221047 and A0221109 as planned.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Visual Acuity at Week 12: Study A0221109</title>
        <description>Visual acuity (VA) was assessed for each eye using the Snellen method, where logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units were derived from the Snellen ratios. Participants had to read letters from the chart at a distance of 20 feet/6 meter or 4 meter. VA (Snellen ratio) = distance between the chart and participant, divided by distance at which participant was able to see/read chart without impairment; expressed as decimal. logMAR = log10 (1/decimal VA). In this outcome measure, data have been reported for right and left eye separately. Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for each treatment group of study A0221109 only.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Visual Acuity at Week 28: Study A0221109</title>
        <description>VA was assessed for each eye using the Snellen method, where logMAR units were derived from the Snellen ratios. Participants had to read letters from the chart at a distance of 20 feet/6 meter or 4 meter. VA (Snellen ratio) = distance between the chart and participant, divided by distance at which participant was able to see/read chart without impairment; expressed as decimal. logMAR = log10 (1/decimal VA). In this outcome measure, data have been reported for right and left eye separately. Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for each treatment group of study A0221109 only.</description>

        <description>The visual accommodation was the minimum focusing distance for each eye at which vision became blurred - the mean of triplicate measurements. The participants focused on a single letter of the 20/40 line of an eye chart and chart was moved slowly towards the participant until letter was blurred. At this point, the distance from eye to letter was measured for each eye. In this outcome measure data have been reported for right and left eye separately.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Visual Accommodation at Week 28: Study A0221109</title>
        <description>The visual accommodation was the minimum focusing distance for each eye at which vision became blurred - the mean of triplicate measurements. The participants focused on a single letter of the 20/40 line of an eye chart and chart was moved slowly towards the participant until letter was blurred. At this point, the distance from eye to letter was measured for each eye. In this outcome measure data have been reported for right and left eye separately. Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for each treatment group of study A0221109 only.</description>

        <description>CBCL: assessed child's behavioral and emotional problems. Parent/caregiver of child answered 120 items, each on scale: 0=not true, 1=somewhat/sometimes true, 2=very/often true. 103 items were categorized in 8 domains: aggressive behavior, anxious/depressed, attention problems, rule-breaking behavior, social problems, somatic complaints, thought problems, withdrawn. Summary scores: Internalizing problems =anxious/depressed+withdrawn+somatic complaints; Externalizing problems =rule-breaking+aggressive behavior. Total problems =8 domains+other 17 items. Raw scores for each domain, summary and total problems =sum of scores of related items. Using ADM tool raw scores transformed/derived into standard T-scores, range: each domain=50-100, internalizing problems=34-100, externalizing problems=33-100, total problems=24-100. Lower T-score (8 domain,2 summary,total problems)=better outcomes. Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for each treatment group of study A0221109 only.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) T Score (Derived Score) at Week 28: Study A0221109</title>
        <description>CBCL: assessed child's behavioral and emotional problems. Parent/caregiver of child answered 120 items, each on scale: 0=not true, 1=somewhat/sometimes true, 2=very/often true. 103 items were categorized in 8 domains: aggressive behavior, anxious/depressed, attention problems, rule-breaking behavior, social problems, somatic complaints, thought problems, withdrawn. Summary scores: Internalizing problems =anxious/depressed+withdrawn+somatic complaints; Externalizing problems =rule-breaking+aggressive behavior. Total problems =8 domains+other 17 items. Raw scores for each domain, summary and total problems =sum of scores of related items. Using ADM tool raw scores transformed/derived into standard T-scores, range: each domain=50-100, internalizing problems=34-100, externalizing problems=33-100, total problems=24-100. Lower T-score (8 domain,2 summary,total problems)=better outcomes. Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for each treatment group of study A0221109 only.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) T Score (Derived Score) at Final Visit: Study A0221109</title>
        <description>CBCL: assessed child's behavioral and emotional problems. Parent/caregiver of child answered 120 items, each on scale: 0=not true, 1=somewhat/sometimes true, 2=very/often true. 103 items were categorized in 8 domains: aggressive behavior, anxious/depressed, attention problems, rule-breaking behavior, social problems, somatic complaints, thought problems, withdrawn. Summary scores: Internalizing problems =anxious/depressed+withdrawn+somatic complaints; Externalizing problems =rule-breaking+aggressive behavior. Total problems =8 domains+other 17 items. Raw scores for each domain, summary and total problems =sum of scores of related items. Using ADM tool raw scores transformed/derived into standard T-scores, range: each domain=50-100, internalizing problems=34-100, externalizing problems=33-100, total problems=24-100. Lower T-score (8 domain,2 summary,total problems)=better outcomes. Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for each treatment group of study A0221109 only.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Total Score (Raw Score) at Week 12: Study A0221109</title>
        <description>CBCL:assessed child's behavioral and emotional problems. Parent/caregiver of child answered 120 items, each on scale:0=not true, 1=somewhat/sometimes true, 2=very/often true. 103 items were classified in 8 domains: aggressive behavior, total score range (TSR) =0-36; anxious/depressed,TSR=0-26; attention problems,TSR=0-20; rule-breaking behavior, TSR=0-34; social problems, TSR=0-22; somatic complaints, TSR=0-22; thought problems, TSR=0-30; withdrawn, TSR=0-16. Summary scores: externalizing problems combined rule-breaking and aggressive behavior,TSR=0-70; internalizing problems combined anxious/depressed, withdrawn and somatic complaints, TSR=0-64. Total problems combined 8 domains and 17 remaining items,TSR=0-240. TSR for each domain, summary and total problems was sum of scores of related items respectively. Lower scores for each domain, summary, total problems = better outcomes.Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for each treatment group of study A0221109 only.</description>

        <description>CBCL:assessed child's behavioral and emotional problems. Parent/caregiver of child answered 120 items, each on scale:0=not true, 1=somewhat/sometimes true, 2=very/often true. 103 items were classified in 8 domains: aggressive behavior, total score range (TSR) =0-36; anxious/depressed,TSR=0-26; attention problems,TSR=0-20; rule-breaking behavior, TSR=0-34; social problems, TSR=0-22; somatic complaints, TSR=0-22; thought problems, TSR=0-30; withdrawn, TSR=0-16. Summary scores: externalizing problems combined rule-breaking and aggressive behavior,TSR=0-70; internalizing problems combined anxious/depressed, withdrawn and somatic complaints, TSR=0-64. Total problems combined 8 domains and 17 remaining items,TSR=0-240. TSR for each domain, summary and total problems was sum of scores of related items respectively. Lower scores for each domain, summary, total problems = better outcomes.Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for each treatment group of study A0221109 only.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Grooved Pegboard Test (10 Pegs Group) at Week 12- Time to Completion: Study A0221109</title>
        <description>The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. Participants were asked to insert 10 grooved pegs into holes within the given time limit up to 300 seconds. The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand. Time taken to complete the test was inversely correlated to the cognitive ability. Participants were assigned to either a 10 or 25-peg assessment based on their age. 10-peg assessment was done on participants below age of 9 years. In this outcome measure data for dominant and non-dominant hand have been reported separately. Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for each treatment group of study A0221109 only.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Grooved Pegboard Test (10 Pegs Group) at Final Visit- Time to Completion: Study A0221109</title>
        <description>The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. Participants were asked to insert 10 grooved pegs into holes within the given time limit up to 300 seconds. The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand. Time taken to complete the test was inversely correlated to the cognitive ability. Participants were assigned to either a 10 or 25-peg assessment based on their age. 10-peg assessment was done on participants below age of 9 years. In this outcome measure data for dominant and non-dominant hand have been reported separately. Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for each treatment group of study A0221109 only.</description>

          <description>The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. Participants were asked to insert 25 grooved pegs into the holes within the given time limit up to 300 seconds. The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand. Time taken to complete the test was inversely correlated to the cognitive ability. Participants were assigned to either a 10 or 25-peg assessment based on their age. 25-peg assessment was done on participants of age 9 years and above. In this outcome measure data for dominant and non-dominant hand have been reported separately. Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for each treatment group of study A0221109 only.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Grooved Pegboard Test (25 Pegs Group) at Week 12- Number of Pegs Dropped: Study A0221109</title>
        <description>The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. Participants were asked to insert 25 grooved pegs into the holes within the given time limit up to 300 seconds. The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand. Number of pegs dropped while putting in the holes were measured. Participants were assigned to either a 10 or 25-peg assessment based on their age. 25-peg assessment was done on participants of age 9 years and above. In this outcome measure data for dominant and non-dominant hand have been reported separately. Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for each treatment group of study A0221109 only.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Grooved Pegboard Test (10 Pegs Group) at Week 12- Number of Pegs Placed Correctly: Study A0221109</title>
          <description>The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. Participants were asked to insert 10 grooved pegs into the holes within the given time limit up to 300 seconds. The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand. Number of pegs placed correctly in hole was measured. Participants were assigned to either a 10 or 25-peg assessment based on their age. 10-peg assessment was done on participants below age of 9 years. In this outcome measure data for dominant and non-dominant hand have been reported separately.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Grooved Pegboard Test (25 Pegs Group) at Week 28- Number of Pegs Placed Correctly: Study A0221109</title>
        <description>The grooved pegboard test was a manipulative dexterity test that assessed psychomotor speed, fine motor control, and rapid-visual motor coordination. Participants were asked to insert 25 grooved pegs into the holes within the given time limit (up to 300 seconds). The task needs to be completed once for each hand; firstly, using the dominant hand followed by the non-dominant hand. Number of pegs placed correctly in hole was measured. Participants were assigned to either a 10 or 25-peg assessment based on their age. 25-peg assessment was done on participants of age 9 years and above. In this outcome measure data for dominant and non-dominant hand have been reported separately. Data for this outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for each treatment group of study A0221109 only.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Micturitions Per 24 Hours at Week 12 of Study A0221047 and at Week 28 and Final Visit of Study A0221109</title>
        <description>The mean number of micturitions per 24 hours were calculated as the total number of micturitions divided by the total number of diary days collected at the assessment time point. Number of diary days collected at the assessment time point = number of calendar days when the diary was completed on, even if it was not a full 24 hour period. This outcome measure was only calculated for participants with &gt;0 micturitions at Baseline. Data was summarized for each cohort, each treatment group and total of treatment groups, using the merged data of studies A0221047 and A0221109 as planned.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Incontinence Episodes Per 24 Hours at Week 12 of Study A0221047 and at Week 28 and Final Visit of Study A0221109</title>
          <description>The mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours were calculated as the total number of incontinence episodes divided by the total number of diary days collected at the assessment time point. Number of diary days collected at the assessment time point = number of calendar days when the diary was completed, even if it was not a full 24 hour period. This outcome measure was only calculated for participants with &gt;0 incontinence episodes at Baseline. Data was summarized for each cohort, each treatment group and total of treatment groups, using the merged data of studies A0221047 and A0221109 as planned.</description>
          <population>FAS included all participants who were enrolled and received at least one dose of study medication and had at least 1 observation in efficacy endpoint data after baseline visit in study A0221109. Here, 'Number Analyzed' = participants evaluable for this outcome measure for specified rows.</population>
