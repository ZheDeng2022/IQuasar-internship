      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness and efficacy of&#xD;
      intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS) for treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to two weeks (10 sessions) of treatment with open-label&#xD;
      iTBS, blinded iTBS or blinded sham. 'Open-label' means that you (the subject) and the study&#xD;
      staff will know that you are receiving active iTBS treatment. 'Blinded' or 'sham-controlled'&#xD;
      means that you, the subject, will not know whether the treatment you receive is the active&#xD;
      treatment or the non-active treatment. In the 'sham' condition, the stimulator will turn on&#xD;
      but will not actually be stimulating your brain. Subjects who do not show remission of&#xD;
      symptoms after the first 2 weeks of treatment will receive 10 additional treatment sessions&#xD;
      with open-label active iTBS. Subjects will be evaluated at Week 12 to assess the durability&#xD;
      of symptoms changes.&#xD;

    <description>Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Standard TBS parameters consisting of 3-pulse, 50Hz bursts every 200 ms (5 Hz) at an intensity of 80% motor threshold (MT) will be utilized. Intermittent TBS will be delivered in 2-second trains of bursts repeated every 10 seconds for a total of 570 seconds (1800 pulses) in each session.&#xD;
Each treatment session thus involves &lt; 10 minutes of stimulation. The subject and researchers know what treatment is being administered.</description>

Each treatment session will be &lt; 10 minutes in duration.</description>
