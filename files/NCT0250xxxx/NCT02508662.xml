      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the anti-cancer activity of commercially available, targeted anti-cancer&#xD;
      therapies used off-label for treatment in patients with advanced solid cancer with known&#xD;
      genomic aberrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine outcomes of patients who were treated with matched targeted anti-cancer&#xD;
      therapies based on known genomic aberrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain treatment related adverse events in patients with advanced solid tumor who were&#xD;
      treated with off -label targeted therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine co-genomic aberrations that may contribute to treatment response or resistance&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine feasibility of detecting the genomic alterations in plasma, and the genomic&#xD;
      evolution of circulating biomarkers.&#xD;

      Study Treatment Assignment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, the study doctor will review the&#xD;
      test results in your medical records that were previously performed as part of your routine&#xD;
      care. The results of the testing may be helpful in managing your treatment and may also help&#xD;
      the doctor to find effective off-label use of FDA approved therapies for the type of cancer&#xD;
      you have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After reviewing the screening tests and the molecular test results in your medical records,&#xD;
      the study staff and your study doctor will work together to find an off-label use for an FDA&#xD;
      approved therapy that is best for you. You may receive a single therapy or a combination of&#xD;
      therapies. You and the study doctor will discuss this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor or study staff will tell you which drug(s) you will be taking, the dose of&#xD;
      the study drug(s), and how often you should take them. You will sign a separate consent form&#xD;
      that explains in more detail how the study drug(s) are administered and the potential&#xD;
      benefits and side effects of taking the study drug(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While you are receiving treatment and during follow-up, you will have your routine, standard&#xD;
      of care clinic visits and routine tests so that the doctor may check the status of the&#xD;
      disease to learn if the therapy chosen to treat the disease is having any effect. Information&#xD;
      from these routine visits will be collected and stored by the study staff. The timing of&#xD;
      these visits will depend on the type of therapy you receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During every cycle of therapy (about every 3-4 weeks):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an EKG to check the health of your&#xD;
           heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After even numbered cycles (2, 4, 6, and so on), or more often if the doctor thinks is it&#xD;
      needed, you will have the same imaging scan(s) which were done during Screening to check the&#xD;
      status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;
