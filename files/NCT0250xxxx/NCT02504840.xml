      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used for decades to help diagnose and monitor&#xD;
      neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis (MS). Researchers want to improve how MRI&#xD;
      pictures are taken. They also want to learn more about using newer MRIs with stronger magnets&#xD;
      to get better pictures than standard MRIs provide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect data that will help researchers better understand MS and related diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults 18 and older with MS or MRI findings that appear similar to MS, or with other&#xD;
           neurological diseases that may look or act like MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a review of their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a baseline visit. It will include a physical exam, medical&#xD;
           history, and neurological exam. They may have blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will last indefinitely.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have MRIs. Some MRIs may include a contrast dye. For this, a needle&#xD;
           will be used to guide a thin plastic tube into an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have up to 2 lumbar punctures per year. Skin will be numbed and a&#xD;
           needle inserted between back bones will remove fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may give saliva samples and have an eye exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have evoked potential tests. These measure how the nervous system&#xD;
           responds to different types of stimulation. Participants may sit in front of a TV and&#xD;
           watch pictures on the screen. Or they may wear earphones that make a clicking noise or&#xD;
           static. Or they may get a small electrical shock that may tingle and cause a hand or&#xD;
           foot twitch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have tests of strength, spasticity, sensations, balance, and/or&#xD;
           walking.&#xD;

      Objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this protocol are to study the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS),&#xD;
      primarily through small studies that utilize magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and to&#xD;
      correlate the results with clinical and biological measures. The protocol includes only&#xD;
      techniques with minimal risk (standard and quantitative clinical evaluation, MRI, blood&#xD;
      draws, saliva testing, urine and stool collection, visual evoked potentials, ophthalmologic&#xD;
      evaluation) or more-than-minimal risk (injection of approved gadolinium-based contrast&#xD;
      agents, lumbar punctures) that are appropriate and common in this study population. Under&#xD;
      this protocol, we will conduct:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pilot substudies. These studies are exploratory and hypothesis generating. Once&#xD;
           sufficient data are collected to justify a hypothesis-driven study and a formal power&#xD;
           analysis, further work will continue under either a dedicated protocol or, if&#xD;
           appropriate, a hypothesis-testing substudy. There are no enrollment limitations for&#xD;
           pilot substudies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis-testing substudy. These studies have a specific hypothesis that can be tested&#xD;
           with at most 6 participants per arm. If additional participants are required, a memo&#xD;
           will be sent to the Protocol Review Committee (PIRC) and its statistical reviewer to&#xD;
           request review of a hypothesis-testing substudy for possible additional enrollment.The&#xD;
           memo will also be forwarded to the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individual patient substudies. These studies seek to increase knowledge of a disease&#xD;
           process or to assist in the diagnosis of an individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Technique development substudies. These studies will lay the groundwork for new&#xD;
           experimental paradigms, using the methods approved under this protocol, which can be&#xD;
           further tested in the substudies listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Training of investigators. These studies will be done to train new investigators in&#xD;
           techniques relevant to the studies under this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three groups of study participants will be enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MS patients. Participants with definite, probable, or possible MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient controls. Participants with diseases that share features with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will design small substudies as ideas arise in the course of our work that are pertinent&#xD;
      to the theme of the pathophysiology of MS (or of diseases that share features with MS). If a&#xD;
      hypothesis testing sub-study leads to results of interest and if a larger population is&#xD;
      necessary to reach statistical significance, a separate protocol will be submitted with a&#xD;
      priori hypotheses, specific study design and power analysis adapted from the pilot or&#xD;
      exploratory substudies performed in the present protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      These will include MRI, clinical, and biological outcome measures consistent with the&#xD;
      objectives of the study and its investigators. Imaging measures will focus on features&#xD;
      related to the central nervous system (CNS), particularly focal lesions. Clinical measures&#xD;
      will include standard and established MS disability scales as well as quantitative measures&#xD;
      related to function. Biological measures will include genotype, gene expression, proteomics,&#xD;
      virological studies, and immunological profiling.&#xD;

        Up to 1300 participants will be enrolled onto this open-ended thematic protocol. The&#xD;
        following study populations will be included:- Participants with definite, probable, or&#xD;
        possible MS. These participants either carry a diagnosis of MS, or else their referring&#xD;
        clinicians are considering the diagnosis.-Participants with diseases that share imaging&#xD;
        features with MS. These participants report clinical symptoms or prior MRI findings that&#xD;
        could, in the best judgment of the investigators, be due to inflammatory demyelination of&#xD;
        the central nervous system.- Healthy volunteers.-Withdrawals and dropouts will not be&#xD;
        replaced.&#xD;
