  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a critical need for treatments that address depression and barriers to mental health&#xD;
      care in Parkinson's disease (PD). This randomized-controlled trial will evaluate a 10-session&#xD;
      telephone-guided cognitive behavioral self-help program (TH-CBT) for depression in PD (dPD).&#xD;
      72 people with dPD (and their caregivers) will receive either TH-CBT plus enhanced usual care&#xD;
      (INTERVENTION GROUP) or enhanced usual care only (CONTROL GROUP). Groups will be compared at&#xD;
      baseline, midpoint, endpoint, and 1 and 6 months post-treatment. Participants assigned to the&#xD;
      control group with have the opportunity to receive the experimental intervention (TH-CBT)&#xD;
      after the data collection period (e.g., after the 6-month follow-up evaluation). Given the&#xD;
      public health impact of improved depression treatment in PD, the knowledge to be gained may&#xD;
      be significant and the project could directly impact clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All study procedures, including the initial evaluation, study treatment sessions, and&#xD;
      follow-up study assessments, take place over the phone and no travel is required. All PWP&#xD;
      across the USA may participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will continue to receive their routine medical treatment under the&#xD;
      supervision of their personal doctors (e.g., neurologists, psychiatrists, primary care&#xD;
      physicians, therapists) while participating in the study. In addition to usual care, half of&#xD;
      the participants in the study will receive the experimental telehealth treatment (TH-CBT;&#xD;
      intervention group), immediately after enrolling in the research program. The other half will&#xD;
      only receive usual care (control group) and will have the option to receive TH-CBT, after&#xD;
      completing all study related assessments (9 months after the initial evaluation). Group&#xD;
      assignment will be decided randomly (i.e., by chance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study eligibility will be determined by a qualified professional. Those who qualify for&#xD;
      participation will be randomly assigned (e.g., flip of a coin) to either the intervention&#xD;
      (TH-CBT) or the control group (enhanced usual care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to the TH-CBT group will receive a 10-chapter CBT self-help treatment&#xD;
      workbook, tailored to the unique needs of people with PD, immediately following enrollment.&#xD;
      Participants will read and complete one treatment module per week (approximately 60 minutes&#xD;
      per module plus practice exercises throughout the week). The treatment materials will review&#xD;
      different coping skills for the effective management of depression. Study therapists will&#xD;
      call participants to review the treatment material over the phone every week (after every&#xD;
      chapter) or every other week (after ever 2 chapters), based on participant needs. These&#xD;
      telephone-based counseling sessions will last 60 minutes. It will take approximately 10 weeks&#xD;
      to complete the study treatment materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A family member or friend (carepartner) will also be asked to participate in 3-4 separate&#xD;
      educational sessions (30-60 minutes each), evenly dispersed throughout the 10 week TH-CBT&#xD;
      treatment period. The study treatment provided to the care-partner will teach the&#xD;
      care-partner how to best support the participant with PD as he/she tries to incorporate the&#xD;
      information learned during the study treatment, in day-to-day life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be re-evaluated 6, 11, 15, and 35 weeks after the initial evaluation.&#xD;

    <description>The treatment works by teaching people with PD (PWP) the coping skills needed to manage their emotional reactions to the numerous challenges posed by the disease. Specifically, the treatment targets maladaptive thought patterns (e.g., I have no control; I am helpless) and behaviors (e.g., social isolation, lack of exercise, poor sleep habits, excessive worry), and critically, provides caregivers with the tools needed to encourage the PWPs' practice of their newly acquired coping skills. Treatment is administered over the phone and no travel is required.</description>

This routine treatment (e.g., usual care) will be further enhanced with the provision of written educational materials for effective coping with PD, the close clinical monitoring of depressive symptoms by study staff, and the provision of counseling resources in the local community.</description>
