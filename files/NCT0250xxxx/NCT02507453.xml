      Parabolic flight is the only ground-based condition in which free-fall (0G) can be created&#xD;
      long enough for safely testing changes in human perception and behavior. In addition to the&#xD;
      0G period, parabolic flight generates equal duration periods of 1.8G, which present another&#xD;
      unique opportunity to test the same responses to hypergravity and back to 1G.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that performance decrements occur in astronauts during and after gravity&#xD;
      level transitions. Illusions are commonly felt in orbit as well disorientation and perceptual&#xD;
      limitations, mainly due to both psycho-physiological changes and adaptation and lack of&#xD;
      familiar points of reference in the space environment. Studies performed during previous&#xD;
      space missions showed several changes occurring in different gravity conditions, pointing&#xD;
      out, for example, that colors and shadows were misleading, the depth and distance perception&#xD;
      were weakened, and the linear perspective was lost. Visual perception is of primary&#xD;
      importance for spatial orientation and object recognition because the static vestibular&#xD;
      (otolithic) and proprioceptive signals are absent when free-floating. Consequently,&#xD;
      astronauts become increasingly dependent on vision to perceive motion and orientation. All&#xD;
      these factors play an important role in the adaptation of humans to spaceflight that needs to&#xD;
      be analyzed to understand the underlying mechanisms that regulate human psycho-physiological&#xD;
      adaptive process to changing gravity. Human psycho-physiological health has to be safeguarded&#xD;
      and possibly improved when long-term human space missions are programmed in the near future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this experiment is to investigate if the SWI illusion is present in&#xD;
      altered gravity environments. Since weight cannot be estimated in 0G, investigators have&#xD;
      developed a procedure during which the subject is asked to estimate the objects' mass by&#xD;
      shaking them rather than lifting them. Our results in 1G indicate that a size-mass illusion&#xD;
      (SMI) is also present in 1G. Our hypothesis is that the previously observed alteration in 3D&#xD;
      visual perception in 0G, particularly in the height of 3D objects, as well as the change in&#xD;
      proprioceptive inputs, will be responsible for changes in the SMI in 0G and 1.8G compared to&#xD;
      1G. In a separate proposal, investigators will also propose to perform this experiment using&#xD;
      the ESA short-arm human centrifuge (SAHC), with subjects exposed to various centrifugal force&#xD;
      levels, to further investigate the role of proprioceptive cues in the size-mass illusion.&#xD;
