  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, the antitumor activity and the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of ASP8273 in EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI)-naïve patients with&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR activating mutations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of a single-dose period (Cycle 0 lasting 3 days) and a multiple-dose&#xD;
      period (from Cycle 1 onwards, each cycle lasting 21 days). To compare the PK between ASP8273&#xD;
      Capsules and ASP8273 Capsules A, enrolled subjects will receive a single oral dose of ASP8273&#xD;
      Capsules A on Day 1 of Cycle 0 in the single-dose period and will then be observed for 3 days&#xD;
      (including the day of dosing). In the multiple-dose period, subjects will receive multiple&#xD;
      oral doses of ASP8273 Capsules during each cycle lasting 21 days. From the viewpoint of PK&#xD;
      comparison (bioavailability [BA] evaluation) between ASP8273 Capsules and ASP8273 Capsules A,&#xD;
      data from approximately 15 subjects are sufficient for the evaluation. Therefore, if PK data&#xD;
      of approximately 15 subjects included in BA evaluation are obtained and the sponsor judges&#xD;
      that further acquisition of PK data is not necessary, the single-dose period will not be&#xD;
      conducted in subjects who are enrolled thereafter (subjects not included in BA evaluation).&#xD;
      Subjects will continue to receive treatment with ASP8273 until they meet the discontinuation&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
