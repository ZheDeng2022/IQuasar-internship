      The efficacy of punctal dilatation with insertion of perforated punctal plugs for the&#xD;
      management of acquired punctal stenosis due to allergic conjunctivitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acquired punctal stenosis is a condition in which the external opening of the lacrimal&#xD;
      canaliculus is narrowed or occluded due to chronic inflammation and fibrosis. This condition&#xD;
      is a rare cause of symptomatic epiphora, but its incidence may be higher in patients with&#xD;
      chronic blepharitis, in those treated with various topical medications, including&#xD;
      antihypertensive agents, and especially in patients treated with taxanes for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of punctal stenosis is still unknown, with reported rates ranging from 8% to&#xD;
      54.3%, depending on setting, demographics, and probably interob¬server variability.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the literature suggests that this pathology should be given special&#xD;
      consideration while assessing the tearing patient, because it may involve an easier surgical&#xD;
      solution than in patients with obstruction in the more distal lacrimal system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently many oculoplastic surgeons encounter young patients (usually females) with punctual&#xD;
      stenosis and signs of allergic conjunctivitis but no reflex tearing. In these cases,&#xD;
      treatment for allergic conjunctivitis does not improve tearing. Treatment with punctoplasty&#xD;
      of mini- Monoka stents improve their condition for the short term. However, many patients&#xD;
      experience recurrence of epiphora in the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no uniform clinical guidelines for treatment of the disease. A few methods are&#xD;
      currently used in the management of punctal stenosis. The most common in use are punctoplasty&#xD;
      or intubation with minimonoka stents. Substantial experience with these minor surgical snip&#xD;
      procedures would suggest giving preference to their utilization in the treatment of the&#xD;
      disease in our clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The simplest method involves the use of perforated punctal plugs, a reversible simple&#xD;
      procedure that can be applied in an office setting. Silicon perforated plugs are inserted&#xD;
      after punctual dilatation under topical anesthesia to the lacrimal punctum in order to&#xD;
      maintain a patent tear drain into the nasolacrimal sac. The procedure is simple and usually&#xD;
      pain free. After the procedure topical steroids and antibiotics are prescribed for one week.&#xD;
      Plugs are extracted after a two month period in the outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, evidence for the efficacy of the procedure for acquired punctual stenosis is&#xD;
      scarce. One retrospective series of 44 eyes from 26 patients treated with dilation and the&#xD;
      placement of a perforated punctal plug for acquired punctal stenosis, the success rate was&#xD;
      84.1% (37 of 44 eyes) for cessation of epiphora. The plugs were extracted after 2 months.&#xD;
      Most cases had partial punctal stenosis. Associated eyelid laxity was detected in 14 eyes,&#xD;
      and eight of them underwent a lateral tarsal strip procedure prior to plug implantation. The&#xD;
      mean follow-up period was 19 months. Failures were due to either restenosis or horizontal&#xD;
      eyelid laxity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study evaluated the use of perforated punctual plugs in patients with acquired&#xD;
      punctual stenosis, 20 patients in total. This study showed 85% successes rate in total.&#xD;
      Patients where the procedure failed were usually older and were likely to have blepharitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although perforated punctal plugs are an attractive non¬surgical tool in the management of&#xD;
      acquired punctal stenosis, the long-term results of the procedure and its role in treating&#xD;
      punctal stenosis requires and prospective larger clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design We intend to perform a prospective clinical trial to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      perforated punctual plugs in treating acquired punctual stenosis. Since patients were&#xD;
      previously assigned to treatment by a Crawford tube insertion, this patient group will act as&#xD;
      the comparison group for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult, consenting patients will be recruited from the ophthalmology outpatient clinics in&#xD;
      Rabin Medical Center. Punctal plugs will be inserted in the outpatient clinics for duration&#xD;
      of two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plug insertion will be performed under topical anesthesia after careful dilation of the&#xD;
      lacrimal punctum. Patients will be prescribed topical steroids and antibiotic for a one week&#xD;
      period following plug insertion procedure. Punctal plugs will be removed after two months&#xD;
      treatment period. Follow up time is intended for two years to asses both short term and long&#xD;
      term efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Records for patients who underwent Crawford tube insertion due to allergic conjunctivitis&#xD;
      will be anonymously collected from Rabin Medical Centers' database. The collected data will&#xD;
      be analyzed and used a comparison group for the study.&#xD;
