    <textblock>
      Defects in insulin secretion are central to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) but the&#xD;
      molecular basis and physiological consequences of those defects are poorly understood,&#xD;
      impeding efforts to develop novel therapeutic approaches. Key questions remain unanswered,&#xD;
      such as the extent to which T2D-associated islet dysfunction reflects endogenous defects in&#xD;
      beta-cell mass or function, as opposed to disruption of external factors impinging on the&#xD;
      beta-cells, such as incretins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently the investigators have identified several genetic variations (DNA changes)&#xD;
      associated with the production and processing of insulin in non-diabetic individuals and now&#xD;
      aim to explore in more detail the role of these genetic variations. Utilising a &quot;recruit by&#xD;
      genotype&quot; approach, they will identify individuals with and without genetic variants of&#xD;
      interest from existing databases of research volunteers. The investigators will collect&#xD;
      detailed medical history and measurements, fasted and stimulated blood samples for the&#xD;
      profiling of insulin-related hormones and metabolites. The resulting genetic and non-genetic&#xD;
      data will be used to improve understanding of the role of genetic variation on insulin&#xD;
      secretion and sensitivity defects that lead to the development of T2D.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working with collaborators as part of ongoing genetic studies, the investigators have&#xD;
      identified several genetic variations (DNA changes) associated with the production of and&#xD;
      processing of insulin and are trying to understand how these genetic variations cause&#xD;
      differences in people's ability to produce or process insulin. Their findings will lead to an&#xD;
      improved understanding of how the pancreas produces and processes insulin after a meal and&#xD;
      will help to improve understanding of why some people develop diabetes and some people do&#xD;
      not, despite similar levels of obesity. This question is of great public health significance&#xD;
      because it is unlikely that the prevalence of obesity will fall dramatically in the&#xD;
      foreseeable future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to test the hypothesis that individuals carrying different&#xD;
      genetic variations have different abilities to produce or process insulin. They will test the&#xD;
      consequences of these genetic variations when the pancreas has to produce insulin in response&#xD;
      to a meal or components of a meal, such as sugar or amino acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective &quot;recruit by genotype&quot; cohort study that will test the role of several&#xD;
      genetic variants (or combinations of variants) over a 4 year period (late 2014 to late 2018).&#xD;
      The genetic variants will be chosen if there is strong evidence that they have a role in the&#xD;
      pancreas and on insulin secretion. Each genetic variant will involve a different set of&#xD;
      research volunteers and a slightly different set of tests. Participants will be blinded to&#xD;
      their genetic variant status. Some genetic variants will be identified during the next 4&#xD;
      years so it is not possible to define at the outset a detailed methodology for all cohorts to&#xD;
      be studied. This protocol has therefore been written to describe a core protocol relevant to&#xD;
      the whole study, with appendices to describe specific cohorts within the study. Since the&#xD;
      general management and ethical issues are overarching, as new genetic variants are identified&#xD;
      over the 4 year study period, cohort-specific appendices will be added as major amendments,&#xD;
      rather than submitting each cohort as a separate ethics application. The procedure for&#xD;
      recruitment and testing of each set of research volunteers will be the same except for a&#xD;
      component that will be outlined in cohort-specific appendices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be identified from existing research cohorts managed by the NIHR Exeter&#xD;
      Research Facility (Exeter CRF) and/or the Oxford Biobank (OBB) and recruitment will be&#xD;
      facilitated within the Exeter CRF and/or Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and&#xD;
      Medicine (OCDEM). Individuals will be identified with the variant of interest or as gender,&#xD;
      age and BMI matched controls. All potential participants will be 'blinded' by a Data Manager&#xD;
      so that the study team does not know which participants have the variant and which are&#xD;
      controls. They will be invited into the study by letter, and provided with the study&#xD;
      information sheet and study team contact details. A member of the study team will contact&#xD;
      them within 2-3 weeks to determine whether they are interested in participating, to offer&#xD;
      them greater explanation of what the study entails, and to check their eligibility. If they&#xD;
      agree to take part, verbal consent for a fasted visit will be sought and an appointment will&#xD;
      be made and confirmed in writing/by email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying genetic variation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring the genetic factors in these individuals is an ongoing process that involves&#xD;
      routine lab measures using the single existing DNA sample that the volunteers provided during&#xD;
      their participation in the Exeter 10000 Project/OBB. As of June 2014, in Exeter 94 genetic&#xD;
      variants (aka DNA changes) have been measured in 5600 EXTEND volunteers and 800,000 genetic&#xD;
      variants in a subset of 1700 EXTEND volunteers. During the course of the next 4 years, the&#xD;
      genetic measures will be extended to all participants (up to 10,000) and all variants&#xD;
      (800,000+). These data will be returned to the EXTEND/OBB database as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals identified with a genetic variation of interest will be invited to participate&#xD;
      (30-50, dependent on the associated specific tests) together with a similar number of gender,&#xD;
      age, and BMI matched control individuals without the variation of interest. The definition of&#xD;
      matching will be same sex, age +/- 1 year, and BMI within 1 kgm2 unit but these ranges may be&#xD;
      broadened if not enough individuals are available in the tighter definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to fast overnight (from 10 pm the night before), avoid&#xD;
      strenuous exercise and smoking for 24 hours prior to attending a morning visit at the Exeter&#xD;
      CRF/OCDEM (approx 2-4 hours depending on test choice). Participants will be asked to sign a&#xD;
      written consent form prior to any data collection or test. Patients who lack capacity to&#xD;
      consent will not be recruited. Participants will be given the opportunity to contact a member&#xD;
      of the research team to discuss the project in more detail if desired. All participants will&#xD;
      be informed of the nature and purpose of the study, its requirements and possible hazards,&#xD;
      and their rights to withdraw at any time from the study without prejudice and without&#xD;
      jeopardy to any future clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo core data collection, measurements and provide fasted and&#xD;
      stimulated blood samples. A cohort of participants may be asked to return for a second visit&#xD;
      to undergo a further test to provide comparison measures. Test choice depends on the genetic&#xD;
      variation being studied - detailed in cohort-specific appendices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core data collection, measurements and samples for all participants - approx. 1 hour&#xD;
      Anthropometry: data, including Height (m), Weight (Kg), Waist (cm) and Hip (cm)&#xD;
      circumference, will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history: including current medications and lifestyle information (smoking/alcohol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BOD POD: Participants will be asked to have their fat mass measured by BOD POD. This&#xD;
      non-invasive technique provides a more accurate measure of fat mass compared to bioimpedence&#xD;
      measures, or measures of height and weight. Participants that opt out of this test will not&#xD;
      be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed body composition measures will be obtained using the Body Composition Tracking&#xD;
      System. This briefly comprises a BOD POD machine, electronic scales, and a computer. It uses&#xD;
      the principles of body densitometry (measuring mass and volume) to calculate the&#xD;
      participant's percentage and absolute amounts of fat and fat free mass. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to wear minimal clothing (e.g. swimming costume) and a close fitting swim hat. They&#xD;
      stand on the electric scales to record their weight which is then calibrated with the BOD&#xD;
      POD. Participants are asked to sit inside the BOD POD for up to 1 minute at a time (max 3&#xD;
      times). The computer will then analyze and generate the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small cannula (thin plastic tube) will be inserted into a vein, following standard clinical&#xD;
      practice to minimise any potential trauma from repeat blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasted samples will be obtained for baseline measures (including routine glucose and lipid&#xD;
      measurement), DNA, plasma, and serum, for storage and future batched analysis including&#xD;
      measures of glucose and insulin and other markers of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulated blood samples will be obtained from all participants. The choice of stimulation&#xD;
      agent will be dependent on the specific genetic variation under study. At the end of the test&#xD;
      period, the cannula will be removed and the participant will be offered&#xD;
      breakfast/refreshments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions of the genotypes of interest and details of the visit(s) are provided in the&#xD;
      protocol's cohort-specific appendices. In addition to the core data collection, measurements&#xD;
      and fasted samples, each cohort will undertake up to two of the tests described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A: Glucose-Potentiated Arginine-Induced Insulin secretion (GPAIS) - approx. 1½ hrs Rationale.&#xD;
      This test is designed primarily to test the maximum insulin secretion capacity of a&#xD;
      participant's beta cells. It provides the best available surrogate for beta cell mass, as&#xD;
      opposed to beta cell function (Kahn 2008) and will therefore help to improve understanding of&#xD;
      the mechanisms of how chosen genetic variants influence risk of diabetes. It has recently&#xD;
      been shown to correlate well with the number of (autologous) islets transplanted into&#xD;
      pancreatitis patients following pancreatectomy. In dogs and non-human primates it correlates&#xD;
      well with % beta cell mass (reviewed in Kahn 3). The test is based on the well-described&#xD;
      (Kahn 2008; Larsson &amp; Ahren 1998) principle that a non-glucose secretagogue, such as the&#xD;
      amino acid arginine, will produce greater insulin response when potentiated by high glucose&#xD;
      levels, with the combined stimulus producing a near maximal beta cell response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GPAIS test involves 5 stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Set up. Intravenous catheters will be inserted into antecubital veins in both arms. One&#xD;
           arm will be used for infusion of glucose/amino acid, and the other arm for intermittent&#xD;
           sampling. Blood glucose concentration will be monitored with regular YSI measures&#xD;
           throughout the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AIRarg (acute insulin response to arginine). Baseline samples will be taken at -2 and -0&#xD;
           min. A maximally stimulating bolus dose of arginine hydrochloride (5 g) will then be&#xD;
           injected intravenously for 45 s. Samples will be collected at +2, +3, +4 and +5 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Acute insulin response to intravenous glucose (unvalidated measure of acute insulin&#xD;
           response to intravenous glucose AIRglucose). Next a high-speed (900 ml/hr) 20% glucose&#xD;
           infusion over 10-25 minutes will be commenced (total volume infused up to 410 ml).&#xD;
           Samples will be collected at -5, -2 min (before starting the high speed infusion) and&#xD;
           then at 2 minute intervals for 10 minutes following the start of the glucose infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. AIRMAXarg. When the glucose levels have reached 20mmol/L (or after 25 mins max), repeat&#xD;
           baseline samples will be taken, the glucose infusion lowered to 300ml/hr and a second&#xD;
           arginine hydrochloride (5 g) bolus will be injected, followed by final +2, +3, +4 and +5&#xD;
           min samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Recovery and monitoring of glucose and insulin as participant's glucose levels return to&#xD;
           baseline. Samples for glucose and insulin will be collected every 10 minutes for 50&#xD;
           minutes after the end of the AIRMAXarg test to monitor the participant's recovery and&#xD;
           provide a measure of insulin sensitivity. Blood sugar will be monitored with regular YSI&#xD;
           measures until the participant's blood sugar returns to a safe level. The participant&#xD;
           will be given a light lunch at the end of this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples: at all time points insulin and glucose will be measured. Spare aliquots will be&#xD;
      saved and stored at -80oC for potential additional analysis, such as glucagon and C-peptide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B: Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test (IGTT aka IVGTT) - approx. 30 minutes Rationale. This&#xD;
      test is an accepted, standard measure of first phase insulin secretion that does not involve&#xD;
      the neurohormonal (incretin) and absorption effects of an oral glucose challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C: Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) - approx. 2.5 hrs Rationale. This test is an accepted,&#xD;
      standard measure of insulin secretion and absorption effects of an oral glucose challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D: Stool sample for faecal elastase measurement Rationale. This will test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      the genetic polymorphism may influence exocrine pancreatic function in addition to pancreatic&#xD;
      endocrine function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be provided with a specimen container, prepaid padded envelope,&#xD;
      transport container, and instructions to collect and post a faecal sample for analysis.&#xD;
      Provision of a faecal sample will be optional and will not be essential for inclusion in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
