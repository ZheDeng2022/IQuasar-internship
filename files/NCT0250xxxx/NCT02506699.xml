  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For ten years, rTMS, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex, has&#xD;
      found its place in the treatment of drug-resistant neuropathic pain. Patients relieved by&#xD;
      some sessions may thereafter receive a chronic invasive stimulation via electrodes implanted&#xD;
      through a neurosurgical procedure. This is common practice at the University Hospital of Caen&#xD;
      and in different CHU with the proper equipment rTMS. It seems permissible to provide in our&#xD;
      center only a non-invasive technique for patients challenged with brain surgery, since&#xD;
      according to the various meta-analyzes the analgesic efficacy of rTMS seems to be correlated&#xD;
      to the repetition of sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment centers and the treatment of pain allow a multidimensional assessment,&#xD;
      bio-psycho-social of patients in order to optimize their management and experience&#xD;
      efficiently analgesics first- and second-line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a study evaluating the analgesic efficacy of rTMS, in relevant stimulation&#xD;
      parameters reproduced according to a literature review, during 3 months after 5 active&#xD;
      sessions separated by one week apart, in 15 patients with neuropathic pain chronic refractory&#xD;
      to treatment of first and second line, followed by multidisciplinary center specializing in&#xD;
      chronic pain Lower Normandy. The quality of life will also be assessed by validated scales,&#xD;
      and the results will be compared to the literature data.&#xD;
