    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b/2, multicenter, open-label, basket trial to evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      talimogene laherparepvec injected intrahepatically into liver tumors alone and in combination&#xD;
      with systemic IV administration of pembrolizumab, in subjects with non-HCC liver metastases&#xD;
      from BC, CRC, gastroesophageal cancer (GEC), melanoma, NSCLC, RCC in Part 1 Group A, and&#xD;
      subjects with HCC with and without viral hepatitis in Part 1 Group B (viral hepatitis is only&#xD;
      applicable in combination setting), and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intratumoral&#xD;
      talimogene laherparepvec in combination with systemic pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced&#xD;
      TNBC, hormone receptor positive breast cancer, CRC, CSCC, and BCC in Part 2 Group A and&#xD;
      subjects with HCC with and without viral hepatitis in Part 2 Group B. The objective of Part 1&#xD;
      is to evaluate the safety of intrahepatic injection of talimogene laherparepvec into liver&#xD;
      tumors alone and in combination with systemically administered pembrolizumab for the non-HCC&#xD;
      (Group A) and HCC (Group B) cohorts separately. Part 2 consists of 2-stage design to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of talimogene laherparepvec in combination with systemic&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. Efficacy and safety will be evaluated in each of the five non-HCC tumor types&#xD;
      from Group A separately. Similarly, the efficacy and safety of the combination treatment will&#xD;
      be determined for Group B HCC subjects.&#xD;

        prior hepatitis B and/or C infection, HBV and/or HCV viral load by qPCR must be&#xD;
        undetectable, and they must not have had recent treatment within 12 weeks for HBV or HCV&#xD;
        with certain antiviral medications in Part 1 Group B cohorts 1-5 and 6a, and Part 2 Group B&#xD;
        HCC without viral hepatitis. For all patients in Part 1 and for patients in Part 2 where&#xD;
        intrahepatic liver injection is planned, there should be no macroscopic intravascular&#xD;
        invasion of tumors into the main portal vein, hepatic vein, or vena cava. Subjects must&#xD;
        not: have active herpetic skin lesions or prior complications of herpetic infection (eg,&#xD;
        herpetic keratitis or encephalitis); require treatment with an antiherpetic drug; have&#xD;
        received live-virus vaccination within 30 days of planned treatment start; have previous&#xD;
        therapy with talimogene laherparepvec, oncolytic viruses, or tumor vaccine. Subjects in the&#xD;
        combination treatment cohort must not have: a history or evidence of psychiatric, substance&#xD;
        abuse, or any other clinically significant disorder; toxic effects of the most recent prior&#xD;
        chemotherapy not resolved to grade 1 or less (except alopecia); or expected other cancer&#xD;
        therapy while on study with the exception of local radiation to the site of bone or other&#xD;
        metastasis for palliative treatment. Male subjects of reproductive potential in the&#xD;
        combination treatment must be willing to use acceptable methods of effective contraception&#xD;
        during treatment and through 4 months after the last dose of pembrolizumab.&#xD;

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication (or other new use) have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
