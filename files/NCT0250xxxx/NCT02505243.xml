      The aim of this study is to evaluate RBV plasma concentrations when used in combination with&#xD;
      newly developed DAA combinations. If possible, its correlations with SVR rates and incidence&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ribavirin (RBV) is a synthetic guanosine analogue that is used to treat patients infected&#xD;
      with hepatitis C virus (HCV). For many years, RBV has been the cornerstone of the HCV&#xD;
      treatment in combination with peg interferon (PEG-IFN). Since the development of&#xD;
      direct-acting antivirals (DAA), PEG-IFN free treatment regimes became first choice of HCV&#xD;
      treatment in the Netherlands. RBV still plays an important role in some of these regimens.&#xD;
      The European Association for the Study of the liver (EASL) included RBV in PEG-IFN free&#xD;
      regimens in combination with sofosbuvir, simeprevir and daclatasvir for HCV genotype (GT) 1,&#xD;
      3 and 4. Patients with predictors of poor response are candidates for DAA therapy combined&#xD;
      with RBV, for instance prior null responders and/or patients with cirrhosis. For the&#xD;
      treatment of genotype 2 (GT2) and 3 RBV is used in combination with sofosbuvir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic HCV infection is treated with combination therapy, therefore manufacturers developed&#xD;
      combination tablets such as Gilead's Harvoni (ledipasvir + sofosbuvir) and Abbvie's 3D&#xD;
      combination (paritaprevir, ombitasvir, dasabuvir and ritonavir). Possibly, RBV will be added&#xD;
      to these regimes in the future when the patient is a prior null responder or suffering from&#xD;
      cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As RBV is a guanine analogue it is not specific for HCV and some severe adverse effects are&#xD;
      known. The most important adverse effect is haemolytic anaemia,which usually occurs during&#xD;
      the first weeks of treatment (&gt;10% of the treated patients, depending on co-medication).&#xD;
      Other adverse reactions that were frequently reported were: neutropenia, anorexia,&#xD;
      depression/insomnia, headache, dizziness, dyspnea, and cough 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In dual (PEG-IFN + RBV) HCV therapy RBV concentrations were associated with efficacy and&#xD;
      toxicity. Also in former studies in HCV-infected patients treated with telaprevir (TVR) or&#xD;
      boceprevir (BOC) in combination with PEG-IFN, the plasma concentration of RBV was associated&#xD;
      with Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) and anaemia (defined as Hb&lt;8,5 g/dL). We have tried&#xD;
      to determine an optimal therapeutic range for RBV when combined with these DAAs. The plasma&#xD;
      concentration of RBV at week 8 should be 2.2-5.3 mg/L in combination with TVR. 48% of the HCV&#xD;
      patients in the cohort had these plasma concentrations of which 81% achieved SVR and 5.2%&#xD;
      reported anaemia. In combination with BOC the plasma concentration should be 2.2-3.6 mg/L,&#xD;
      50% of patients had these concentrations. In this group 69% of patients achieved SVR and 46%&#xD;
      anaemia. So, for these therapies, therapeutic ranges for RBV could be defined for the optimal&#xD;
      SVR rates and the lowest incidence of anaemia 6, 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As TVR and BOC have now been replaced by novel DAAs, we would like to investigate this&#xD;
      described relationship between RBV concentrations, SVR and anaemia also with the newer DAAs&#xD;
      that were licensed in the last year (simeprevir and sofosbuvir) and that are going to be&#xD;
      available in 2015 in The Netherlands (daclatasvir, Harvoni, Abbvie 3D combo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate RBV plasma concentrations when used in combination with&#xD;
      newly developed DAA combinations. If possible, its correlations with SVR rates and incidence&#xD;
      of anaemia will be assessed in HCV-patients.&#xD;
