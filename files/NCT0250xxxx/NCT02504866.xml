      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) often causes problems with moving and balance, and thinking&#xD;
      and emotions. Exercise can improve these things in people with other brain damage.&#xD;
      Researchers want to look at the effect of exercise on these things in people with TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study how head injuries affect the brain. To study if exercise can help some symptoms in&#xD;
      people with TBI. These include problems thinking, balancing, and moving, and depression or&#xD;
      anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People age between 18 and 79 :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Had a non-penetrating TBI at least 12 months ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are physically inactive, but can stand and walk without help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine&#xD;
           tests. They may have a balance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be assigned to a high-intensity or a lower-intensity exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study is 6 months long. There will be 3 months with exercise on an elliptical&#xD;
           machine and 3 months without exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will exercise for 30 minutes on an elliptical machine, 3 days per week for&#xD;
           3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also have 3 outpatient testing visits lasting approximately 8 hours,&#xD;
           once every 3 months. This visit will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests for memory, attention, and thinking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests of walking and balance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An MRI: they will lie in a machine that takes pictures of their brain, while breathing&#xD;
           regular air and air with more carbon dioxide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test of physical fitness.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad objective of this study is to examine the effects of moderate and more intense&#xD;
      aerobic exercise as an intervention on cognitive performance, physical functioning and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life in patients with chronic (more than 12 months post-injury)&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury (TBI). Importantly, structural and biological brain changes will be&#xD;
      measured to examine whether functional outcomes are related to exercise-induced adaptations.&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that in the chronic phase of persons with TBI, there will be improved: 1)&#xD;
      cognitive function, 2) physical fitness and fatigue severity, 3) motor performance and&#xD;
      balance, and 4) mood and depressive symptoms, in those that performed the exercise&#xD;
      intervention compared to a control group. It is also hypothesized that these functional&#xD;
      improvements will be related to exercise intensity, improved cortical connectivity, dopamine&#xD;
      transmission gene scores, and blood biomarkers related to neuroand angio-genesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      80 ambulatory adults with non-penetrating TBI will be enrolled. Subjects will be recruited&#xD;
      from NIH, affiliated hospitals/clinics and the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will perform baseline assessments including cognitive and behavioral&#xD;
      performance, brain imaging, fitness, motor and balance testing, and selected blood and&#xD;
      genetic testing. Thereafter, subjects will be randomized to either a waitlist control, or one&#xD;
      of two exercise conditions: 1) 30 minutes at a fast pace, moderate-intensity (rapidresistive&#xD;
      exercise; RET); 2) 30 minutes at higher-intensity (aerobic exercise; AET). Both exercise&#xD;
      groups will perform the exercise on an elliptical trainer 3 times a week, for a session&#xD;
      duration of 45 minutes including warm-up and cool-down. The RET group will focus on rapid&#xD;
      reciprocal motion with minimal resistance, while the AET group will exercise at an elevated&#xD;
      intensity known to produce an aerobic effect. After 12 weeks, all groups will repeat the&#xD;
      baseline assessments (3 month follow-up). Following this assessment, the waitlist control&#xD;
      group will be randomized to either RET or AET and the exercise groups will cease formal&#xD;
      supervised exercise sessions. A third assessment visit will be performed after an additional&#xD;
      12 weeks (6 month follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive performance will be tested and interpreted compared to norms. Performance on motor&#xD;
      and balance tasks will be assessed with the Smart Balance Measurement System and the GAITRite&#xD;
      System. Physical fitness will be determined by peak oxygen consumption and aerobic threshold&#xD;
      as measured by pulmonary gas exchange during an exercise tolerance test on the treadmill.&#xD;
      Structural brain volumes will be determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cortical&#xD;
      connectivity will be quantified using resting state functional MRI and Diffusion Tensor&#xD;
      Imaging (DTI) to evaluate integrity of and changes in white matter tracts in response to&#xD;
      exercise. Blood will be collected to quantify the presence of biomarkers (such as VEGF, BDNF&#xD;
      and IGF-1) and dopamine transmission. Other self-reported measures of quality of life,&#xD;
      fatigue severity, depression and sleep quality would also be collected.&#xD;
