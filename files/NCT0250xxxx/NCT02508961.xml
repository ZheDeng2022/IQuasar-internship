  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a pragmatic, single blind, randomised, controlled feasibility study,&#xD;
      comparing 6 months of web-based physiotherapy plus usual care with usual care alone in pwMS.&#xD;
      The study will recruit 90 pwMS from three UK Centres (30 from each centre); NHS Ayrshire and&#xD;
      Arran, NHS Lothian, and Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial examining&#xD;
      the effectiveness of a six-month web-based physiotherapy programme and usual care compared to&#xD;
      usual care alone, in people moderately affected by MS and to gather essential information for&#xD;
      the planning of a definitive trial, which would evaluate both clinical and cost effectiveness&#xD;
      of the intervention.&#xD;

      Following baseline assessments, both groups will be given an appointment with the&#xD;
      physiotherapist to agree shared goals and to devise an individualised exercise programme&#xD;
      based upon their needs and treatment goals. Participants will then be randomised to one of&#xD;
      two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomised to the intervention group will receive their individualised exercise&#xD;
      programme delivered via the web-based physio website. Participants will be asked to complete&#xD;
      their exercise programme at least twice weekly. They will receive weekly standardised phone&#xD;
      calls from the physiotherapist for the first two weeks of the programme. Every two weeks&#xD;
      thereafter for the remainder of the 6 month intervention period the physiotherapist will&#xD;
      review the exercise diary of each participant and remotely alter the participant's exercise&#xD;
      programme as appropriate, by changing any combination of exercises, level of difficulty or&#xD;
      number of repetitions. The number and type of exercises within the programme and duration to&#xD;
      complete the exercise programme will be documented. Participants will be informed of any&#xD;
      changes by standardised email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomised to the control group will receive a print out exercise sheet of their&#xD;
      individualised exercise programme. Participants will be asked to complete their exercise&#xD;
      programme at least twice weekly. Compliance will be captured using a home exercise diary.&#xD;
      Participants will also receive a weekly phone call from the physiotherapist for the first two&#xD;
      weeks to check on progress.&#xD;

    <description>Participants receive an online individualised exercise programme to complete over the internet twice per week. Exercises can be a combination of aerobic, strengthening and balance exercises. Participants receive a weekly phone call from a physiotherapist for the first two weeks to check on progress. After this, every 2 weeks online exercise diaries are remotely monitored by a physiotherapist and exercise programmes progressed as appropriate.</description>
