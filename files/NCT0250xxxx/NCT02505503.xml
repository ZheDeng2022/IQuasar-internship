  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some people experience a cramp-like leg pain during walking that is relieved only by rest.&#xD;
      This is called intermittent claudication (IC) and it is a common symptom of peripheral&#xD;
      arterial disease. Patients with IC struggle to walk, which in turn lowers their quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensity of IC pain experienced during walking depends on several factors, including the&#xD;
      type of footwear worn. For example, non-supportive shoes may make the calf muscles work&#xD;
      harder during walking, leading to earlier and more-severe symptoms of IC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the research team has developed a shoe that reduces the work done by the&#xD;
      lower-leg muscles during walking. Preliminary data indicate that, when wearing these&#xD;
      &quot;unloading shoes&quot;, people with IC were able to walk further without pain as compared with&#xD;
      when wearing a normal pair of shoes. The current project aims to provide further information&#xD;
      on the usefulness and acceptability of these shoes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty people with IC will complete a set of three walking tests on two separate occasions;&#xD;
      once whilst wearing the unloading shoes, and once whilst wearing some normal shoes. The&#xD;
      participants will then be given a pair of unloading or normal shoes to wear for two weeks,&#xD;
      after which we will collect information on how acceptable the shoes were to wear via a survey&#xD;
      of all participants and one-to-one interviews with a subset of participants.&#xD;

      Study design This is a single-centre, randomised crossover study with a qualitative&#xD;
      component. Forty patients will be recruited from York Hospital. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      perform walking assessments on two week days within a maximum period of two weeks.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to complete walking assessments whilst wearing&#xD;
      unloading shoes on day 1, followed by walking assessments whilst wearing control shoes on day&#xD;
      2, or vice versa. All participants will then be given the unloading or control shoes to wear&#xD;
      for two weeks, after which they will complete a survey about how acceptable the shoes were to&#xD;
      wear. A sub-sample of participants will also be interviewed about the acceptability of the&#xD;
      shoes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting Recruitment for this study will take place at York Hospital, York, United&#xD;
      Kingdom. Study assessments will take place at York St John University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unloading shoe The design of the &quot;unloading&quot; shoe to be used in this research will be a&#xD;
      modern style of trainer-type shoe with a cosmetically-shaped rocker sole incorporated. The&#xD;
      rocker sole will comprise of three circular curves whose arc centres are positioned at the&#xD;
      anatomical ankle, hip and knee respectively; assuming a vertical lower limb. This is designed&#xD;
      to influence the line of action of the ground reaction force to pass close to the anatomical&#xD;
      joint centres and so reduce the moments needed to be generated for ambulation by the muscles&#xD;
      acting across those joints in the lower limb. Additionally it is designed to place the ankle&#xD;
      into a relatively plantarflexed position where the ankle plantarflexors use less energy than&#xD;
      for instance when placed in dorsiflexion. This is in order to unload the calf muscles by&#xD;
      providing a simultaneous reduction in ankle range of motion in relative plantarflexion but&#xD;
      still moving with a near-normal trajectory. This also optimises the lever arm between the&#xD;
      Achilles tendon and the ankle joint so making propulsion, and therefore calf muscle power&#xD;
      generation, more efficient. Participants will be provided with a pair of appropriately-sized&#xD;
      shoes, which will be produced for this study by an established shoe manufacturer - Chaneco&#xD;
      (www.chaneco.co.uk). To allow participants to habituate to wearing the shoes before&#xD;
      assessment, they will be allowed to walk around in the shoes at a self-selected pace for at&#xD;
      least 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control shoe During the control condition assessments, participants will wear a pair of&#xD;
      appropriately-sized shoes, which are similar in appearance to the unloading shoes, but do not&#xD;
      contain the altered sole. Again, these will be provided by Chaneco, and a minimum of 5&#xD;
      minutes walking will be allowed for habituation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Primary outcome measure&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Maximum walking distance during forced-pace walking: Following a rest period of at least 20&#xD;
      minutes, participants will complete a 6-minute walk test in which they will be instructed to&#xD;
      walk as far as possible within 6 minutes. This test simulates community walking better than&#xD;
      treadmill testing, has been recommended as a primary outcome in claudication trials, and has&#xD;
      good inter-day reproducibility (coefficient of variation 10.4%). A straight 30-m course will&#xD;
      be used and the distance walked recorded. A testing checklist and standardised instructions&#xD;
      will be used. The outcome assessor will have no role in the sizing and fitting of the shoes,&#xD;
      in an attempt to keep them blinded, and the verbal test instructions will be audio-recorded&#xD;
      so that we can check the consistency of which the instructions have been delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain-free walking distance during usual-pace walking: Following a rest period of at&#xD;
           least 20 minutes, participants will be invited to walk at their usual walking speed&#xD;
           along a straight 30-m course. Their walking speed will be recorded using electronic&#xD;
           timing gates (SMARTSPEED, Fusion Sport). Participants will be instructed to indicate the&#xD;
           point where they first experience claudication pain. The distance walked up until this&#xD;
           point will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gait biomechanical parameters: Reflective markers will be positioned on anatomical&#xD;
           landmarks of the lower extremities using double-sided sticky tape to allow 3D motion&#xD;
           analysis. Wireless surface electromyography units (Trigno EMG, Delsys, Italy) will also&#xD;
           be attached to the skin overlying the medial and lateral Gastrocnemius and Tibialis&#xD;
           Anterior using double-sided sticky tape to allow the assessment of lower-leg muscle&#xD;
           recruitment patterns during the gait cycle. Participants will walk at their usual pace&#xD;
           along a figure-of-8 circuit. A force plate (9281EA, Kistler) positioned in the central&#xD;
           straight portion of the figure-of-8 will capture kinetic data. The participants will be&#xD;
           naïve to the force plate, to help ensure a natural walking gait. Infra-red 3D optical&#xD;
           motion analysis cameras (Oqus, Qualisys) will capture kinematic data each time a&#xD;
           participant approaches and passes over the force plate. Participants will indicate when&#xD;
           they experience the onset of claudication pain and continue until pain prevents them&#xD;
           walking further. Outcomes include step length, stride length, cadence, velocity and&#xD;
           joint angles, and joint moments and powers of the lower extremities during the three&#xD;
           stages of pain development during walking; pain-free walking, after the onset of pain&#xD;
           and immediately before stopping walking due to pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant timeline Participants will be required to attend the biomechanics laboratory at&#xD;
      York St John University on 3 occasions: a first &quot;screening&quot; visit for obtaining written&#xD;
      informed consent, confirming eligibility and recording baseline characteristics of the&#xD;
      participant, and two subsequent visits on which the study assessments will be conducted. The&#xD;
      study assessment sessions (i.e. visits 2 and 3) will be identical in composition apart from&#xD;
      that the participants will wear different shoes (unloading or control) during the walking&#xD;
      tests. The first assessment visit must be completed within 4 weeks of the screening visit,&#xD;
      and there will be a maximum of 2 weeks and a minimum of 1 day between assessment visits 1 and&#xD;
      2. After completing the crossover study, half of the participants (n=20) will be given the&#xD;
      unloading shoes and the other half (n=20) the control shoes to wear for 2 weeks. After this&#xD;
      2-week period, all participants will complete and return a survey about the shoes and be&#xD;
      questioned via telephone about any adverse device effects. A sub-sample (minimum n=12;&#xD;
      control n=6, unloading n=6) will undertake a telephone-based semi-structured interview with a&#xD;
      qualitative researcher. This interview will be conducted within 2 weeks of the end of the 2&#xD;
      week shoe-wearing period. Therefore, the maximum duration that a participant will be involved&#xD;
      in the study from the point of consenting is 10 weeks, and the minimum is 17 days; however,&#xD;
      most participants will most likely be undertaking the study visits across a period of 4-8&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
