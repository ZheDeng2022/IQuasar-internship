  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive dysfunction is a highly persistent, pervasive and progressive abnormality in young&#xD;
      adults (i.e., 18-65 years) with MDD. It has also been shown that among adults with MDD who&#xD;
      are gainfully employed, measures of cognition are a greater determinant of overall workplace&#xD;
      performance than is total depression symptom severity. Several lines of evidence indicate&#xD;
      that cognitive deficits that persist between episodes of depression are critical determinants&#xD;
      of functional recovery in the workplace. The functional implications associated with&#xD;
      cognitive impairment provide the impetus for systematic evaluation, measurement and&#xD;
      assessment of the domains of cognition expected to be impaired in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no measurement tool has been sufficiently validated and/or determined to be&#xD;
      sensitive to the cognitive deficits in younger adults with MDD. Major limitations of&#xD;
      available comprehensive psychometric tools include relative lack of availability, cost, lack&#xD;
      of access to most healthcare providers, and above all else, the lengthy time to administer.&#xD;
      Moreover, the need for a psychometrist to interpret the results adds to the complexity and&#xD;
      the costliness of such an endeavor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is imperative that any tool recommended for clinical utility be aligned with the busy&#xD;
      nature of a high-volume clinical practice. The ideal gold standard tool for assessing the&#xD;
      presence of cognitive dysfunction in MDD in the clinical environment should include, but not&#xD;
      be limited to, features such as good conceptual coverage of cognitive domains affected in&#xD;
      MDD, good sensitivity and reliability, and it should be relatively uninfluenced by culture&#xD;
      effects and practice effects. The tool would also need to be brief, easy to administer and&#xD;
      interpret, and complement busy clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to validate a brief user-friendly tool capable of detecting deficit in&#xD;
      cognitive performance among adults with MDD. Data will be gathered with the aim to determine&#xD;
      whether the proposed tool identifies cognitive deficits in adults with MDD and differentiates&#xD;
      the clinical MDD population from healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the THINC-it tool will be free of charge and downloadable from the&#xD;
      THINC-it website for use in the primary care and specialty setting. The THINC-it tool will be&#xD;
      accessible via computers/tablets, will take 20 minutes to self-administer in a clinical&#xD;
      setting, and the performance results will be immediately available.&#xD;
