  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness and safety of the NovoTTF-200A device&#xD;
      in patients with low-grade glioma when it's used by itself or used together with&#xD;
      temozolomide. Researchers would also like to know whether the use of NovoTTF-200A, with or&#xD;
      without temozolomide, is associated with fewer negative side effects on mental function that&#xD;
      may be seen with other currently used treatment options.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 2,000 to 3,000 low-grade gliomas (LGGs) are diagnosed in adults each year in&#xD;
      the United States. Based on a variety of prognostic factors the median overall survival&#xD;
      ranges from 3 to 9 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NovoTTF-200A is a device that produces alternating electrical fields within the human body&#xD;
      that disrupt cell division. These very low intensity intermediate frequency electric fields&#xD;
      (TTFields) impair the growth of tumor cells through the arrest of cell division and inducing&#xD;
      apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although FDA approved for the treatment of recurrent or progressive glioblastoma, further&#xD;
      investigation of NovoTTF-200A is warranted, in the setting of low-grade glioma where it has&#xD;
      the potential to stunt tumor growth without significant toxicity. NovoTTF-200A has also been&#xD;
      shown to be safe combined with adjuvant 5-day temozolomide regimen in newly diagnosed&#xD;
      glioblastoma in an ongoing clinical trial. Given the low proliferative index in low-grade&#xD;
      gliomas, combining NovoTTF-200A with metronomic chemotherapy may be more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, 2-arm, open label study of NovoTTF-200A alone or combined with daily&#xD;
      temozolomide for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed low-grade gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized 1:1 to one of two arms for a total of 22 patients (11 per arm).&#xD;
      Arm A will receive NovoTTF-200A only and Arm B will receive NovoTTF-200A and low-dose (50&#xD;
      mg/m2) daily temozolomide regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients providing informed consent will be screened for eligibility. Baseline&#xD;
      assessments will include vital signs, physical exam, blood hematology and chemistries,&#xD;
      Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) evaluation, Quality of Life (QOL) assessment using the&#xD;
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br), a neurological exam and&#xD;
      neuro-imaging (MRI) of brain. An extra blood sample will be collected for biomarker studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluations include physical exam, vitals, KPS, neurological exam and blood&#xD;
      hematology and chemistries (obtained once every month throughout treatment). Neuro-imaging&#xD;
      and assessment for response will be performed approximately every 3 months. QOL will be&#xD;
      assessed with the KPS rating scale and the FACT-Br questionnaire at screening and then every&#xD;
      six months during treatment. Blood will be collected for correlative studies on Day 1 of&#xD;
      every even cycle. Any molecular information derived from the correlative studies or clinical&#xD;
      care will be associated with the patient's response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will continue monthly cycles of treatment for 12 cycles or until disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity (whichever occurs first). For those in Arm B, patients may continue&#xD;
      NovoTTF-200A treatment if temozolomide is discontinued early for toxicity. An end of&#xD;
      treatment visit for clinical evaluations and safety assessments will be performed&#xD;
      approximately four to six weeks of withdrawing from study treatment. Patients discontinuing&#xD;
      study treatment will be followed at months 18 and 24 with tumor assessments if they&#xD;
      discontinued from study treatment without disease progression and for survival.&#xD;
