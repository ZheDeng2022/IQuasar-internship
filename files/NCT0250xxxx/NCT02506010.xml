      The purpose of this study is to conduct an oxygen saturation (SpO2) accuracy validation&#xD;
      comparing prototype pulse oximeter oxygen saturation measurements directly to arterial blood&#xD;
      saturation during non-motion conditions over the range of 60-100% SaO2 as measured by&#xD;
      Reference CO-Oximetry. Additionally, the prototype pulse oximeter pulse rate measurements&#xD;
      will be compared to 3-lead ECG heart rate measurements made via a multi-parameter monitor.&#xD;
