  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the effect of renal function on the PK of a 0.25&#xD;
      mg single oral dose of bevenopran in humans and to assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      bevenopran in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment and in healthy subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft guidance for renal impairment studies&#xD;
      advises performance of a PK study in patients with renal impairment for medications primarily&#xD;
      excreted in urine and also for medications primarily metabolized or secreted in bile. The&#xD;
      major routes of excretion of bevenopran in animals were identified as hepatobiliary and&#xD;
      renal. In addition, preliminary findings show &gt;40% of an oral bevenopran dose is eliminated&#xD;
      unchanged in urine over a 48-72 hour period post-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 1, non-randomized, parallel group, open-label study to characterize the&#xD;
      effect of renal function on the PK of bevenopran in 1 or more study centers. At screening,&#xD;
      eligible subjects will be enrolled and assigned to 1 of 5 parallel study groups of&#xD;
      approximately 8 to 12 subjects each based on the classification of the renal function using&#xD;
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease&#xD;
      (MDRD) Study, as presented in the FDA guidance on renal impairment studies. There are 5 study&#xD;
      groups based on eGFRs.&#xD;
