      The most recent classification, adopted by International Society for the Study of Vascular&#xD;
      Anomalies (ISSVA) in 1996, and updated in Melbourne in 2014, divides these lesions into two&#xD;
      broad categories: vascular tumors and vascular malformations. Vascular malformations (VMs)&#xD;
      are subdivided into high-flow VM and slow-flow VM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Slow-flow VMs consist of congenital anomalies which may involve abnormal capillaries vessels,&#xD;
      venous vessels, lymphatic vessels or combination of several of them. They can be superficial&#xD;
      (involving cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues) and/or may have visceral involvement. They can&#xD;
      be limited or diffuse, and are sometimes components of genetic hypertrophic syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of slow-flow VMs is performed on physical examination (biopsy may be required&#xD;
      for confirmation), and is completed with imaging (ultrasonography and magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI)). Slow-flow VMs may be particularly voluminous; associated with underlying&#xD;
      hypertrophy responsible for functional impairment; painful; associated with seepage or&#xD;
      continuous cutaneous bleeding; complicated with visceral signs or hematologic disturbances&#xD;
      (anemia, thrombopenia). Management requires dedicated multispecialty care. There are no&#xD;
      guidelines for treatment, and management may include no intervention - but natural history of&#xD;
      these VMs is progressive worsening -, compression by physical bandage, sclerotherapy,&#xD;
      resection (when feasible),anti-inflammatory or anti-coagulation drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case reports and series have provided evidence for supporting the need for a clinical trial&#xD;
      of sirolimus by reporting successful treatment on several children with complicated vascular&#xD;
      anomalies. The choice of sirolimus is rational. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a&#xD;
      serine/threonine kinase regulated by phosphoinositide-3-kinase involved in cell mobility,&#xD;
      cell growth and angiogenesis. Sirolimus inhibits mTOR, which induces inhibition of&#xD;
      angiogenesis, in particular lymphangiogenesis, which has been demonstrated in several models.&#xD;

      Vascular anomalies include a heterogeneous group of disorders of newborns and children. While&#xD;
      infantile hemangioma are common (10% of infants), generally not complicated and easily&#xD;
      managed, the majority of other vascular anomalies are rare (&lt;2% altogether) and have no&#xD;
      guidelines for management. The most recent classification, adopted by International Society&#xD;
      for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) in 1996, divides these lesions into two broad&#xD;
      categories: vascular tumors and vascular malformations. Vascular malformations (VMs) are&#xD;
      subdivided into high-flow VM and slow-flow VM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Slow-flow VMs consist of congenital anomalies which may involve abnormal capillaries vessels,&#xD;
      venous vessels, lymphatic vessels or combination of several of them. They can be superficial&#xD;
      (involving cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues) and/or may have visceral involvement. They can&#xD;
      be limited or diffuse, and are sometimes components of genetic hypertrophic syndromes. They&#xD;
      always result from defective embryologic vasculogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of slow-flow VMs is performed on physical examination - a biopsy may be&#xD;
      required for confirmation -, and is completed with imaging, which includes ultrasonography&#xD;
      and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Slow-flow VMs may be simple to manage or can be&#xD;
      complicated for several reasons: they may be particularly voluminous; associated with&#xD;
      underlying hypertrophy responsible for functional impairment; painful; associated with&#xD;
      seepage or continuous cutaneous bleeding; complicated with visceral signs or hematologic&#xD;
      disturbances (anemia, thrombopenia). Management requires dedicated multispecialty care. There&#xD;
      are no guidelines for treatment, and management may include no intervention - but natural&#xD;
      history of these VMs is progressive worsening -, compression by physical bandage,&#xD;
      sclerotherapy, resection (when feasible), anti-inflammatory or anti-coagulation drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vast majority of literature reporting medical therapies consists of paediatric case&#xD;
      reports, and is complicated by publication bias, inconsistent use of nomenclature and absence&#xD;
      of clinical trials. Case reports and series have provided evidence for supporting the need&#xD;
      for a clinical trial of sirolimus by reporting successful treatment on several children with&#xD;
      complicated vascular anomalies. The choice of sirolimus is rational. Mammalian target of&#xD;
      rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase regulated by phosphoinositide-3-kinase involved&#xD;
      in cell mobility, cell growth and angiogenesis. Sirolimus inhibits mTOR, which induces&#xD;
      inhibition of angiogenesis, in particular lymphangiogenesis, which has been demonstrated in&#xD;
      several models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized observational-phase design (Feldman et al. J Clin Epidemiol 2001;54:550-557):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  each patient will be followed during a 12-month-period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  each patient will start by an observational period and will end being treated by&#xD;
           sirolimus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at a random date (between month 4 and month 8), each patient will switch from the&#xD;
           observational period to the sirolimus period Therefore, each patient will be his/her own&#xD;
           control, as in a cross-over trial (but the difference is that the cross-over is all in&#xD;
           one direction, from observational period to treatment period). This explains why&#xD;
           variation in volume will be standardized by period durations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As specified by Feldman et al, the randomized placebo-phase design is well adapted in&#xD;
      situations where &quot;a placebo controlled study would be perceived as being unacceptable by&#xD;
      enrolling physicians and by patient&quot; and &quot;may be especially useful when highly potent&#xD;
      therapies for rare diseases&quot;&#xD;

    <description>Primary outcome will be based on the volume of the VMs on MRI. Three MRI will be performed: one at baseline (M0), one at the date of switch from the observational period to the sirolimus period (MS) and one at the end of follow-up (M12). Relative change of volume, standardized by the duration period, will define the outcome. Thus, for the observational period, the primary outcome is defined as {(VMS - V0)/V0}/(MS-M0) where V0 and VMS are the volumes assessed at baseline and month S, respectively, and (MS-M0) corresponds to the duration of the observational period. For the sirolimus period, the outcome is defined in the same way as {(V12 - VMS)/VMS}/(M12-MS), where V12 is the volume assessed at month 12 and (M12-MS) corresponds to the duration of the sirolimus period.&#xD;
Interpretation of the MRI will be centralized and performed by a radiologist blinded from physical assessment and from treatment period.</description>
