      This study will augment an existing mobile application for individuals with eating disorders&#xD;
      by developing adaptive, tailored content targeting remediation of cognitive distortions. The&#xD;
      adaptive application will be deployed and assessed for efficacy relative to the standard&#xD;
      product in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eating Disorders (ED) are common and serious psychological disorders. Anorexia Nervosa (AN)&#xD;
      has a prevalence estimated at between 0.48% and 0.70% among young females. Bulimia Nervosa&#xD;
      (BN) is a serious mental health problem, with a prevalence of between 1-2% of young women&#xD;
      while clinically significant bulimic behaviors occur in an additional 2-3%. There are&#xD;
      significant barriers to access of evidence-based treatments and current models of individual&#xD;
      psychotherapy will likely never meet the enormous need for psychological services for ED.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, even with treatment, rates of recovery are modest with the best performing&#xD;
      treatments achieving remission in only about 50% of cases while relapse rates are high,&#xD;
      especially if the ED becomes chronic. It is widely acknowledged that a major shift in&#xD;
      intervention practice is needed and that smartphone apps will almost certainly play a role&#xD;
      due to their reach and breadth of functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the first commercially available smartphone app for EDs, Recovery Record (RR) has&#xD;
      established wide reach and user acceptability. The app provides users with meal and ED&#xD;
      symptom self-monitoring and coping skill strategies in an evidence-based CBT format.&#xD;
      Preliminary pilot data suggest that for a proportion of RR users, using RR is associated with&#xD;
      clinically significant symptom reduction. However, a limitation of the current app is that it&#xD;
      is a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; product that does not account for the heterogeneity of ED symptoms.&#xD;
      Genetic, personality and neurocognitive data support distinct clusters of ED presentations&#xD;
      that also differ according to response to treatment, course and outcome. Pilot data confirm&#xD;
      that clinical response to RR is not homogenous across groups and that extent of cognitive&#xD;
      distortions is the most potent factor to predict outcome. There is considerable opportunity&#xD;
      to increase RR's effectiveness across a range of ED symptoms and behaviors by creating&#xD;
      adaptive and tailored content focused on remediation of cognitive distortions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase 1 of this study screening algorithm will be validated against an unseen,&#xD;
      prospective test dataset of approximately 2,000 users. All candidate predictor variables will&#xD;
      be entered into a Signal Detection Analysis to confirm the sensitivity and specificity of the&#xD;
      screen. Informed by the resultant algorithms, adaptive content will be developed that targets&#xD;
      ED-specific cognitive distortions. To evaluate acceptability, adapted content will be piloted&#xD;
      with approximately 200 individuals for a period of one month. Participant feedback and&#xD;
      utilization data will inform content acceptability and feasibility. By the end of the first&#xD;
      phase tailored content that is acceptable to individuals with specific symptom presentations&#xD;
      will be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will focus on an evaluation of whether an adaptive app offering tailored content&#xD;
      addressing eating related cognitive distortions in a stepped way can outperform the current&#xD;
      standard app. The adaptive content will be integrated into a new, dynamic version of the app&#xD;
      (RR-A) that will then be evaluated against the current app (RR-S). Approximately 5,000&#xD;
      registered users of RR will be randomized to receive either RR augmented with targeted&#xD;
      content (RR-A), or RR in its current standard format (RR-S) over a two-month period. Outcome&#xD;
      data will be measured at baseline, one month, end of treatment, and at six-month follow-up.&#xD;
      At the end of the study period it is predicted that the resultant evidence-based product will&#xD;
      have demonstrated ability to bring about clinically significant reduction in symptoms in more&#xD;
      users than the current app, and thus will have potential to make a substantial public health&#xD;
      impact.&#xD;
