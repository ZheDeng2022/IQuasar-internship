    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this project is to examine the association between having a long-term&#xD;
      condition (morbidity) and screening uptake for colorectal cancer. Whilst this project will&#xD;
      consider all morbidity and co-morbidities, there will be a particular focus on common mental&#xD;
      health disorders, such as depression and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim of this project is to examine other factors that may influence uptake rate.&#xD;
      Information on a wide array of potential factors is available for this project. These include&#xD;
      demographics (age, gender, ethnicity), socio-economic status (deprivation, education status)&#xD;
      and lifestyle (smoking status, drinking patterns, degree of exercise). In addition, any&#xD;
      potential moderating effect of these factors on the association between morbidity and&#xD;
      screening uptake shall be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the following shall be explored:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uptake rates by type of mental health disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uptake rates by chronic physical health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Associations between uptake, morbidity (both physical and mental) and broader health&#xD;
           determinants such as demographics, socio-economic status and lifestyle.&#xD;

      Linkage of datasets and ethical issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The South Yorkshire Cohort (SYC) data (including patient identifiers) are held by the&#xD;
      Clinical Trials Research Unit (CTRU) at the University of Sheffield, whilst Bowel Cancer&#xD;
      Screening Programme (BCSP) data are held by the NHS Cancer Screening Programmes (part of&#xD;
      Public Health England).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linkage will be based on the subset of respondents to the SYC who have given their consent&#xD;
      for the SYC researchers to look at their NHS health records, and are eligible to be invited&#xD;
      for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. The proposed method for linkage will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For those respondents who have given this consent, the CTRU shall send their NHS number&#xD;
           and their SYC study ID to the BCSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using the NHS number, the BCSP shall extract data on if the individual was invited for&#xD;
           screening, and if so whether or not the individual accepted screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The BCSP shall then send the screening data along with the SYC study ID to the CTRU. NHS&#xD;
           number shall not be included in the data that is sent from the BCSP (in other words it&#xD;
           will be pseudo-anonymised).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The CTRU shall use the pseudo-ID to link the screening programme data to the SYC data. A&#xD;
           pseudo-anonymised dataset shall then be released to the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way, the only patient-identifiable data that the BCSP would receive is data that they&#xD;
      already hold (NHS number), whilst the CTRU would not receive any additional&#xD;
      patient-identifiable data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should also be stressed that the research team undertaking this project would not have&#xD;
      access to patient-identifiable data at any stage of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data shall be used within this project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Exposure variables. The exposure variables are the presence of long-standing conditions.&#xD;
      These are collected within the SYC as self-reported long-standing conditions. Twelve named&#xD;
      conditions are recorded, along with an &quot;other&quot; condition, which includes free-text to allow&#xD;
      the respondent to state the condition. These conditions (and their prevalence amongst a&#xD;
      preliminary sample of people aged 60 to 74 in the SYC) are: Depression (8%), Anxiety (10%),&#xD;
      Fatigue (19%), Pain (28%), Insomnia (8%), Diabetes (10%), Breathing problems (13%), High&#xD;
      blood pressure (31%), Heart disease (10%), Osteoarthritis (16%), Stroke (3%), Cancer (5%) and&#xD;
      Other (29%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the long-standing conditions shall be considered, with the exception of cancer (as&#xD;
      this will include CRC, and patients with this are not eligible for screening) and free-text&#xD;
      descriptions (these shall be analysed as &quot;other&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcome variable. The outcome variable will be if the individual attended CRC screening.&#xD;
           This will be linked to SYC data using data supplied by the National Bowel Cancer&#xD;
           Screening Programme. It should be noted that CRC screening relates to the first time an&#xD;
           individual is screened (prevalent screening). The main analysis will look at if an&#xD;
           individual has had a CRC screen (irrespective of number of invitations to screening that&#xD;
           were sent). Depending on the available evidence, a secondary analysis would consider the&#xD;
           outcome variable of 'individual accepted CRC screening after refusing the initial&#xD;
           invitation for CRC screening.'&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confounding variables. The following potentially-confounding variables shall be&#xD;
           assessed: Age, gender, ethnicity, highest level of education, levels of physical&#xD;
           exercise, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and IMD deprivation score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional descriptive variables. The following variables will not be used within the&#xD;
           statistical models, but shall be included when performing a descriptive comparison of&#xD;
           individuals who do attend screening with those who do not attend screening:&#xD;
           self-reported EQ-5D summary score, self-reported healthcare use in the last 3 months&#xD;
           (this includes 22 named categories, it is anticipated that due to small numbers some of&#xD;
           these will need to be grouped. Possible groupings to consider are: Accident and&#xD;
           emergency (A&amp;E), Hospital use (excluding A&amp;E), Health-carer: GP, Health-carer: Nurse,&#xD;
           Other health-carers, Other carers, Alternative therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis shall include the following sections:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Initial exploratory analysis. This initial analysis shall provide an overview of the&#xD;
      available data, and will highlight any issues that may need to be addressed within the&#xD;
      statistical modelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive analysis shall compare the characteristics of people who attend CRC screening&#xD;
      with those who do not attend. This comparison will include the exposure variables,&#xD;
      confounding variables and additional descriptive variables (as detailed in the previous&#xD;
      section). Comparisons will be tested for statistical significance, with the caveat that as no&#xD;
      specific differences were hypothesised a priori, resulting p-values should be interpreted&#xD;
      with caution. T-tests will be used to compare continuous variables, Fisher's exact test will&#xD;
      be used to compare binary variables, and the Kruskal-Wallis test will be used to compare&#xD;
      ordinal variables. Any p-values less than 5% will be taken to indicate a statistically&#xD;
      significant association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the descriptive analysis, the functional form of the association between any&#xD;
      continuous variables and the outcome shall be visually assessed using smoothing methods. If a&#xD;
      non-linear functional form is indicated then the use of non-linear functions (fractional&#xD;
      polynomials, natural splines) shall be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Handling missing data. The amount of missing data shall determine the strategy employed&#xD;
           (Harrell, 2001). If the total proportion of people with any missing data is less than 5%&#xD;
           then single imputation of missing values shall be carried out. Otherwise, multiple&#xD;
           imputation of missing values shall be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical modelling. Screening uptake rates for CRC shall be analysed using logistic&#xD;
           regression, with patient demographics, socioeconomic status, lifestyle factors and&#xD;
           morbidities as the potentially explanatory variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary interest is which morbidities affect uptake rate, with particular interest in&#xD;
      mental morbidities (of which depression and anxiety are measured in the SYC). Because of&#xD;
      this, only interactions with these two mental morbidities shall be considered. To examine the&#xD;
      association between the mental morbidities and uptake, and to see how the other variables&#xD;
      influence this association, a series of models shall be presented:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Model 1 (univariate-model): this shall include only the long-standing conditions&#xD;
           (exposure variables) as the independent variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Model 2 (demographics-adjusted model): this shall include the independent variables from&#xD;
           Model 1, along with the demographic variables (age, gender and ethnicity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Model 3 (full model): this shall include all the variables considered in this study.&#xD;
           Interactions shall not be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Model 4 (exploratory model): this shall apply subset-selection to Model 3&#xD;
           (backwards-stepwise, with a probability-to-remove of 0.05). Interactions shall be&#xD;
           considered after applying subset-selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of displaying a series of models will be to show the un-adjusted association&#xD;
      between morbidities and screening uptake, and the highlight the degree to which these&#xD;
      associations are mediated by patient characteristics. A distinction is made between&#xD;
      'intrinsic' characteristics (age, gender and ethnicity), which are (generally) beyond a&#xD;
      person's control to change, and the remaining characteristics, over-which a person has more&#xD;
      control&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analyses were conducted using G*Power 3.1.9. The required sample size to detect a&#xD;
      significant effect of a pre-specified variable was calculated. For this analyses an alpha&#xD;
      level of 5% and a two-tailed test were used. There were a number of additional factors that&#xD;
      needed to be estimated or chosen:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Required power: values of 95% and 80% were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Odds ratio: values between 1.2 and 3 were tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Probability of uptake amongst those without any morbidity: the overall uptake of 47%&#xD;
           observed between 2008 and 2011 of the BCSP was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Degree of correlation amongst the potentially explanatory variables: values of 20% and&#xD;
           40% were tested (this is denoted by 'R2' in the table below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevalence of the pre-specified variable: a value of 8% was used, corresponding to the&#xD;
           prevalence of depression in a preliminary analysis of the SYC data. In this analysis,&#xD;
           74% of the sample had a morbidity, with an average of 1.8 long-term conditions per&#xD;
           person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1: Sample size required as a function of power, correlation, and odds ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power = 80% Power = 95% Odds Ratio R2 = 0.2 R2 = 0.4 R2 = 0.2 R2 = 0.4 1.2 16,066 21,422&#xD;
      26,605 35,473 1.3 7,780 10,373 12,876 17,168 1.4 4,751 6,335 7,857 10,476 1.5 3,292 4,389&#xD;
      5,437 7,249 1.6 2,466 3,289 4,069 5,425 1.8 1,603 2,137 2,637 3,516 2.0 1,174 1,566 1,925&#xD;
      2,567 2.2 926 1,234 1,513 2,017 2.4 767 1,022 1,248 1,665 2.6 658 877 1,067 1,422 2.8 579 772&#xD;
      935 1,247 3.0 519 693 837 1,116&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size available is expected to be approximately 7,500 indicating that any odds&#xD;
      ratios of 1.4 or greater will be detected with 80% power, whilst any odds ratios of 1.5 or&#xD;
      greater will be detected with 95% power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An example of a change in uptake rates relating to an odds ratio of 1.5 would be a decrease&#xD;
      in uptake from 60% to 57%. Further examples are presented in Table 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 2: Decreases in uptake rate corresponding to an odds ratio of 1.5 Uptake rate in group&#xD;
      1: 90% 80% 70% 60% Uptake rate in group 2: 81% 72% 64% 57%&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative method for estimating samples sizes was also tested (Campbell, Julious, and&#xD;
      Altman 1996). This uses published tables which estimate the sample size (per group) required&#xD;
      to identify a pre-specified difference in two proportions at at a 5% significance level with&#xD;
      80% power. The group sizes are then adjusted to take into account any differences in group&#xD;
      size. For example, if the group with depression represents 8% of the total population, then&#xD;
      to detect a difference in uptake of 65% amongst people without depression and 60% amongst&#xD;
      people with depression, an overall sample size of 425 is required, of which 34 would need to&#xD;
      have depression and 391 would not have depression. The overall sample size required for a&#xD;
      range of differences in uptake rates are presented in Table 3 (the uptake rates are all&#xD;
      multiples of 5% as these values are used in the published tables).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 3: Sample sizes required to detect pre-specified differences in uptake. Uptake in group&#xD;
      A Uptake in group B Total sample size 60% 55% 1 188 65% 60% 425 70% 65% 213 75% 70% 138&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Assuming that the comparison is between people with depression (prevalence 8%,&#xD;
      corresponding to group B) and without depression.&#xD;
