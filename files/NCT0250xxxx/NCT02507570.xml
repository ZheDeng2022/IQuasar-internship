      This is an open label study designed to examine the effects of Enzalutamide with concurrent&#xD;
      administration of Radium Ra 223 dichloride in castrate resistant (hormone-refractory)&#xD;
      prostate cancer subjects with symptomatic bone metastasis, in both the pre- and post-&#xD;
      chemotherapy setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radium Ra 223 dichloride is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this&#xD;
      indication. Enzalutamide is US Food and Drug Administration approved for this indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled to obtain 30 evaluable subjects. All subjects will&#xD;
      receive Radium Ra 223 dichloride every 4 weeks for a total of 6 doses over 24 weeks and&#xD;
      concurrent Enzalutamide for a minimum duration of 24 weeks. The sponsor will provide&#xD;
      Enzalutamide after the End of Treatment visit until the last Long Term Follow Up visit has&#xD;
      been completed. Subjects will continue to receive Enzalutamide as long as a positive response&#xD;
      to therapy is demonstrated. Enzalutamide may be discontinued at any time per physician&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated 30 days after the last dose of Radium Ra 223 dichloride. Including&#xD;
      screening, the total duration of the study is 32 weeks plus every 3 month follow up visits&#xD;
      while subjects are receiving Enzalutamide.&#xD;
