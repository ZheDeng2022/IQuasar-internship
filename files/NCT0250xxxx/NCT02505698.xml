    <textblock>
      Three-dimensional functional Metabolic Imaging (3D MIRA) is a new infrared imaging technology&#xD;
      using the Real Imager 8 (RI8) developed by Real Imaging. This technology generates 3D&#xD;
      metabolic maps of the breast and based on sophisticated machine learning technology, provides&#xD;
      objective risk assessment for the presence of malignant tumor in the breast. The procedure is&#xD;
      non-invasive, comfortable and does not involve ionizing radiation. It is based on acquiring&#xD;
      infrared images of the breast. Those images are processed and analyzed by computers to&#xD;
      provide the objective risk assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technology is intended to be used as a screening tool for breast cancer and emerges as&#xD;
      highly useful in women for whom screening mammography is sub-optimal, such as women with&#xD;
      dense breast. 3D MIRA is unaffected by breast density and is therefore ideal for evaluating&#xD;
      patients with mammographically dense breasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real Imaging is continuously developing the technology including image acquisition hardware&#xD;
      and objective analysis of the imaging biomarkers. To further improve and optimize this novel&#xD;
      metabolic imaging technology, Real Imaging will introduce an improved imaging device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical study is to collect more imaging data in order to establish&#xD;
      superiority of the newer device over the previous one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize is that the new device will be at least as good as the previous&#xD;
      one.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer death among women, with an estimated 1&#xD;
      million new cases and over 400,000 deaths annually worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, however, improvements in survival rate have been attributed to earlier&#xD;
      diagnosis by national screening programs and better treatments. Although mammography has been&#xD;
      the main screening modality of early detection, its limitations such as difficulty in&#xD;
      interpreting mammograms for woman with dense breast, are well recognized and the search for&#xD;
      more effective technologies for early detection has been receiving increased attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies showed that US (Ultra Sound) can detect more breast cancers not seen on&#xD;
      Mammography, particularly in dense breasts. However, breast US sensitivity is not very high&#xD;
      and it is highly operator-dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As opposed to US, Breast MRI is highly sensitive, however, it is not used as a screening tool&#xD;
      for the general population. The high cost of MRI, its relatively low speciÔ¨Åcity (true&#xD;
      negative rate), its being time consuming and its need for intravenous contrast agent make it&#xD;
      unsuitable as a breast screening tool for the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of these shortcomings, the use of the existing screening modalities described that&#xD;
      are based on anatomical imaging will result in some misdiagnosis of cancer, particularly in&#xD;
      women with dense breast tissue.There is a real need for a novel breast imaging technology&#xD;
      that may outperform the current modalities available for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of infrared imaging for breast cancer screening is an appealing concept, as it is&#xD;
      non-invasive, involves no ionization radiation, requires no breast compression and is not&#xD;
      affected by breast density. Infrared imaging in the form of thermography, has been utilized&#xD;
      in the past for breasts cancer screening with limited success. Detection of thermal asymmetry&#xD;
      between breasts, that can point to cancerous tissue, is laborious and inaccurate when&#xD;
      examining temperature coded images. Moreover, small focal thermal variations between the&#xD;
      breasts causes frequent misdiagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real Imaging developed a new infrared imaging technology called 3D MIRA ,(Three-dimensional&#xD;
      functional Metabolic Imaging and Risk Assessment) using medical device, Real Imager 8 (RI8).&#xD;
      The MIRA technology generates three-dimensional (3D) infrared (IR) metabolic maps of the&#xD;
      breast and developed to enable efficient, automated computer analysis of those metabolic&#xD;
      maps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic imaging will detect signatures of the cancer's microenvironment (e.g angiogenesis).&#xD;
      A breast with malignant tumor behaves differently from a healthy breast. In this regard, the&#xD;
      breast tumor has specific signatures on the surface of the breast even if the tumor is deeply&#xD;
      embedded inside. Metabolic imaging can overcome the limitations of current mammography&#xD;
      screening for women with dense breasts. The infrared signal contains information on both&#xD;
      anatomical structures and metabolic processes within the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on those infrared signals MIRA technology can provide an objective risk assessment for&#xD;
      the presence of malignant tumor. The risk assessment is an index that represents the&#xD;
      likelihood that a given image dataset includes a malignant finding. The index scale ranges&#xD;
      from -100 (normal) to 100 (abnormal). The risk model is based on training the parameters on a&#xD;
      calibration set of clinically known cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Real Imager 8.0 (RI8) is composed of two optical heads, each of which includes infrared&#xD;
      camera digital camera and video projector. RI8 offers a non-invasive method for Metabolic&#xD;
      Imaging and Risk Assessment (MIRA). The RI8 scan enables the determination of risk for breast&#xD;
      cancer malignancy, based on assessment of several metabolic parameters. The device does not&#xD;
      provide diagnosis or location of cancer. It will offer the physician a support tool to guide&#xD;
      the patient to further imaging workup in order to locate, diagnose and characterize the&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Imaging process is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The imager is positioned at a distance of approximately 70 cm from the subject who is seated&#xD;
      upright throughout the examination. This position will be maintained throughout the imaging&#xD;
      session. An initial period of temperature equilibrium precede the imaging process, during&#xD;
      which the patient sits in the dedicated imaging room with room temperature set at 18-22&#xD;
      degrees Celsius. Following the temperature equilibration phase, continuous infrared imaging&#xD;
      will be acquired for a period of up to 7 minutes. Two minutes after beginning of infrared&#xD;
      recording, a metabolic stress test will be induced by having the patient wear cold gloves&#xD;
      (0-5 degrees Celsius), which will be removed after 1 minute. This is performed for the&#xD;
      purpose of generating vasoconstriction in the breast vessels. The entire imaging session will&#xD;
      last approximately 22 minutes. The procedure is comfortable, non-invasive and does not emit&#xD;
      or involves any ionizing radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real Imaging is continuously developing the technology including image acquisition hardware&#xD;
      and objective analysis of the imaging biomarkers. To further improve and optimize this novel&#xD;
      metabolic imaging technology, Real Imaging will introduce an improved imaging device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvements over the previous approved prototype device include higher resolution and&#xD;
      frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore there is a need to collect more imaging data in order to establish superiority of&#xD;
      the newer device over the previous one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Imaging data will not be used to assess the clinical health status of the volunteers.&#xD;
      Data collected during this study is part of Real Imaging's ongoing research and development&#xD;
      efforts aimed to create a more effective screening modality for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this data collection study, approximately 300 female subjects will be enrolled at The&#xD;
      Breast Imaging Unit of the Tel-Aviv Medical Center. MIRA's risk assessment will not be&#xD;
      provided to the physician nor the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate MIRA's ability to classify healthy women from those who have breast&#xD;
      cancer, the enrollment will include two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening Group - healthy women with no breast findings in previous screening exams&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-Biopsy Group - women with suspicious findings on recent Mammography and/or US and/or&#xD;
           MRI exams with BI-RADS (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System) 4/5/6 who are summoned&#xD;
           for biopsy for further workup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible recruited subjects who have signed an informed consent will undergo MIRA imaging&#xD;
      prior to being imaged by any other conventional imaging method and if relevant, prior to&#xD;
      undergoing a breast biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MIRA's data of every individual patient will be used for development purposes. The subject's&#xD;
      personal, medical, diagnostic examination information and pathology results will be recorded&#xD;
      in CRF (case report form) specially designed for this study. Each subject's clinical&#xD;
      information will be followed up in order to validate MIRA's results.&#xD;
