  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II trial of regorafenib in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring c-Kit&#xD;
      mutations and/or amplifications of c-Kit gene copy number. The primary end point is disease&#xD;
      control rate (DCR), and the secondary end points are safety, response rate (RR), progression&#xD;
      free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).&#xD;

      The incidence of melanoma is rising globally and mortality is increasing faster than most&#xD;
      other cancers. Recent advances in the molecular biology of melanoma have uncovered several&#xD;
      potential therapeutic targets in melanoma. It has been observed that 81% of melanomas arising&#xD;
      from non-chronic sun-damaged skin have an oncogenic BRAF or NRAS mutation, whereas such&#xD;
      mutations are far less frequent in chronic sun-damaged skin melanomas, acral melanomas, or&#xD;
      mucosal melanomas. In contrast, c-Kit mutations are more common in mucosal and acral&#xD;
      melanomas, which can also be accompanied by an increase in c-Kit copy numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asian populations, the most common melanoma subtypes are acral and mucosal melanoma, which&#xD;
      comprise greater than 70% of all melanomas, a rate that is much higher than that seen in&#xD;
      white populations (6% to 7%). KIT mutations or amplification are reported about 20% in acral&#xD;
      or mucosal melanomas (JAMA. 2011;305(22):2327-2334). Therefore, c-Kit mutations are likely&#xD;
      the most common kind of genetic mutations in Asians, and the investigation of c-Kit&#xD;
      inhibitors is a high priority in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, formerly STI571; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland),&#xD;
      is a selective inhibitor, targeting Abl as well as c-Kit and the platelet-derived growth&#xD;
      factor receptor. Imatinib demonstrated significant activity in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma harboring genetic c-Kit aberrations, with an overall response rate of 29% (J Clin&#xD;
      Oncol 2011;29:2904-9) Regorafenib (BAY 73-4506) is a novel, orally active, diphenylurea&#xD;
      multikinase inhibitor of VEGFR1-3, c-KIT, TIE-2, PDGFR-Î², FGFR-1, RET, RAF-1, BRAF and p38&#xD;
      MAP kinase. Regorafenib provide a significant improved PFS and OS in patients with GIST and&#xD;
      colorectal cancer, respectively (Lancet 2013; 381: 295-302, Lancet 2013; 381: 303-12).&#xD;
      Especially, inhibitory activity of regorafenib is most effective in c-kit mutated tumors.&#xD;
      Therefore, regorafenib has a chance to significant activity in melanoma with c-kit mutations.&#xD;
      However, no clinical trials have been published for regorafenib in the patients with melanoma&#xD;
      who harbor c-Kit mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NCCN recommend ipilimumab, high-dose interleukin-2, and vemurafenib or dabrafenib for BRAF&#xD;
      mutated tumor as a preferred regimen, and imatinib for c-kit mutated tumors, dacarbazine,&#xD;
      temozolomide, and paclitaxel as other active regimens. In Korea, ipilimumab is not available&#xD;
      yet and imatinib for c-kit mutated tumors is not used legally. Thus, regorafenib could be&#xD;
      used for c-kit mutated tumor in clinical trial setting.&#xD;
