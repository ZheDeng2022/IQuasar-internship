    <textblock>
      Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is characterized by marked intimal proliferation and&#xD;
      concentric vascular thickening and fibrosis. CAV remains the leading cause of late morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality in heart transplant recipients. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new&#xD;
      generation catheter-based modality that acquires images at a spatial resolution of 10-20 μm&#xD;
      which is 10-fold greater than that of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). OCT is currently the&#xD;
      most sensitive imaging technique for early CAV detection. Recent studies proved that&#xD;
      circulating human leukocyte antigen (HLA) directed donor-specific antibodies correlate with&#xD;
      increased mortality and CAV. Contradiction of scientific results has been reported regarding&#xD;
      increased resting heart rate and development of CAV. Larger prospective studies using more&#xD;
      sensitive CAV detecting methods are required to enhance our understanding. Novel&#xD;
      immunosuppressants, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, may attenuate CAV&#xD;
      progression and may improve long-term allograft survival owing to favorable coronary&#xD;
      remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study: Use OCT imaging for identification of patients with early rapid progression&#xD;
      of CAV (rapid progressors) and to identify the critical risk factors responsible for CAV&#xD;
      progression. The impact of conventional and heart transplant (HTx) specific risk factors,&#xD;
      such as donor-specific antibodies or rapid heart rate will be studied in a prospective,&#xD;
      national-level cohort study. The implication of OCT results will lead to adjustment of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy in one year after heart transplant to prevent further progression&#xD;
      of the disease in CAV rapid progressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with rapid progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy can be identified by&#xD;
           increased titers of donor specific anti-human leukocyte antigen (anti-HLA) and/or&#xD;
           antibodies against major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-related chain A (MICA)&#xD;
           antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Specific high-risk characteristics of anti-HLA antibodies can be identified that are&#xD;
           associated with particularly high rate of CAV progression (vascular complement&#xD;
           activation in biopsies, certain HLA haplotypes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Tachycardia in heart transplant recipients represents a risk factor for development of&#xD;
           cardiac allograft vasculopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Influence of anti-HLA antibodies and increased heart rate is independent of already&#xD;
           established risk factors of CAV.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) represents the leading cause of late morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in heart transplant recipients and accounts for a second of all-cause mortality at&#xD;
      3 years. Development of CAV is a complex process involving intimal thickening,&#xD;
      atherosclerosis, thrombosis and vasculitis by histology, but ultimately, intimal hyperplasia&#xD;
      is the predominant cause of lumen narrowing, leading to ischemia and graft failure. In&#xD;
      distinction from general coronary atherosclerosis, which is marked by focal and eccentric&#xD;
      fibrofatty atheroma, CAV affects diffusely the entire coronary vasculature with marked&#xD;
      intimal proliferation and concentric vascular thickening and fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT), compared with IVUS, is more sensitive for early detection&#xD;
      of CAV. OCT is a new generation catheter-based modality that acquires images at a spatial&#xD;
      resolution of 10-20 μm which is 10-fold greater than that of IVUS. OCT could obviously&#xD;
      identify the layer of media as a lower-echoic line, which could not be identified by IVUS.&#xD;
      When assessing the quality of an intracoronary structure accurately, OCT seems to have more&#xD;
      potential than IVUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endothelial cells of the cardiac vasculature express human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and&#xD;
      others, such as vimentin and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-related chain A&#xD;
      (MICA), and appear to be primary targets of cell-mediated and humoral immune responses after&#xD;
      heart transplant (HTx). Circulating antibodies mediate rejection through complement&#xD;
      activation and fixation on graft endothelium, thereby predisposing the patient to graft loss,&#xD;
      accelerated cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and death. The rate of allosensitized patients&#xD;
      (patients with circulating antibodies against donor antigens) on waiting lists is increasing&#xD;
      as a consequence of growing numbers of retransplants and assist-device implantations.&#xD;
      Allosensitization is a consequence of exposure to disparate HLA molecules during pregnancy,&#xD;
      blood/platelet transfusions, or after cardiac repairs with homograft material, but may occur&#xD;
      in some patients even without any of these triggers from unknown reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthotopic heart transplantation is accompanied by sympathetic and parasympathetic&#xD;
      denervation. The subsequent heart rate is usually higher and the circadian variation is low&#xD;
      due to elimination of the vagus nerve effect. It is known that persistent increase in heart&#xD;
      rate contributes to the pathogenesis of vascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS OF THE PROJECT The aim of this study is to use OCT imaging for identification of&#xD;
      patients with early rapid progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (rapid progressors)&#xD;
      and to identify the critical risk factors responsible for CAV progression. The impact of&#xD;
      conventional and HTx-specific risk factors, such as donor-specific antibodies (using the most&#xD;
      sensitive methods for its measurement) or rapid heart rate (using repeated Holter monitoring)&#xD;
      will be studied in a prospective, national-level cohort study. The implication of OCT results&#xD;
      will lead to adjustment of immunosuppressive therapy in one year after heart transplant to&#xD;
      prevent further progression of the disease in CAV rapid progressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WORKING HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with rapid progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy can be identified by&#xD;
           increased titers of donor specific anti-HLA and/or MICA antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Specific high-risk characteristics of anti-HLA antibodies can be identified that are&#xD;
           associated with particularly high rate of CAV progression (vascular complement&#xD;
           activation in biopsies, certain HLA haplotypes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Tachycardia in heart transplant recipients represents a risk factor for development of&#xD;
           cardiac allograft vasculopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Influence of anti-HLA antibodies and increased heart rate is independent of already&#xD;
           established risk factors of CAV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN Collection of data and blood samples will be performed at the same time as the&#xD;
      patient's regularly scheduled surveillance cardiac catheterization (1 month and 12 months&#xD;
      after heart transplant). Additionally donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (class I, II) and&#xD;
      MHC complex class I - related chain A (MICA) antibodies will be measured also before heart&#xD;
      transplant and in 6 months after heart transplant during regular follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT (optical coherency tomography) imaging will be performed at the same time as the&#xD;
      patient's regularly scheduled surveillance cardiac catheterization (1 month and 12 months&#xD;
      after heart transplant). OCT imaging will be performed with the commercially available&#xD;
      second-generation frequency domain Ilumien Optis (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN). The OCT&#xD;
      catheter (Dragonfly Duo) will be advanced over a 0.014-inch coronary guide wire into the&#xD;
      middle segments of all three main arteries (left anterior descending, left circumflex and&#xD;
      right coronary artery) and imaging will be performed by automated pullback with a length 45&#xD;
      mm, with pullback speed 25 mm/sec in high resolution mode (10 frames /mm). OCT examination&#xD;
      will be performed after administration of 200-300 μg of intracoronary nitroglycerin and&#xD;
      simultaneous injection of 14 ml of contrast agent to each artery by power injector through&#xD;
      the guiding catheter. OCT data will be used for 3-D vessel reconstruction done by the fusion&#xD;
      with routine angiography performed in two projections at least 60 degree apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The image data acquired from two-plane angiography, can be utilized to accurately reconstruct&#xD;
      the path and orientation of the OCT catheter in 3-D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two-plane angiograms are taken immediately prior to the pullback start and cover at least&#xD;
      one heart cycle each. They are used to extract the catheter path automatically along the&#xD;
      expected pullback trajectory by a dynamic programming approach. From the known imaging&#xD;
      geometry, an accurate 3-D model of the catheter path within the respective vessel segment is&#xD;
      generated for end-diastolic heart phase. For OCT acquisition, motorized pullback ensures a&#xD;
      constant pullback speed, thus allowing to assign each OCT image frame a specific location on&#xD;
      the 3-D catheter trajectory model. The relative and absolute orientations of the OCT frames&#xD;
      are determined using previously reported system for establishing the absolute orientation in&#xD;
      3-D on IVUS images. Quantitative data can be derived from the contour data, such as luminal&#xD;
      dimensions and plaque-cap thickness, actually considering the vessel curvature in contrast to&#xD;
      conventional OCT reconstruction systems. The space between adjacent contours is interpolated&#xD;
      to form a volume element. In locations of the plaque cap, integrating over an entire vessel&#xD;
      segment or any part thereof yields the total plaque cap volume enclosed by the inner and&#xD;
      outer cap surfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OCT examination will be analyzed according to OCT consensus standard definitions. Intima&#xD;
      can be recognized as a uniform signal-rich bright layer and media as a signal-poor darker&#xD;
      layer due to low backscatter. The lumen, intima, and media layers will be traced&#xD;
      automatically with manual correction to obtain average thickness and areas for every frames.&#xD;
      The only segment without any signs of coronary atherosclerosis on coronary angiography will&#xD;
      be used for OCT examination. Following indices will be analyzed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Normalized intimal volume: the sum of intimal cross sectional area (difference between&#xD;
           media area and lumen area) in every frames / pullback length.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Normalized lumen volume: the sum of lumen cross sectional area in every frames /&#xD;
           pullback length.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mean intima thickness: the values from all sufficient quality frames will be averaged to&#xD;
           yield average intima thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Mean intima-to-media ratio (I/M): Values from all sufficient quality frames will be&#xD;
           averaged to yield average intima thickness, and media thickness. The intima-to-media&#xD;
           ratio (I/M) will be calculated as a ratio of average area of each layer over the whole&#xD;
           pullback. An I/M ratio of more than 1 will be defined as abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These indices will be compared between baseline and follow-up examinations. After&#xD;
      identification of vascular landmarks corresponding in the two 3-D vessel models, the patient&#xD;
      specific model pairs will be co-registered to correctly match the OCT pullbacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT baseline and follow-up examinations will be performed in Prague (IKEM hospital) and Brno&#xD;
      (Saint Anna hospital) and data will be send to the core lab in the Iowa Institute for&#xD;
      Biomedical Imaging, The University of Iowa, USA for analysis. Iowa Institute for Biomedical&#xD;
      Imaging is a research centre, which has extensive experience with the evaluation of coronary&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. For the purpose of detailed analysis of the coronary arteries unique&#xD;
      software for creating 3-D reconstructions of coronary arteries based on the fusion of&#xD;
      angiography and optical coherence tomography was developed at this institution. This software&#xD;
      enables exact assessment of plaque and lumen volumes. Software is protected by U.S. patent.&#xD;
      Because of large volume of data and patients in this project, applications of such automated&#xD;
      analytic tools are prerequisite of successful accomplishment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean heart rate will be measured during 24 hour ECG Holter monitoring, which will evaluate&#xD;
      all necessary parameters including its circadian variability. ECG Holter recordings will be&#xD;
      performed in 1 month and in 12 months after heart transplant. In addition to mean 24 hour&#xD;
      heart rate, time and frequency domain components of heart rate variability will be analyzed&#xD;
      to obtain estimate the extent of vagal reinnervation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies(class I,II) and MHC complex class I - related chain A&#xD;
      (MICA) antibodies will be measured (before heart transplant, 1 month, 6 months and 12 months&#xD;
      after heart transplant). Evaluation of anti-HLA antibodies levels (titers) in the serum of a&#xD;
      patient is performed by fluorescence intensity of formed complexes. Double laser cytometer&#xD;
      Luminex 100 IS 2.3 is used for fluorescence reading. Based on comparison of negative and&#xD;
      positive controls, cut-off is calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional risk factors for CAV will be determined in 1 month and in 12 months after heart&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides) will be measured. Blood&#xD;
      pressure in triplicate will be measured in supine position (1 hour before regular&#xD;
      endomyocardial biopsies). Glycemic control will be quantified by measurements of Hemoglobin&#xD;
      A1 level, plasma glucose. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) status will be measured by immunoglobulin G&#xD;
      (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM) titers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other monitored parameters will be: 1) the post transplant course and clinical status; the&#xD;
      occurrence of graft dysfunction (echocardiographic monitoring will follow each endomyocardial&#xD;
      biopsy), 2) the occurrence of cellular and/or humoral rejection in endomyocardial biopsies (8&#xD;
      protocolar endomyocardial biopsies within 12 months after heart transplantation), 3) presence&#xD;
      and tissue distribution (vascular/non-vascular) staining for complement fragments C3 and C4&#xD;
      (markers of antibodies-mediated complement activation), 4) the period of cardiac allograft&#xD;
      cold ischemia 5) aetiology of brain death of the donor 6) degree of HLA mismatch between&#xD;
      donor and recipient, 7) blood cytokine levels involved in regulation of humoral immune&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
