      Summary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretical Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The left ventricular myocardial performance results from a complex interplay between linear&#xD;
      deformations (longitudinal, circumferential and radial) and twist/ untwist mechanics. These&#xD;
      components of myocardial mechanics can be assessed, at rest and during stress conditions, by&#xD;
      high resolution echocardiography using the &quot;2D-strain&quot; technology and constitute good indexes&#xD;
      of tissue intrinsic contractility / relaxation properties. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome (MS) are associated with an increased risk for cardiac diseases. While&#xD;
      several clinical studies have reported, particularly in T2DM, a diastolic dysfunction&#xD;
      (concept of &quot;diabetic cardiomyopathy&quot;), the existence of impaired regional myocardial&#xD;
      function, with altered intrinsic contractility properties, remains largely unanswered,&#xD;
      especially in the SM. Stress echocardiography is very interesting to reveal myocardial&#xD;
      dysfunction, discrete or absent at rest. To the best of our knowledge, no scientific study&#xD;
      is, however, today available on the kinetics of linear strains and twist/untwist dynamics in&#xD;
      response to stress in T2DM as well as SM. The epicardial adipose tissue is the source of&#xD;
      production of important pro-inflammatory cytokines that have the potential, through an&#xD;
      exacerbation of oxidative stress, to impair coronary endothelial function, increase fibrosis,&#xD;
      but also directly affect cardiomyocyte calcium homeostasis. An increase in epicardial adipose&#xD;
      tissue is consensually reported in T2DM and SM and is clearly associated with coronary&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. A link between cardiac adiposity and overall cardiac function, particularly&#xD;
      diastolic, is now suggested but to our knowledge no study has challenged its association with&#xD;
      myocardial dysfunction in T2DM as SM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Methodology: - To investigate regional myocardial linear deformations and&#xD;
      torsion, at rest and in response to a dobutamine stress, in asymptomatic T2DM and SM patients&#xD;
      without clinical complications, - to study the links between expected regional myocardial&#xD;
      abnormalities and inflammation, hyperglycemia and cardiac adiposity. A control group of&#xD;
      healthy individuals matched for sex and age will also be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the subjects will benefit from a clinical, anthropometric and biological evaluation. In&#xD;
      addition, conventional echocardiography (remodelling and global diastolic and systolic&#xD;
      functions) complemented by a functional analysis by tissue Doppler imaging will be performed.&#xD;
      Furthermore, 2D cine loops will be recorded in the apical 4, 3 and 2- chamber views for the&#xD;
      objective assessment of myocardial longitudinal deformations as well as in the parasternal&#xD;
      short axis (base and apex) for the evaluation of the circumferential deformations and basal&#xD;
      and apical rotations and left ventricular torsion, at rest and under low dose of dobutamine&#xD;
      (110 and 120 bpm).&#xD;
