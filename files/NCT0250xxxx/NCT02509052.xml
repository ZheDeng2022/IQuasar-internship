    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of leflunomide in treating&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma that has come back (relapsed) or has not responded to previous&#xD;
      treatment (refractory). Leflunomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose (RP2D) of leflunomide, when given as a single agent. (Phase I) II. To assess the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of leflunomide at each dose level by evaluation of toxicities including:&#xD;
      type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration. (Phase I) III. To evaluate&#xD;
      the anti-myeloma activity of leflunomide, when given as a single agent, as assessed by&#xD;
      overall response rate (ORR). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To obtain estimates of: response duration, clinical benefit&#xD;
      response, overall survival, progression-free survival. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To characterize the relationship between serum concentration of the&#xD;
      active leflunomide metabolite, teriflunomide (A77 1726), and toxicity. (Phase I/II) II. To&#xD;
      assess the relationship between serum concentration of the active leflunomide metabolite,&#xD;
      teriflunomide (A77 1726), and disease response. (Phase I/II) III. To explore the relationship&#xD;
      between polymorphisms in the CYP1A2, CYP2C19, or DHODH genes and toxicity/response. (Phase&#xD;
      I/II) IV. To explore the ex vivo cytotoxicity of leflunomide toward primary multiple myeloma&#xD;
      (MM) cells, in order to evaluate whether individual ex vivo leflunomide response might be a&#xD;
      useful predictor of therapeutic response. (Phase I/II) V. To explore the potential additive&#xD;
      or synergistic effects of combining leflunomide with other classes of Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. (Phase I/II) VI. To generate a preliminary ribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (RNA)/microRNA (miRNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation signature associated&#xD;
      with response of MM cells to leflunomide in vivo (mRNA/miRNA and DNA methylation, phase II&#xD;
      only) and teriflunomide ex vivo (messenger RNA [mRNA]/miRNA). (Phase I/II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive leflunomide orally (PO) once daily&#xD;
      (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30&#xD;
      days and then every 28 days until disease progression (active follow-up) or every 3 months&#xD;
      (long term follow-up).&#xD;
