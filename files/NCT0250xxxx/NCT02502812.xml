  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clopidogrel is a potent anti-thrombotic drug that inhibits adenosine diphosphate&#xD;
      (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation. This is an open-label, randomized, single dose, three-way&#xD;
      cross over, six sequence study to investigate the relative bioavailability of two 75&#xD;
      milligrams (mg) clopidogrel tablet formulations (clopidogrel SB224326 test formulation 1&#xD;
      [Clop F1] and clopidogrel SB224326 test formulation 2 [Clop F2]) compared with the reference&#xD;
      product (innovator) in healthy human subjects. A total of 18 healthy human subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized, such that approximately 14 evaluable subjects complete the study. Total duration&#xD;
      in the study for each subject will be approximately 8 weeks from screening to the follow-up&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Adult subjects aged between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing&#xD;
             the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy, non-smoker, as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee&#xD;
             based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination,&#xD;
             laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not&#xD;
             specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference&#xD;
             range for the population being studied may be included only if the investigator in&#xD;
             consultation with the Medical Monitor if required, agree and document that the finding&#xD;
             is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight &gt;=50 kilograms (kg) and Body mass index (BMI) within the range 19 - 24.9&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Healthy male or female subjects: MALES: Male subjects with female partners of child&#xD;
             bearing potential must comply with the following contraception requirements from the&#xD;
             time of first dose of study medication until 24 hours after the last dose of study&#xD;
             medication: a) Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia. b) Male condom plus&#xD;
             partner use of one of the contraceptive following options: Contraceptive subdermal&#xD;

             combined or progestogen alone, Injectable progestogen, Contraceptive vaginal ring,&#xD;
             Percutaneous contraceptive patches, This is an all inclusive list of those methods&#xD;
             that meet the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) definition of highly effective: having a failure&#xD;
             rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and, correctly and, when&#xD;
             applicable, in accordance with the product label. For non-product methods (e.g. male&#xD;
             sterility), the investigator determines what is consistent and correct use. The GSK&#xD;
             definition is based on the definition provided by International Conference on&#xD;
             Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human&#xD;
             Use (ICH). The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how&#xD;
             to properly use these methods of contraception. FEMALES: Eligible to participate, if&#xD;
             she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin&#xD;
             [hCG] test), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies: a)&#xD;

             amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle&#xD;
             stimulating hormone [FSH] and estradiol levels consistent with menopause). Females on&#xD;
             hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be&#xD;
             required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to&#xD;
             continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow&#xD;
             confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. b) Reproductive&#xD;
