  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Topotecan is an FDA-approved drug when given by intravenous infection. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine if treatment with topotecan by an alternative method, direct delivery&#xD;
      into the part of the brain where the tumor has spread, is safe and well tolerated. The&#xD;
      Cleveland Multiport Catheter is a new, investigational device that will be used to deliver&#xD;
      topotecan into tumor-infiltrated brain. A second purpose of this study is to determine&#xD;
      whether the Cleveland Multiport Catheter can be used effectively and safely to deliver&#xD;
      topotecan into tumor-infiltrated brain. This study will also examine how tumors responds to&#xD;
      treatment with topotecan. This study will also look at the way topotecan is injected into&#xD;
      tumors-infiltrated brain. A small amount of contrast dye (called gadolinium DTPA) will be&#xD;
      added to topotecan before it is injected. Pictures will be taken of the brain with an MRI&#xD;
      machine. This will allow the investigators to see where in the tumor-infiltrated brain the&#xD;
      topotecan has been injected. This study will collect medical information before, during, and&#xD;
      after treatment in order to better understand hot to make this type of procedure accessible&#xD;
      to patients.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging the spatial and temporal distribution&#xD;
           of topotecan in tumor-infiltrated brain administered by convection-enhanced delivery&#xD;
           (CED) in patients with recurrent/progressive WHO grade III or IV (high grade) glioma&#xD;
           (HGG) who have failed standard therapy comprising surgical biopsy and/or resection and&#xD;
           adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, following a clinically-indicated resection of&#xD;
           the contrast enhancing tumor mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate by MR imaging the influence of catheter positioning, on the spatial and&#xD;
           temporal distribution of topotecan administered by CED in patients with&#xD;
           recurrent/progressive HGG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the extent of spatial distribution of topotecan, by MR imaging, when&#xD;
           delivered into non-enhancing tumor tissue (as defined on pre-operative conventional MRI&#xD;
           imaging with and without intravenous gadolinium) in the intraoperative setting, the&#xD;
           immediate peri-operative setting, and in the post-operative setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the extent to which CED-mediated delivery of topotecan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the extent to which infusate can be distributed in the 2 cm margin around&#xD;
           the resection cavity by administration by CED&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety, tolerability and toxicity profile of topotecan administered by CED&#xD;
           using different infusion rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe evidence of activity of single-agent topotecan administered by CED to&#xD;
           patients with recurrent/progressive HGG who have failed standard therapy comprising&#xD;
           surgical biopsy and/or resection and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.&#xD;
