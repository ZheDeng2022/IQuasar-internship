  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal aim of the present research is to compare two methods of antibiotic delivery:&#xD;
      concomitant tumescent antibiotic delivery (TAD) and intravenous antibiotic delivery (IVAD)&#xD;
      versus IVAD alone, (TAD+IVAD vs IVAD), with respect to the prevention of surgical site&#xD;
      infections (SSI). The investigators hypothesize that TAD+IVAD will significantly reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of SSI compared to IVAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAD is the subcutaneous infiltration of a dilute solution of antibiotic(s) in a solution of&#xD;
      tumescent local anesthesia (TLA). TLA consists of a dilute solution of lidocaine (1gm/L),&#xD;
      epinephrine (1mg/L) and sodium bicarbonate (10mEq/L) in 0.9% physiologic saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim of this study is to compare TAD+IVAD vs IVAD with respect to the prevention&#xD;
      of post-operative venous thromboembolism (VTE).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tumescent antibiotic delivery (TAD) is defined as the subcutaneous infiltration of a dilute&#xD;
      solution of antibiotic(s) in a solution of tumescent local anesthesia (TLA). TLA consists of&#xD;
      a dilute solution of lidocaine (1gm/L), epinephrine (1mg/L) and sodium bicarbonate (10mEq/L)&#xD;
      in 0.9% physiologic saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that TAD with intravenous antibiotic delivery (IVAD) will&#xD;
      significantly reduce the incidence of SSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal aim of the present research is to compare two methods of antibiotic delivery:&#xD;
      concomitant TAD and IVAD versus IVAD alone (TAD+IVAD vs IVAD) with respect to the prevention&#xD;
      of surgical site infections (SSI). The secondary aim of this study is to compare TAD+IVAD vs&#xD;
      IVAD with respect to the prevention of post-operative venous thromboembolism (VTE). This&#xD;
      research is an open label randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing two modes of antibiotic&#xD;
      delivery. It is not a trial comparing antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target populations for the present clinical trial are patients who have a high risk of&#xD;
      SSI. These include patients exposed to high-risk surgical procedures (open abdominal&#xD;
      surgeries, trauma surgeries, burn surgeries, sternotomy) or are obese, have diabetes, are&#xD;
      immune-compromised or are otherwise at increased risk of SSI.&#xD;
