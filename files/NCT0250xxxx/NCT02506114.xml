  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentered, open label, randomized phase II trial of PROSTVAC or ipilimumab or&#xD;
      the combination of PROSTVAC and ipilimumab as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with localized&#xD;
      prostate cancer. Eligible patients will be randomized to PROSTVAC monotherapy (Arm A),&#xD;
      ipilimumab monotherapy (Arm B), or combination therapy with both PROSTVAC and ipilimumab (Arm&#xD;
      C), prior to RP. In arms A and C, PROSTVAC-V will be administered subcutaneously as the&#xD;
      primary vaccine on Day 1, which will be followed 2 weeks later with a series of 2 PROSTVAC-F&#xD;
      subcutaneous administrations, given 3 weeks apart. In arms B and C, ipilimumab will be&#xD;
      administered twice, at a dose of 3mg/kg, 3 weeks apart. In the combination arm, ipilimumab&#xD;
      administration will coincide with the PROSTVAC-F administration. In arm B, ipilimumab will&#xD;
      begin on Day 1. In all three arms, radical prostatectomy (RP) will occur 21 days, or three&#xD;
      weeks, following final treatment administration of PROSTVAC or ipilimumab. No further therapy&#xD;
      will be administered on study following RP.&#xD;

    <description>PROSTVAC-V/F is a prostate-specific antigen(PSA)-based immunization strategy. It is intended to generate immune responses to prostate specific antigens and prostate cancer cells. It uses poxviral vectors to introduce modified PSA to the patient in an immunogenic manner to break self-tolerance, and thereby induce immune responses directed against prostate cancer cells.</description>

             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, stroke or&#xD;
             myocardial infarction within 6 months, or psychiatric illness that would limit&#xD;

&#xD;
         20. Subject requires any medical intervention(s) or has any other condition(s) that, in&#xD;
             the Investigator's opinion, will 1) make the administration of PROSTVAC or ipilimumab&#xD;
             hazardous, 2) obscure the interpretation of adverse events (AEs), 3) compromise&#xD;
             adherence with study requirements, or 4) otherwise compromise the study's objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Subject has high-risk features (e.g., based on Gleason score, PSA, clinical stage, %&#xD;
             positive biopsies), and the treating physician feels the subject should undergo&#xD;
             radical prostatectomy sooner than planned within the protocol.&#xD;
