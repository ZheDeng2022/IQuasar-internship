      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - About 15 million Americans have a food allergy. Because there are no cures or effective&#xD;
      prevention or treatment for food allergies, researchers want to learn more about them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn more about the causes and effects of food allergy and related conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People ages 2 99 who have food allergy and/or a related genetic or other condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their relatives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy relatives and volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have at least 3 visits over 1 2 years, and then once a year for up to&#xD;
           12 years. Each may last a day or longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergy skin prick tests: Drops of allergens are placed on the back or arm. The skin is&#xD;
           scratched under each drop.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leukapheresis: blood is taken from a needle in one arm, passed through a machine, and&#xD;
           returned through a needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-rays&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Esophageal string test: One end of a string is taped to the cheek and the other end is&#xD;
           packed into a capsule. When the capsule is swallowed, the string unwinds; it is left in&#xD;
           for at least 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EGD and colonoscopy: Biopsies are taken from the gastrointestinal system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tiny biopsies of skin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photographs of the body&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of cells through:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Swab of nose, inside of cheek, or skin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gentle skin scrape&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tape stripping: piece of tape is put on the skin and pulled off.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 15 million Americans, including 6 million children, who have a&#xD;
      potentially life-threatening food allergy. The prevalence of this disease has increased over&#xD;
      the last three decades, in both the United States and other developed countries. There are no&#xD;
      cures or effective prevention or treatment strategies for food allergy. Moreover, little is&#xD;
      known about the factors that account for the rising prevalence and severity of these diseases&#xD;
      in recent years. Both genetic and environmental factors likely contribute to the development&#xD;
      of food allergy, but the complex interaction between these variables has frustrated efforts&#xD;
      to elucidate pathogenesis and develop mechanism-targeted therapies. Children with food&#xD;
      allergy are 2 to 4 times more likely to be diagnosed with asthma or other allergic conditions&#xD;
      than children without food allergy, and food allergy may also be an important trigger for&#xD;
      atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic esophagitis. The Laboratory of Allergic Diseases within&#xD;
      the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has a longstanding interest in the&#xD;
      genetics and pathogenesis of allergic inflammatory disorders, and with the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health Clinical Center, it provides the ideal environment for the proposed&#xD;
      translational studies. In this study, we will: (1) investigate the key genetic, cellular,&#xD;
      immunologic, and biochemical pathways that lead to the development of food allergy, and (2)&#xD;
      identify biomarkers that predict the clinical course and natural history of patients with&#xD;
      food allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects eligible for enrollment in this study include children and adults with food allergy&#xD;
      and patients with a known/suspected genetic or congenital disorder potentially associated&#xD;
      with these phenotypes. Unaffected relatives (children and adults) of an enrolled subject and&#xD;
      healthy volunteers (children and adults) will also be eligible for enrollment as controls.&#xD;
      Most participants will be followed for 2 years, although participants with an identified&#xD;
      genetic or congenital disorder and a subset of participants with food allergy may be followed&#xD;
      until this study ends (up to 12 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data obtained from analysis of blood, skin, saliva, stool, gastrointestinal biopsies, and&#xD;
      other specimens will be used to explore the immunologic, biochemical, microbial, and genetic&#xD;
      basis of food allergy. Results of research studies will be correlated with the scope and&#xD;
      severity of their clinical phenotype, their response to treatment, and the natural history of&#xD;
      their allergic disease(s).&#xD;
