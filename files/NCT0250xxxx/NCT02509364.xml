  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a highly heterogeneous and lethal pathological process&#xD;
      with limited therapeutic options, which is the most common and severe of the idiopathic&#xD;
      interstitial pneumonias (IIPs). During the past 20 years, the incidence of IPF increased&#xD;
      significantly. Most of IPF patients show a median survival time of 2-3 years after diagnosis.&#xD;
      Five-year survival rate is 30%-50%. It's difficult to diagnose in the early stage of IPF.&#xD;
      Once the patients go to hospital, it's already in the late stage. Now there is no effective&#xD;
      therapy except lung transplant for IPF in clinical application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF) is a fatal condition with high&#xD;
      mortality (over 80%). Its etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown. There is a lack of&#xD;
      effective treatment for it. Based on the investigators' long-term clinical observation, most&#xD;
      cases of AE-IPF initially got &quot;common cold&quot; and had coryza, more cough, nasal&#xD;
      obstruction，rhinorrhea, sore throat, some patients had fever, headache, and etc. Some of&#xD;
      these patients' condition developed very rapidly and then became very severe similar to the&#xD;
      situation of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Why these AE-IPF patients were so&#xD;
      hypersensitive to &quot;cold&quot;? What were the immunologic and pathological mechanisms of their lung&#xD;
      lesions after patients exposed to &quot;common cold&quot;? How to effectively offer interventional&#xD;
      treatment for AE-IPF? All the above questions are yet to be explained clearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the investigators' previous retrospective study, the investigators found that there were&#xD;
      some obviously imbalanced immune responses in IPF patients, including increased cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 4 (CD4) T cell population, immunoglobulin and complements. The investigators&#xD;
      also found highly expressed inflammatory cytokines (IL-17, MIG and IL-9) and high detection&#xD;
      rates of pathogens in AE-IPF patients, especially serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody of&#xD;
      some respiratory virus. These findings provide a strong suggestion that there are some&#xD;
      imbalance of immunologic function in IPF and there are relationship between AE-IPF and&#xD;
      infection, especially &quot;Cold&quot; virus infection might be a key trigger for AE-IPF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IPF has become the focus of study in the area of pulmonary fibrosis, accounting for over 25%&#xD;
      of all interstitial lung diseases (ILD) 1 and over 60% of all idiopathic interstitial&#xD;
      pneumonia (IIP). The past 20 years have observed the remarkable tendency of increase of IPF&#xD;
      incidence, accompanied by only 2-3 years of medium survival after diagnosis and 30-50% of&#xD;
      5-year survival2. Due to limited diagnosis method at early stage of the disease, the patients&#xD;
      are most likely diagnosed only when they reach middle or late stage. Other issue is lack of&#xD;
      effective treatment, except for lung transplantation. Most of the deaths are caused by acute&#xD;
      exacerbation, which is defined by clinicians as acute exacerbation of IPF (AE-IPF) and&#xD;
      characterized by the rapid deterioration during relatively stable period of IPF (Stable-IPF).&#xD;
      Exacerbation may occur at all stages of IPF development (see the below figure) and is&#xD;
      accompanied by hazardous and quick development, high mortality and very poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence and mortality of AE-IPF varies in different studies. Kubo etc. reported that&#xD;
      acute exacerbation occurs within 3 years in around 57% of IPF patients, with the mortality of&#xD;
      53%. Study by Kim etc. show that the mortality of AE-IPF reaches 78%. Study by Song&#xD;
      etc.demonstrated that the incidence of acute exacerbation of IPF is 35.4%, with over 50% of&#xD;
      in-hospital morality, 56% of 1-year mortality and 18.4% of 3-year mortality. Other studies&#xD;
      showed that 1-year post-exacerbation mortality is nearly 100%. Data based on the 178&#xD;
      in-hospital IPF patients in the investigators' department during the latest 4 years showed&#xD;
      that 58% (102/178) of those patients experienced acute exacerbation at certain stage of&#xD;
      disease, with 70 deaths occurred. Among those deaths, 56 cases (83%) were caused by acute&#xD;
      exacerbation. It is clear that the high incidence and mortality of AE-IPF is the most&#xD;
      essential factors impacting the survival and quality of life of IPF patients, therefore lead&#xD;
      to the poor prognosis of IPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and key scientific questions Based on analysis above, the investigators propose&#xD;
      the following hypothesis: certain level of immunological imbalance exists in those relatively&#xD;
      stable IPF patients, making them susceptible to infection by various pathogens. Once&#xD;
      infected, especially by viruses (e.g. common cold related viruses), AE-IPF can be quickly&#xD;
      triggered, leading to ARDS-like reaction. To validate this hypothesis, four key scientific&#xD;
      questions need to be answered by studies with scrupulous design: 1) what are the&#xD;
      characteristic changes of immunological function in IPF/AE-IPF patients so as to make the&#xD;
      patients more susceptible to common cold viruses? 2) What kind of pathogens, especially those&#xD;
      common cold viruses, are the key triggering factors during the development of AE-IPF? 3) What&#xD;
      kind of inflammatory cascade reaction occurs in AE-IPF leading to ARDS-like prompt&#xD;
      development of pulmonary inflammation? Key research direction and scientific rationale In&#xD;
      order to address the key scientific questions above, the investigators will conduct&#xD;
      comprehensive studies based on detailed screen and analysis of large amount of clinical&#xD;
      cases, integrated research methods in such areas as immunology, molecular, cytology and&#xD;
      animal model, as well as high throughput data collection and big data analysis: 1) Extensive&#xD;
      screening and identification of those pathogens closely related with AE-IPF; 2) Comprehensive&#xD;
      analysis of the change of immunology function, focusing on the pathological-physiological&#xD;
      alteration in virus induced immunologic imbalance in IPF, as well as the characteristic&#xD;
      changes in relevant cytological signal transduction, so as to identify important AE-IPF&#xD;
      bio-markers and explain the pathological molecular mechanism and network of ARDS-like&#xD;
      inflammatory cascade reaction, which will be significant efforts in terms of prevention of&#xD;
      AE-IPF, reduction of mortality, improvement of quality of life, delaying of disease&#xD;
      progression and increase of survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar clinical deterioration like AE-IPF will also occur in almost all the other types of&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis, especially connective tissue disease-ILD (CTD-ILD), nonspecific&#xD;
      interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), drug induced ILD, fibrotic allergic pneumonia and cryptogenic&#xD;
      organizing pneumonia (COP) etc. Therefore, this program will also provide insight into the&#xD;
      basic research and clinical management of acute exacerbation of other interstitial lung&#xD;
      diseases, which is one common problem extensively exists in the area of interstitial lung&#xD;
      disease and the key factor in terms of improving patients' quality of life and survival.&#xD;
