  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. According to the&#xD;
      World Health Organization's Global Cancer Observatory, there were an estimated 2.09 million&#xD;
      new cases and 1.76 million deaths worldwide in 2018 (GLOBOCAN, 2018, Fact Sheet N⁰39). The&#xD;
      lung cancer incidence and mortality in China is relatively high compared to most countries&#xD;
      with an estimated 774,323 new cases and 690,567 deaths in 2018 (GLOBOCAN, 2018, Fact Sheet&#xD;
      N⁰160 China). In the US, as per the estimates of the National Cancer Institute, there would&#xD;
      be about 228,820 new cases and 135,720 deaths from lung cancer in 2020 accounting for&#xD;
      approximately 22.4% of all cancer deaths (SEER program, 2020). About 84% of lung cancers are&#xD;
      NSCLCs in the US (American Cancer Society, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prognosis for patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC, either at initial diagnosis or&#xD;
      recurrence, remains grim. The standard of care has been chemotherapy with agents including&#xD;
      platinum analogs, taxanes, vinca alkaloids, and pemetrexed with vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor inhibitors and for patients with appropriate disease genotypes, epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First-line Therapy: For patients without specific molecular target, first-line therapy is&#xD;
      usually a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)-inhibitor or a platinum-containing, double&#xD;
      agent regimen. Platinum can be either cisplatin or carboplatin, and the most commonly used&#xD;
      drugs combined with platinum include paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine;&#xD;
      other drugs such as irinotecan, etoposide, and vinblastine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The arrival of immunotherapy with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab effectively changed the&#xD;
      first-line standard. Pembrolizumab is very effective, with a long Duration of Response (DoR),&#xD;
      however response rates remain suboptimal (approximately 45% in first line [Keytruda®&#xD;
      Prescribing Information. 2020]). Most patients will eventually fail first line therapy and&#xD;
      docetaxel remains a valid treatment option when NSCLC patients fail to respond to targeted or&#xD;
      immune-based therapies or become refractory to such therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients intolerant to platinum-containing regimens, platinum-free double-agent&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens are used as an alternative. For patients with an Eastern Cooperative&#xD;
      Oncology Group score of 2 and elderly patients, single-agent or double agent regimens are&#xD;
      recommended. Approval has been obtained in China for the single agent gefitinib to be used in&#xD;
      first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients with sensitive mutation&#xD;
      of EGFR tyrosine kinase gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second-line Therapy: Drugs used for second-line treatment include docetaxel, pemetrexed,&#xD;
      EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for EGFR mutant patients, and the checkpoint inhibitors&#xD;
      (such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several second-line treatment drugs and regimens (docetaxel, pemetrexed, and ramucirumab&#xD;
      combined with docetaxel) have been approved as single agents or combination for second-line&#xD;
      therapy for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR wild type with limited efficacy,&#xD;
      characterized by limited clinical improvement or overall survival (OS). EGFR wild type&#xD;
      represents around 85% of western NSCLC population, and around 70% of Asian NSCLC population.&#xD;
      Checkpoint inhibition with PD 1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors in combination&#xD;
      with chemotherapy or other checkpoint inhibitors have moved into first line and are&#xD;
      increasingly not an option for 2nd/3rd line. This has created a situation where&#xD;
      docetaxel-based regimens have become standard-of-care in 2nd/3rd line NSCLC. Therefore, the&#xD;
      evaluation of plinabulin combined with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone has become highly&#xD;
      relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docetaxel, a taxane, binds to and stabilizes tubulin, thereby inhibiting microtubule&#xD;
      disassembly resulting in cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and subsequent cell death. In&#xD;
      patients with NSCLC, previously treated with a platinum-based chemotherapy, second-line&#xD;
      therapy with docetaxel afforded a median OS in the range from 5.7 to 7.5 months (Fossella,&#xD;
      2000; Shepherd, 2000). The most common AEs included infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile&#xD;
      neutropenia (FN), hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea,&#xD;
      constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea,&#xD;
      vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia (Taxotere Prescribing Information,&#xD;
      2020). Since the approval of docetaxel in 1999 as the second-line treatment for advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic NSCLC, other drugs, namely pemetrexed and erlotinib, have been approved for the&#xD;
      same indication. However, despite the availability of newer treatments, patient survival has&#xD;
      not improved over that achieved with docetaxel. The OS in these studies was found to remain&#xD;
      in the range of 5.6 to 8.3 months (Hanna et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2008; Shepherd et al.,&#xD;
      2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective analysis of the plinabulin Phase 2 study suggests that plinabulin prolongs&#xD;
      survival in NSCLC patients with measurable lung tumors. The expectation is that patients with&#xD;
      a measurable lung lesion may still harbor antigens that are immunogenic, thus capable of&#xD;
      still stimulating the immune system. Docetaxel treatment is expected to release these&#xD;
      immunogens and plinabulin is expected to enhance presentation of these immunogens via&#xD;
      dendritic cell activation, to the T-cell repertoire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This plinabulin study investigates the efficacy and safety of plinabulin and docetaxel&#xD;
      combination in patients with EGFR wild type NSCLC and progressing tumors requiring second- or&#xD;
      third- line therapy for advanced or metastatic disease after failing a platinum-containing&#xD;
      regimen. The primary endpoint is OS, with docetaxel monotherapy as an active comparator.&#xD;

    <description>A treatment cycle is 21 days. Treatment will be repeated until disease progression is detected by imaging studies or unacceptable toxicities are encountered. On Day 1, all patients will receive docetaxel 75 mg/m2 by intravenous (IV) infusion over 1 hour. Oral dexamethasone (16 mg, given as 8 mg twice daily) will be given on the day prior to, the day of (Day 1), and the day following docetaxel infusion (Day 2). Antiemetic prophylaxis will be administered according to institutional guideline for docetaxel. Institutional guideline/practice should be followed in the event of infusion/hypersensitivity reaction. Diphenhydramine and dexamethasone infusion may be administered in the event of infusion reaction.</description>

    <description>The treatment regimen for Docetaxel (D) will be followed for this arm. In addition, on Days 1 and 8 of the 21 day cycle, patients will receive Plinabulin (P) administered via IV infusion over 60 minutes. On Day 1, the infusion begins 2 hours from the starting time of docetaxel infusion, i.e, approximately 60 minutes from the end of docetaxel infusion. On Day 8, patients must be given an anti-emetic prophylactically before the plinabulin infusion. If emesis persists after Day 8, with a grade &gt;1, plinabulin will be reduced to 20 mg/m2. Patients from the DP Arm who stop treatment with docetaxel due to toxicity or another medically acceptable reason, may continue treatment with plinabulin alone as previously described.</description>

             early stage disease do not count as prior systemic therapy. Prior radiation therapy is&#xD;
             not exclusionary. Prior immunotherapy with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor is not exclusionary.&#xD;
             Prior treatment for advanced or metastatic disease must have included a platinum-based&#xD;
             regimen. (Treatment of early stage disease [Stage IIIA or earlier] with a&#xD;
             platinum-containing therapy does not count).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with active brain metastasis or leptomeningeal involvement with brain&#xD;
             metastases who are asymptomatic, and whose lesions by imaging are at least stable and&#xD;
             without interim development of new lesions for at least 4 weeks may be enrolled.&#xD;
             Patients who require continued therapy with steroid medication for management for&#xD;
             their brain metastases are eligible; dosing must be stable for at least 4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to randomization;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have at least one measurable lung lesion of ≥10 mm by CT or MRI per&#xD;

             known ALK-rearrangements should be treated with an appropriate tyrosine kinase&#xD;
             inhibitor (TKI) before entering the study. The TKI regimen would count as a line of&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. All adverse events of any prior systemic therapy, surgery, or radiotherapy, must have&#xD;
             resolved to CTCAE (v4.03) Grade ≤2, except for neurological adverse events that must&#xD;

             women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of&#xD;
             childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy,&#xD;
             anti-estrogens, or ovarian suppression.&#xD;
