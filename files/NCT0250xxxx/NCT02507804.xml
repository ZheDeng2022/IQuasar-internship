  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to design and evaluate a PROMs diary for cancer patients to self&#xD;
      report side effects and experiences of their treatment, and thereby create a detailed account&#xD;
      of treatment related adverse events and their impact on daily activities to share with the&#xD;
      care team.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, controlled, single-centred study to compare the quality of Adverse&#xD;
      Events (AE) and Concomitant Medication (CM) reporting, patient satisfaction, care experience&#xD;
      and quality of life in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and managed with/without a&#xD;
      diary for Patient Reported Outcome Measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      164 subjects will be enrolled and randomised in a 1:1 ratio and stratified by line of therapy&#xD;
      (first line vs second line or higher line), treatment intent (curative vs palliative) and&#xD;
      ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive standard chemotherapy delivered as per institutional practice. They&#xD;
      will also receive counselling on monitoring and reporting side effects, medication and&#xD;
      experiences as per standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will complete a study questionnaire and EQ-5D forms in the Outpatient Department&#xD;
      prior to the consultation and delivery of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomised to Arm A will use the PROMs diary to record side effects, medication and&#xD;
      experiences associated with cycles 1-6 of chemotherapy. The diary will be reviewed by the&#xD;
      study team to collect AE and CM information. AE/CM will be recorded in source documents as&#xD;
      per usual practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomised to the control Arm B will discuss side effects, medication and&#xD;
      experiences associated with cycles 1-6 of chemotherapy at clinical consultations as per&#xD;
      standard practice. This may include the use of notes, diaries or other methods at their own&#xD;
      discretion. Arm B subjects may not use a PROMs diary. The study team will collect and record&#xD;
      AE/CM information in the source documentation as per usual practice.&#xD;
