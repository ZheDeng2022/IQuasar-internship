    <textblock>
      This is a multi-institutional, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blinded phase II trial&#xD;
      of maintenance pembrolizumab versus placebo after first-line chemotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic urothelial cancer who have achieved at least stable disease on first-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be 1:1 randomized to placebo (Control Arm A) and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      (Experimental Arm B). Stratification factors for randomization: presence of visceral&#xD;
      metastatic disease (lung, liver, or bone or other organs vs. lymph node only) at the time of&#xD;
      initiation of first-line chemotherapy, and response to first-line chemotherapy (CR/PR vs. SD.&#xD;
      Subjects who progress on placebo will be assessed to determine if they are eligible to cross&#xD;
      over to unblinded treatment with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Control Arm A, commercially available normal saline will be used as the placebo. No&#xD;
      active placebo drug will be mixed with the normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Experimental Arm B, pembrolizumab (or placebo), 200 mg intravenous infusion (IV) every 3&#xD;
      weeks for up to 12 months, or until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following required laboratory values must be obtained within fourteen days prior to&#xD;
      registration for protocol therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematopoietic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 /mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemoglobin ≥8.5 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Creatinine ≤1.5x ULN OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measured or calculated creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min for subject with creatinine&#xD;
           levels &gt;1.5x institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN for subject with liver metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coagulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 X ULN. If subject is&#xD;
           on anticoagulant therapy, PT or PTT must be within therapeutic range of intended use of&#xD;
           anticoagulants.&#xD;

             weeks prior to registration for protocol therapy. Note: If the subjects have undergone&#xD;
             major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or&#xD;
             complications from the intervention prior to starting protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
