      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single and&#xD;
      multiple oral dose of ASP3325 and to evaluate the effect of administration timing on the&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of ASP3325 orally administered three times a day.&#xD;

      &lt;Part 1: Single ascending dose&gt; Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of ASP3325 in non-elderly,&#xD;
           healthy adult Japanese male and female, and Caucasian male subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate gender differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate ethnic differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between&#xD;
           Japanese and Caucasians&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Part 2: Multiple ascending dose&gt; Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple oral doses of ASP3325 in&#xD;
           non-elderly, healthy adult Japanese male and female subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate gender differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Part 3: Evaluation of the effect of administration timing&gt; Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of administration timing on the pharmacodynamics of ASP3325&#xD;
           orally administered three times a day at different administration timings of 30 minutes&#xD;
           before a meal, during a meal, 30 minutes after a meal, and 2 hours after a meal in&#xD;
           non-elderly, healthy adult Japanese male subjects in a crossover design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics&#xD;

                       normal range will not be established for parameters for which a deviation&#xD;
                       from the lower limit is not considered clinically significant (AST, ALT,&#xD;
                       Î³-GTP, T-Bil, D-Bil, I-Bil, ALP, LDH, CK, T-Cho, TG, TBA, BUN, Cre, and UA).&#xD;
