    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of oral propranolol versus&#xD;
      nadolol in patients with Infantile Hemangiomas (IH) in a randomized, controlled,&#xD;
      double-blinded study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of oral propranolol in comparison&#xD;
      with oral nadolol in patients with IH. Patients will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      propranolol or dose equivalent nadolol. The duration of the study will be 24 weeks, however,&#xD;
      patient will be monitored for up to 1 year post study enrolment. Both efficacy and safety&#xD;
      will be closely monitored and captured.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be administered twice-daily doses of medication as follows: since Day 0- 0.5 mg/kg/day ; since Day 7-1.0 mg/kg/day and since Day 14- 1.5 mg/kg/day. In all subsequent visits the dosage will be adjusted based on the current weight rather than the baseline weight to maintain 1.5 mg/kg/day. Or the dose may be escalated (by 0.5 mg/kg/day at any following study visit) up to 3 mg/kg/day based on the clinical response to maintain the dose that led to at least 75% reduction in the hemangioma size until Week 24, when unblinding happen. At Week 24 paticipants can start weaning by 10% per week or continue with the last dose, depending on the investigator's decision.&#xD;
S/he will be monitored until Week 52.</description>
