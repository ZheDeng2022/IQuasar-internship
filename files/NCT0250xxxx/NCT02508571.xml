    <intervention_name>Direct swallowing training (DST)</intervention_name>
    <description>The DST consists of placing a bolus of 0.05-0.2 mL of formula milk (if the parents refuse, distilled water) via a 1-mL syringe directly on the medial-posterior part of the tongue approximately at the level of the hard and soft palate junction. The volume is started with 0.05 mL, and increased in increments of 0.05 mL to a maximum of 0.2 mL until the swallowing reflex is observed. Once the minimal volume necessary to initiate the swallow reflex is identified, it is used for the duration of the training. The bolus is provided every 30 sec over the 15-minute program or as tolerated. It is continued until infants are able to complete independent oral feeding, 2 days in a row with no adverse events that do not self-resolve.</description>

    <description>The OSMS consists of a 15-minute stimulation program, whereby the first 12 minutes involve stroking the cheeks, lips, gums, and tongue, and the final 3 minutes consist of sucking on a pacifier. It is continued until infants are able to complete independent oral feeding, 2 days in a row with no adverse events that do not self-resolve.</description>

    <description>The sham intervention consisted of the therapists placing his/her hands into the incubator or bassinet for 15 minutes without touching the infants. It is continued until infants are able to complete independent oral feeding, 2 days in a row with no adverse events that do not self-resolve.</description>
