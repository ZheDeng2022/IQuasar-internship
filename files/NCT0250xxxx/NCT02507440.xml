  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To find out if the administration of the local pharyngeal anesthetic, lidocaine, in&#xD;
      conjunction with Propofol during elective Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is useful, safe&#xD;
      and impacts the time of discharge of patient compared to placebo.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Local pharyngeal anesthetics when used in conjunction with IV sedatives such as&#xD;
      benzodiazepines may ease the endoscopy and the patient tolerance. They have been believed to&#xD;
      dull the gag reflex and smooth the process of intubation of the esophagus. However local&#xD;
      pharyngeal anesthetics beside increasing the total procedure time and delaying the discharge&#xD;
      of the patient can cause serious side effects including methemoglobinemia, aspiration and&#xD;
      anaphylactic reactions although these are rare. There have been studies supporting the use of&#xD;
      local pharyngeal anesthetics along with sedatives such as benzodiazepines and opiates [1].&#xD;
      However there have been only a few studies on the use of local pharyngeal anesthetics in&#xD;
      conjunction with propofol which have not supported any added benefit of local pharyngeal&#xD;
      anesthetics [2, 3, 4]. Despite of these studies local pharyngeal anesthetics are still being&#xD;
      widely used in conjunction with propofol during EGD's. There are currently no set&#xD;
      recommendations or protocol for the use of local anesthetics such as lidocaine in conjunction&#xD;
      with propofol during EGD's. This study is yet another attempt to find out if the local&#xD;
      pharyngeal anesthetics have any role during EGD's when used in conjunction with propofol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial. Patients scheduled to have&#xD;
      elective EGD's will be consented for their participation. CRNA's or anesthetists would be&#xD;
      present during all EGD's since propofol is only given by the anesthesia department personnel.&#xD;
      Five minutes prior to intravenous sedation the patients will be asked to gargle with 7.5 ml&#xD;
      of 2% lidocaine viscous solution or 7.5 ml of placebo and then swallow. Placebo will be 3%&#xD;
      methylcellulose which will be flavored and colored to match the characteristics of 2 %&#xD;
      lidocaine. The operating gastroenterologist after extubation will be asked to fill in a&#xD;
      questionnaire commenting on the ease of intubation and if they were able to make any guesses&#xD;
      whether lidocaine was used during the procedure or not. An independent observer will be asked&#xD;
      to fill in a questionnaire regarding their visual assessment about patient discomfort during&#xD;
      the procedure. the visual scale ranging from 1 cm to 10 cm and then the observer;&#xD;
      gastroenterologist would pick up a number with 0 being the worst satisfaction and 10 being&#xD;
      the best satisfaction with the procedure. The questionnaire will also include the number of&#xD;
      times the patient gagged, number of intubation attempts by the gastroenterologist and post&#xD;
      procedure what did the gastroenterologist think if Lidocaine or placebo was used during the&#xD;
      procedure. The time after recovery from the sedatives till the patient is discharged will be&#xD;
      recorded as the primary end point. The total number of intubation attempts, total amount of&#xD;
      propofol used during the procedure and any above mentioned side effects of lidocaine will be&#xD;
      recorded as the secondary end points. The total procedure time will also be recorded. Start&#xD;
      time for the procedure will be when the first attempt for GI scope insertion is made by the&#xD;
      gastroenterologist after giving sedative. End time for the procedure is when the GI scope is&#xD;
      extubated. Throat pain/discomfort scores which are routinely assessed and recorded prior to&#xD;
      discharge will be assessed as a secondary endpoint.&#xD;
