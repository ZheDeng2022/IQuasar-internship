      In stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) the risk of death due to cardiovascular causes is&#xD;
      high and greatly exceeds the risk of progression to end stage renal failure. This high&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk is predominantly due to sudden cardiac death and heart failure,&#xD;
      manifestations of left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis. Aldosterone appears to play an&#xD;
      important role in the causation of this myocardial disease both by direct inflammatory and&#xD;
      fibrotic myocardial effects and via increased arterial stiffness due to hypertrophy,&#xD;
      inflammation, and fibrosis within the media of large arteries. Levels of aldosterone are high&#xD;
      in CKD despite sodium overload and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)&#xD;
      inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs due to the twin phenomena of&#xD;
      aldosterone escape and breakthrough. In a previous British Heart Foundation funded study,&#xD;
      Birmingham investigators showed that the addition of the mineralocorticoid receptor blocker&#xD;
      (MRB) spironolactone to background therapy with ACE inhibitors or ARBs caused reductions in&#xD;
      the prognostically important parameters of arterial stiffness and LV mass. Because&#xD;
      spironolactone therapy was also associated with significant falls in arterial pressure it&#xD;
      remains possible that these effects were mediated simply by blood pressure reduction. In this&#xD;
      multi-centre, randomised controlled study, the effects of treatment with spironolactone on LV&#xD;
      mass and arterial stiffness in patients with stage 3 CKD on established ACE or ARB therapy&#xD;
      will be compared to those of chlortalidone, a control anti-hypertensive agent. Early stage&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease is highly prevalent and new, cost effective treatment strategies are&#xD;
      required to reduce cardiovascular risk. This study is designed to provide the rationale for a&#xD;
      larger study of morbidity and mortality with MRB therapy in early stage CKD.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease CKD is a major but poorly recognised&#xD;
           and under-treated risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It can be categorised in to 5&#xD;
           stages according to GFR and the presence of markers of kidney damage. Stage 3 CKD, the&#xD;
           subject of this proposal, is defined by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30-59&#xD;
           ml/min/1.73m2. There is a graded inverse relationship between cardiovascular risk and&#xD;
           GFR which is independent of age, sex and other risk factors. There is also a graded&#xD;
           association between albuminuria and cardiovascular risk and in patients with both low&#xD;
           GFR and albuminuria, risk is increased with a multiplicative association. While the&#xD;
           cardiovascular risk of end stage CKD is extreme, in public health terms the burden&#xD;
           resides in early stage (CKD stages 1-3) disease, which is more prevalent affecting&#xD;
           almost 1 in 7 of the entire population, including approximately 4% of those aged 40-59&#xD;
           and more than 40% of those over 70 years. Thus, CKD is a potentially important risk&#xD;
           factor for cardiovascular disease in the general population. Although the risks of&#xD;
           myocardial infarction and other manifestations of coronary artery disease are increased&#xD;
           in CKD, there is a much greater increase in the incidence of heart failure and sudden&#xD;
           cardiac death in stages 3-5. This is almost certainly a reflection of the very high&#xD;
           prevalence of myocardial disease; left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) often accompanied&#xD;
           by magnetic resonance imaging evidence of fibrosis is present in over 30% of patients&#xD;
           with stage 2 (GFR 60-89) and stage 3 CKD and in 80% of patients at the start of renal&#xD;
           replacement therapy. To date, the only prospective trial to examine the prognostic&#xD;
           benefit of drug therapy in this high risk group is the recently presented SHARP trial.&#xD;
           This showed a reduction in occlusive vascular events associated with LDL lowering with&#xD;
           simvastatin and ezetimibe. The Birmingham CRIB-2 study (see below) published in 2010&#xD;
           provided evidence that mineralocorticoid receptor blockade with spironolactone exerts&#xD;
           beneficial effects on intermediate end points of strong prognostic value including LV&#xD;
           mass and arterial stiffness. That work provides the basis for this application.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pathophysiology of myocardial and vascular disease in chronic kidney disease&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main pathological features of cardiovascular disease in CKD are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Myocardial disease characterised by LVH and fibrosis accompanied by systolic and&#xD;
                diastolic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Arterial wall thickening, stiffening and calcification (arteriosclerosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Coronary and peripheral artery atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although there is no doubt that patients with CKD are subject to accelerated&#xD;
           atherosclerosis the major pathological features of the cardiovascular system in CKD are&#xD;
           myocardial disease (so called uraemic cardiomyopathy) and arterial stiffening due to&#xD;
           arteriosclerosis. As kidney function declines, a range of abnormalities occur that may&#xD;
           exert adverse effects upon the cardiovascular system. Hypertension, chronic anaemia,&#xD;
           oxidative stress, inflammation and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone&#xD;
           (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous systems all appear to contribute to the development of&#xD;
           atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis and myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aldosterone and Cardiovascular Disease The fundamental role of the RAAS in&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease is apparent from the results of many large ACE inhibitor trials&#xD;
           showing mortality benefit in patients with chronic heart failure and in those with, or&#xD;
           at high risk of, coronary artery disease. These beneficial effects have been attributed&#xD;
           to prevention of the multiple adverse effects of angiotensin II. Strong evidence&#xD;
           suggests that aldosterone may also be an important mediator of cardiac and vascular&#xD;
           damage in many disease states. In trials involving patients with chronic heart failure&#xD;
           and heart failure complicating myocardial infarction, the addition of the MRBs -&#xD;
           spironolactone (RALES) or eplerenone (EPHESUS and EMPHASIS ) - to standard therapy&#xD;
           including ACE inhibition reduced mortality by up to 30%. Primary aldosteronism is&#xD;
           associated with a greater LV mass and higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events than&#xD;
           control hypertensive populations and in patients after myocardial infarction, plasma&#xD;
           aldosterone concentration even within the normal range predicts an adverse prognosis.&#xD;
           More recently, a study of subjects undergoing coronary angiography confirmed an&#xD;
           independent association of plasma aldosterone levels with total and cardiovascular&#xD;
           mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms of action of aldosterone include upregulation of Angiotensin 1 receptors and&#xD;
      direct effects on fibroblast collagen synthesis as well as decreased matrix&#xD;
      metallo-proteinase secretion. An anti-fibrotic effect of MRB therapy may be of major&#xD;
      importance. After myocardial infarction, circulating markers of collagen turnover and&#xD;
      fibrosis were reduced by MRB therapy and in the RALES study myocardial collagen turnover was&#xD;
      significantly reduced by spironolactone and the fall in the marker of this index was related&#xD;
      to the mortality benefit. In CKD stages 2 and 3, data from CRIB-2 showed that spironolactone&#xD;
      improves myocardial diastolic function and collagen turnover. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of MRBs in Patients with CKD Although some doubt remains about whether ACE inhibitors and&#xD;
      ARBs are superior to other blood pressure lowering drugs in slowing the progression of CKD,&#xD;
      they may provide marginal extra benefit and are widely recommended in national and&#xD;
      international guidelines. Conversely, the traditional approach by nephrologists to MRB drugs&#xD;
      has been to avoid their use because of the risk of azotaemia and hyperkalaemia. There are&#xD;
      both theoretical and empirical reasons why this avoidance may be incorrect. Firstly, CKD is&#xD;
      characterised by an abnormal combination of chronic sodium overload and high (unsuppressed)&#xD;
      levels of circulating aldosterone; the normal relationship between circulating volume and&#xD;
      aldosterone secretion appears to be altered (aldosterone escape). Secondly, in a large&#xD;
      proportion of patients with CKD on standard treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, there is&#xD;
      aldosterone 'breakthrough' so that aldosterone levels are high despite inhibition of the&#xD;
      system by prevention of angiotensin II formation or inhibition of angiotensin receptors. Thus&#xD;
      patients with CKD are exposed to high levels of aldosterone despite standard treatment. The&#xD;
      only other common disease state in which high aldosterone production continues to occur in&#xD;
      the face of sodium overload is chronic heart failure in which MRB therapy is of major&#xD;
      prognostic benefit reducing both adverse cardiovascular events and total mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also accumulating evidence to suggest that the addition of MRBs to ACE inhibitors in&#xD;
      CKD might have beneficial effects by slowing the otherwise progressive decline in renal&#xD;
      function. Animal experiments have shown that aldosterone can mediate renal injury and that&#xD;
      MRBs such as eplerenone effectively reduce this. MRBs remain effective in low aldosterone&#xD;
      models of CKD probably reflecting the importance of local (paracrine) aldosterone synthesis.&#xD;
      In humans, small studies have suggested that the addition of MRBs to ACE inhibitors or ARB&#xD;
      reduces proteinuria and may slow the progression of renal disease. Thus, the widespread use&#xD;
      of MRBs in CKD has been advocated and has even been termed 'renal aspirin'. Until the&#xD;
      publication of the CRIB-2 trial however, little attention had been paid to the potentially&#xD;
      beneficial effects of MRB therapy on the cardiovascular system in patients with CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRIB-2 trial The Effect of Spironolactone on Left Ventricular Mass and Aortic Stiffness&#xD;
      in Early-Stage Chronic Kidney Disease; a Randomised Controlled Trial In a placebo controlled&#xD;
      double blind trial, 112 patients (mean age 54 years) with stage 2 and 3 CKD with good blood&#xD;
      pressure control on established treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs were treated in an&#xD;
      active run-in phase with spironolactone 25 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then randomised to&#xD;
      continue spironolactone or to receive a matching placebo for a total of 40 weeks. LV mass&#xD;
      (cardiac magnetic resonance) and arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity/analysis, aortic&#xD;
      distensibility) were measured before run in and after 40 weeks of treatment. Compared with&#xD;
      placebo, the use of spironolactone resulted in large reductions in LV mass and arterial&#xD;
      stiffness (pulse wave velocity, augmentation index and aortic distensibility). This trial has&#xD;
      been well received and widely publicised. In a recent review, Pitt stated that &quot;we can be&#xD;
      cautiously optimistic that use of an MRB in addition to an ACE inhibitor or an ARB will&#xD;
      reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with CKD, as well as prevent its progression to&#xD;
      end-stage renal disease with all of its health-care and health-cost consequences&quot;. Thus, this&#xD;
      old and inexpensive drug has the potential to reduce adverse cardiovascular events and&#xD;
      mortality in early stage CKD, a risk factor that is now screened for routinely in primary&#xD;
      care by measurement of eGFR in the United Kingdom population. In the CRIB-2 trial, systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure was significantly reduced; spironolactone is well recognised as an effective&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive agent for patients with hypertension, even when this is resistant to other&#xD;
      drugs. It is therefore necessary to determine whether the improvements in arterial stiffness&#xD;
      and LV mass that occurred with spironolactone were mediated by this effect. Furthermore,&#xD;
      before a large scale clinical trial of spironolactone can be contemplated, it is necessary to&#xD;
      demonstrate that spironolactone can be used safely in a multi-centre trial design with local&#xD;
      monitoring of renal function and serum potassium. This study will provide the pilot data on&#xD;
      efficacy (independent of blood pressure) and safety that are necessary to undertake a&#xD;
      definitive phase III trial of the role of spironolactone in reducing cardiovascular morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality in patients with early stage CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial started recruitment in June 2014, and aimed to recruit 350 patients over a 2 year&#xD;
      period. The study was originally planned to be complete by February 2017. The rate of&#xD;
      recruitment however was much slower than anticipated and it became evident by November 2015&#xD;
      that it would take a further 2 years to reach this target. This period of time was greater&#xD;
      than funding allowed and the decision was taken to change the study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial design of the study was to use a co-primary end point of change in LV mass and&#xD;
      change in pulse wave velocity. A sample size of 350 patients was planned to give 90% power to&#xD;
      detect a difference in PWV with a p value of 0.025 and &gt;90% power to detect a change in LV&#xD;
      mass. When it became evident that was not achievable within the funded time frame the study&#xD;
      was re-designed using the single end point of change in LV mass. With a p value of 0.05 and a&#xD;
      power of 85%, it was calculated that 63 patients per group would be required. The sample size&#xD;
      was calculated at 150 patients allowing for a 15% rate of missing data. This allowed a&#xD;
      smaller sample size which was achievable within the funded time frame.&#xD;
