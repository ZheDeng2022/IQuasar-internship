  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In geriatric departments, physicians are faced with two difficulties, first the increasing&#xD;
      number of infections caused by multiresistant bacteria, especially extended spectrum&#xD;
      β-lactamase (ESBL) producing enterobacteria strains and second, the poor venous access&#xD;
      frequently encountered in elderly population. Giving antibiotics subcutaneously would be an&#xD;
      interesting alternative, all the more as intramuscular injection is contraindicated in case&#xD;
      the of anticoagulant therapy. Unfortunately, few data are available about subcutaneous (SC)&#xD;
      administration. Ertapenem is a recent long-acting parenteral carbapenem indicated especially&#xD;
      in the treatment of ESBL infection. Its subcutaneously administration has been tested in&#xD;
      several studies in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and internal medicine wards with promising&#xD;
      results regarding clinical and pharmacokinetics data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative to the IV Ertapenem administration is needed because of poor venous access and&#xD;
      behavioural abnormalities commonly present in infected elderly population. Ertapenem is&#xD;
      currently SC administrated in geriatric departments if no other option is available. Moreover&#xD;
      elderly patients often present several comorbdities, polymedication, renal insufficiency,&#xD;
      cachexia which may disturb antibiotics pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to obtain pharmacokinetic data of SC and IV Ertapenem administration&#xD;
      in elderly population, obtain PK/PD parameters adapted to time-dependent antibiotics (T%&gt;MIC)&#xD;
      and descriptive data of occurrence of adverse effects and evolution of signs of infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ESBL infection incidence increases especially in elderly population (Observatoire National de&#xD;
      l'Epidémiologie de la Résistance Bactérienne aux Antibiotiques (ONERBA) www.onerba.org). SC&#xD;
      antibiotic route is sometimes the only option available for infected elderly patients&#xD;
      (delirium, dementia or no venous access) and presents advantages like greater patient&#xD;
      comfort, less nursing time and decrease hospital duration. Ertapenem has a relatively long&#xD;
      half life (4 hours) compared to imipenem (1 hour) and a less broad spectrum. Two studies&#xD;
      compared the ertapenem pharmacokinetics regarding IV or SC administration. The first&#xD;
      concerned 6 patients admitted in ICU and the second 16 patients in internal medicine&#xD;
      department. They found IV and SC administrations were equivalent considering that ertapenem&#xD;
      antimicrobial activity was time dependent. In fact, a reduction of peak concentration and of&#xD;
      time to peak concentration was observed in both studies, but the Area Under the Curve were&#xD;
      similar especially the time spent over the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration. Both studies did&#xD;
      not observe any severe adverse effects. Because of these promising results and despite not&#xD;
      being approved yet, SC Ertapenem, is commonly used in geriatric department. This&#xD;
      administration route is chosen when no other option is available, for instance in cases of&#xD;
      behavioural disturbance and lack of venous access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the investigators study is to confirm the pharmacokinetics data in elderly&#xD;
      population known to present frequently renal insufficiency and denutrition and to document&#xD;
      the occurrence of adverse effects and clinical evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients over 75 receiving ertapenem for 48 hours (IV or SC) will be included. Ertapenem&#xD;
      concentrations (H0, H+0.5h and H+2.5h) will be determined at steady state and described based&#xD;
      on administration route. Systemic and local adverse effects will be collected during the&#xD;
      treatment and infection evolution will be described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored during ertapenem treatment and for 45 days after the beginning of&#xD;
      the treatment. Biological data will be obtained initially at inclusion (D3 after ertapenem&#xD;
      beginning) and for 14 days (+/-10) after the beginning of the treatment (corresponding to end&#xD;
      of treatment). Signs of infection evolution will be also monitored for 45 days (+/-10).&#xD;
