      To assess the efficacy and safety of 10% Cocamide DEA and Lyclear creme rinse (permethrin1%)&#xD;
      in the eradication of head lice. To assess the ability of each product to kill all viable ova&#xD;
      and to assess patient acceptability of the product in use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A formulation of cocamide diethanolamine (DEA) surfactant was previously reported as showing&#xD;
      efficacy to eliminate head louse infestation. This study has been designed to test those data&#xD;
      using a new formulation of 10% cocamide DEA in an aqueous basis in comparison with the&#xD;
      standard of care product 1% permethrin creme rinse. It is believed that surfactants like&#xD;
      cocamide DEA are capable of eliminating lice resistant to conventional insecticides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A planned total of 120 patients who, following examination, are found to suffer from active&#xD;
      head lice infestation will be recruited to the trial. The patient will be treated with the&#xD;
      appropriate product according to the randomization code from a pre-prepared listing in&#xD;
      balanced blocks of 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10% Cocamide DEA is applied directly to dry hair and is washed off with shampoo after 60&#xD;
      minutes. Permethrin 1% creme rinse is applied to shampooed and towel dried hair and left in&#xD;
      situ for 10 minutes, then rinsed off with clean water. Treatments will be applied by&#xD;
      experienced investigators throughout the study. Assessments will be made by other&#xD;
      investigators unaware of the treatment regimen used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment (day 0), follow up assessments will be performed on days 4, 7,10 then again&#xD;
      at day 14 after which they will leave the study. Any adverse events or side effects from the&#xD;
      treatments will be monitored during the study.&#xD;
