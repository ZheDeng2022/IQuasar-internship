  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The adipose (fat) cells under the skin are where individuals store excess fat. The more&#xD;
      excess fat they have, the more &quot;strain&quot; they put on these cells which then get bigger and&#xD;
      don't work as well as they should. Having some fat under the skin is important. People who&#xD;
      have a genetic defect which results in them having almost no fat under their skin have a very&#xD;
      high risk of a condition called insulin resistance (where the body does not respond as well&#xD;
      to insulin and blood sugar levels rise). This can lead to diabetes and heart disease despite&#xD;
      them not being overweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientists have only recently started to understand the importance of fat in insulin&#xD;
      resistance and how people unable to store fat very well can have insulin resistance despite&#xD;
      not being obese. The investigators have also recently discovered that small changes in a&#xD;
      person's genetic code (their body's instruction manual) may also affect their ability to&#xD;
      store fat and would like to explore this in more detail. To do this, they will recruit&#xD;
      volunteers from the Exeter 10,000 study who gave permission to contact them about further&#xD;
      research. The investigators will collect detailed body size measures and blood samples taken&#xD;
      before and after a special drink that is high in fat (similar to a thick milk shake), then&#xD;
      compare the results between people with and without the particular genetic changes of&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowing more about these genetic changes and how fat cells work could help to improve&#xD;
      understanding about why some people develop diabetes and heart disease despite a relatively&#xD;
      normal BMI.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals carrying different genetic variations have different abilities to store fat under&#xD;
      the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To improve understanding of &quot;adipose tissue dysfunction&quot; using human genetics, and&#xD;
      demonstrate that lipid uptake into fat cells is compromised in subjects with 'polygenetic&#xD;
      lipodystrophy' alleles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify individuals with genetic risk variants of interest and controls matched for&#xD;
           gender, age and BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Undertake detailed physiological assessments including an Oral Triglyceride Tolerance&#xD;
           Test (OTTT) (blood samples before and after a fatty drink), detailed body size measures&#xD;
           and an optional fat biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using the samples collected, test whether or not individuals carrying a high genetic&#xD;
           load of &quot;polygenic lipodystrophy&quot; alleles:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. have larger subcutaneous fat cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. have higher circulating lipid levels 4 hours after a fatty meal challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. have a gene expression profile normally associated with obesity, despite being of&#xD;
                the same BMI as matched controls. This profile includes a downregulation of genes&#xD;
                involved in fatty acid trafficking and an upregulation of genes involved in&#xD;
                inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. have higher insulin resistance as measured by HOMAIR (calculated from fasting&#xD;
                insulin and fasting glucose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is the most common chronic metabolic disease and is a major source of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. It is one of the biggest healthcare challenges facing the UK NHS with more than&#xD;
      2.6 million adults diagnosed in the UK, with the vast majority (90%) having type 2 Diabetes&#xD;
      (T2D). It is anticipated the numbers will continue to rise, in part due to the increasing&#xD;
      levels of obesity in the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T2D is characterised by high blood glucose levels in the context of increasing insulin&#xD;
      resistance and reduced beta cell function, and this can develop over several years with&#xD;
      individuals unaware of the problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research groups in Exeter are leading efforts to identify the genetic factors that influence&#xD;
      why some people develop T2D despite relative leanness, whilst many obese people do not get&#xD;
      the disease. The investigators have identified many such factors but now wish to study them&#xD;
      in more detail to understand the role of insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adipose tissue dysfunction Working with collaborators as part of ongoing genetic studies, the&#xD;
      investigators have identified several genetic variations (DNA changes) associated with&#xD;
      insulin resistance, and believe some of these genetic variants operate primarily through&#xD;
      adipose tissue &quot;dysfunction&quot;. Adipose tissue dysfunction is a relatively new concept and has&#xD;
      resulted from detailed physiological studies that have revealed that obese individuals have&#xD;
      larger fat cells, more inflamed fat tissue (often infiltrated with macrophages) poorer&#xD;
      adipose tissue blood flow pre/post meal, and differential expression of genes involved in&#xD;
      these processes (Alkhouli 2013). The failure of adipocytes, resulting in a limited capacity&#xD;
      to take up free fatty acids (FFA), predispose to ectopic fat depositions which is a&#xD;
      deposition of lipids in sites such as the liver, muscle with more omental tissue similar to&#xD;
      subjects with lipodystrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are trying to understand how genetic variations cause differences in&#xD;
      people's ability to store fat and wish to test the hypothesis that individuals carrying&#xD;
      different genetic variations have different abilities to store fat under the skin as&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat tissue. This could lead to an improved understanding of subcutaneous fat&#xD;
      storage. It is very unlikely that the rising numbers of people becoming overweight or obese&#xD;
      as they age will be substantially reversed, therefore the study's findings could be important&#xD;
      in identifying how to reduce the risk of disease caused by obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective &quot;recruit by genotype&quot; cohort study that will take place over a 2 year&#xD;
      period (2015 to 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be identified from existing research cohorts managed by the NIHR Exeter&#xD;
      Clinical Research Facility (Exeter CRF) and recruitment will be facilitated within the Exeter&#xD;
      CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under over-arching ethical approval 09/H0106/75, approximately 7500 anonymised DNA samples&#xD;
      have been genotyped for genetic variants related to insulin production. These variants occur&#xD;
      in &gt;1% of the population and have no direct consequences to individual health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no defined cut-off for having, or not having, polygenic lipodystrophy as it is not&#xD;
      based on a single genetic variant. People will have between 0 and 22 polygenic lipodystrophy&#xD;
      alleles and the investigators are looking for those with a combination of at least 11 genetic&#xD;
      variants. They have identified approx 300 people in the EXTEND cohort who fit this criteria&#xD;
      and will then recruit matched controls from those in the EXTEND cohort who have been&#xD;
      identified as having the fewest number of risk alleles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will provide the Exeter Clinical Research Facility (Exeter CRF) with a list&#xD;
      of the sample numbers that have been identified as having the Individuals identified with the&#xD;
      &quot;polygenic lipodystrophy&quot; genetic variants of interest, together with control individuals&#xD;
      carrying the average number of risk alleles. The Exeter CRF Data Manager will then identify&#xD;
      50 individuals with the variants and 50 individuals matched for age, gender, diabetes status&#xD;
      and BMI, who will be invited to a 5-hour visit to the Exeter CRF for data and sample&#xD;
      collection. Interested participants will be contacted directly by a member of the study team&#xD;
      who will be responsible for the recruitment process, providing more detailed verbal and&#xD;
      written project-specific information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to refrain from strenuous exercise and from eating very fatty&#xD;
      meals in the 48 hours prior to coming in to the clinic, and no alcohol (it has high energy&#xD;
      content and affects the liver) but otherwise normal diet, then fast overnight prior to&#xD;
      attending a morning visit at the Exeter CRF. Participants will be asked to sign a written&#xD;
      consent form prior to any data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline data including Ht (m), Wt (kg), Waist (cm) and Hip (cm) circumference will be&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detailed body fat measures will be obtained from the BOD POD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin fold measurements (mm) from biceps, triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history: including current medications and lifestyle information (smoking/alcohol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BODPOD TM :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed body composition measures will be obtained using the Body Composition Tracking&#xD;
      System. This briefly comprises a BOD POD machine, electronic scales, and a computer. It uses&#xD;
      the principles of body densitometry (measuring mass and volume) to calculate the&#xD;
      participant's percentage and absolute amounts of fat and fat free mass. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to wear minimal clothing (e.g. swimming costume) and a close fitting swim hat. They&#xD;
      stand on the electric scales to record their weight which is then calibrated with the BOD&#xD;
      POD. Participants are asked to sit inside the BOD POD up to 1 minute at a time (max 3 times).&#xD;
      The computer will then analyse and generate the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Triglyceride Tolerance Test (OTTT) (approx. 4 hours):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small cannula (thin plastic tube) will be inserted into a vein following standard clinical&#xD;
      practice to minimize any potential trauma from repeat blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting samples (at -5 and -2 minutes) will be obtained for baseline measures (including&#xD;
           routine glucose and lipid measurement) plasma and serum for storage and future batched&#xD;
           analysis, and pre-OTTT measures of glucose, insulin, standard lipids, and stored plasma&#xD;
           for potential future metabolomic or lipidomic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following the initial fasting blood sampling, the participant will be asked to drink&#xD;
           approx 150 mls of Fresubin 5cal shot supplement drink over a 5 min period. The time of&#xD;
           completion will be noted as T= 0. Further blood samples will be obtained at T=30, 60,&#xD;
           120, 180 and 240 minutes post-ingestion. The calorific content and proportion of&#xD;
           macronutrients in Fresubin is very similar to that described in publications performing&#xD;
           the OTTT (Karamanos 2001; Carstensen 2003; Mohanlal 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of this period the cannula will be removed and the participant will be offered a&#xD;
      light lunch/refreshments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional abdominal fat biopsies (approx. 30 mins and undertaken during OTTT):&#xD;
&#xD;
      For research volunteers that are happy to undergo a small fat biopsy, a sample of abdominal&#xD;
      fat will be obtained by firstly injecting some local anaesthetic into an accessible area of&#xD;
      the abdomen. Using a scalpel, a small incision (approx 2-3 cm) will be made to a depth of&#xD;
      approx 15mm and two small pea-sized samples of fat will be removed. The wound will be closed&#xD;
      with simple sutures or steristrips. One fat sample will be flash frozen in liquid nitrogen&#xD;
      immediately after excision and stored at minus 80 degrees for RNA analyses. The other sample&#xD;
      will be stored in formalin for later immunohistochemistry staining.&#xD;
