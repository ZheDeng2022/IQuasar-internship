    <textblock>
      TRX-818 is a new small molecule chemical entity being developed as a potential anti-cancer&#xD;
      therapeutic by TaiRx, Inc. TRX-818 is a potent anti-cancer agent in numerous human cancer&#xD;
      cell lines. The objectives of this study are to determine the safety profile of TRX-818&#xD;
      including identification of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
      determine the recommended dose and regimen(s) to initiate Phase 2.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Tumor eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Histologically confirmed advanced malignancies refractory to standard of care therapy,&#xD;
             or for whom no standard of care therapy is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Solid tumors must have measurable or evaluable disease as per Response Evaluation&#xD;
             Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v. 1.1). Target lesions that have been previously&#xD;
             irradiated will not be considered measurable (lesion) unless increase in size is&#xD;
             observed following completion of radiation therapy. Leukemia, lymphomas and multiple&#xD;
             myeloma must have measurable disease as per response criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female or male, 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2. Resolution of all acute&#xD;
             toxic effects of prior therapy or surgical procedures to grade 1 (except alopecia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Adequate organ function as defined by the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and serum alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤3 x&#xD;
                  upper limit of normal (ULN), or AST and ALT ≤5 x ULN if liver function&#xD;
                  abnormalities are due to underlying malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN (except for patients with documented Gilbert's&#xD;
                  syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1500/µL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets &gt;= 90,000/µL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine ≤2.0 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the patient (or legally&#xD;
             acceptable representative) has been informed of all the pertinent aspects of the trial&#xD;
             prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory&#xD;
             tests, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients presenting with any of the following will not be included in the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Major surgery, radiation therapy, or systemic anti-cancer therapy within 4 weeks of&#xD;
             starting study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior high-dose chemotherapy requiring hematopoietic stem cell rescue except for&#xD;
             patients with lymphoma or myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current treatment on another clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Brain metastases, spinal cord compression, carcinomatous meningitis, or leptomeningeal&#xD;
             disease unless appropriately treated and neurologically stable for at least 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any of the following within the 12 months prior to starting study treatment:&#xD;
             myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass&#xD;
             graft, congestive heart failure, or cerebrovascular accident including transient&#xD;
             ischemic attack; within 6 months prior to starting study treatment for pulmonary&#xD;
             embolus. However, upon agreement between the investigator and sponsor, the 6 month&#xD;
             post-event-free period for a patient with a pulmonary embolus can be waived if due to&#xD;
             advanced cancer. Appropriate treatment with anticoagulants is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Hypertension that cannot be controlled by medications (&gt;150/100 mmHg despite optimal&#xD;
             medical therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Current treatment with therapeutic doses of warfarin (low dose warfarin up to 2 mg Per&#xD;
             oral (PO) daily for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis is allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Known human immunodeficiency virus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Female patients must be surgically sterile or be&#xD;
             postmenopausal, or must agree to the use of effective contraception during the period&#xD;
             of therapy. All female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test (serum or urine) prior to enrollment. Male patients must be surgically&#xD;
             sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The&#xD;
             definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal&#xD;
             investigator or a designated associate.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormalities that would impart, in the judgment of the investigator and/or sponsor,&#xD;
             excess risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, which&#xD;
             would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
