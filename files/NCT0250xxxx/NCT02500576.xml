  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving pembrolizumab with standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), and aldesleukin works in treating&#xD;
      patients with melanoma that has spread to other areas of the body. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine phosphate, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,&#xD;
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving an infusion of TIL, or white blood cells, may help&#xD;
      stimulate the immune system to help kill more cells. Aldesleukin may also stimulate the white&#xD;
      blood cells to kill melanoma cells. Giving pembrolizumab together with standard chemotherapy,&#xD;
      TIL, and high- or low-dose aldesleukin may help stop the melanoma from spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the overall response rates of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) combined with&#xD;
      lymphodepletion, TIL and high or low dose aldesleukin (interleukin-2) therapy in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Comparison of progression free survival between the treatment arms. II. Comparison of&#xD;
      overall survival between the treatment arms. III. Comparison of deep tumor responses (defined&#xD;
      as over 60% reduction in tumor burden) between the treatment arms as per Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Number of complete responses in both treatment arms. V. Safety evaluations by Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Identification of biomarkers predictive of treatment response or failure through&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, gene expression changes as assessed by NanoString&#xD;
      codeset, neo-antigen identification and complementary determining region (CDR)3 sequencing&#xD;
      from blood and tumor samples acquired from baseline and on-treatment samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive standard lymphodepleting chemotherapy comprising of cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -7 and -6 followed by fludarabine phosphate IV&#xD;
      piggyback (IVPB) over 15-30 minutes on days -5 to -1. Patients also receive therapeutic tumor&#xD;
      infiltrating lymphocytes IV over 15-60 minutes on day 0 followed by high-dose aldesleukin IV&#xD;
      over 15 minutes every 8-16 hours for up to 15 doses on days 1-5. Beginning between 21-28 days&#xD;
      after TIL infusion, patients receive maintenance therapy comprising of pembrolizumab IV over&#xD;
      30 minutes every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive standard lymphodepleting chemotherapy comprising of&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, fludarabine phosphate, and therapeutic tumor infiltrating lymphocytes as in&#xD;
      Arm I, followed approximately 6 hours later by low-dose aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) once&#xD;
      per day (QD) for 14 days. Patients also receive pembrolizumab as in Arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;

             subjects that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections&#xD;
             would not be excluded from the study; subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone&#xD;
             replacement or Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded from the study; subjects with&#xD;
             hypophysitis stable on physiologic dose of steroid will not be excluded from the study&#xD;

             [HBsAg] reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA]&#xD;
             [qualitative] is detected)&#xD;
