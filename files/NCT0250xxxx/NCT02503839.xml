  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is a global challenge and for the increasing epidemic of multi-drug&#xD;
      resistant (MDR)-TB there is restricted treatment options. This calls for research of new&#xD;
      immune-modulating treatment strategies that can strengthen the patients immune system to&#xD;
      better fight the TB bacteria. The pro-inflammatory, but still immunosuppressive mediator&#xD;
      prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is produced by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in inflamed infected tissue.&#xD;
      Studies from both human and animal models show that COX-2 inhibitors (COX-2i) can improve the&#xD;
      immune system and strengthen vaccines responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A hyperactive COX-2/PGE2 signal system in active TB causes down-regulated immune&#xD;
           responses that favour TB survival, but this can be abrogated by COX-2i.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. TB-specific immunisation with targeted antigens presented as a therapeutic TB vaccine&#xD;
           and enhanced by COX-2i will improve immune-mediated host clearance of TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Combinations of COX-2i and a therapeutic TB vaccine to conventional anti-TB chemotherapy&#xD;
           offer new treatment modalities for TB, including MDR/XDR-TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach to test the hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study design: 4-arm, open and randomized clinical intervention trial of patients&#xD;
           starting treatment for active TB in specialized Norwegian TB centres and where two arms&#xD;
           will receive the COX-2i etoricoxib with and without a TB vaccine, one arm vaccine only&#xD;
           and the last arm serve as control receiving only standard anti-TB therapy. For safety&#xD;
           precautions, only patients bearing sensitive TB strains are included and study arms will&#xD;
           be sequentially introduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In a mouse model examine in more detail the effects of reversion of chronic inflammation&#xD;
           with COX-2i locally in tissue and the interplay with TB vaccine responses, immune&#xD;
           regulation, correlates of protection and survival in a well-characterized model for&#xD;
           TB-exposed mice.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that treating TB patients with a therapeutic TB vaccine and COX-2&#xD;
      inhibiting drugs in addition to standard antibiotic TB therapy will improve the patients&#xD;
      immune system and boost TB vaccine responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will provide safety and immunogenicity data from a Norwegian phase 1 clinical&#xD;
      trial of the therapeutic TB vaccine candidate H56:IC31 and the COX-2i etoricoxib given to TB&#xD;
      patients together with standard TB antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also perform exploratory in-depth studies of immune regulatory&#xD;
      mechanisms and try to identify biomarkers for efficacy of treatment both in humans and in a&#xD;
      parallel mouse model. These results may further optimize the therapeutic strategy and prepare&#xD;
      for larger clinical trials and finally contribute to new treatment options for MDR-TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the safety and tolerability of etoricoxib given for 20 weeks (day 0-140) alone and&#xD;
           in combination with the therapeutic TB vaccine H56:IC31 given as two immunizations at&#xD;
           day 84 and day 140 in patients with active TB disease treated with conventional 26-week&#xD;
           anti-TB chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the immune effects of etoricoxib given for 20 weeks (day 0-140) on immune&#xD;
           regulation and TB vaccine (H56:IC31) immunogenicity in patients with active TB disease&#xD;
           treated with conventional 26-week anti-TB chemotherapy.&#xD;
