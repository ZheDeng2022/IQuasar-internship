    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of 8-chloroadenosine and to see&#xD;
      how well it works in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has returned after a&#xD;
      period of improvement (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as 8-chloroadenosine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (recommended phase II dose, RP2D) of&#xD;
      8-chloro-adenosine, when given as a single agent, in patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia. (Phase I) II. To assess tolerability and safety of 8-chloro-adenosine&#xD;
      at each dose level by evaluation of toxicities including: type, frequency, severity,&#xD;
      attribution, time course and duration. (Phase I) III. To estimate the response rate and to&#xD;
      evaluate the antitumor activity of 8-chloro-adenosine, when given as a single agent, as&#xD;
      assessed by complete remission rate (complete remission [CR] + complete remission with&#xD;
      incomplete blood count recovery [CRi]). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate for disease response to 8-chloro-adenosine in refractory/relapsed acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML) on each dose level tested. (Phase I) II. To obtain estimates of&#xD;
      remission duration and survival probabilities (overall and event-free). (Phase II) III. To&#xD;
      obtain an estimate of the overall response rate (CR + CRi + partial response [PR]). (Phase&#xD;
      II) IV. To summarize and evaluate toxicities by type, frequency, severity, attribution, time&#xD;
      course and duration. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the plasma, urinary and cellular pharmacokinetics of 8-chloro-adenosine and&#xD;
      metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the impact of 8-chloro-adenosine on cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#xD;
      pool in AML blasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the impact of 8-chloro-adenosine therapy on select short-lived messenger (m)&#xD;
      ribonucleic acids (RNAs) and corresponding proteins in circulating AML blasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To correlate clinical responses and toxicity with plasma/urine 8-chloro-adenosine level&#xD;
      (pharmacokinetic [PK]), cellular 8-chloro-ATP (PK) and cellular ATP pool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY EX-VIVO MOLECULAR OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the cytotoxicity of 8-chloro-adenosine toward leukemic progenitor cells in&#xD;
      vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To generate a preliminary pre-treatment RNA/micro RNA (miRNA) signature in leukemic&#xD;
      progenitor cells, and explore its possible association with in vitro cytotoxicity to&#xD;
      8-chloro-adenosine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore the possible association between the preliminary RNA/miRNA signature and&#xD;
      clinical response to 8-chloro-adenosine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive 8-chloro-adenosine intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1-5. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months for up to 2 years.&#xD;
