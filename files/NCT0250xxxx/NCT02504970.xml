      The Anesthesia Quality Institute (AQI) is home to the National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes&#xD;
      Registry (NACOR), a data warehouse that has been designated as a Qualified Clinical Data&#xD;
      Registry (QCDR) by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for Physician Quality&#xD;
      Reporting System (PQRS) reporting. With 20 million cases and growing, Anesthesia Quality&#xD;
      Institute's clinical data provides an evidence-based rational that informs treatment choices&#xD;
      and helps control treatment costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry is intended for all anesthesia providers&#xD;
      caring for patients. The registry provides participating providers with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Custom continuous performance monitors Performance gap analysis and patient outlier&#xD;
      identification Access to improvement interventions to close performance gaps including&#xD;
      patient care management tools, targeted education, resources and other evidence based&#xD;
      interventions Registry and peer-to-peer benchmarks&#xD;

      The Anesthesia Quality Institute is home to the National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes&#xD;

      the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for Physician Quality Reporting System&#xD;
      reporting. With 20 million cases and growing, Anesthesia Quality Institute's clinical data&#xD;
      provides an evidence-based rational that informs treatment choices and helps control&#xD;

&#xD;
      National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry is intended for all anesthesia providers&#xD;
      caring for patients. The registry provides participating providers with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Custom continuous performance monitors Performance gap analysis and patient outlier&#xD;

      interventions Registry and peer-to-peer benchmarks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have unlimited access to National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry to&#xD;
      identify opportunities to improve anesthesia clinical care. Reports allow participants to&#xD;
      immediately identify gaps in specific quality measures and focus efforts to close those gaps.&#xD;
      Performance tracking reports capture trends over time and help measure improvements in&#xD;
      quality care. National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry also provides participants with&#xD;
      access to national benchmarking reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Outliers&#xD;
&#xD;
      National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry participants can also improve care by&#xD;
      reviewing performance results across their patient population. This information helps to&#xD;
      address clinical gaps in a timely manner. Consider and choose interventions that can lead to&#xD;
      sustainable practice improvement for your aggregate performance, which can help reduce the&#xD;
      number of patient outliers in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement&#xD;
&#xD;
      National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry identifies possible interventions for&#xD;
      improvement based on clinical quality gaps found through calculating selected data. Data can&#xD;
      be used to review performance and determine quickly the impact of an improvement&#xD;
      intervention. Results are presented graphically to identify trends in performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry is approved by Centers for Medicare and&#xD;
      Medicaid Services as a Qualified Clinical Data Registry . A Qualified Clinical Data Registry&#xD;
      is a registry comprised of Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) and/or non Physician&#xD;
      Quality Reporting System-approved measures which qualifies as a Centers for Medicare and&#xD;
      Medicaid Services-approved reporting tool for Physician Quality Reporting System. Previously,&#xD;
      physician anesthesiologists were limited to reporting three measures to Physician Quality&#xD;
      Reporting System. National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry has more than a dozen&#xD;
      additional anesthesia-related measure--helping eligible professionals satisfactorily report&#xD;
      on outcomes that matter to them and their patients, and more easily meet Physician Quality&#xD;
      Reporting System requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualified Clinical Data Registry reporting services are included in American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) membership, and all Eligible Professionals may participate through&#xD;
      American Society of Anesthesiologists membership. Non-member physicians and non-physicians&#xD;
      must pay additional fees. All eligible professionals using Qualified Clinical Data Registry&#xD;
      reporting services must be a member of National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steps for becoming a National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry participant&#xD;
&#xD;
      National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry participants range from pen-and-paper&#xD;
      anesthesiology practices to the most wired academic centers. You do not need an AIMS system&#xD;
      or electronic health records to participate. Anesthesia Quality Institute will help&#xD;
      facilitate the contribution of desired data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry allows for close collaboration between&#xD;
      Anesthesia Quality Institute, individual providers and healthcare technology vendors. Roles&#xD;
      are defined as follows:&#xD;
