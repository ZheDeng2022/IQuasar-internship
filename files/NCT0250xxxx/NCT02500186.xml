  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this clinical study is to assess the effect of the amount of carbohydrate&#xD;
      intake and meals differing in glycemic index (GI) in patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      treated with an SGLT2 inhibitor (Luseogliflozin), which inhibits glucose reabsorption from&#xD;
      renal uriniferous tubule, on glucose variability by using continuous glucose monitoring&#xD;
      (CGM), and to establish dietary therapy which reduces the risk of hypoglycemia in patients&#xD;
      treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. In addition, blood and urine samples are collected for&#xD;
      metabolome analysis that will be performed as an extension study of the clinical study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &lt;Background and Rationale&gt; In order to decrease the risk of hypoglycemia caused by SGLT2&#xD;
      inhibitor, it is necessary to review the effect of the volume of carbohydrate intake and the&#xD;
      level of GI value on variation of blood glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, if a patient with chronic lack of carbohydrate intake receives SGLT2 inhibitors, there&#xD;
      is a risk of serious hypoglycemic reaction. Thus, the establishment of proper meal for&#xD;
      patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors is the urgent task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to establish a safe dietary therapy for patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus to avoid hypoglycemia by controlling carbohydrate intake volume and GI&#xD;
      value, where study patients are provided study meal three times a day and circadian blood&#xD;
      glucose variation including blood glucose after meal is measured by using CGM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, blood and urine samples are collected for the future research (metabolome&#xD;
      analysis) on the effect of carbohydrate intake volume and GI value on metabolism to be&#xD;
      conducted as an extended study of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Study Procedures&gt; Total of 24 study patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have not&#xD;
      taken or washed out hypoglycemic drug (oral hypoglycemic drug and glucagon like peptide-1&#xD;
      receptor agonist) for at least 4 weeks are randomized into 3 groups (8 patients each) of high&#xD;
      GI meal containing 55% carbohydrate group, low GI meal containing 55% carbohydrate group, and&#xD;
      high GI meal containing 40% carbohydrate group. The energy intake of study patients in all&#xD;
      the groups is 1800 kcal per day. Each study group patient takes the following diets for 14&#xD;
      days; study patients in high GI meal containing 55% carbohydrate group take 55% carbohydrate&#xD;
      white rice diet; those in low GI meal containing 55% carbohydrate group take 55% carbohydrate&#xD;
      brown rice diet; those in high GI meal containing 40% carbohydrate group take 40%&#xD;
      carbohydrate white rice diet. Study patients orally receive luseogliflozin 2.5 mg s.i.d.&#xD;
      before breakfast for 7 days from the 8th day of starting the study meal to the 14th day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned examinations are conducted at the initiation of the study meal, the initiation of the&#xD;
      study treatment, and the completion of the clinical study. Blood glucose is measured on 4&#xD;
      days from the 3rd day of the initiation of the study meal to pre-dose of study treatment and&#xD;
      from 2 days before study treatment completion to the next day of study treatment so that&#xD;
      blood glucose data of continuous 48 hours at one time can be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Time and process of getting informed consents&gt; Principal investigator or sub-investigator&#xD;
      fully explains the clinical study to candidate patients using informed consent form approved&#xD;
      by the Institutional Review Board prior to the study procedure and obtains written informed&#xD;
      consent from subjects on voluntary basis after confirming that patients duly understand the&#xD;
      content of the clinical study. Principal investigator or sub-investigator who gives&#xD;
      explanation to patients and study patients affix a name and seal or give a signature and&#xD;
      enter the date on the informed consent form. If study collaborator gives supplementary&#xD;
      explanation, the collaborator also affixes a name and seal or give a signature and enter the&#xD;
      date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal investigator or sub-investigator provided the copy of the informed consent form to&#xD;
      study patients who gave informed consent to participate in the clinical study and record&#xD;
      them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal investigator or sub-investigator documents the date of informed consent on case&#xD;
      report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Screening Examination&gt; The eligibility for the clinical study of candidate patients who gave&#xD;
      written informed consent are judged through the following examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidate patients undergo screening examinations between 28 days and one day before the&#xD;
      initiation of test meal (if the patient takes one hypoglycemic drug, between 28 days and one&#xD;
      day before the initiation of washout).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic background: date of birth, race, sex, disease duration of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, drug and therapy used for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus within 3 months&#xD;
      prior to the study procedure, complications / medical history, concomitant drug / therapy,&#xD;
      drinking / smoking status, height / weight / BMI Examination item: physical examination,&#xD;
      measurement of body fluid volume (by impedance method), clinical laboratory tests, vital&#xD;
      signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature) &lt;Statistical Analysis&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics Efficacy analysis set and Safety analysis&#xD;
           set are used for the analysis. For discrete values, frequency is summarized by group;&#xD;
           for continuous data, summary statistics is calculated. Comparison between groups is also&#xD;
           conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analysis of primary endpoint (Efficacy endpoint) Efficacy analysis set is used for the&#xD;
           analysis. Summary statistics of blood glucose level by using CGM is calculated.&#xD;
           Comparison between groups is also conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analysis of Secondary endpoint (Safety endpoint or efficacy endpoint) Safety analysis&#xD;
           set and Efficacy analysis set are used for the analysis and the followings are&#xD;
           summarized and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For discrete values of clinical laboratory tests and vital signs, frequency is&#xD;
           summarized by group; for continuous data, summary statistics is calculated by group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Summary statistics of adverse event is calculated by group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Significance level of test and confidence coefficient of confidence interval Tests are&#xD;
           two-sided with the significance level of 5%. Confidence intervals are estimated with&#xD;
           coefficient of 95%. &lt;Sample size&gt; Determination of sample size 24 patients (8 for each&#xD;
           group) The sample size is 8 patients for each group because the size is operable and&#xD;
           appropriate for analysis for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;Action to be taken to study patients when an adverse event occurs&gt; If an adverse event is&#xD;
      observed, principal investigator or sub-investigator provides treatment or follow-up to the&#xD;
      study patients until the patient recovers from the adverse event or the follow-up is judged&#xD;
      to be unneccesary by medically explainable reason. If follow-up examination, additional&#xD;
      examination, or re-examination is necessary, they are conducted after obtaining the study&#xD;
      patient's informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal investigator or sub-investigator documents the name of adverse event, date of&#xD;
      occurrence, intensity, seriousness, study drug adjustment, treatment for the adverse event,&#xD;
      outcome, date of outcome, and relationship with the clinical study. For an adverse event&#xD;
      which is observed from the initiation of the study drug administration to follow-up&#xD;
      examination, the relationship with the study drug is also documented.&#xD;
