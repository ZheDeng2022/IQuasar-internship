      Part 1: to assess the safety and tolerability of pyrotinib and to define the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) of pyrotinib in patients with Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2&#xD;
      (HER2)-positive advanced solid tumors (metastatic breast cancer, gastric cancer, or other&#xD;
      solid tumors that have no targeted agent as standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: to estimate the overall response rate (ORR) for patients with HER2-positive&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer (mBC) and HER2 mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated at&#xD;
      the RP2D (or MTD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose escalation study of repeated doses of pyrotinib in patients with&#xD;
      HER2-positive advanced solid tumors, including breast cancer, non small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of the trial is dose escalation and is designed to enroll 3 to 6 patients in each dose&#xD;
      group. Adverse events (AEs) will be assessed and monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
      Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) will be assessed from the first dose of study drug through day&#xD;
      28 in the first cycle of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of the trial will consist of two independent arms: arm A for HER2 positive mBC and arm&#xD;
      B for NSCLC with documented HER2 mutation will be investigated to further evaluate safety and&#xD;
      the preliminary effectiveness and clinical benefits of pyrotinib as a single agent.&#xD;
