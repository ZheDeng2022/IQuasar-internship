  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a clinic-based intervention designed to&#xD;
      reduce illness uncertainty for parents of children who have been recently diagnosed with&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed trial will test the efficacy of the parent-focused clinic-based Parent&#xD;
      Uncertainty Management Intervention (PUMI) to improve the outcomes of children newly&#xD;
      diagnosed with cancer and their parents. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      equivalent doses of either the PUMI or an Education/Support (ESO) group. Theoretically driven&#xD;
      by Mishel's model of illness uncertainty, the PUMI will teach parents about uncertainty&#xD;
      prevention and management through the use of medically-specific communication, information&#xD;
      management, and problem-solving skills via in-clinic sessions and an online portal. Parents&#xD;
      and children will complete measures online at baseline, 1-week, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month&#xD;
      follow-ups.&#xD;

    <description>Sessions in this condition aim to provide education on cancer etiology, medical treatments, side effects, potential short- and long-term effects of treatment and resources that are often helpful to parents of children with cancer. Information presented will be based upon, &quot;Young People with Cancer: A Handbook for Parents&quot;, a parent resource developed by the National Cancer Institute. Parents will also be provided with relevant educational brochures from COG. Each session will also include a structured set of questions that will facilitate discussion. All ESO interventionists will be trained in non-directive approaches including reflective listening. Content provided in the ESO sessions will offer valuable information to parents without providing the specific skills of the IMPACT.</description>
