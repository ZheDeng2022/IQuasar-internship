  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a growing problem, especially in children. It causes frequent wheezing, shortness&#xD;
      of breath, chest tightness, and cough. A cold that is caused by a virus (viral cold) can&#xD;
      sometimes make asthma symptoms worse. This study will help investigators learn about the way&#xD;
      colds are related to asthma attacks among children who need higher amounts of medications to&#xD;
      control their asthma. Investigators want to learn why viral colds sometimes cause asthma&#xD;
      attacks and other times do not by studying the immune system response in samples taken from&#xD;
      the nose and blood.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, longitudinal, nested case-control study designed to identify&#xD;
      changes in gene transcription predictive of and associated with asthma exacerbations in&#xD;
      children ages 6 to 17 years with difficult-to-control, exacerbation-prone asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed prospectively for the onset of a cold and a subsequent asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation. An internet-based asthma and cold symptom diary will be accessed by&#xD;
      participants using a hand-held device. When the participant reports development of a cold, a&#xD;
      clinic visit will be scheduled as soon as possible (within 48 hours of cold symptom onset) to&#xD;
      collect blood and nasal samples. A second clinic visit will occur 4-6 days from the onset of&#xD;
      cold symptoms to obtain samples after the initial cold, but prior to the use of systemic&#xD;
      corticosteroids. Participants will be followed for up to two colds or approximately 6 months&#xD;
      after Visit 0, whichever comes first.&#xD;
