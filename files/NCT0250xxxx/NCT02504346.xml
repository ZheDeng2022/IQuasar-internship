      Phase II, single-arm study to assess the safety and efficacy of AZD9291 (80 mg, orally, once&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single-arm study to assess the safety and efficacy of AZD9291 (80 mg,&#xD;
      orally, once daily) in second-line (or later) patients with EGFR mutation-positive, locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic NSCLC, who have progressed following treatment with an approved&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If feasible, subjects will have to provide a biopsy sample for molecular testing following&#xD;
      confirmed disease progression on the most recent treatment regimen. A second biopsy will be&#xD;
      sampled at progression on AZD9291, if feasible. Liquid biopsies will be sampled throughout&#xD;
      the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects should continue on study treatment until RECIST 1.1-defined progression or until a&#xD;
      treatment discontinuation criterion is met. There is no maximum duration of treatment as&#xD;
      subjects may continue to receive investigational product beyond RECIST 1.1 defined&#xD;
      progression as long as they are continuing to show clinical benefit, as judged by the&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
