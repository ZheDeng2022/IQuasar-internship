  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advanced heart failure affects nearly 6 million Americans, and less is known about how this&#xD;
      illness affects the 80% of heart failure patients who are 65 years and older because research&#xD;
      tends to focus on younger patients. Older patients with heart failure and their family&#xD;
      caregivers, rarely have access to palliative supportive care services because the disease is&#xD;
      unpredictable and palliative treatment may not be provided until after other medical&#xD;
      treatments have been tried. Investigators are studying whether palliative care provided when&#xD;
      advanced heart failure patients are still well will result in better quality of life, mood&#xD;
      and less symptom distress compared to usual or standard heart failure care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Determine whether ENABLE CHF-PC leads to higher advanced heart failure&#xD;
      patient-reported quality of life (QOL) and mood (depression/anxiety); and lower symptom&#xD;
      burden and resource use (e.g. hospital admissions and days, emergency visits) through 16&#xD;
      weeks post baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Hypothesis 1: Intervention participants will experience higher QOL and mood, and lower&#xD;
      symptom burden and resource use through 16 weeks post baseline compared with those receiving&#xD;
      usual HF care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Determine whether ENABLE CHF-PC leads to higher caregiver-reported QOL, mood&#xD;
      (anxiety/depression), and self-reported health and lower caregiver burden through 16 weeks&#xD;
      post baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Hypothesis 2: Intervention caregivers will report higher QOL, mood, and self-reported&#xD;
      health, and lower caregiver burden through 16 weeks post baseline.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline patient-reported Quality of Life (QOL) was measured on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) Clinical Summary Score, a heart failure-specific 23-item instrument. The KCCQ consists of 4 clinical domains: symptoms - frequency &amp; severity; Physical Limitation; Quality of Life and Social Limitation and captures the patient's perspective of heart failure. Clinical summary scores range from 0 to 100. Higher KCCQ scores indicate better perceived health status. KCCQ clinical summary scores greater than or equal to 50 indicate good QOL.</description>

        <title>Patient Quality of Life as Measured on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) Clinical Summary Score</title>
        <description>Baseline patient-reported Quality of Life (QOL) was measured on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) Clinical Summary Score, a heart failure-specific 23-item instrument. The KCCQ consists of 4 clinical domains: symptoms - frequency &amp; severity; Physical Limitation; Quality of Life and Social Limitation and captures the patient's perspective of heart failure. Clinical summary scores range from 0 to 100. Higher KCCQ scores indicate better perceived health status. KCCQ clinical summary scores greater than or equal to 50 indicate good QOL.</description>

          <description>Baseline patient-reported Quality of Life (QOL) was measured on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) Clinical Summary Score, a heart failure-specific 23-item instrument. The KCCQ consists of 4 clinical domains: symptoms - frequency &amp; severity; Physical Limitation; Quality of Life and Social Limitation and captures the patient's perspective of heart failure. Clinical summary scores range from 0 to 100. Higher KCCQ scores indicate better perceived health status. KCCQ clinical summary scores greater than or equal to 50 indicate good QOL.</description>

The PROMIS SF Global Health-10 measures general domains of health including physical, mental, and social health, symptoms, overall quality of life. Summed scores for PROMIS measures are converted to T scores with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 in the general US population; higher scores indicate better functioning.</description>

Higher KCCQ scores indicate better perceived health status. The KCCQ Symptom burden domain consists of 8 items and quantifies the frequency, severity and change over time with clinical symptoms in heart failure, including fatigue, shortness of breath, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and patients' edema/swelling. KCCQ symptom domain scores range from 0 to 100; A score of 50 is the threshold between unstable heart failure symptoms (&lt;50) or stable heart failure symptoms (&gt;=50).</description>
