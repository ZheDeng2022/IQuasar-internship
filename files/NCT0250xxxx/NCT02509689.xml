  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new technology called Global Z-Score Neurofeedback Technology (GZNT) has been identified&#xD;
      that can overcome an existing barrier to the use of neurofeedback as a treatment technique in&#xD;
      a military setting. Neurofeedback, or EEG Biofeedback, is a form of biofeedback that uses the&#xD;
      brain's own electrical activity as the training parameter. With sufficient practice, the&#xD;
      brain can learn to change its own activity through finely tuned feedback using computerized&#xD;
      sounds, graphs and animations. Previous attempts at using neurofeedback as a treatment&#xD;
      modality have been subject to a lack of standardization and have required significant&#xD;
      expertise on the part of the provider. This new GZNT technology allows neurofeedback to be&#xD;
      administered in a standardized and semi-automated fashion, which, if effective, will&#xD;
      represent a significant advance toward providing this promising treatment modality to Service&#xD;
      Members in a military or VA setting. This study will determine feasibility and preliminary&#xD;
      evidence of efficacy for this neurofeedback technology in a pilot study of soldiers with&#xD;
      medical issues associated with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). GZNT technology has the&#xD;
      potential to provide a cost-efficient, non-invasive/non-pharmacological approach to recovery&#xD;
      from impact and/or blast-induced brain injury, and holds promise to simultaneously address&#xD;
      emotional symptoms that are often a part of the post-concussion symptom picture.&#xD;

      Research Design: This will be a single group design, treatment effect and feasibility study&#xD;
      to demonstrate GZNT technology, examining electrocortical changes, and comparing&#xD;
      emotional/vocational functioning, and post concussive symptoms before and after intensive&#xD;
      GZNT treatment, and at three months follow-up. Up to 50 subjects with a history of traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury and persistent cognitive and emotional symptoms will be enrolled following&#xD;
      screening and baseline evaluation. Resting and event-related EEG (electroencephalograph)&#xD;
      recordings, a physiological stress evaluation, neuropsychological tests, self-report symptom&#xD;
      scales, and psychosocial/vocational functioning measures will be performed at each&#xD;
      evaluation. All subjects will receive the study treatment intervention. Subjects will be&#xD;
      scheduled to receive twenty treatment sessions of GZNT over a six week period, but will be&#xD;
      counted as having completed treatment if they attend fifteen or more sessions. At least&#xD;
      twenty-five subjects will need to complete treatment to meet statistical requirements for the&#xD;
      study hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures will include electrocortical indices under resting and mental task&#xD;
      states and will evaluate the degree of neuro-physiological and cortical functional&#xD;
      connectivity change following treatment as a proxy measure for neuroplastic response to the&#xD;
      GZNT training. Secondary outcomes will include physiological stress response (as an objective&#xD;
      measure of emotional regulation), neuropsychological test performance (as an objective&#xD;
      measure of cognition), and self-reported symptom and emotional well-being measures.&#xD;
      Feasibility outcomes will include number of visits completed within the six weeks, number and&#xD;
      reason for drop-outs, adverse event profiles, and patient satisfaction questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology/Technical: For this pilot study, the investigators will require twenty-five&#xD;
      patients to complete the study. The investigators will therefore recruit as many as are&#xD;
      necessary to achieve this goal, to a maximum of 50 patients. However, since this is a&#xD;
      feasibility study, the dropout rate and reasons for drop outs will be monitored and reported.&#xD;
      Completion of a minimum of fifteen study treatment visits will satisfy requirements for&#xD;
      &quot;study completion.&quot; (This is based on clinical experience data with this technology.)&#xD;
      Therefore, only those who complete fourteen or fewer sessions within the six week study&#xD;
      treatment time window will be counted as drop outs. The planned total number of study&#xD;
      sessions for the study will be twenty. Data analysis will be carried out on pre and post&#xD;
      metrics for the group who completed the trial, and secondary analyses will be carried out on&#xD;
      all subjects using an intention-to-treat paradigm, to evaluate feasibility, and acceptance of&#xD;
      this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from the Warrior Recovery Center, the Soldier Readiness Center,&#xD;
      and Evans Army Hospital Primary Care Clinics. Subjects will be pre-screened by signing an&#xD;
      initial consent and completing a preliminary set of self-report forms, followed by a review&#xD;
      of medical records in order to determine eligibility. Following eligibility determination,&#xD;
      full consent discussion will be held, and baseline evaluations will be completed and study&#xD;
      visits scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this pilot efficacy/feasibility study, all study subjects will receive the study&#xD;
      treatment intervention. Dose exposure will begin at 10 minutes of GZNT at the first session&#xD;
      and progress to a maximum of thirty minutes of training by the sixth or seventh visit, and&#xD;
      continue at thirty minutes per visit for the remainder of the study.&#xD;

    <description>The experimental intervention in this study, Global Z-Score Neurofeedback Training, is a non-pharmacological EEG Biofeedback training process using a specific new technology that allows for the training to be semi-automated and to train based on referencing EEG activity in 19 sites on the scalp, whilst comparing in real time to a database of non-clinical normative EEG data. Subjects will be scheduled to receive 20 treatment sessions of GZNT over a six-week period, aiming for four treatment visits per week, but allowing for some missed appointments due to holidays and duty obligations.&#xD;
Training will be conducted for a continuous time which will begin at 10 minutes in the first session, and progress to a maximum of 30 minutes by the sixth or seventh session, and then remain at 30 minutes of training per session for the remainder of the sessions.</description>
