  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, open-label, dose escalation and expansion, 2-part study to&#xD;
      determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose of Andes-1537 for Injection in&#xD;
      patients with advanced unresectable solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy or&#xD;
      for which no standard therapy is available.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 is a dose-escalation study to establish the maximum tolerated dose based on&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicities and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of&#xD;
      Andes-1537 for Injection in patients with advanced unresectable solid tumors that are&#xD;
      refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy is available. Part 2 is an&#xD;
      open-label, dose-expansion study to determine the safety, tolerability, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of Andes-1537 in patients with advanced solid tumors. In part 2, patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled and receive the recommended phase 2 dose established in part 1 based on the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy data.&#xD;

    Part 1 of the study was completed and the maximum tolerated dose determined. Part 2 of the&#xD;
