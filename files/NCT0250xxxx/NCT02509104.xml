  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the bioavailability of a FDC capsule&#xD;
      formulation of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride (0.5 milligram [mg]/0.2 mg) relative&#xD;
      to coadministration of one dutasteride 0.5 mg capsule and one tamsulosin HCl 0.2 mg tablet in&#xD;
      healthy male subjects in fed and fasted states. This is an open-label, randomized, single&#xD;
      dose, two-way crossover study enrolling healthy male subjects, split into fasted (Cohort 1)&#xD;
      and fed (Cohort 2) conditions. In both cohorts, one FDC capsule formulation of dutasteride&#xD;
      0.5 mg/tamsulosin HCl 0.2 mg will be administered in one treatment period and the&#xD;
      coadministration of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride in a different treatment period.&#xD;
      Each subject enrolled will be allowed to participate in only one cohort (i.e, will receive&#xD;
      treatment under fasted or fed conditions) and will participate in both treatment periods. The&#xD;
      two treatment periods will be separated by a minimum washout period of 28 days. The total&#xD;
      duration in the study for each subject will be approximately 2.5 months from screening to the&#xD;
      final follow-up visit.&#xD;
