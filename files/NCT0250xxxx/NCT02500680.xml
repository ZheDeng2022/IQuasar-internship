      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance, and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      MAS-1-Adjuvanted seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) (MER4101) with hemagglutinin&#xD;
      dose escalation compared to non-adjuvanted comparator IIV standard dose (SD) in healthy&#xD;
      adults and high dose (HD) IIV in ambulatory elderly subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Reduced HA dose IIV formulated in MAS-1 adjuvant (MER4101) has been shown under&#xD;
      Phase 1A to be safe, tolerable and demonstrated a more robust and durable immune response to&#xD;
      IIV over 6 months post-vaccination in healthy young adults 18 - 49 years of age compared to&#xD;
      SD IIV. Under phase 1B, the 9 µg/HA dose of IIV in 0.3 mL MAS-1 was safe and well tolerated&#xD;
      and immunogenically comparable to or better than 60 µg/HA HD IIV control over 3 to 6 months&#xD;
      post-vaccination than HD IIV control. It is anticipated that the increased total dose of 15&#xD;
      µg HA antigen administered concurrently to opposite arms in 2 doses of 7.5 µg/HA IIV in 0.25&#xD;
      mL MAS-1 adjuvant emulsion will be safe, well tolerated, and more immunogenic than 9 µg/HA&#xD;
      IIV in MAS-1, and will be more immunogenic when compared to HD IIV control in adults who are&#xD;
      65 years of age and older with the potential to provide better protection throughout the&#xD;
      influenza season.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study is a Phase 1A, 1B and 1B extension, randomized, double-blind, single-center,&#xD;
      clinical trial, in healthy adults (18-49 years old) and ambulatory elderly subjects (aged 65&#xD;
      years and older). Phase IA evaluated the safety, tolerability and hemagglutination inhibition&#xD;
      assay (HAI) antibody response to MER4101 at each of four escalating doses of seasonal&#xD;
      inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) hemagglutinin (HA) antigen with a fixed dose of a&#xD;
      water-in-oil emulsion adjuvant MAS-1 (Mercia Adjuvant System-1), compared with licensed,&#xD;
      unadjuvanted, standard dose (SD) of licensed inactivated trivalent influenza virus vaccine&#xD;
      (IIV). Phase IB evaluated the optimal dose of IIV in MAS-1 selected under phase IA for&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and HAI antibody response (from Phase 1A known to be 9 µg of HA antigen&#xD;
      in 0.3 mL dose of MAS-1 adjuvanted emulsion) in ambulatory elderly subjects compared to high&#xD;
      dose (HD) IIV. The Phase 1B extension will evaluate if the increased dose volume of MAS-1&#xD;
      (0.5 mL vs 0.3 mL) at the same 9 µg/HA adjuvanted IIV vaccine is safe, well tolerated and&#xD;
      immunogenic, and then whether the increased dose of 15 µg/HA in 0.5 mL MAS-1 is safe, well&#xD;
      tolerated and still more immunogenic in elderly subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of standard dose (SD) IIV to protect against seasonal influenza virus infection&#xD;
      in the elderly is less than vaccine efficacy observed in healthy young adults. The&#xD;
      MAS-1-adjuvanted influenza virus vaccine offers the potential for higher seroconversion and&#xD;
      seroprotection rates, hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers relative to&#xD;
      pre-vaccination HAI titers (GMFI), hemagglutinin (HA) antigen dose-sparing and&#xD;
      cross-protection against antigenically divergent viral strains, and importantly, prolonged&#xD;
      duration of protective immunity lasting up to at least 6 months post-vaccination in both the&#xD;
      general adult population and the elderly, thereby providing potentially protective immunity&#xD;
      throughout the influenza season. This study will determine if the adjuvanted vaccine&#xD;
      formulated with one or more of the reduced HA antigen doses is safe. The study will also&#xD;
      determine if it is likely to induce an improved HA antibody response (HAI) when compared to&#xD;
      SD IIV in healthy adults and HD IIV in elderly subjects. This trial will inform future&#xD;
      clinical trials in at-risk populations of older patients.&#xD;
