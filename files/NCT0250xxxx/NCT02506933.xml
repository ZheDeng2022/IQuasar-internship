    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies the safety and how well multi-peptide cytomegalovirus&#xD;
      (CMV)-modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine works in reducing CMV complications in patients&#xD;
      previously infected with CMV and are undergoing a donor hematopoietic cell transplant. CMV is&#xD;
      a virus that may reproduce and cause disease and even death in patients with lowered immune&#xD;
      systems, such as those undergoing a hematopoietic cell transplant. By placing 3 small pieces&#xD;
      of CMV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (the chemical form of genes) into a very safe, weakened&#xD;
      virus called MVA, the multi-peptide CMV-MVA vaccine may be able to induce immunity (the&#xD;
      ability to recognize and respond to an infection) to CMV. This may help to reduce both CMV&#xD;
      complications and reduce the need for antiviral drugs in patients undergoing a donor&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplant.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CMV-MVA Triplex (multi-peptide CMV-MVA vaccine)&#xD;
      in vaccinated hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients by assessing the following:&#xD;
      non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days post HCT, severe (grade 3-4) acute graft-versus-host&#xD;
      disease (GVHD) (aGVHD), and grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) (Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
      Adverse Events [CTCAE] 4.0) probably or definitely related to the vaccination within 2 weeks&#xD;
      from each vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if CMV-MVA Triplex reduces the frequency of CMV events defined as&#xD;
      reactivation or CMV disease in allogeneic CMV positive HCT recipients (HCT-R+).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize CMV reactivation and CMV disease in recipients of CMV-MVA Triplex compared&#xD;
      to placebo by assessing time-to viremia (defined as number of days from transplantation to&#xD;
      the date of &gt; 500 CMV gc/mL), duration of viremia, recurrence of viremia, incidence of late&#xD;
      CMV viremia/disease (&gt; 100 and =&lt; 360 days post HCT), use of antiviral drugs (triggered by&#xD;
      clinically significant viremia of &gt;= 1500 CMV gc/mL), cumulative number of CMV specific&#xD;
      antiviral treatment days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the impact of CMV-MVA Triplex on transplant related outcomes by assessing the&#xD;
      incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD), chronic GVHD (cGVHD), relapse, non-relapse mortality,&#xD;
      all-cause mortality, infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine 1) if CMV-MVA Triplex increases levels, function and kinetics of&#xD;
      CMV-specific T cell immunity in vaccinated compared to placebo treated human leukocyte&#xD;
      antigen (HLA) A*0201, CMV seropositive HCT-recipients, 2) to determine whether vaccination&#xD;
      induces adaptive natural killer (NK) cell population changes, and increase in the highly&#xD;
      cytotoxic memory killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily C, member 2 (NKG2C)+ NK cells,&#xD;
      and 3) to explore GVHD biomarkers and compare between the vaccine and placebo groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive multi-peptide CMV-MVA vaccine intramuscularly (IM) on days 28 and 56&#xD;
      post-HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive placebo IM on days 28 and 56 post-HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 1 year post-HCT.&#xD;
