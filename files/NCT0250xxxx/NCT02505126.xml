  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the efficacy of 1 week of tDCS (5 sessions) placebo in reducing alcohol&#xD;
      consumption within the 24 weeks following the treatment in non-abstinent patients with&#xD;
      alcohol use disorders versus placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      340 patients are expected and randomized in two groups: 170 patients with active tDCS and 170&#xD;
      patients with placebo tDCS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 : Patients will received one daily session (13:20:13) during 5 consecutive days:&#xD;
      current flows continuously twice for 13min with a rest interval (no stimulation) of 20 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 to 7 : Change from baseline to week 24 in Total Alcohol Consumption (TAC) and Number&#xD;
      of Heavy Drinking Days (HDD) will be evaluated in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation on alcohol consumption (daily drinking diary, alcohol craving and severity) and&#xD;
      other assessments like mood, quality of life, safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The co-primary outcome of change from baseline in total alcohol consumption AND reduction in&#xD;
      number of heavy drinking days at 6 months after treatment and its association with tDCS will&#xD;
      be analyzed under the intention-to-treat principle using a mixed model repeated measures (8&#xD;
      times).&#xD;
