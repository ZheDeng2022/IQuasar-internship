  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) is characterized by repeated episodes of airway&#xD;
      obstruction while sleeping. Upper airway obstruction while sleeping leads to a dramatic&#xD;
      decrease in oxygen saturation and to hypoxemia finally, in which consequence the patient&#xD;
      rapidly awake. Clinical signs are sleepiness and functional cognitive deficits. The Gold&#xD;
      standard therapy is &quot;continuous positive airway pressure&quot; ventilation during sleep. However,&#xD;
      the success depends strongly to the patient´s compliance. Surgical treatment is an&#xD;
      alternative option, which could be considered if clinical success failed. A comparison of the&#xD;
      cognitive function of both therapies is not yet analyzed. The study addresses the question&#xD;
      which of this treatment options is favorable regarding cognitive function and outcome.&#xD;

      Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) is characterized by repeated episodes of airway&#xD;
      obstruction while sleeping. The &quot;Apnea-hypopnea index&quot; (AHI) defined as events per hour,&#xD;
      gives information about the severity of the disease. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine&#xD;
      Task Force&quot; defined that more than 5 episodes per hour is strongly suspect for an OSAS&#xD;
      disease. Upper airway obstruction while sleeping leads to a dramatic decrease in oxygen&#xD;
      saturation and to hypoxemia finally, in which consequence the patient rapidly awake. The&#xD;
      prevalence rise with age and about 20% of the population is suspect to a sleep disorder.&#xD;
      However about 1-5% of male and about 0,5-2% of female aged adults are affected. Main reason&#xD;
      is obesity. Clinical signs are sleepiness and functional cognitive deficits. The Gold&#xD;
      standard therapy is &quot;continuous positive airway pressure&quot; ventilation during sleep. However,&#xD;
      the success depends strongly to the patient´s compliance. Surgical treatment is an&#xD;
      alternative option, which could be considered if clinical success failed. It is notable that&#xD;
      the long-term mortality is comparable in both medical treatment options. However, a&#xD;
      comparison of the cognitive function of both therapies is not yet analyzed. The study&#xD;
      addresses the question which of this treatment options is favorable regarding cognitive&#xD;
      function and outcome.&#xD;

    <description>Using different tests addressing a various quality of neurocognitive function (attention, memory, perceptual and processing speed, alertness and executive function) participants score test appropriate values. Comparing test values separately allows to distinguish between prior - and post - operative and prior and post - interventional status. Moreover it allows to discriminate achieved test results between both groups and calculate statistical differences. Favorable test results lead to a potential better neurocognitive function outcome and enable to assess neurocognitive function in the light of operation or interventional consequence.</description>
