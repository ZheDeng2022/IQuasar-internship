    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of onalespib and CDKI AT7519 in&#xD;
      treating patients with solid tumors that have spread from the primary site (place where they&#xD;
      started) to other places in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery. Onalespib&#xD;
      and CDKI AT7519 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the safety, tolerability, and the maximum tolerated dose of the combination&#xD;
      of onalespib and AT7519M (CDKI AT7519).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics of the combination of onalespib and AT7519M.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the pharmacodynamic effect of the combination of onalespib and AT7519M on HSP70&#xD;
      expression and modulation of HSP90 client proteins in peripheral blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
      (PBMCs), plasma, and tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To observe and record anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive onalespib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1 and 4 (cycle 0 only).&#xD;
      Patients then receive onalespib IV over 1 hour and CDKI AT7519 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 4,&#xD;
      8, and 11 (cycle 1 and subsequent cycles thereafter). Cycles repeat every 21 days (7 days for&#xD;
      course 0 only) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed solid tumor that is metastatic or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of onalespib and AT7519M on the developing human fetus are unknown; for&#xD;
             this reason, women of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier&#xD;
             method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study&#xD;

             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential enrolling on study must have a negative pregnancy test within 72 hours of&#xD;
             enrollment in order to be eligible; because there is an unknown but potential risk to&#xD;
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with onalespib and AT7519M,&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements; additionally, patients with other co-morbid disease or metabolic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would render the subject at high risk for treatment complications may&#xD;
