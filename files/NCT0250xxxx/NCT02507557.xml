      Excessive fluid loss is often reported in gastrointestinal surgical patients due to&#xD;
      preoperative fasting and bowel preparations. Insufficient fluid infusion may cause&#xD;
      hypovolemia and tissue hypoperfusion, which may delayed postoperative recovery and even&#xD;
      induce postoperative acute renal failure. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of&#xD;
      Goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) strategy with that of the conventional fluid management on&#xD;
      the morbidity and mortality of postoperative complications, length of postoperative hospital&#xD;
      stay, and medical expense, so as to provide clinical evidences for optimized intraoperative&#xD;
      fluid management for patients undergone gastrointestinal surgery.&#xD;

      I. Background Excessive fluid loss is often reported in gastrointestinal surgical patients&#xD;
      due to preoperative fasting and bowel preparations. Many factors may further exacerbate the&#xD;
      lack of fluid volume, including intraoperative blood loss and fluid loss, anesthetic&#xD;
      drug-induced peripheral vasodilatation, as well as systemic inflammatory response syndrome,&#xD;
      systemic capillary leak syndrome, endothelial barrier dysfunction and transfer of&#xD;
      intravascular fluid to the third space caused by surgical trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insufficient fluid infusion may cause hypovolemia and tissue hypoperfusion, which may delayed&#xD;
      postoperative recovery and even induce postoperative acute renal failure. On the other hand,&#xD;
      fluid overload can lead to edema, increased oxygen diffusion distance between lung mesenchyme&#xD;
      and cells, then causing tissue ischemia, hypoxia, and acidosis and even affecting the&#xD;
      recovery of gastrointestinal function and the healing of incision. It has been proved that&#xD;
      improper fluid therapy in the perioperative period is associated with poor outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with gastrointestinal surgery. Goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) regimen emphasizes&#xD;
      the personalized fluid infusion to optimize the intraoperative hemodynamics and tissue&#xD;
      perfusion, including rising stroke volume, increasing arterial oxygen saturation, which may&#xD;
      result in improving postoperative outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flo-Trac/Vigileo system is developed by Edwards Technology, and monitors the continuous&#xD;
      cardiac output via peripheral arteries. The monitoring approaches of this system prove to be&#xD;
      convenient, safe and minimally invasive. As an important indicator of the system, stroke&#xD;
      volume variation (SVV) can accurately reflect the volume status of patients. The principle of&#xD;
      SVV is the preload change, which is caused by the intrathoracic pressure changes between&#xD;
      inspiratory and expiratory phases, will lead to arterial pulse pressure fluctuations, thus&#xD;
      affecting stroke volume (SV). SV may vary under different volume loads. Through measuring and&#xD;
      analyzing these differences and then assessing the circulation status, SVV provides guidance&#xD;
      for fluid therapy. The continuous and real-time SVV monitoring can provide data of patients'&#xD;
      circulation status, thereby optimizing clinical fluid treatment options and avoiding&#xD;
      excessive or insufficient volume. For patients with gastrointestinal surgery, SVV guidance&#xD;
      during the surgery can accurately regulate fluid infusion, which will contribute to the early&#xD;
      postoperative recovery and improve patient prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, SVV-directed fluid therapy will be performed in patients with&#xD;
      gastrointestinal surgery and then will be compared with conventional fluid treatment regimen&#xD;
      in the mobility and mortality of postoperative complications, postoperative recovery, and&#xD;
      length of hospital stay. The investigators are aiming to provide clinical evidences for&#xD;
      reasonable intraoperative fluid management of such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Objectives The aim of this study is to compare the effects of GDFT strategy with that of&#xD;
      the conventional fluid management on the morbidity and mortality of postoperative&#xD;
      complications, length of postoperative hospital stay, and medical expense, so as to provide&#xD;
      clinical evidences for optimized intraoperative fluid management for patients undergone&#xD;
      gastrointestinal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Research Plan 1. Design: quantitative observational comparative effectiveness research.&#xD;
      2. Sample Volume: 200 cases of subjects in the experimental group and control group,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Research phases The research is divided into three phases&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Retrospective analysis of perioperative data from patients undergone gastrointestinal&#xD;
           surgery according to traditional practices from January to June 2015. Data about&#xD;
           postoperative length of hospital stay, the morbidity and mortality of complications is&#xD;
           collected from electronic database. The fluid was administrated according to the&#xD;
           traditional method. Total intake volume = compensatory volume of expansion (CVE) +&#xD;
           physically required volume+ cumulative loss volume + continued loss volume + the loss&#xD;
           volume of the third space. Both physically required volume and cumulative loss volume&#xD;
           were replaced according to 4-2-1 rule. Crystalloid and colloid were given with the ratio&#xD;
           of 2/1. According to the bleeding, RBC and plasma were given if necessary. HR50&#xD;
           /min~100/min and MAP60~100mmHg were maintained during the surgery in both groups. When&#xD;
           SBP&lt;90 mmHg or MAP &lt; 60 mmHg, the patients were given the vasoactive drug of bitartrate&#xD;
           noradrenaline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Training phase: the GDFT protocol training will be implemented after receiving ethic&#xD;
           approval estimated from July to September 2015. A 3-month training period allowed all&#xD;
           research staff to become familiar with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Implementation phase: After 3 months training, estimated from October 2015 till March in&#xD;
           2016, the fluid management is conducted to patients with the gastrointestinal surgery on&#xD;
           the basis of GDFT protocol. Then perioperative data of the included patients in this&#xD;
           phase will be collected retrospectively from electronic database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. GDFT protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anesthesia management The radial artery line is placed before anesthesia. The invasively&#xD;
           arterial blood pressure, ECG, HR and SPO2 are monitored. The Flo-Trac/Vigileo monitoring&#xD;
           system is connected with the radial artery line of the GDFT group, CO, SV, SVV and other&#xD;
           hemodynamic parameters are monitored. In addition, the bispectral index (BIS) is&#xD;
           continuously monitored to assess the depth of sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Induction: 0.01~0.03 mg/kg of midazolam, 0.2~0.4μg/kg of sufentanil, 1~2 mg/kg of&#xD;
           propofol and 0.6~0.9 mg/kg of rocuronium are injected intravenously for anesthesia&#xD;
           induction. After the completion of endotracheal intubation, the internal jugular&#xD;
           puncture catheterization is undergone at the right side to monitor the central vein&#xD;
           pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Maintenance: After endotracheal intubation, the mechanical ventilation is initiated. The&#xD;
           tidal volume is set as 6~8 mL/kg, respiratory rate as 10 to 14 times/min and inhalation&#xD;
           to exhalation ratio as 1:2. In the surgery, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in&#xD;
           end expiratory gas is kept at the level of 35 - 45 mmHg. And the remifentanil (target&#xD;
           concentration of effect compartment is 4 - 8 ng / mL) and propofol (target concentration&#xD;
           of plasma is 3 - 5μg / mL) of intravenous target-controlled infusion are given to&#xD;
           maintain the anesthesia effect. BIS value is maintained at 40 - 50. Besides,&#xD;
           0.1~0.3μg/kg sufentanil and 0.1~0.2 mg/kg rocuronium are injected intermittently. About&#xD;
           30 minutes before the end of the surgery, a bolus of 0.1~0.3μg/kg sufentanil is&#xD;
           administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recovery: The depth of anesthesia is reduced gradually at the end of the surgery. In the&#xD;
           recovery period, the atropine and neostigmine are given as muscle relaxant antagonists.&#xD;
           Extubation is performed according to the awareness, breathing, muscle strength and&#xD;
           reflex recovery of the patient. All patients are delivered to ICU after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fluid Treatment Compensatory volume of expansion (CVE) is replaced with 5mL/kg of&#xD;
           Ringer's lactate solution before induction. The maintained dose of infusion of&#xD;
           crystalloid during surgery is: 2~4 ml/kg/h for open procedure (maximum dose of 400ml/h),&#xD;
           and 1~2 ml/kg/h for laparoscopic procedure (maximum dose of 200ml/h) respectively. Fluid&#xD;
           replacement is directed by SV value. After incision (after pneumoperitoneum for&#xD;
           laparoscopic cases) give a 200 mL Hydroxyethyl Starch 130/0.4 and Sodium Chloride bolus&#xD;
           over &lt;10 min. If SV increases by &gt;10%, repeat bolus until SV increases by &lt;10%. Record&#xD;
           peak value achieved. Give a further colloid bolus when SV drops 10% from peak value and&#xD;
           repeat cycle. According to the bleeding, RBC and plasma are given if necessary.&#xD;
           SaO2≥95%, Hb &gt; 70g/L, core body temperature&gt; 37 ℃, HR50 /min~100/min and MAP60~100mmHg&#xD;
           are maintained during the surgery in both groups. When SBP&lt;90 mmHg or MAP &lt; 60 mmHg, the&#xD;
           two groups are given the vasoactive drug of bitartrate noradrenaline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Monitoring variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intraoperative intake and output volume: volume of intraoperative crystalloid, volume of&#xD;
           colloid, blood transfusion volume, urine output, blood loss and use of vasoactive&#xD;
           agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hemodynamic variables: MAP, HR, SaO2, CVP, CO, CI, SV, SVV, stroke volume index (SVI)&#xD;
           and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) at the following time points: baseline,&#xD;
           immediately after induction and intubation, at beginning of the surgery and every five&#xD;
           minutes following that, at the end of surgery, etc.&#xD;
