  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI), especially involving the cervical and upper thoracic segments, can&#xD;
      significantly compromise respiratory muscle function. Respiratory complications can ensue,&#xD;
      including lung collapse and pneumonia, which are the primary cause for mortality in&#xD;
      association with traumatic SCI both during the acute and chronic phases post-injury. Lesions&#xD;
      at the level of the cervical or high thoracic spinal cord result in respiratory muscle&#xD;
      weakness, which is associated with ineffective cough, mucus retention, and mucus plugging.&#xD;
      Despite the fact that pulmonary complications are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      this population, there is a paucity of effective interventions in the SCI population known to&#xD;
      improve respiratory muscle strength with pharmacologic interventions receiving little to no&#xD;
      attention. The current objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of 16 weeks&#xD;
      of sustained release oral Albuterol to; (1) improve respiratory muscular strength, and (2)&#xD;
      improve cough effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the past 40 years has witnessed a substantial improvement in the acute and chronic&#xD;
      management of persons with SCI, mortality remains high during the first year post-injury, and&#xD;
      pulmonary complications including pneumonia, lung collapse (atelectasis), respiratory&#xD;
      failure, and thromboembolism are the predominant cause. The propensity for pulmonary&#xD;
      complications among subjects with SCI stems from paralysis of respiratory muscles. Injury to&#xD;
      the cervical and upper thoracic cord significantly compromises function of the diaphragm,&#xD;
      intercostal muscles, accessory respiratory muscles, and abdominal muscles. Respiratory muscle&#xD;
      dysfunction is manifest as diminution in lung volumes, reduction in maximal static&#xD;
      inspiratory and expiratory mouth pressures (MIP and MEP, respectively), and reduction in peak&#xD;
      cough pressure and flow. Cough effectiveness is contingent upon both inspiratory and&#xD;
      expiratory muscle strength; increasing the pressure-generating capacity of the inspiratory&#xD;
      and expiratory muscles in persons with tetraplegia and high paraplegia may, therefore,&#xD;
      translate to improved cough effectiveness and reduction in the propensity for atelectasis&#xD;
      and, possibly, pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory muscle training, often utilizing simple hand-held portable resistive or threshold&#xD;
      training devices, appears to have marginal effects on vital capacity and maximal static mouth&#xD;
      inspiratory and expiratory pressures (MIP and MEP, respectively), although data is&#xD;
      inconclusive. Pharmacologic interventions to improve respiratory muscle strength have&#xD;
      received little attention in the SCI population. Studies involving oral beta-2 adrenergic&#xD;
      agonists, which have been shown to elicit anabolic effects on skeletal muscle in young men&#xD;
      and an increase in muscle strength among patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular&#xD;
      dystrophy, have also demonstrated salutary effects in persons with SCI. There are many&#xD;
      foreseeable advantages of a pharmacologic approach to improve respiratory muscle strength in&#xD;
      persons with SCI. For instance, RMT can be physically demanding and time consuming,&#xD;
      compliance can be an issue, and sustainable improvements have not been realized. The intent&#xD;
      in the present proposal is to enroll a targeted cohort of 24 comparatively weaker subjects&#xD;
      with tetraplegia and high paraplegia in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      parallel group trial to assess the effects of an oral beta-2 agonist upon respiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength and cough effectiveness.&#xD;
