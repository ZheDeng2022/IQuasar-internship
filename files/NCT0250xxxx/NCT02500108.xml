  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the risk of serious cardiac events, specifically&#xD;
      ventricular tachyarrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (VT/SCD), associated with the use of&#xD;
      domperidone in a population of patients with Parkinson's disease. The hypothesis for this&#xD;
      study is that the risk of VT/SCD will be higher among domperidone users, especially at a&#xD;
      higher dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a retrospective population-based cohort study using health&#xD;
      care databases in eight jurisdictions in Canada and the UK. The study cohort will be defined&#xD;
      by the initiation of a new antiparkinsonian drug or a new diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
      The results from the separate sites will be combined by meta-analysis to provide an overall&#xD;
      assessment of the risk of VT/SCD in users of domperidone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the risk of serious cardiac events associated with the&#xD;
      use of domperidone in a cohort of patients with Parkinson's disease. More specifically, the&#xD;
      study objective is to assess the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia and sudden cardiac death&#xD;
      associated with the use of domperidone compared to no use in patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease. In addition, the investigators would also like to determine whether the risk of&#xD;
      ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death increases with the dose of domperidone in&#xD;
      patients with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use a common-protocol approach to conduct retrospective cohort studies&#xD;
      using health care data from eight jurisdictions (the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British&#xD;
      Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan, as well as the United&#xD;
      Kingdom (UK) Clinical Practice Research Datalink [CPRD]). The Canadian databases contain&#xD;
      population-level data on physician billing, diagnoses and procedures from hospital discharge&#xD;
      abstracts, vital statistics, and dispensations for prescription drugs. The CPRD is a clinical&#xD;
      database that is representative of the UK population and contains the records for patients&#xD;
      seen at over 680 general practitioner practices in the UK; these data will be linked to the&#xD;
      Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database, which contains in-hospital diagnosis and&#xD;
      procedure data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each jurisdiction, the investigators will assemble a study cohort that includes all&#xD;
      patients with a new diagnosis of Parkinson's disease or a first-ever prescription of an&#xD;
      antiparkinsonian drug between January 1, 1990 (or 1 year after site-specific data is&#xD;
      available, whichever is later) and June 30, 2012. Patients will be followed from the date of&#xD;
      study cohort entry until the occurrence of either study endpoint (defined below) or censoring&#xD;
      due to death, departure from the database, loss of continuous health plan or drug plan&#xD;
      enrolment, entry into a long-term care facility, or the end of the study period (or the last&#xD;
      date of data availability at that site), whichever occurs first. Data from Alberta, Ontario,&#xD;
      and Nova Scotia will be restricted to patients aged 66 years and older as prescription data&#xD;
      are not available for younger patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case-control selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort defined above will be analyzed using a nested case-control approach, where cases&#xD;
      are defined as a first diagnosis of ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) or sudden cardiac death&#xD;
      (SCD) any time after cohort entry. For each case, up to 30 controls will be randomly selected&#xD;
      among the cohort members in the risk sets defined by the case, after matching on age, sex,&#xD;
      date of cohort entry (Â±1 year), and duration of follow-up. Matching on duration of follow-up&#xD;
      (i.e., our best estimate of duration of the disease) will serve as a proxy to control for the&#xD;
      potential for confounding by progression and severity of Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinically relevant exposure period considered for data analysis will be the year&#xD;
      preceding the index date, and exposure to domperidone will be classified according to&#xD;
      prescriptions dispensed during this time period. For all cases and their matched controls,&#xD;
      the investigators will identify all prescriptions for domperidone from the computerized&#xD;
      medical records during the year prior to the index date. Current exposure to domperidone will&#xD;
      be defined as a prescription dispensed within 30 days before the index date (35 days for&#xD;
      Saskatchewan). Recent use, past use, and no use will also be explored as mutually exclusive&#xD;
      exposure categories. Recent use will be defined as a prescription dispensed between 31 and 90&#xD;
      days before the index date, and past use as a prescription dispensed between 91 and 365 days&#xD;
      before the index date. No use will be defined as no prescription of domperidone in the year&#xD;
      preceding the index date and will be the reference category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditional logistic regression will be used to estimate the odds ratios and corresponding&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the association between domperidone use and the risk of&#xD;
      VT/SCD. In secondary analyses, VT/SCD will be analyzed according to duration of domperidone&#xD;
      use (&lt;=30 days, &gt;30 days), and to the daily dose of domperidone (&lt;=30 mg per day, &gt;30 mg per&#xD;
      day). In addition, several sensitivity analyses will be conducted, all defined a priori, to&#xD;
      assess the robustness of the results. Finally, all site-specific estimates will be&#xD;
      meta-analyzed using fixed and random effects models. The amount of between-site heterogeneity&#xD;
      will be estimated using the I square statistic.&#xD;

All potential cases will be subjected to a computer algorithm to exclude non-relevant events (such as events due to non-arrhythmic cardiac causes or acute life-threatening non-cardiac causes); all potential cases that are not excluded by the algorithm will be reviewed in each centre to exclude cases that do not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.</description>
