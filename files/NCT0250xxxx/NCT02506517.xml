  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study (the second phase in testing a new drug) to see how useful an&#xD;
      investigational drug called afatinib is in patients with advanced cancer with changes in the&#xD;
      HER gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afatinib is a drug that is approved by Health Canada for the treatment of advanced lung&#xD;
      cancer with changes in the HER gene. Afatinib works by attaching to and blocking a protein&#xD;
      called HER from working. HER is an important protein that contributes to the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
