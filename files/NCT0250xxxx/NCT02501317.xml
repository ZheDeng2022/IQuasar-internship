      Introduction: Urinary incontinence is a condition that affects most women in her adult life;&#xD;
      it is considered a public health problem and has a high negative impact on the quality of&#xD;
      life. Physical therapy is considered as the first treatment option for this disease, these&#xD;
      treatments are done with pelvic floor muscles exercises (kinesiotherapy) with or without the&#xD;
      use of other resources such as biofeedback, electrical stimulation and vaginal cones.&#xD;
      Rationale: The protocols used in the various studies on the treatment of urinary incontinence&#xD;
      are made with only one type of therapy and have no change in the intensity of the exercises.&#xD;
      The &quot;Active Perineal Rehabilitation&quot; protocol uses kinesiotherapy with biofeedback,&#xD;
      electrical stimulation, vaginal cones and home exercises; it consists of 14 individual&#xD;
      sessions that gradually evolve the intensity of exercises. Objective: To assess the&#xD;
      scientific validity of &quot;Active Perineal Rehabilitation&quot; protocol for the treatment of urinary&#xD;
      incontinence. Methodology: A multicenter, prospective clinical trial, controlled and&#xD;
      randomized, the sample will be divided into a study group that will be treated with the&#xD;
      Active Perineal Rehabilitation protocol, and a control group will be treated with the&#xD;
      protocol already widely used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keys Words: urinary incontinence, physical therapy, rehabilitation, pelvic floor, perineum,&#xD;

      Urinary incontinence is defined as an involuntary loss of urine, the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) considers it is a public health problem having a negative impact on the&#xD;
      quality of life of such patients. Its prevalence ranges from 3% to 55%, it is difficult to&#xD;
      have a right number because different definitions used and the range age of the population&#xD;
      studied. Its more common type is stress urinary incontinence (SUI), the involuntary loss of&#xD;
      urine on exertion, coughing or sneezing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the old days, those pathologies were seen as a natural consequence of aging, making people&#xD;
      adapt to the changes imposed by them. Modern society and the increase of life expectancy made&#xD;
      people care more about their quality of life and well-being, making them search for&#xD;
      treatments to those pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, International Continence Society,&#xD;
      as well the most of national societies of gynecology and urology, deliberate that&#xD;
      physiotherapy is the first option to urinary incontinence treatment. Perineal rehabilitation&#xD;
      aims increase pelvic floor muscle strength, to intensify urethral closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perineal rehabilitation is showing to be an efficient treatment to urinary incontinence,&#xD;
      studies show that rate cure is between 28 to 84%, this large interval is because different&#xD;
      techniques and different assessments in each study.The treatments used in perineal&#xD;
      rehabilitation are kinesiotherapy (pelvic floor muscle exercises), with or without&#xD;
      biofeedback, electrical stimulation and vaginal cones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are several studies about physical therapy to urinary incontinence treatment,&#xD;
      there are not studies that use more than one of these techniques. Other problem is the fact&#xD;
      that the protocols used in these studies start and finish with the same exercises intensity,&#xD;
      there is no evolution in the treatment. It can be observed in the literature review made by&#xD;
      Hay-Smith, 2012 and Margarida Ferreira e Paula Santos, 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Active Perineal Rehabilitation&quot; (APR) protocol uses perineal kinesiotherapy with&#xD;
      biofeedback, electrical stimulation, vaginal cones and home exercises, its intensity increase&#xD;
      session by session, like is recommended by American College of Sports Medicine. This protocol&#xD;
      is unique and innovative to urinary incontinence treatment.&#xD;
