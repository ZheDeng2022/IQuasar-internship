  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients who experience a prolonged ICU stay are at high risk for developing post&#xD;
      intensive care unit syndrome (PICS), a serious medical condition manifested by loss of muscle&#xD;
      mass, weakness, malnutrition and neurocognitive decline. PICS often leads to chronic&#xD;
      disability, prolonged mechanical ventilation and the need for costly extended stays in long&#xD;
      term care facilities (LTCs). The investigators' preliminary study shows attempts at&#xD;
      rehabilitating patients who have already developed PICS are minimally effective, resulting in&#xD;
      only modest improvements in functionality. This project will determine the effects of&#xD;
      mobility-based physical rehabilitation (MPR) combined with neuromuscular electric stimulation&#xD;
      (NMES) and high protein supplementation (HPRO) early in a patients ICU stay on preventing&#xD;
      PICS related musculoskeletal and functional deficits, and improving clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older, critically ill patients who survive their ICU stay frequently develop post-ICU&#xD;
      syndrome (PICS) - a condition manifested by sarcopenia, weakness, malnutrition and&#xD;
      neurocognitive decline - which occurs as a result of a critical illness, prolonged bed rest,&#xD;
      catabolism, and polypharmacy. PICS frequently leads to chronic disability, prolonged&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation (MV), functional deficits, and the need for extended rehabilitation in&#xD;
      long term care facilities (LTCs). As the majority of patients admitted to ICUs are ≥ 65 years&#xD;
      old, many of these patients are at high risk for PICS. Since the care of ICU patients is&#xD;
      primarily focused on the medical management of the acute critical illness, there are limited&#xD;
      resources and strategies available to prevent PICS. Evidence suggests mobility-based physical&#xD;
      rehabilitation (MPR) combined with resistive training with neuromuscular electric stimulation&#xD;
      (NMES) and high protein diets (HPRO) containing essential amino acids can mitigate the loss&#xD;
      of muscle mass and function during bed rest in the elderly. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that preventive therapy involving the addition of both NMES and HPRO to MPR early and&#xD;
      throughout the ICU and hospital stay can mitigate PICS-associated sarcopenia, malnutrition,&#xD;
      and immobility to confer valuable health benefits toward recovery. To test this, the&#xD;
      investigators will use a 2x2 factorial design in which older, MV ICU patients will all&#xD;
      receive comprehensive ICU care and MPR, then be randomized to one of 4 groups: 1) MPR+NMES,&#xD;
      2) MPR+HPRO, 3) all 3 together, or 4) MPR alone (control), to determine independent and&#xD;
      combined effects of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Aims are to 1) determine the effects of adding NMES and HPRO interventions to&#xD;
      MPR on muscle mass, strength, and mobility function in older, critically ill MV patients&#xD;
      while still in the ICU, and 2) determine the effects of adding NMES and HPRO interventions to&#xD;
      MPR on the clinical outcomes of time to weaning from MV, ICU/hospital length of stay and&#xD;
      discharge disposition of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal capitalizes on the interdisciplinary collaboration among Pulmonary/Critical&#xD;
      Care Intensivists, Physical Therapists, Geriatricians, Clinical Nutritionists, Statisticians&#xD;
      and Nutrition and Metabolism clinical researchers examining the efficacy of the proposed&#xD;
      comprehensive rehabilitation approach. The investigators' primary goal is to attenuate the&#xD;
      severity of sarcopenia and functional decline in this older, critically ill population at&#xD;
      risk for severe disability. Additionally, by focusing on maintaining skeletal muscle mass,&#xD;
      function, and strength, the investigators hope to improve clinical outcomes. The&#xD;
      investigators posit this combined therapy will mitigate PICS-associated disability and speed&#xD;
      the recovery from critical illness in older, MV ICU patients. This project has high overall&#xD;
      impact as the intervention is easily administered by hospital staff and may greatly reduce&#xD;
      the physiological and functional declines while hastening recovery during acute ICU&#xD;
      hospitalization in older adults.&#xD;

    <description>The MPR provides strength and cardiopulmonary endurance training, which consist of exercises to promote function movements. Intensity is based on patient's hemodynamic responses and subjective report using Modified Borg Dyspnea Scale. Intensity, duration, or type of activity will be modified each session to achieve a moderately intense physiologic response. The NMES protocol requires self-adhesive surface electrodes be placed on quadriceps muscles and lower leg bilaterally, twice daily. This protocol is based on prior NMES protocols used to stimulate muscle protein synthesis in older diabetic patients, preserve muscle mass in intensive care patients and increase strength in older adults after knee replacement. The HPRO intervention is based on caloric needs, calculated using validated equations to maintain positive nitrogen balance. Protein will be supplemented as isolated amino acids twice/day to deliver ~15g of essential amino acids per serving, with a goal of 1.6 g/kg/day.</description>
