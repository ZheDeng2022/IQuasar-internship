      The investigators aim to assess type and frequency of HIV drug resistance in adults&#xD;
      presenting to the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) in Kampala, Uganda, and compare this&#xD;
      data to patients from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS). This study is a single-site,&#xD;
      cross-sectional study. The Investigators' goal is to perform viral load measurements in 2750&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients who have been on ART for 6 months or more. Presuming a detectable viral&#xD;
      load in 10%, resistance testing would then be performed in 250 patients on ART. All adult&#xD;
      patients attending will be screened for enrollment. Furthermore, the investigators' goal is&#xD;
      to perform resistance testing in 250 ART naive patients in order to detect transmitted&#xD;
      resistance mutations. Investigators will therefore consecutively screen and enroll 250 ART&#xD;
      naive patients who attend the clinic during the study period. For each participant, a case&#xD;
      report form (CRF) form will be completed which includes social, as well as medical&#xD;
      information. Investigators will ask each participant for permission to store plasma in case&#xD;
      resistance testing must be repeated, and serum, in case of future research questions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background &amp; Rational Uganda and Switzerland are two examples of regions in the world that&#xD;
      have experienced the era of antiretroviral treatment (ART) in substantially different ways.&#xD;
      While European patients had access to ART from the beginning of drug development, ART was&#xD;
      made accessible to patients from sub-Saharan Africa many years later. HIV-infected patients&#xD;
      in resource-limited settings were not subjected to the early days of treatment, were mono&#xD;
      therapy was tried or combinations of drugs that are off the market nowadays. Furthermore, in&#xD;
      contrast to European patients, patients from resource-limited settings were constantly&#xD;
      confronted with economic constraints leading to stock-outs for instance. Cultural aspects,&#xD;
      such as stigma and fear of disclosure, differ as well, and are well known to influence&#xD;
      individual adherence and treatment outcome substantially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today similar first-line treatment choices are made by Ugandan and Swiss physicians, but&#xD;
      monitoring strategies still differ. As in other countries of sub-Saharan Africa, treatment of&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients is monitored immunologically and clinically, while viral load&#xD;
      measurement is reserved for selected patients. In accordance with WHO recommendations&#xD;
      treatment failure is therefore determined clinically (new or recurrent WHO stage III or IV&#xD;
      condition) and/or by the decline of a patient's CD4 cell count to or below baseline, which&#xD;
      usually occurs late during insufficient treatment. Viral rebound and emergence of resistance&#xD;
      may thereby arise. Moreover, misclassification of treatment failure (e.g. patients with&#xD;
      immunological failure in the absence of virological failure or complete non-adherence to&#xD;
      treatment) may result in premature switching to more costly second-line treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The currently available information on transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in Ugandan adults&#xD;
      shows lower rates compared to patients from European countries, including Switzerland. Yet,&#xD;
      available studies were conducted with small patient numbers. Newer data from Uganda,&#xD;
      especially under new WHO treatment recommendations, is not available yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of investigators' knowledge, so far no study has directly compared HIV drug&#xD;
      resistance data from a resource-limited country to a resource-rich country. Little is known&#xD;
      about the effects of historically, culturally and economically different ART experiences on&#xD;
      resistance. With the 2013 WHO guidelines, ART roll-out will be enhanced globally and the&#xD;
      continued success of these large-scale treatment programs will depend on the prevention of&#xD;
      further emergence of drug resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectional, single-site, observational Enrolment period: May 1st - July 31st 2015&#xD;
      Patients: All HIV-infected adults above the age of 18 years that have been on a stable first-&#xD;
      or second-line ART regimen ≥6 months presenting to the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI)&#xD;
      during the study period and are able to give written informed consent will be enrolled. The&#xD;
      goal is to perform viral load testing in 2750 patients on ART. Presuming a detectable viral&#xD;
      load in 10%, resistance testing would then be performed in 250 patients on ART. Treatment&#xD;
      naive HIV-infected patients above the age of 18 years presenting to the IDI during the study&#xD;
      period will be offered resistance testing. The goal is to perform resistance testing in 250&#xD;
      ART naive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests: A blood sample is used for resistance testing in treatment naive patients.&#xD;
      For patients on ART, the initial sample will be used for HIV viral load measurement at the&#xD;
      IDI. Part of the sample will be frozen (-80°C) and stored at the IDI for later resistance&#xD;
      testing in case of detectable viral load (plasma viral load &gt;1000 copies/ml). Resistance&#xD;
      testing will be done at the Ugandan Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Entebbe, Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type and frequency of mutations in treatment-naive will be identified and compared to the&#xD;
      data from the SHCS. Investigators will compare treatment-naive patients from the SHCS who&#xD;
      were tested in the same time-frame (in the year 2014). Additionally, investigators will&#xD;
      identify a time-frame in the SHCS where a similar proportion of patients had detectable viral&#xD;
      loads on ART as now in Uganda (the time-frame will depend on the findings in Uganda). Uni-&#xD;
      and multivariate logistic regressions will be performed to identify risk factors for the&#xD;
      detection of HIV drug resistance mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type and frequency of mutations in treatment-experienced patients will also be analyzed and&#xD;
      compared to patients from the SHCS. For comparison, investigators will match patients from&#xD;
      the SHCS with the same age, gender and ART. To identify risk factors for the detection of&#xD;
      mutations in treatment-experienced patients, the investigators will also perform logistic&#xD;
      regression models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the diagnostic performance of clinical/immunological testing investigators will&#xD;
      calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value compared to&#xD;
      virological testing (gold standard).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These analyses will be performed for all drug-resistance mutations pooled together&#xD;
      (outcome-variable= patient has any drug resistance mutation), for drug resistance mutations&#xD;
      against individual drug classes (outcome = patient has any drug resistance mutation to a&#xD;
      particular drug class), and for the two resistance mutations (M184V and K103N) that have been&#xD;
      most prevalent in previous studies in resource-limited settings.&#xD;
