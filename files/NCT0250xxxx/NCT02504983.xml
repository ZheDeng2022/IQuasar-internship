  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) + sorafenib therapy has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      exert a beneficial effective on time-to-tumor-progression (TTP) in patients with unresectable&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in some studies. However, the beneficial effect varies among&#xD;
      studies conducted in different areas of the world. The objectives of this study are (1) to&#xD;
      understand whether GALNT14 TT genotype patients respond better than do GALNT14 non-TT&#xD;
      genotype patients when treated by TACE; and (2) to understand whether GALNT14 non-TT genotype&#xD;
      patients can benefit from TACE plus sorafenib (Nexavar) combination therapy. Patients&#xD;
      enrolled will be stratified by GALNT14 genotyping. The GALNT14 &quot;non-TT&quot; patients were then&#xD;
      randomized into two subgroups to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of TACE plus&#xD;
      sorafenib therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is the efficacy of TACE with or without sorafenib&#xD;
      combination therapy evaluated by complete remission (CR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Time to partial or complete response (PR + CR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time-to-tumor-progression (TTP) and the progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Safety and tolerability of TACE plus sorafenib therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The strategy of TACE + sorafenib is now being intensively investigated. It is a safe approach&#xD;
      with significant beneficial effect on TTP in some studies, but the beneficial effect on OS&#xD;
      remains uncertain. In the present study, we hypothesized that the GALNT14 genotype might play&#xD;
      a role in this issue. Our pilot study indicated that GALNT14 &quot;TT&quot; genotype was associated&#xD;
      with a favorable complete response rate in patients treated by TACE alone. This genotype was&#xD;
      present in ~ 25% of Chinese population coming from Taiwan, Colorado (US), or Beijing (China),&#xD;
      and in ~ 7% of Italian population. But it was present in ~ 50% of Japanese population. The&#xD;
      lower percentage of a TACE - favorable genotype in Chinese and Italian population could&#xD;
      explain the different results between Japanese and Chinese/Italian clinical trials. It is&#xD;
      possible that in a population with higher percentage of TACE - favorable genotype (GALNT14&#xD;
      &quot;TT&quot;), the beneficial effect of sorafenib adjuvant treatment might not be detected. In this&#xD;
      study, we proposed to examine the TACE + sorafenib effect in patients with GALNT14 &quot;non-TT&quot;&#xD;
      genotype, a TACE - unfavorable genotype.&#xD;
