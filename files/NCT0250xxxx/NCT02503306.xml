      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      o To assess the change in percent of sexual attempts in which subjects are able to maintain&#xD;
      an erection of sufficient duration to have successful intercourse between the run-in period&#xD;
      and treatment period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The change in percent of sexual attempts in which subjects are able to insert the penis&#xD;
           into the partner's vagina.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The change in score on the erectile function (EF) domain of the International Index of&#xD;
           Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      o To evaluate the safety and tolerability of avanafil in patients with erectile dysfunction&#xD;
      (ED).&#xD;
