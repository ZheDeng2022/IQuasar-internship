      The objective of the observational study is to assess the positioning of customized guides&#xD;
      designed from patients X-Rays (Zimmer速 X-Ray PSI Knee) using optical navigation in primary&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research is a single center, prospective, case series, and non-controlled study.&#xD;
      One orthopedic surgeon will perform 30 primary TKAs using X-Ray PSI Knee guides, generated&#xD;
      from X-ray. Patients who have been appropriately indicated as candidates for TKA and who meet&#xD;
      the specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be informed about Zimmer速 X-Ray PSI Knee&#xD;
      technology and offered entry into the study. Informed consent, in accordance with current&#xD;
      ethical board regulatory requirements and best practice, will be obtained from all patients.&#xD;
