      Prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled First-In-Human study with four&#xD;
      sub-parts: Part A, a single ascending dose study (SAD) in normal human volunteers (NHVs),&#xD;
      Part B, a multiple ascending dose study (MAD) in NHVs, Part C, a multiple dose (MD) study in&#xD;
      patients with a complement-mediated disorder, and Part E, a multiple dose (MD) study in&#xD;
      patients with cold agglutinin disease previously treated with BIVV009 within the scope of a&#xD;
      BIVV009 clinical trial or named patient program use. Note: For parts A-C as well as at the&#xD;
      start of part E, study drug was named TNT009. The study drug name is changed to BIVV009 with&#xD;
      final version Final 15.0 of the clinical study protocol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Study TNT009-01 (parts A-C)/ BIVV009 (part E) is a First in Human (FIH) study that uses an&#xD;
      Integrated Protocol Design. This Phase 1 study protocol will comprise three sub-parts: a&#xD;
      Single Ascending Dose (SAD) and Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) study in normal male and female&#xD;
      human volunteers (NHVs), and a Multiple Dose (MD) study in patients with various&#xD;
      complement-mediated disorders not confined to a single disease or therapeutic area. Although&#xD;
      these patients represent a population with a diverse set of clinical diagnoses they are&#xD;
      united by a common mechanism of disease matched to the mechanism of action of BIV009. Several&#xD;
      key safety measures have been incorporated into the design of this study, including use of&#xD;
      Sentinel Dosing Groups and an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), as well as an&#xD;
      appropriate program of prophylactic vaccinations and clinical biomarker surveillance related&#xD;
      to the risks potentially associated with inhibition of the complement system. To allow access&#xD;
      of BIVV009 to CAD patients where successful treatment effect has been observed and to allow&#xD;
      re-initiation of BIVV009 to previously treated CAD patients, Part E has been added to both&#xD;
      continued access to study drug in this subset of study patients, and to further characterize&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy to BIVV009.&#xD;
