  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 2 diabetes have very variable endogenous insulin secretion. While some&#xD;
      patients have relatively preserved endogenous insulin with marked insulin resistance others&#xD;
      may develop the very severe insulin deficiency seen in type 1 diabetes. The impact of this&#xD;
      variation on hypoglycaemia risk and treatment response in type 2 diabetes is unclear. This&#xD;
      project aims to determine the impact of residual endogenous insulin secretion on glucose&#xD;
      variability, hypoglycaemia risk and treatment response in insulin-treated participants with a&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The investigators will recruit participants from&#xD;
      existing cohorts known to have severe insulin deficiency despite classical clinical&#xD;
      characteristics of type 2 diabetes. The investigators will recruit other participants with&#xD;
      insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and retained endogenous insulin secretion matched for&#xD;
      glycemia and gender. The investigators will assess glucose variability (using continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitoring system (CGMS)) and treatment response to a single dose of the glucose&#xD;
      lowering therapy vildagliptin and compare responses between groups. This study will allow us&#xD;
      to assess the potential utility of measuring endogenous insulin secretion in insulin-treated&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes as a marker of hypoglycaemia risk and in determining likely response to oral&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

      In insulin-treated type 2 diabetes the relationship between endogenous insulin levels and&#xD;
      both glucose variability and hypoglycaemia risk is unclear. An association between endogenous&#xD;
      insulin levels and hypoglycaemia risk was reported in the United Kingdom Hypoglycaemia Study,&#xD;
      and those with low endogenous insulin levels have increased post-meal glucose rise (a measure&#xD;
      of glucose variability and therefore hypoglycaemia risk). However, in another large&#xD;
      cross-sectional study there was no correlation between endogenous insulin levels and&#xD;
      questionnaire-assessed hypoglycaemia risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-peptide as a potential biomarker for predicting treatment response to combination therapies&#xD;
      in those with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other glucose-lowering therapies may be combined with insulin in those with type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      as combined therapy in this condition may achieve better blood glucose control than insulin&#xD;
      alone. In contrast non-insulin therapy is usually ineffective in type 1 diabetes, likely due&#xD;
      to differences in endogenous insulin secretion. Among the commonly used glucose-lowering&#xD;
      treatments which are licensed for combined therapy with insulin in type 2 diabetes are the&#xD;
      dipeptide peptidase 4 (DPPIV) inhibitors. They have multiple mechanisms of action that&#xD;
      include potentiation of beta cell insulin secretion and suppression of glucagon. The relative&#xD;
      importance of these mechanisms to treatment response is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent work by the investigators group has identified that preserved endogenous insulin&#xD;
      secretion is important for the glucose-lowering effect of a related class of glucose lowering&#xD;
      therapies called GLP-1 receptor agonists, with little response seen in those with severe&#xD;
      endogenous insulin deficiency. The investigators hypothesise that potentiation of endogenous&#xD;
      insulin secretion may be the major mechanism of glucose lowering by DPPIV inhibitors and&#xD;
      therefore those who have type 2 diabetes, but very low residual insulin secretion, will have&#xD;
      little change in glucose with these medications. The pharmacodynamics of these agents (&gt;90%&#xD;
      inhibition of the target enzyme occurring within 45 minutes (for vildagliptin) and marked&#xD;
      glucose lowering effect seen within an hour would allow us to explore this idea by assessing&#xD;
      the impact of residual beta cell function on the glucose-lowering effect of a one-off dose of&#xD;
      a DPP IV-inhibitor .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: The investigators hypothesize that patients who have the clinical characteristics&#xD;
      of type 2 diabetes but have severe loss of endogenous insulin secretion will have markedly&#xD;
      increased glycaemic variability (and therefore hypoglycaemia risk), and decreased response to&#xD;
      non-insulin glucose lowering treatment in comparison to patients with similar clinical&#xD;
      characteristics but preserved endogenous insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether individual residual beta cell function influences glucose variability,&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia, and response to DPP-IV therapy in patients with insulin-treated type 2&#xD;
      diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In participants with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does individual residual endogenous insulin secretion influence glucose variability and&#xD;
           hypoglycaemia risk?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does individual residual endogenous insulin secretion influence glycaemic response to&#xD;
           DPPIV inhibitor therapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design (Overview):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit participants who have a clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      are currently treated with insulin therapy and are known to have preserved or very low&#xD;
      endogenous insulin secretion. Participants with and without severe endogenous insulin&#xD;
      deficiency will be matched for clinical characteristics. Glucose variability, hypoglycaemic&#xD;
      risk, and response to a single dose of a standard glucose lowering treatment will be assessed&#xD;
      and compared between the groups. This will require 3 research visits over a 2 week period&#xD;
      (one non-fasting, two fasting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the response to treatment aspect of the study, glucose response to a mixed meal will be&#xD;
      assessed with and without a one-off dose of the DPPIV inhibitor vildagliptin, with these&#xD;
      tests performed in random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and recruitment: The investigators will recruit 54 participants. Potential&#xD;
      participants will be identified from existing research cohorts or routine clinical practice&#xD;
      where endogenous insulin status (C-peptide in blood or urine) has been previously assessed.&#xD;
      Where patients are identified from existing cohorts who have given consent for future&#xD;
      contact, a letter from that database administrator will be sent providing generic information&#xD;
      on the study. Contact details of those interested in further information will be passed to&#xD;
      the research team to continue the recruitment process. Where potential participants are&#xD;
      identified in clinical practice they will be given generic information about the study by&#xD;
      their clinician and if interested, and with their permission, their contact details will be&#xD;
      passed to a member of the research team for further contact. The research team will be&#xD;
      responsible for the recruitment process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants identified as having severe insulin deficiency (n=27) will be matched (for&#xD;
      gender, HbA1c) with participants who have retained insulin secretion (n=27).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit one (baseline, research facility or participant's home) Participants will attend&#xD;
      non-fasting. Following written informed consent, a blood sample (approximately 30mls in&#xD;
      total) will be taken for baseline measurements (to include C-peptide, glucose, HbA1c,&#xD;
      creatinine, liver function) and saved serum and plasma. A urine sample will be collected and&#xD;
      stored and a pregnancy test offered to pre-menopausal women. Baseline data will include:&#xD;
      height, weight, age, duration of diabetes, age of diagnosis and ethnicity, and confirmation&#xD;
      of treatment regimen. A standard hypoglycaemia questionnaire (the Modified Clarke/Edinburgh&#xD;
      Hypoglycaemia questionnaire, incorporating the Gold question) will be completed by the&#xD;
      participant. The participant's ability to self-monitor blood glucose will be confirmed (with&#xD;
      further education provided if necessary). Participants will be instructed on the use of the&#xD;
      CGM system, and requirements for self-monitoring of blood glucose. Whilst wearing the&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitors participants will be requested to test their own blood glucose&#xD;
      levels 4 times spread over the course of each day (for subsequent calibration purposes) and&#xD;
      record this on a data collection sheet provided. They will also be asked to record details of&#xD;
      meals, exercise or symptoms over the duration of monitoring. The automatic device will be set&#xD;
      up for 4-6 days continuous glucose monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit two (4-6 days after visit 1, research facility) Participants will be asked to attend&#xD;
      for a morning visit having omitted their morning insulin and not consumed anything (except&#xD;
      water) from midnight the night before. If they feel unwell, or need to treat low blood&#xD;
      glucose the visit will be postponed. A small cannula will be inserted to enable multiple&#xD;
      blood samples to be taken with the minimum of discomfort. A fasting blood test (approximately&#xD;
      15mls) will be performed for glucose, c-peptide, glucagon and saved serum/plasma.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to take their normal morning insulin with a 10% reduction&#xD;
      immediately prior to consuming 250mls of a meal replacement drink (Fortisip) with or without&#xD;
      a DPPIV inhibitor (Vildagliptin 50mg) tablet. Blood for glucose, c-peptide, glucagon and&#xD;
      saved serum/plasma will be taken at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes after they have&#xD;
      completed the drink (volume of blood at each time point approximately 15 mls). A urine sample&#xD;
      will be collected and saved at 180 minutes, and then the CGM device will be disconnected and&#xD;
      removed. Participant's bedside blood glucose will be measured, and a light lunch provided&#xD;
      together with advice from study clinicians regarding insulin adjustments if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit three (4-14 days after visit 2, research facility) This will be as visit 2 with&#xD;
      participants given the alternative treatment (DPPIV inhibitor or no treatment). Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to keep glucose-lowering therapy identical between visits 2 and 3, to attend&#xD;
      the research department at a similar time of day as visit 2 and to take evening insulin prior&#xD;
      to visit 3 at the same time and dose as prior to visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation All participants will be required to undertake a mixed meal test with/without&#xD;
      the standard DPPIV inhibitor. The order of the mixed meal tests at visits 2 and 3 will be&#xD;
      decided using a randomisation table (StatsDirect), overseen by the CRF statistician. The&#xD;
      randomisation is included in order to minimize any theoretical order bias effects (e.g.&#xD;
      glucose levels improving through the study, or participant drop-out affecting the third visit&#xD;
      more).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and clinical research staff will not be blinded to this, however the&#xD;
      statistician will be blinded to the group randomisation allocation for the purposes of&#xD;
      analysis Concomitant Therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
      All diabetes related medication will continue unaltered. Participants will be asked not to&#xD;
      change diabetes treatment for the duration of the study. The study team will manage diabetes&#xD;
      medication for the duration of the participant's involvement in the study. The General&#xD;
      Practitioner (GP) or secondary care diabetes team will manage other aspects of diabetes care&#xD;
      in line with standard clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Recording All participants will be assigned a unique study identifier&#xD;
      (ID). All data collected will be recorded and stored under this ID number. Data will be&#xD;
      initially recorded onto a study specific data collection form (DCF). Data will then be&#xD;
      recorded onto a study specific database. Hard copies will be stored in the study specific&#xD;
      site file. As part of the ECRF data quality procedures, data collected and recorded will be&#xD;
      screened and reviewed for discrepancies and missing data prior to analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permission will be obtained to access medical notes should this be required for diabetes data&#xD;
      relevant to taking part in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participant data will be held in a link-anonymised format, with personal identifiable&#xD;
      data only accessible to personnel with training in data protection who require this&#xD;
      information to perform their duties. Participants' research and sample data will be&#xD;
      identified by unique study ID numbers and all data will be held on password-protected&#xD;
      computers. Only the Chief Investigator (CI) or designated research team member will have&#xD;
      access to personal identifiable data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Storage and Archiving:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consent and paper data collection forms will be scanned onto discs and stored in locked&#xD;
      filing cabinets within the controlled access ECRF for the duration of the project. Paper&#xD;
      copies will be shredded. Where permission has been obtained, samples and data will be&#xD;
      transferred for safe keeping to the Exeter Tissue Bank (ETB) Where no such permission has&#xD;
      been obtained at the end of the project the study documentation will be archived and stored&#xD;
      following the standard R&amp;D archiving procedures and biological samples will be destroyed&#xD;
      following standard clinical guidelines for sample destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample analysis and storage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All saved serum and plasma samples will be stored under the study ID, with the file linking&#xD;
      the study code to personal identifiable information held securely by the clinical research&#xD;
      facility data manager and accessible only to personnel with training in data protection who&#xD;
      require this information to perform their duties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be undertaken by the biochemistry laboratory of the Royal Devon and Exeter&#xD;
      Hospital. HbA1c, lipid, renal and liver profile will be sent for immediate processing and&#xD;
      results copied to participants clinicians (with participants consent). Other analysis will be&#xD;
      performed batched samples at the end of the study, with samples stored at -80oc prior to&#xD;
      analysis. Blood samples for DNA extraction will be processed and stored by the Royal Devon &amp;&#xD;
      Exeter National Health Service Foundation Trust Molecular Genetics Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent will be sought to transfer samples remaining at the end of the study to the ethically&#xD;
      approved Peninsula Research Bank (PRB) for safe storage for future use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Calculation and statistical analysis The investigators will recruit 54 participants (27&#xD;
      each group). This will give us 80% power to detect an 0.8 Standard Deviation (SD) change in&#xD;
      mean average glucose excursions (MAGE) (1.44 moll/L [35]), and an 18% absolute difference in&#xD;
      glucose reduction with vildagliptin at the 5% level of significance between those with and&#xD;
      without substantial endogenous insulin secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRF statistician will be blinded to the group randomisation allocation for the purposes&#xD;
      of analysis. The investigators will compare MAGE, time spent in hypoglycaemia (hours/day),&#xD;
      and Clarke scores in those with and without severe insulin deficiency using unpaired T-tests.&#xD;
      The investigators will compare response to DPPIV inhibitor (incremental area under the curve&#xD;
      glucose with mixed meal test with vildagliptin - incremental area under the curve glucose&#xD;
      test without vildagliptin) between groups using unpaired T tests. The investigators will&#xD;
      assess whether each outcome variable is normally distributed prior to analysis and log&#xD;
      transform or use equivalent non-parametric analysis where necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be managed by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Exeter Clinical&#xD;
      Research Facility. All contact with volunteers and sample collection will be facilitated&#xD;
      within the R D&amp;E NHS Foundation Trust setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timescale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated the project objectives will be met over a period of 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Budget Summary and Costing&#xD;
&#xD;
      All costs will be met by existing research funding as outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Service support costs will be will be funded by the NIHR Exeter Clinical Research&#xD;
           Facility core funding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All other research costs will be funded by Professor Andrew Hattersley's Wellcome Trust&#xD;
           Senior Investigator Award&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project development and user involvement The study team will have access to the user&#xD;
      representative group of the NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility (ECRF). In keeping with&#xD;
      the National Health Service (NHS) Patient Carer and Public Involvement (PCPI) strategy the&#xD;
      ECRF invites user representatives to contribute to the development of various projects within&#xD;
      its portfolio. These individuals have agreed to maintain contact and regular meetings have&#xD;
      been established at which researchers discuss the development of current projects within the&#xD;
      ECRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Event Recording and Reporting This is a low risk study and it is not anticipated that&#xD;
      participants involved in this project will be subject to adverse effects. The CI will be&#xD;
      informed of any adverse effects within 24 hours and they will be reported following local NHS&#xD;
      R&amp;D SOPs with a copy of any adverse event form stored in the project site file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Feedback:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should any biochemistry result potentially impact on clinical care, the results will be&#xD;
      initially discussed by the CI and the clinical members of the research team and a decision&#xD;
      will be made to contact that individual participant's General Practitioner or healthcare&#xD;
      team. A statement to this effect is included in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination/implementation of research Results will be written up and submitted for&#xD;
      publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Abstracts will be submitted to national and&#xD;
      international conferences. Results will be presented to clinical colleagues at regular&#xD;
      in-house meetings. Written information in the form of a letter outlining the key findings of&#xD;
      the study will be sent to all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential impact and benefit of the proposed research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the short term the investigators hope to gain an improved understanding of the impact of&#xD;
      residual beta cell function on hypoglycemic risk and treatment response in patients with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes. In the longer term the availability of a predictive biomarker for treatment&#xD;
      response and hypoglycaemia risk would enable improved management of patients with&#xD;
      insulin-treated diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study The study will finish when data and sample collection has been completed on all&#xD;
      participants, and analysis of data has been undertaken.&#xD;
