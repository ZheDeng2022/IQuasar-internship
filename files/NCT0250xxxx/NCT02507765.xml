    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and&#xD;
      transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in treating patients with liver cancer that cannot be&#xD;
      removed by surgery. SBRT is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of&#xD;
      radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal&#xD;
      tissue. Chemoembolization kills tumor cells by carrying drugs directly into blood vessels&#xD;
      near the tumors and then blocking the blood flow to allow a higher concentration of the drug&#xD;
      to reach the tumor for a longer period of time. SBRT may make TACE more beneficial by&#xD;
      increasing blood flow to the tumor, which may allow more of the TACE chemotherapy to enter&#xD;
      the tumor. Giving SBRT with TACE may work better in treating patients with liver cancer that&#xD;
      cannot be removed by surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the feasibility of completing SBRT followed by TACE in a 2 day time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine acute tumor perfusion changes after SBRT using functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) (magnetic resonance [MR]-dynamic contrast enhanced [DCE]/perfusion weighted&#xD;
      imaging [PWI], MR-diffusion, blood oxygen level dependent [BOLD] sequences).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To establish safety and tolerability of this regimen. III. To determine overall response&#xD;
      rates (using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria),&#xD;
      including objective response rate (partial response [PR] + complete response [CR]) and&#xD;
      clinical benefit rate (stable disease [SD] + PR + CR) at 1, 3, and 6 months after TACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate local control, progression-free survival, and overall survival at 1, 3, 6, 9,&#xD;
      and 12 months after a single-dose of SBRT followed by TACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To correlate micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) biomarkers with response and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo SBRT on day 1 and TACE on day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1-2 weeks and at 1, 3, 6, 9,&#xD;
      12, 18, and 24 months.&#xD;
