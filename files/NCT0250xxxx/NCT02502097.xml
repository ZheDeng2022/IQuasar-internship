        <title>Mixed Model of Repeated Measures (MMRM) Change From Baseline in Awake Objective Cough Frequency (Periods 1 &amp; 2 Combined)</title>
        <description>Cough monitoring was conducted for 24 hours while awake, at pre-dose on Day 0 (baseline), and after administration of the study drug on Day 7 and Day 14 in Periods 1 and 2. The cough frequency is the coughs/hour over each 24-hour period. Awake objective cough frequency was analyzed using Mixed Effect Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) to evaluate the results of the 2-period cross-over study. Baseline cough frequency was derived from the cough monitoring performed at the beginning of each treatment period while the post-treatment cough frequency was derived from the cough monitoring performed at the end of the dosing period. A negative change indicates a decrease in cough frequency, while a positive change indicates an increase in cough frequency.</description>

        <description>Cough monitoring was conducted for 24 hours while awake, at pre-dose on Day 0 (baseline), and after administration of the study drug on Day 7 and Day 14 in Periods 1 and 2. The cough frequency is the coughs/hour over each 24-hour period. Awake objective cough frequency was defined as the total number of cough events during the monitoring period the participant was awake divided by the total duration for the monitoring period the participant was awake. Baseline cough frequency was derived from the cough monitoring performed at the beginning of each treatment period while the post-treatment cough frequency was derived from the cough monitoring performed at the end of the dosing period. A negative value indicates a decrease in cough frequency.</description>

        <description>Awake objective cough frequency was defined as the total number of cough events during the monitoring period the participant was awake divided by the total duration for the monitoring period the participant was awake. Change from Baseline in awake cough frequency = post-treatment awake cough frequency - Baseline awake cough frequency. A negative value indicates a decrease in cough frequency. A positive value indicates an increase in cough frequency. Baseline cough frequency was derived from the cough monitoring performed at the beginning of each treatment period while the post-treatment cough frequency was derived from the cough monitoring performed at the end of the dosing period. Awake objective cough frequency for Period 1 was analyzed for using MMRM to evaluate the results of the 2-period cross-over study. The derived change measured at each dose were the repeated measures.</description>

        <title>MMRM Analysis of Change From Baseline in Awake Objective Cough Frequency (Period 2)</title>
        <description>Awake objective cough frequency was defined as the total number of cough events during the monitoring period the participant was awake divided by the total duration for the monitoring period the participant was awake. Change from baseline in awake cough frequency = post-treatment awake cough frequency - Baseline awake cough frequency. A negative value indicates a decrease in cough frequency. A positive value indicates an increase in cough frequency. Baseline cough frequency was derived from the cough monitoring performed at the beginning of each treatment period while the post-treatment cough frequency was derived from the cough monitoring performed at the at the end of the dosing period. Awake objective cough frequency for Period 2 was analyzed using MMRM to evaluate the results of the 2-period cross-over study. The derived change measured at each dose were the repeated measures.</description>

          <description>24-hour objective cough frequency = total number of coughs during the monitoring period divided by the total duration for the monitoring period. A negative value indicates a decrease in cough frequency.

        <title>MMRM Analysis of Change From Baseline in Cough Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (Periods 1 &amp; 2 Combined)</title>
        <description>Cough VAS is scored from 0 to 100 using a 10 mm visual analogue scale with 0 at 0mm and 100 at 10mm with 0 (no cough) and 100 (most severe cough). Baseline cough VAS is defined as average of screening and baseline cough VAS. A negative result indicates a decrease in cough frequency, while a positive result indicates an increase in cough frequency. Cough VAS was analyzed using MMRM to evaluate the results of the 2-period cross-over study. The derived change measured at each dose were the repeated measures.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 7, and Day 14 (Period 1 and Period 2)</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis population includes all randomized participants who had a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline frequency values, were enrolled into the study under protocol amendment 3, and had otherwise complied with the protocol without any major protocol deviations. Participants enrolled prior to protocol amendment 3 were not included in the efficacy analysis.</population>

        <title>MMRM Analysis of Change From Baseline in Cough Quality of Life Questionnaire (CQLQ) (Periods 1 &amp; 2 Combined)</title>
        <description>CQLQ is a 28-item scale that has 4 possible responses: 1 = strongly disagree; 2 = disagree; 3 = agree; 4 = strongly agree. Subjects were instructed to circle only 1 response. The total CQLQ score is the sum of the individual item scores; the lowest possible score is 28 and the highest 112. Low CQLQ scores for both total and the 6 domains indicate less impact of cough on health-related quality of life. A negative result indicates a decrease in cough impact on quality of life. CQLQ was analyzed using MMRM to evaluate the results of the 2-period cross-over study. The derived change measured at each dose were the repeated measures.</description>

        <title>MMRM Analysis of Change From Baseline in Total Daily Cough Severity Diary (CSD) Score (Periods 1 &amp; 2 Combined)</title>
        <description>The daily CSD Score is calculated using the daily CSD instrument, a 7-item, disease specific, patient-reported outcome measure with a recall period of &quot;today&quot; (the current day). The measure evaluates frequency of cough (3 items); intensity of cough (2 items); and sleep disruption due to cough (2 items). Each of these 7 items is rated on an 11-point scale, ranging from 0 (best) to 10 (worst), with higher scores indicating greater severity. The total daily CSD score is the sum of these 7 item scores (Min=0, Max=70). Baseline CSD score = average of CSD scores at screening and baseline. A negative result indicates a decrease in cough severity, while a positive result indicates an increase in cough severity. CSD was analyzed using MMRM to evaluate the results of the 2-period cross-over study. The derived change measured at each dose were the repeated measures.</description>

        <title>MMRM Analysis of Change From Baseline in University of California San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD SOBQ) (Periods 1 &amp; 2 Combined)</title>
        <description>UCSD SOBQ is a 24-point item scale to assess shortness of breath questionnaire that has a 6-point scale ranging from 0 to 5 (0 = &quot;not at all&quot;, to 5 = &quot;maximal or unable to do because of breathlessness&quot;. Lowest possible score is 0 and the highest possible score is 120. The higher the score the more out of breath the participant is reporting. A negative value indicates less breathlessness. UCSD SOBQ was analyzed using MMRM to evaluate the results of the 2-period cross-over study. The derived change measured at each dose were the repeated measures.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 7, and Day 14 (Period 1 and Period 2)</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis population includes all randomized participants who had a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline frequency values, were enrolled into the study under protocol amendment 3, and had otherwise complied with the protocol without any major protocol deviations. Participants enrolled prior to protocol amendment 3 were not included in the efficacy analysis.</population>

        <title>Pre-dose Baseline Cough Severity CSD (Periods 1 &amp; 2 Combined)</title>
        <description>The daily CSD Score is calculated using the daily CSD instrument, a 7-item, disease specific, patient-reported outcome measure with a recall period of &quot;today&quot; (the current day). The measure evaluates frequency of cough (3 items); intensity of cough (2 items); and sleep disruption due to cough (2 items). Each of these 7 items is rated on an 11-point scale, ranging from 0 (best) to 10 (worst), with higher scores indicating greater severity. The total daily CSD score is the sum of these 7 item scores (Min=0, Max=70). Baseline CSD score = average of CSD scores at screening and baseline.</description>

          <description>The daily CSD Score is calculated using the daily CSD instrument, a 7-item, disease specific, patient-reported outcome measure with a recall period of &quot;today&quot; (the current day). The measure evaluates frequency of cough (3 items); intensity of cough (2 items); and sleep disruption due to cough (2 items). Each of these 7 items is rated on an 11-point scale, ranging from 0 (best) to 10 (worst), with higher scores indicating greater severity. The total daily CSD score is the sum of these 7 item scores (Min=0, Max=70). Baseline CSD score = average of CSD scores at screening and baseline.</description>
          <population>The analysis population includes all randomized participants who had a baseline and at least 1 post-baseline frequency values, were enrolled into the study under protocol amendment 3, and had otherwise complied with the protocol without any major protocol deviations. Participants enrolled prior to protocol amendment 3 were not included in the efficacy analysis.</population>
