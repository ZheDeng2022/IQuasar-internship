      The limbus located between the cornea and the conjunctiva tissue, is important for not only&#xD;
      providing a barrier frontier to prevent conjunctival tissue invasion into the cornea,&#xD;
      containing nerves passing to the cornea, having blood and lymph vasculature for oxygen and&#xD;
      nutrient delivery, but also the niche environment of limbal stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, in vivo image systems are not able to visualize or identify the limbal stem cells&#xD;
      directly. One alternative practical is to visualize the histological morphology of palisades&#xD;
      of Vogt (POV), and to speculate the possible status of the stem cells accordingly. Slit-lamp&#xD;
      biomicroscope can be used routinely for clinical examination of the limbal morphology.&#xD;
      However, this technology does not allow for high resolution imaging of structural details and&#xD;
      only up to 20% of patients can be identified. In vivo confocal microscopy has been used to&#xD;
      visualize the POV and can provide cellular level resolution images, but the technique is&#xD;
      limited by high magnification that restricts the area of the scan, and requires contact with&#xD;
      the eye. Besides, both slit lamp biomicroscopy and in vivo confocal microscopy have the&#xD;
      limitation of not being able to give an overall view of the dimension and structure of the&#xD;
      whole palisades region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a noninvasive, rapid and&#xD;
      reproducible technique to evaluate the anterior segment and can also provide in vivo spatial&#xD;
      information. The purpose of the study is to assess the role of aging and regions on the&#xD;
      limbus.&#xD;

      The limbus located between the cornea and the conjunctiva tissue, approximately 1.5 mm wide&#xD;
      in adult human eyes, is important for not only providing a barrier frontier to prevent&#xD;
      conjunctival tissue invasion into the cornea, containing nerves passing to the cornea, having&#xD;
      blood and lymph vasculature for oxygen and nutrient delivery, but also the niche environment&#xD;
      of limbal stem cells. The human limbus contains radially oriented fibrovascular rides named&#xD;
      palisades of Vogt (POV), a unique tissue first noted in 1866 and were further described in&#xD;
      detail in 1921. The POV has unique structure, configuration and dimension which was commonly&#xD;
      found in all types of epithelial stem cell niche all over the body, which include the&#xD;
      complicated niche area providing a safe place to protect the stem cells from damage or&#xD;
      injury. During the past few years, progress in stem cell research and cell therapy has&#xD;
      focused attention on the POV as the location of the stem cells that keep the corneal&#xD;
      epithelial homeostasis and clarity. The POV also provide the niche environment for limbal&#xD;
      stem cells. The niche cells surrounding the limbal stem cells, the stromal environment&#xD;
      underneath the limbal epithelial cells, the blood vessels and nerve innervation around the&#xD;
      limbal epithelium all help create the unique niche environment for limabl stem cells.&#xD;
      Understanding the limbal structure, especially the POV, is necessary for the treatment of&#xD;
      limbal damage and the development of stem cell therapies targeted at restoring impaired&#xD;
      function of limbal stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, in vivo image systems are not able to visualize or identify the limbal stem cells&#xD;
      directly. One alternative practical is to visualize the histological morphology of POV, and&#xD;
      to speculate the possible status of the stem cells accordingly. However, the microstructure&#xD;
      of POV is not well defined or understood in spite of awareness of it's importance. Slit-lamp&#xD;
      biomicroscope can be used routinely for clinical examination of the limbal morphology.&#xD;
      However, this technology does not allow for high resolution imaging of structural details and&#xD;
      only up to 20% of patients can be identified. In vivo confocal microscopy has been used to&#xD;
      visualize the POV and can provide cellular level resolution images, but the technique is&#xD;
      limited by high magnification that restricts the area of the scan. In addition, in vivo&#xD;
      confocal microscopy requires direct contact with the eye. Although the quality of these&#xD;
      images is impressive, the disadvantages existed included the direct contact during&#xD;
      examination, the small field of view (~200μm x 200μm), and the limited axial resolution.&#xD;
      Besides, both slit lamp biomicroscopy and in vivo confocal microscopy have the limitation of&#xD;
      not being able to give an overall view of the dimension and structure of the whole palisades&#xD;
      region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging modality that allows for non-invasive&#xD;
      imaging of the morphology of biological tissue with micrometer scale resolution at imaging&#xD;
      depths of 1-2mm below the tissue surface. During these few years, OCT has become a useful&#xD;
      clinical and research tool for imaging of the ocular surface. In addition to the mostly used&#xD;
      application for observing the optic disc and retinal choroidial structure, the usage in the&#xD;
      anterior segment, especially cornea, was also widely developed. An anterior segment OCT&#xD;
      (Visante; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA), a time-domain OCT, is a commercial available OCT&#xD;
      designed for especially for anterior segment. This OCT instrument has been used widely in&#xD;
      LASIK, different lamellar keratoplasties, keratoconus screening and evaluation of corneal&#xD;
      diseases in different layers. However, its limited resolution does not allow for the&#xD;
      observation of the epithelial layer on the ocular surface. Spectral domain OCT with a corneal&#xD;
      module can provide much better resolution than time domain OCT for the observation of&#xD;
      epithelial layer on ocular surface. It has been used recently to evaluate the corneal&#xD;
      epithelial layer with reliable results. In this study, we use a fourier-domain optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography OCT (RTvue, Optovue Inc., Fremont, CA), with a corneal-anterior module&#xD;
      long lens adapter with low magnification, to observe the limbal structure (POV). The purpose&#xD;
      of the study is to assess the role of aging and regions on the limbus.&#xD;
