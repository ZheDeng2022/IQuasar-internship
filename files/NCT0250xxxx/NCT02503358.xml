  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects and the best dose of selumetinib&#xD;
      when given together with paclitaxel as a second line therapy in treating patients with stage&#xD;
      IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Selumetinib may stop or slow the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking a protein called mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) that is needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Giving selumetinib together with paclitaxel may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of three pre-planned arms of continuous,&#xD;
      intermittent, and pulsatile selumetinib with paclitaxel as second-line treatment in patients&#xD;
      with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the preliminary clinical response of continuous, intermittent, and pulsatile&#xD;
      selumetinib with paclitaxel as second-line treatment in patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients&#xD;
      treated with selumetinib/paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess correlations between cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) molecular&#xD;
      features from blood and molecular features and pathways from the biopsy samples, and use this&#xD;
      as a surrogate measure of tumor response and duration of response as evaluated in the primary&#xD;
      and secondary objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-finding study of selumetinib. The goal is to find out what dose and&#xD;
      dosing schedule is the most effective in this population. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 and paclitaxel&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over a fixed rate on days 1 and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive selumetinib PO BID on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19 and paclitaxel as in&#xD;
      Arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Patients receive selumetinib PO BID on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and paclitaxel as&#xD;
      in Arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all three arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients experiencing clinical benefit from study&#xD;
      treatment may continue treatment based on the principal investigator (PI) approval on a&#xD;
      patient-by-patient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 8 weeks for&#xD;
      12 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;
