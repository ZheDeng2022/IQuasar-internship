    <time_frame>Up to Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Composite endpoint defined as number of days from start of treatment to 30 days thereafter during which subject is:&#xD;
Alive. However, if patient dies within these 30-days then PVFDs will be zero even if there is a period during which subject is alive and free of both vasopressor treatment and mechanical ventilation;&#xD;
Free of treatment with vasopressors: Less than 60 min during any contiguous 24-h period. If a patient requires vasopressors longer than 60 min in total during any 24-h period, the intervening intervals during which they are free of vasopressors will not be included in the determination of PVFDs;&#xD;
Free of any mechanical ventilation: Less than 60 min during any contiguous 24-h period. If a patient requires mechanical ventilation longer than 60 min in total during any 24-h period, the intervening intervals during which they are not receiving mechanical ventilation will not be included in the period free of mechanical ventilation in the determination of PVFDs.</description>

    <measure>Utility, Based on the EuroQol Group's 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) Questionnaire, up to Day 180</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Days 30, 60, 90 and 180</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQoL-5-Dimensions (EQ-5D™) was used to assess the overall health of each subject. EQ-5D™ is a standardised instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. The first part of the instrument includes 5 dimensions where the subject indicates which of the given statements best describes the health state on the day of questionnaire completion. The second part contains a visual analogue scale (VAS) where the subject indicates how good or bad his or her own health is on the day of questionnaire completion.&#xD;
EQ-5D-5L will be analyzed by the index value (Range: 0-1; 0=dead state, 1=full health state), the overall quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and the VAS score (Range: 0-100; 0=worst health state, 100=best health state). The EQ-5D-5L was completed at baseline and at the scheduled follow-up days (i.e. Day 30, Day 60, Day 90, and Day 180).&#xD;
Data for EQ VAS score and EQ-5D-5L index score are reported in this endpoint.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 63 sites were authorized to recruit subjects for the trial between July 2015 and August 2017. Eleven of these sites did not recruit any subjects. The trial sites that randomized subjects to the trial were: 11 in Belgium, 5 in Denmark, 17 in France, 5 in the Netherlands, and 14 in the United States of America (USA).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 6377 subjects were screened, of which 868 subjects were randomized (585 subjects were allocated to selepressin [three doses] and 283 subjects were allocated to placebo).&#xD;
Up to four dosing regimens of selepressin were planned to be investigated in the trial. However, the highest dosing regimen was not used.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects With New Organ Dysfunction and New Organ Failure (Based on the SOFA Score) up to Day 7 and Day 30</title>
        <description>The presence of 5 organ dysfunctions (cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic, coagulation) was assessed using a SOFA score. Each organ has a possible dysfunction score of 0 (no organ dysfunction) to 4 (all organs with dysfunction).&#xD;
Incidence of new organ dysfunction is defined as an increase ≥ 1 from baseline to post baseline up until the end of the period (e.g. going from 1-2) in any of the individual SOFA scores.&#xD;
Incidence of new organ failures is defined as a change in any of the individual SOFA scores from (0-2) at baseline to (3-4) post baseline up until the end of the period (Day 7 or 30) (if the SOFA scores goes from (0-2) to (3-4) and back to (0-2) again within the period, that will still count as a new organ failure).&#xD;
Percentage of subjects with new organ dysfunction and new organ failure (based on the SOFA Score) up to Day 7 and Day 30 are reported.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to Day 7 and Day 30</time_frame>
        <population>The FAS comprised of all subjects who were enrolled (i.e. randomized [as planned]) and dosed. The primary comparison to determine statistical and clinical significance was between all subjects in all selepressin arms (pooled together and treated as a single arm) and all subjects in the placebo arm, to control Type 1 error.</population>

          <description>The presence of 5 organ dysfunctions (cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic, coagulation) was assessed using a SOFA score. Each organ has a possible dysfunction score of 0 (no organ dysfunction) to 4 (all organs with dysfunction).&#xD;
Incidence of new organ dysfunction is defined as an increase ≥ 1 from baseline to post baseline up until the end of the period (e.g. going from 1-2) in any of the individual SOFA scores.&#xD;
Incidence of new organ failures is defined as a change in any of the individual SOFA scores from (0-2) at baseline to (3-4) post baseline up until the end of the period (Day 7 or 30) (if the SOFA scores goes from (0-2) to (3-4) and back to (0-2) again within the period, that will still count as a new organ failure).&#xD;
Percentage of subjects with new organ dysfunction and new organ failure (based on the SOFA Score) up to Day 7 and Day 30 are reported.</description>
          <population>The FAS comprised of all subjects who were enrolled (i.e. randomized [as planned]) and dosed. The primary comparison to determine statistical and clinical significance was between all subjects in all selepressin arms (pooled together and treated as a single arm) and all subjects in the placebo arm, to control Type 1 error.</population>

        <title>Utility, Based on the EuroQol Group's 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) Questionnaire, up to Day 180</title>
        <description>The EuroQoL-5-Dimensions (EQ-5D™) was used to assess the overall health of each subject. EQ-5D™ is a standardised instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. The first part of the instrument includes 5 dimensions where the subject indicates which of the given statements best describes the health state on the day of questionnaire completion. The second part contains a visual analogue scale (VAS) where the subject indicates how good or bad his or her own health is on the day of questionnaire completion.&#xD;
EQ-5D-5L will be analyzed by the index value (Range: 0-1; 0=dead state, 1=full health state), the overall quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and the VAS score (Range: 0-100; 0=worst health state, 100=best health state). The EQ-5D-5L was completed at baseline and at the scheduled follow-up days (i.e. Day 30, Day 60, Day 90, and Day 180).&#xD;
Data for EQ VAS score and EQ-5D-5L index score are reported in this endpoint.</description>

          <title>Utility, Based on the EuroQol Group's 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) Questionnaire, up to Day 180</title>
          <description>The EuroQoL-5-Dimensions (EQ-5D™) was used to assess the overall health of each subject. EQ-5D™ is a standardised instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. The first part of the instrument includes 5 dimensions where the subject indicates which of the given statements best describes the health state on the day of questionnaire completion. The second part contains a visual analogue scale (VAS) where the subject indicates how good or bad his or her own health is on the day of questionnaire completion.&#xD;
EQ-5D-5L will be analyzed by the index value (Range: 0-1; 0=dead state, 1=full health state), the overall quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and the VAS score (Range: 0-100; 0=worst health state, 100=best health state). The EQ-5D-5L was completed at baseline and at the scheduled follow-up days (i.e. Day 30, Day 60, Day 90, and Day 180).&#xD;
Data for EQ VAS score and EQ-5D-5L index score are reported in this endpoint.</description>

        <title>Utility, Based on the EuroQol Group's 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) Questionnaire, up to Day 180</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D™ was used to assess the overall health of each subject. EQ-5D™ is a standardised instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. The first part of the instrument includes 5 dimensions where the subject indicates which of the given statements best describes the health state on the day of questionnaire completion. The second part contains a VAS where the subject indicates how good or bad his or her own health is on the day of questionnaire completion.&#xD;
EQ-5D-5L will be analyzed by the index value (Range: 0-1; 0=dead state, 1=full health state), the overall QALY, and the VAS score (Range: 0-100; 0=worst health state, 100=best health state). The EQ-5D-5L was completed at baseline and at the scheduled follow-up days (i.e. Day 30, Day 60, Day 90, and Day 180).&#xD;
