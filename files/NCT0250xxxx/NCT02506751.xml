    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of synthetic T3, liothyronine. It will&#xD;
      establish if there are changes in MS symptoms and if there is a positive effect on markers of&#xD;
      neuronal health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS) that is characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration. It remains&#xD;
      the most common non-traumatic cause of neurologic disability in young adults and presents in&#xD;
      most patients as relapsing-remitting disease. Relapses, caused by inflammatory demyelination,&#xD;
      can result in a significant amount of neurological disability and reduced health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, and having frequent early relapses is associated with increased risk of&#xD;
      longer-term disability. Clinical recovery from early relapses is incomplete in approximately&#xD;
      half of patients with MS. The mechanisms underlying relapse recovery are not completely&#xD;
      understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remyelination of acutely denuded axons is one mechanism by which relapse recovery may occur.&#xD;
      Remyelination is suspected to occur via newly differentiated oligodendrocytes, which are&#xD;
      derived from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in the CNS. However, despite the presence&#xD;
      of this innate repair mechanism, many patients go on to develop progressive functional&#xD;
      disability. This may be due to a failure of remyelination or because of progressive axonal&#xD;
      injury. Chronic demyelinating lesions are surrounded by OPCs and premyelinating&#xD;
      oligodendrocytes, which suggest that failed remyelination does occur and could be partially&#xD;
      due to incomplete oligodendrocyte differentiation. Additionally, recent studies have&#xD;
      highlighted the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction, perhaps related to oxidative stress&#xD;
      or increased energy demands, in mediating MS disease progression. Mitochondrial dysfunction&#xD;
      may drive axonal degeneration with resultant neurodegeneration and progressive neurological&#xD;
      decline (progressive MS). While numerous immune modulating therapies exist, currently, there&#xD;
      is an urgent need for novel therapies that have neuroreparative and neuroprotective&#xD;
      properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thyroid hormones may play a direct role in remyelination and repair in the adult CNS by&#xD;
      promoting maturation of oligodendrocytes. Further, thyroid hormones have been shown to reduce&#xD;
      oxidative stress and thus may have the capacity to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction as well.&#xD;
      Since tri-iodothyronine (T3) is believed to mediate the most important thyroid hormone&#xD;
      actions, liothyronine (synthetic form of T3) has the potential to induce reparative&#xD;
      mechanisms and limit secondary neurodegeneration in MS. In mice, T3 administration has shown&#xD;
      to help facilitate recovery from cuprizone-induced demyelination. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to perform a phase 1 study in patients with MS to establish a tolerable&#xD;
      dose of liothyronine, evaluate the safety of this medication, determine whether it impacts&#xD;
      function, and evaluate if it is associated with changes in neurotrophic and/or inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).&#xD;
