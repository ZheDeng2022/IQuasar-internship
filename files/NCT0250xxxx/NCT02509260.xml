      Many strategies have been attempted to reduce SSI rates. The Centers for Medicare and&#xD;
      Medicaid Services introduced the Surgical Care Improvement Project infection project with the&#xD;
      aim of reducing SSI incidence and morbidity. These measures include prophylactic intravenous&#xD;
      antibiotics administered within 1 hour of skin incision, appropriate prophylactic antibiotic&#xD;
      selection, discontinuation of prophylactic antibiotics within 24 hours after surgery,&#xD;
      appropriate hair removal, and maintenance of perioperative normothermia. Despite the&#xD;
      enforcement of these measures through quality reporting and pay-for-performance measures,&#xD;
      significant controversy exists as to their overall effectiveness, especially in the high-risk&#xD;
      colorectal surgical population. Laparoscopic surgery has been shown to improve SSI rates in&#xD;
      the colorectal population; however, not all patients are appropriate candidates for this&#xD;
      approach and the inability of promising interventions such as wound edge protection and&#xD;
      gentamicin sponges to improve SSI rates following colorectal surgery mandate the&#xD;
      investigation of novel techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to assess the clinical effectiveness of incisional NPWT to&#xD;
      reduce SSI rates in open, re-operative colorectal surgery. The primary endpoint of this study&#xD;
      is the occurrence of superficial SSI within 30 days after surgery and the secondary endpoints&#xD;
      include length of hospital stay and cost effectiveness.&#xD;

      Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a common problem and a significant cause of morbidity in&#xD;
      surgical patients. They present a substantial burden to the health care system in the United&#xD;
      States and contribute more than 1.6 billion dollars in excess cost and 1 million in extra&#xD;
      hospital days in affected patients. SSIs are associated with a multitude of complications&#xD;
      including an increased risk of incisional hernia and prolonged hospital stay. Despite optimum&#xD;
      surgical care there remains an inability to significantly reduce SSI rates following&#xD;
      colorectal surgery and this field represents a critical priority for study. When one examines&#xD;
      the control arms of recent high quality randomized controlled trials, the SSI rate following&#xD;
      colorectal surgery ranges from 22.0-26.1%, emphasizing the prevalence of this complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many strategies have been attempted to reduce SSI rates. The Centers for Medicare and&#xD;
      Medicaid Services introduced the Surgical Care Improvement Project infection project with the&#xD;
      aim of reducing SSI incidence and morbidity. These measures include prophylactic intravenous&#xD;
      antibiotics administered within 1 hour of skin incision, appropriate prophylactic antibiotic&#xD;
      selection, discontinuation of prophylactic antibiotics within 24 hours after surgery,&#xD;
      appropriate hair removal, and maintenance of perioperative normothermia. Despite the&#xD;
      enforcement of these measures through quality reporting and pay-for-performance measures,&#xD;
      significant controversy exists as to their overall effectiveness, especially in the high-risk&#xD;
      colorectal surgical population. Laparoscopic surgery has been shown to improve SSI rates in&#xD;
      the colorectal population; however, not all patients are appropriate candidates for this&#xD;
      approach and the inability of promising interventions such as wound edge protection6 and&#xD;
      gentamicin sponges4 to improve SSI rates following colorectal surgery mandate the&#xD;
      investigation of novel techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initiated in the orthopaedic literature, a new technique of wound dressing has been described&#xD;
      to reduce SSI. Incisional negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) using devices such as the&#xD;
      Prevena™ involves applying a wound vacuum sponge over a standard wound closure (including&#xD;
      fascial closure and skin closure with staples). The incisional NPWT dressing is then left in&#xD;
      place for 5 to 7 days before removal. A recent retrospective study by Bonds et al. described&#xD;
      the ability of incisional NPWT to reduce SSI rates in open colorectal surgery from&#xD;
      29.3-12.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to assess the clinical effectiveness of incisional NPWT to&#xD;
      reduce SSI rates in open, re-operative colorectal surgery. The primary endpoint of this study&#xD;
      is the occurrence of superficial SSI within 30 days after surgery and the secondary endpoints&#xD;
      include, length of hospital stay and cost effectiveness.&#xD;
