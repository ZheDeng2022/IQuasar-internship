  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective、multicenter、non-comparative interventional case series. 800 breast&#xD;
      cancer patients who have already received chemotherapy prior to this study will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the group, including 400 patients received the anthracyclines followed taxanes&#xD;
      chemotherapy, and the other 400 patients who have received regiments containing no taxanes.&#xD;
      Three tumor tissue slices of all the enrolled patients will be collected for TOP2α assay.&#xD;
      Meanwhile, 10 years followed-up survey will be conducted. The relationship of TOP2α&#xD;
      expression and 5- year or 10-year disease free survival(DFS) and overall survival（OS）will be&#xD;
      identified in this study.&#xD;

      800 breast cancer patients who have received chemotherapy prior to this study will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the group, including 400 patients received the anthracyclines followed taxanes&#xD;
      chemotherapy(Epirubicin 90 mg/m2 d1, Cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2 d1，21days/cycle, 4 cycles,&#xD;
      followed by Docetaxel 75mg/m2,d1, 21days/cycle, 4 cycles;or paclitaxel：Epirubicin 90 mg/m2 d1&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2 d1, 21day/cycle, 4 cycles, followed by paclitaxel 80mg/m2, weekly,&#xD;
      12 wks), and the other 400 patients who have received regiments containing no taxanes&#xD;
      (FEC：5-FU 600mg/m2 d1,Epirubicin 90mg/m2 d1, Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2 d1, 21day/cycle, 6&#xD;
      cycles; or EC: Epirubicin 90mg/m2 d1, Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2 d1,21 day/cycle, 6&#xD;
      cycles).The patients will be enrolled in the groups within one month after chemotherapy.Three&#xD;
      tumor tissue slices of all the enrolled patients will be collected for TOP2α assay.&#xD;
      Meanwhile, 10 years followed-up survey will be conducted. The relationship of TOP2α&#xD;
      expression and 5-year or 10-year disease free survival(DFS) and overall survival（OS）will be&#xD;
      identified in this study.&#xD;
