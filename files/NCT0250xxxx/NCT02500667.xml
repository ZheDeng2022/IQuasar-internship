  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed to assess the effects of Rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      N91115 in healthy subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effects of multiple oral dose administration of rifampin on the&#xD;
      steady state plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of N91115 in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects (n=15) will receive oral doses of N91115 twice daily (approximately every&#xD;
      12 hours) on Study Days 1 through the morning of Day 13. On Study Days 8 through 12, rifampin&#xD;
      administered 600 mg once daily will be added to the N91115 regimen. Study subjects will be&#xD;
      monitored for safety while housed in the clinical research unit (CRU) until discharge on Day&#xD;
      14. Pharmacokinetics will be followed from Study Day 1 through Study Day 14. A follow-up&#xD;
      phone call will be made on Day 20 (1 day). Participation of an individual subject may last up&#xD;
      to approximately 48 days from the time of screening until the end-of-study follow-up call.&#xD;
