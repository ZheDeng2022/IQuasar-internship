      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of online support for diabetes&#xD;
      self-management for patients with Type II diabetes in the Vancouver region. Patients will be&#xD;
      invited to receive 8 online video consultations (total 2.5 hours) with certified healthcare&#xD;
      providers (video calls in a secure Website). Participants will also have access to the use of&#xD;
      an online personal health record -- a place to store healthcare information for the patient&#xD;
      and healthcare provider to view. Patients' ability to care for their diabetes will be&#xD;
      measured at the beginning and the end of the study. Additional measures include glycaemic&#xD;
      control, BMI, waist circumference, diabetes self-efficacy, computer and health literacy,&#xD;
      patient satisfaction with care and perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of the&#xD;
      technology.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a 3-month control-theory-based&#xD;
      online support intervention consisting of 8 online video teleconsultations and access to a&#xD;
      secure online personal health record on self-management behaviours of adults with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, as measured by the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA). Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will include glycemic control, BMI, waist circumference, diabetes self-efficacy,&#xD;
      computer and health literacy, patient satisfaction with care and perceived ease of use and&#xD;
      perceived usefulness of the technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who receive online support for diabetes self-management and access to an online&#xD;
      personal health record will have higher self-management of diabetes scores after they receive&#xD;
      the intervention compared to before the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In British Columbia (BC), an estimated 10.3 percent of the population is expected to have&#xD;
      diabetes by 2020, at an estimated cost to the BC healthcare system of 1.9 billion dollars per&#xD;
      year. Enhancing diabetes self-management has been estimated to be the single most&#xD;
      cost-effective intervention in the primary care setting. Results of telemedicine&#xD;
      interventions for management of diabetes have been mixed; many interventions show promising&#xD;
      improvement in health behaviours, self-efficacy and glycaemic control, while others show&#xD;
      small or no effects. A 2015 meta-analysis of the clinical effectiveness of telemedicine&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials for type 2 diabetes found a significant decrease in HbA1C&#xD;
      overall, with the largest decrease being amongst Internet-based interventions. A recent&#xD;
      Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of computer-based self-management interventions&#xD;
      for adults with type 2 diabetes found that interventions using mobile phones showed a greater&#xD;
      reduction in glycaemic control than did the telehealth interventions overall. A&#xD;
      meta-regression of techniques in 122 healthy eating and physical activity self-management&#xD;
      interventions for diabetes found that self-monitoring explained the greatest amount of&#xD;
      among-study heterogeneity, accounting for 13% of these differences. Self-monitoring is a&#xD;
      component of control theory, which proposes that in order to effectively manage behaviour,&#xD;
      there must be a clear, realistic goal, an action plan for attaining it, a means of monitoring&#xD;
      whether a person is on track, feedback, and opportunities for reviewing goals in the light of&#xD;
      feedback. Providing additional information for behavioural providers through an online&#xD;
      personal health record, and integrating behavioural support with ongoing primary care through&#xD;
      shared action plans, the effectiveness of behavioural support provided online may be&#xD;
      increased. Standard treatment primarily involves management of diabetes through medications&#xD;
      and may involve referral to a diabetes education centre for education about diabetes&#xD;
      self-management. The best method to support patient self-management has not been clearly&#xD;
      identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific outcome to be examined is self-management of type II diabetes as measured by the&#xD;
      Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pre-post intervention study with a multicentre cohort of 125 patients who will be provided&#xD;
      with an online support intervention and followed over three months to evaluate change in&#xD;
      diabetes self-management behaviours and clinical outcomes. We will recruit a total of 125&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes through 12 participating primary care physicians. After consent&#xD;
      is obtained, participants will be provided with training to use the glucometer, online video&#xD;
      teleconsultation tools and online personal health record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Online Support Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online support intervention is designed as a supplement to usual care provided by the&#xD;
      family physician, and will be delivered via the Internet through the company Treatment, Inc.&#xD;
      a West Vancouver-based provider of patient self-care solutions and services (see Treatment&#xD;
      Diabetes Screen shots). The three-month online support intervention involves two primary&#xD;
      components to facilitate patient self-management: 8 online video teleconsultations with a&#xD;
      certified health professional (for a total of 2.5 hours, weekly at first, then bi-monthly)&#xD;
      and access to an online personal health record to promote health care behavioural change.&#xD;
      Certified healthcare professionals will provide the 8 online video teleconsultations and will&#xD;
      provide reports to the primary care provider as needed and at the end of the 3-month&#xD;
      intervention. Participants will also be given a glucose meter (Bayer ContourÂ® Next meter)&#xD;
      from which glucose readings can be uploaded to the online personal health record. The patient&#xD;
      will use their own glucometer strips as provided by the BC government prescription plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is change in diabetes self-management behaviour as measured by the&#xD;
      Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) which includes diet, exercise,&#xD;
      self-monitoring of blood glucose, foot care and smoking. Secondary outcomes include change in&#xD;
      HbA1C, BMI and waist circumference, diabetes self-efficacy, satisfaction with care, and&#xD;
      acceptance of using technology for online support. (See attached document: Measurement&#xD;
      Instruments) The primary care provider will have access to the patient's online information,&#xD;
      including self-monitored glucose values, for review. Participants will complete online&#xD;
      questionnaires at baseline and at end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical power for the study was modeled with a two-tailed paired sample t-test to&#xD;
      test changes in SDSCA from baseline to three months. Published studies using the SDSCA have&#xD;
      shown effects sizes of change in intervention groups ranging from .278 to .53. Thus,&#xD;
      conservatively estimating an effect size of .278, to achieve 80% power at a p &lt;.05&#xD;
      significance level, a sample of 125 participants will be required, assuming a 20%&#xD;
      longitudinal attrition rate. Attrition rates in the 10% to 20% range have been reported in&#xD;
      previous similar Web-based intervention studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-tailed paired sample t-tests will be performed to test for changes in mean&#xD;
      self-management behaviours from baseline to three months. Correlations will explore relations&#xD;
      between the outcome variables and health literacy, computer literacy and the control&#xD;
      variables. Changes across time in the secondary outcomes (clinical outcomes, diabetes&#xD;
      self-efficacy) will also be examined using paired-sample t-tests to explore for trends and&#xD;
      effect sizes for future studies. All tests will be performed using SPSS version 23, with a p&#xD;
      &lt;.05 significance level.&#xD;
