      The objective of ESCAPE-SCD Study is assessment of the effect of sleep apnea on sudden&#xD;
      cardiac death risk and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. The&#xD;
      ESCAPE - SCD Study will address following specific study questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and/or central sleep apnea (CSA) an independent risk&#xD;
           factor of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM)&#xD;
           indicated for ICD/CRT-D implant based on current European Society of Cardiology (ESC)&#xD;
           Guidelines for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can treatment of predominant (&gt;50%) obstructive sleep apnea by appropriate Positive&#xD;
           Airway Pressure (PAP) therapy decrease risk of sudden cardiac arrhythmic death in ICM&#xD;
           patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can treatment of predominant (&gt;50%) obstructive sleep apnea by appropriate PAP therapy&#xD;
           improve cardiovascular outcomes in ICM patients indicated for ICD/CRT-D implant?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does obstructive sleep apnea represent a novel factor that may improve risk&#xD;
           stratification of sudden cardiac death and advance identification of those patients that&#xD;
           will benefit from ICD/CRT-D therapy?&#xD;

      Detailed Study Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is strong evidence that patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy have high cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality, including high risk of sudden cardiac death. Sleep apnea is frequently present in&#xD;
      patients after myocardial infarction/with ischemic cardiomyopathy (approximately in 50% of&#xD;
      patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both central and obstructive sleep apnea are considered as independent risk factors of&#xD;
      worsened prognosis in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).&#xD;
      However, there is no evidence from randomized trials yet providing evidence that sleep apnea&#xD;
      is an independent risk factor leading to an increase in cardiovascular mortality, including&#xD;
      increased risk of sudden cardiac arrhythmic death in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
      There are also no data from randomized trials assessing if treatment of sleep apnea by&#xD;
      positive airway pressure therapy may improve cardiovascular outcomes in these patients,&#xD;
      including reduced risk of sudden cardiac death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICD therapy decreases risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with HFrEF, including patients&#xD;
      with ICM with left ventricular ejection fraction of &lt;35%. Current ESC Guidelines for&#xD;
      implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy for primary prevention of sudden cardiac&#xD;
      death in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy have high sensitivity and high positive&#xD;
      predictive value. A limitation of current guidelines is low specificity and low negative&#xD;
      predictive value. In real clinical practice, it means that less than 1/3 of patients with&#xD;
      heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who get the ICD device for an indication of&#xD;
      primary prevention of sudden cardiac death will receive appropriate ICD discharge. The&#xD;
      remaining 2/3 of patients have no benefit from ICD implantation, and are exposed to risks of&#xD;
      complications resulting from ICD implant, such as inappropriate ICD discharges, lead&#xD;
      dislocation, or even life-threatening complications such as infectious endocarditis or&#xD;
      myocardial perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, improvements of stratification criteria allowing better identification of those&#xD;
      patients with ICM that will have real benefit from ICD therapy, and improvement of long-term&#xD;
      outcomes and cost-benefit of ICD therapy, represent one of the major challenges of modern&#xD;
      cardiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies show that sleep apnea increases the risk of sudden cardiac death in the&#xD;
      population. In other words, sleep apnea represents a treatable condition which is also a&#xD;
      potential risk factor of sudden cardiac death. Some previously non-randomized studies showed&#xD;
      that in patients with HFrEF, both obstructive and central sleep apnea may increase risk of&#xD;
      sudden cardiac arrhythmic death. Contrary to these observations, recently released&#xD;
      preliminary data from the SERVE-HF trial indicate that in patients with HFrEF, treatment of&#xD;
      central sleep apnea by adaptive servo-ventilation therapy increases cardiovascular mortality,&#xD;
      and responsible mechanisms might include increased risk of sudden cardiac death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several pathophysiological mechanisms by which both obstructive and central sleep&#xD;
      apnea may increase risk of sudden cardiac arrhythmic death in ICM patients. Considering the&#xD;
      high prevalence of sleep disordered breathing in patients with ICM, sleep apnea represents a&#xD;
      modifiable risk factor, where proper treatment may decrease risk of sudden cardiac death&#xD;
      and/or improve cardiovascular outcomes in ICM patients. However, randomized studies&#xD;
      specifically addressing the role of sleep apnea in risk of sudden cardiac arrhythmic death in&#xD;
      ICM patients are needed to clarify the existing controversy and provide information highly&#xD;
      needed for routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ESCAPE - SCD Study will address following specific study questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is obstructive sleep apnea and/or central sleep apnea an independent risk factor of&#xD;
           sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with ICM indicated for ICD/CRT-D implant based on&#xD;
           current ESC Guidelines for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can treatment of predominant (&gt;50%) obstructive sleep apnea by appropriate Positive&#xD;
           Airway Pressure (PAP) therapy decrease risk of sudden cardiac arrhythmic death in ICM&#xD;
           patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can treatment of predominant (&gt;50%) obstructive sleep apnea by appropriate PAP therapy&#xD;
           improve cardiovascular outcomes in ICM patients indicated for ICD/CRT-D implant?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does obstructive sleep apnea represent a novel factor that may improve risk&#xD;
           stratification of sudden cardiac death and advance identification of those patients that&#xD;
           will benefit from ICD/CRT-D therapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, randomized, international multi-centric study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      900 patients with ICM indicated for ICD/CRT-D implant based on 2012 and 2013 ESC Guidelines&#xD;
      for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (see Section: &quot;References&quot;) will be enrolled&#xD;
      in this study. A sleep study will be performed in each of the subjects and based on results&#xD;
      patients will be divided to 4 Groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ No or Mild Sleep Apnea Group (Group 1): Patients with no or mild sleep apnea will continue&#xD;
      with standard therapy (ICD/CRT-D implant + maximal medical therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with moderate and severe predominant obstructive sleep apnea (AHI &gt;15) will be&#xD;
      randomized in 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obstructive Sleep Apnea - Control Group (Group 2) - patients with predominant&#xD;
           obstructive sleep apnea that will receive standard therapy (ICD/CRT-D implant + maximal&#xD;
           medical therapy), but no PAP therapy for sleep apnea treatment and to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obstructive Sleep Apnea - Active Group (Group 3) - patients with predominant obstructive&#xD;
           sleep apnea that will receive standard therapy (ICD/CRT-D implant + maximal medical&#xD;
           therapy), plus, as intervention, sleep apnea treatment by using PAP therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Central Sleep Apnea Group (Group 4) - patients with predominant central sleep apnea that&#xD;
           will receive standard therapy (ICD/CRT-D implant + maximal medical therapy). Because the&#xD;
           SERVE-HF Trial demonstrated a negative effect of predominantly central sleep apnea&#xD;
           treatment on cardiovascular mortality in patients with HFrEF by using adaptive&#xD;
           servo-ventilation therapy, patients in Group 4 will not receive any PAP therapy for&#xD;
           treatment of sleep disordered breathing and will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distribution of Patient Population among Study Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on data derived from our pilot study, approximately 60% of patients with ischemic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy indicated for ICD/CRT-D implant for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death&#xD;
      have undiagnosed moderate or severe sleep apnea. Therefore, we expect the following&#xD;
      distribution of patients among patients' groups: Group 1: n=400 patients; Group 2: n=200&#xD;
      patients; Group 3: n=200, Group 4: n=100 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of sleep apnea and its treatment on risk of sudden cardiac arrhythmic death&#xD;
           by assessing the number of appropriate ICD/CRT-D discharges for each of the groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of the effect of sleep apnea and OSA treatment on cardiovascular mortality&#xD;
           and morbidity by assessing MACE (Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of incidence of complications resulting from ICD/CRT-D therapy among study&#xD;
           groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of sleep apnea as a novel factor that may improve risk stratification of&#xD;
           sudden cardiac death and advance identification of those patients that will benefit from&#xD;
           ICD/CRT-D therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of sleep apnea treatment on systolic and diastolic functions and neurohumoral&#xD;
           profile&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of prevalence of sleep apnea and its severity among study population&#xD;

      Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This would be the very first randomized study assessing the effect of predominantly&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea treatment on risk of sudden cardiac death and cardiovascular outcomes&#xD;
      in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. The study will also address important questions&#xD;
      related to improvement of selection of patients that may benefit from ICD/CRT-D therapy. We&#xD;
      have solid evidence from our pilot data that addition of sleep disordered breathing screening&#xD;
      and treatment may improve the selection of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy that can&#xD;
      benefit from ICD therapy, including improvement their long-term outcomes. Use of technologies&#xD;
      for telemonitoring of efficiency of sleep disordered breathing treatment and occurrence of&#xD;
      cardiac arrhythmias will increase the scientific strength of the study and will explore the&#xD;
      benefit of use of telemonitoring technologies in daily clinical practice.&#xD;
