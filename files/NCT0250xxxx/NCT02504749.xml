      This study aims to compare the time to regain intestinal motility after general anesthesia&#xD;
      versus spinal anesthesia for cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A double blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics&#xD;
      and Gynecology, Kasr El-Aini Teaching Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo,&#xD;
      Egypt, between July 20 and November 20, 2015. In the study hospital, the total number of&#xD;
      deliveries in 2012 was 15 167, 6244 (41.2%) of which were by cesarean; in 2013, the total&#xD;
      number of deliveries was 16 057, 5200 (32.4%) of which were by cesarean.&#xD;

      The The study protocol was approved by the Scientific Research Committee of the department.&#xD;
      Pregnant women with indication for caesarean section were enrolled after providing informed&#xD;
      consent. It included 450 patients who had caesarean section and were subdivided into two&#xD;
      groups according to a randomization scale.On the day of the operation,each randomly received&#xD;
      a closed opaque envelope for the selection of the procedure(spinal versus general).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were classified into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: General anaesthesia group Group B:Spinal anaesthesia group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are subjected to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients admitted from the outpatient clinic at Kasr El Ainy university Maternity&#xD;
           Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explanation of the procedure to all women participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Informed written consent from every woman participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Full history taking:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Full name,age,telephone number and address.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Past medical history of hypertension,diabetes and other endocrine diseases,also&#xD;
                history of abdominal operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gravidity and parity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-Vital signs(pulse,blood pressure,temperature and respiratory rate). 2-Measurement of weight&#xD;
      in kilograms,height in meters and calculation of body mass index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6-Full laboratory investigations especially Complete blood count,liver functions,kidney&#xD;
      functions,coagulation profile and random blood sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7-Ultrasound assessment of fetal well being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8-All women fasting for at least 8 hours prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anaesthesia steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Standard rapid sequence induction with pre-oxygenation by 100 % OXYGEN FOR 3 MINUTES&#xD;
      FOLLOWED BY 4-5 mg/kg thiopental and 100 mg succinylcholine,cricoid pressure was applied once&#xD;
      necessary.After correct placement of tracheal tube was confirmed,anaesthesia was maintained&#xD;
      with up to 1.5% isoflurane and oxygen,neuromuscular blockade was maintained with 0.4 mg/kg&#xD;
      atracurium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal anaesthesia steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prehydration with 500 ml lactated ringer solution intravenous within 15 minutes in the&#xD;
      sitting position.Low back was prepared and drapped in a sterile fashion with Betadine&#xD;
      solution 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal anaesthesia performed at L 2-3 or L 3-4 intervertebral space using a fine needle size&#xD;
      22 G.Injection of local anaesthetics into the subarachnoid space,Bupivacaine(marcaine) 1.5&#xD;
      -3.5 ml used.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  The abdomen opened in layers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The peritoneum opened by elevating it with two clamps placed 2 cm apart. It is incised&#xD;
           sharply superiorly to the upper pole of the incision and downward to just above bladder&#xD;
           reflection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The lower peritoneal flap elevated and gentle blunt bladder dissection done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transverse incision of the lower uterine segment.&#xD;

           bowel motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinically significant ileus was considered with appearance of group of&#xD;
           manifestations(persisting more than 24 hours or requiring nasogastric tube placement)&#xD;
           which include absent or hypo active bowel sounds,abdominal distension and more than&#xD;
           three episodes of vomiting with or without crampy abdominal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible criteria for hospital discharge included:stable vital signs with no febrile&#xD;
           morbidity for at least 24 hours,ability to ambulate and to urinate without&#xD;
           assistance,passage of bowel motion,ability to tolerate solid food without emesis and&#xD;

&#xD;
      The main outcome measures are:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Time of 1 st flatus.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <description>Randomization done by computer generated random number in sealed opaque envolopes.Each patient was given a study information sheet and a consent was signed. Sample size was calculated to prevent type II error. Based on these data, we would need to study 225 cases in each arm to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the rates for the experimental and control groups are equal with a probability of 80%. The type I error probability associated with this test for the null hypothesis is 0.05. We used an uncorrected chi-squared statistic to evaluate this null hypothesis. Additionally, to compensate for discontinuations, we recruited 225 women in each arm.&#xD;
450-pregnant women with an indication for caesarean section were randomly allocated .</description>
