      This is an extension study, to provide continued access to PRO 140 to subjects who complete&#xD;
      participation in PRO140_CD02 and continue to receive clinical benefit and would require PRO&#xD;
      140 to form a viable regimen, in the opinion of the treating physician. The patient&#xD;
      population for this trial are treatment-experienced HIV infected patients with CCR5-tropic&#xD;
      virus who demonstrate evidence of HIV-1 suppression after successfully completed 24 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment in the PRO140_CD02 study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria: Potential subjects are required to meet all of the following criteria&#xD;
        for enrollment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who have completed 24 weeks of treatment in PRO 140_CD 02 study, and&#xD;
             Investigator believes subject requires continued access to PRO 140 in order to&#xD;
             continue deriving clinical benefit and maintain HIV-1 viral suppression&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. HIV-1 RNA â‰¤ 50 copies/ml at T23 Visit in PRO140_CD02 study&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Both male and female patients and their partners of childbearing potential must agree&#xD;
             to use 2 medically accepted methods of contraception (e.g., barrier contraceptives&#xD;
             [male condom, female condom, or diaphragm with a spermicidal gel], hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives [implants, injectables, combination oral contraceptives, transdermal&#xD;
             patches, or contraceptive rings], and intrauterine devices) during the course of the&#xD;
             study (excluding women who are not of childbearing potential and men who have been&#xD;
             sterilized).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test prior to&#xD;
             receiving the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Willing and able to participate in all aspects of the study, including use of SC&#xD;
             medication, completion of subjective evaluations, attendance at scheduled clinic&#xD;
             visits, and compliance with all protocol requirements as evidenced by providing&#xD;
             written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria: Potential subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be&#xD;
        excluded from enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Not currently enrolled in PRO 140_CD 02 study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any active infection or malignancy requiring acute therapy (with the exception of&#xD;
             local cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Females who are pregnant, lactating, or breastfeeding, or who plan to become pregnant&#xD;
             during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any other clinical condition that, in the Investigator's judgment, would potentially&#xD;
             compromise study compliance or the ability to evaluate safety measures&#xD;
