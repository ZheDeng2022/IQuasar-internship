  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial pilot study to examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a theoretically based intervention (called ReMind) encompassing two key&#xD;
      components: (a) Resourcefulness Training for parent caregivers, and (b) daily mindfulness&#xD;
      meditation delivered using a smart phone application (Stop, Breathe &amp; Think™) with an&#xD;
      intervention (Mind Only) that consists only of daily mindfulness meditation. Both components&#xD;
      of the intervention have been tested separately (but not combined) and both interventions can&#xD;
      be self-tailored, which meets the vital need for these caregivers to engage in&#xD;
      self-management activities when it is convenient for them. The investigators will test the&#xD;
      two arms of the intervention in 30 parents of technology-dependent children, 15 parents in&#xD;
      each group. The investigators will collect mixed data at baseline, 3 months and 6 months&#xD;
      after subject enrollment to describe changes in proximal and distal outcomes. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the intermediate (3 month) and long-term (6 month) effects of the ReMind and&#xD;
           Mind Only interventions on study mediators (HPA Axis Function and stress, cognitive&#xD;
           factors, resourcefulness) and determine if there are different effects between ReMind&#xD;
           and Mind Only interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the differences in distal psychological (Mental Health Related Quality of Life,&#xD;
           Depressive Cognitions, Depressive Symptoms, Anxiety, Caregiver Burden), physical&#xD;
           (Physical Health Related Quality of Life), and cost outcomes between subjects in the&#xD;
           ReMind and Mind Only arms over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the moderating effects of parents' social support, demographics (age, gender,&#xD;
           family income) and children's functional status on (a) proximal outcomes and the&#xD;
           relationship between (a) the intervention arm and distal outcomes, and (b) HPA Axis&#xD;
           Function, stress, cognitive factors and distal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the impact of decentering on the association between the interventions and the&#xD;
           proximal and distal outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Explore differences in neurological processing (DMN and TPN) and decentering in proximal&#xD;
           and distal outcomes associated with each intervention.&#xD;

      Design Overview. The investigators will conduct a two-arm Randomized Clinical Trial to&#xD;
      compare the effects of the ReMind with the Mind interventions on psychological and physical&#xD;
      health outcomes and cognitive task switching between the DMN and TPN neural networks in&#xD;
      Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). The full&#xD;
      ReMind intervention involves daily self-tailored mindful meditation application focused on&#xD;
      kindness and compassion for 4 weeks with self-selected frequency of use thereafter. The&#xD;
      application that is being used is theoretically constructed and tested and can be delivered&#xD;
      on a smart phone app for free (iPad, computer as well). ReMind also includes five&#xD;
      resourcefulness training aspects: 1) one face-to-face session for teaching social&#xD;
      (help-seeking) and personal (self-help) resourcefulness skills, 2) ongoing web access to&#xD;
      video vignettes of parents of technology-dependent children describing the application of&#xD;
      resourcefulness skills in daily life, 3) 4 weeks of skills' reinforcement using daily journal&#xD;
      writing by the parents, 4) weekly phone calls from the intervention nurse over 4 weeks after&#xD;
      face-to-face intervention training. The Mind Only intervention includes only the meditation&#xD;
      component. Thus, the investigators will be able to see if the addition of Resourcefulness&#xD;
      Training will significantly impact proximal outcomes (self management behaviors) such as&#xD;
      appraised sleep quality, positive health practices and distal outcomes such as psychological&#xD;
      health (Mental Health Related Quality of Life, depressive cognitions, anxiety, caregiver&#xD;
      burden), physical health (Physical Health Related Quality of Life), and economic costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample. A purposive sample of 30 parent caregivers of technology-dependent children (n=15&#xD;
      ReMind, n=15 Mind Only) seen at outpatient clinics (Pulmonology, Gastroenterology,&#xD;
      Trach/Vent). The investigators have used this patient population in prior work. Given the&#xD;
      availability of potential subjects and the investigator's experience with this population,&#xD;
      the investigators anticipate little difficulty in recruiting 30 subjects.&#xD;
