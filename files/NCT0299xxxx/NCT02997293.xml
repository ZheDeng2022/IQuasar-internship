  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study to look at the impact of the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery&#xD;
      system for colorectal surgery (Group 1) in shortening hospital length of stay, reducing&#xD;
      postoperative narcotic consumption, lowering Visual Analog Scale scores, decreasing the&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and reducing 30-day readmission when compared&#xD;
      to patients who had colorectal surgery performed at UAMS prior to the implementation of the&#xD;
      Enhanced Recovery After Surgery system (Group 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective study using de-identified records and therefore will not require&#xD;
      subject enrollment and is NOT Human Subjects Research.&#xD;

      The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery system for perioperative care of patients undergoing&#xD;
      major abdominal surgery, particularly colorectal surgery, was formed in Europe by a surgeon&#xD;
      named Henrik Kehlet in 1994. Dr. Kehlet observed that his patients undergoing colorectal&#xD;
      surgery were hospitalized postoperatively for extended periods of time due to prolonged&#xD;
      return of the normal intestinal physiology and of other bodily functions. Dr. Kehlet&#xD;
      formulated a system of perioperative care that focused on preserving and promoting faster&#xD;
      return of normal physiologic function of the human body following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery system has been implemented in the United States for&#xD;
      nearly a decade now, primarily at major academic institutions. Numerous publications exist&#xD;
      that report the dramatic positive impacts of this program on reducing postoperative hospital&#xD;
      length of stay, reducing 30-day hospital readmissions, and improving patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences implemented several components of the&#xD;
      Enhanced Recovery After Surgery system for colorectal surgery in June 2015. This is an&#xD;
      observational study to look at the impact that program (Group 1) in shortening hospital&#xD;
      length of stay, reducing postoperative narcotic consumption, lowering Visual Analog Scale&#xD;
      scores, decreasing the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and reducing 30-day&#xD;
      readmission when compared to patients who had colorectal surgery performed at University of&#xD;
      Arkansas for Medical Sciences prior to the implementation of the Enhanced Recovery After&#xD;
      Surgery system (Group 2).&#xD;
