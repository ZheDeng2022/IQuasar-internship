  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 / Phase 2 study of newly diagnosed patients with biopsy-proven head and&#xD;
      neck cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) who are undergoing standard radiation therapy and&#xD;
      treatment with cisplatin. BMX-001 added to radiation therapy and cisplatin is expected to&#xD;
      reduce radiation-induced mucositis and xerostomia and also has the potential to benefit the&#xD;
      survival of head and neck cancer patients. In Phase 1, safety and tolerability of BMX-001&#xD;
      will be assessed using a Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) and a maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) will be determined. BMX-001 will be given subcutaneously first with a loading dose zero&#xD;
      to four days prior to the start of chemoradiation and followed by twice a week doses at&#xD;
      one-half of the loading dose for the duration of radiation therapy plus two weeks. In Phase 2&#xD;
      both safety and efficacy of BMX-001 will be evaluated. Impact on mucositis and xerostomia&#xD;
      will also be assessed. A maximum of 48 patients will be enrolled to the MTD dose determined&#xD;
      in Phase 1 to confirm the MTD. The investigators hypothesize that BMX-001 when added to&#xD;
      standard radiation therapy and cisplatin will be safe at pharmacologically relevant doses in&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed head and neck cancer. The investigators also hypothesize that&#xD;
      in Phase 2 of this study the addition of BMX-001 will reduce the severity of&#xD;
      radiation-induced mucositis and xerostomia in patients receiving head and neck radiation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
