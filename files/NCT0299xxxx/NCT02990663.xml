  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure is common and its presence increases the risk of cardiovascular mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity (most notably stroke, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure).&#xD;
      Given blood pressure is normally higher during the day than it is overnight, blood pressure&#xD;
      lowering medications are traditionally taken in the morning. However a randomized trial of&#xD;
      2156 Spanish hypertension patients published in 2010 (&quot;MAPEC&quot;), suggests a large (61%)&#xD;
      reduction in mortality and cardiovascular morbidity if such medications are instead taken at&#xD;
      bedtime. This degree of benefit far exceeds other established methods of cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      reduction - and such a surprisingly large effect requires independent confirmation for&#xD;
      practice to change. BedMed is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial facilitated by over 300&#xD;
      Canadian family physician members of the Pragmatic Trials Collaborative. During the conduct&#xD;
      of this trial consenting hypertensive primary care patients, already established on one or&#xD;
      more antihypertensive medications, will be randomized to either morning or bedtime&#xD;
      antihypertensive use. Patient oriented trial outcomes evaluating both potential benefits and&#xD;
      harms will be drawn largely from administrative health data that is routinely collected on&#xD;
      all residents of Canada's publicly funded health care system. This trial is being conducted&#xD;
      in 5 Canadian provinces and will continue to collect data until the end of 2022, at which&#xD;
      point 250 primary outcome events are anticipated.&#xD;

      THE OPPORTUNITY BEDTIME PRESCRIBING MIGHT PROVIDE: Blood pressure normally exhibits a&#xD;
      circadian rhythm with relatively lower pressures during sleep.(Ref 1) Lack of this sleep time&#xD;
      &quot;dip&quot; correlates strongly with adverse cardiovascular events and BP correlates most strongly&#xD;
      with such events when measured at night (i.e. during sleep).(Ref 2-5) Motivated by such&#xD;
      observations, Spanish researchers studied the effect of taking BP medication at BEDTIME (when&#xD;
      the effect on nighttime BP would be greatest) versus conventional morning use, when most BP&#xD;
      medications are taken. The results of this study (the MAPEC trial) were striking.(Ref 6) Over&#xD;
      a median 5.6 years follow-up, adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 187 of 1084 subjects&#xD;
      taking BP medication in the morning but only 68 of 1072 subjects who took their BP medication&#xD;
      at bedtime (relative risk 0.39, 95%CI [0.29-0.51], p &lt; 0.001). This 61% reduction in adverse&#xD;
      events was similar for all individual components of the primary outcome (including death from&#xD;
      all causes, stroke, MI, new angina pectoris, CHF and retinal artery occlusions). If true, a&#xD;
      switch to bedtime prescribing would have more impact on the health of hypertensive patients&#xD;
      than whether high BP is treated at all. However extraordinary claims require extraordinary&#xD;
      evidence - independent replication of such surprising findings is needed for widespread&#xD;
      practice change to occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BEDMED: The BedMed trial is a pragmatic primary care trial intended to verify whether bedtime&#xD;
      antihypertensive use, as compared to conventional morning use, reduces major adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular events. It is designed as an adaptive randomized registry trial within&#xD;
      community primary care and draws both trial outcomes and baseline covariates from provincial&#xD;
      administrative claims data (vital statistics, hospital separations, physician services,&#xD;
      prescription dispenses, laboratory data). Covariates for the primary analysis will include&#xD;
      province (4 variables), age (continuous), sex, physical frailty (binary - score of 3 or&#xD;
      higher on Tilburg Frailty Indicator Physical Components sub-score), cognitive impairment&#xD;
      (binary - score of 3 or higher on Short Blessed Test), current smoking status,&#xD;
      hospitalization in the 6 months prior to enrolment, ≥3 baseline BP meds (resistant&#xD;
      hypertension), presence/absence of specific diagnoses (diabetes, CHF, stroke/TIA, coronary&#xD;
      artery disease, sleep apnea), ≥ 4 additional non-BP lowering medications (polypharmacy),&#xD;
      kidney disease (a claims data renal insufficiency diagnosis or eGFR less than 40), or&#xD;
      end-stage kidney disease on dialysis. Subgroup analysis based on the presence or absence of&#xD;
      each of these covariates will be carried out (using a threshold of ≥ 70 yrs for age). BedMed&#xD;
      is government funded/facilitated, and has over 400 volunteer primary care providers&#xD;
      recruiting participants in 5 Canadian provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan,&#xD;
      Manitoba, and Ontario). It was originally intended that the trial would continue until 406&#xD;
      primary outcome events were observed, however funding will expire before this occurs. As a&#xD;
      result, BedMed will continue to recruit participants into the fall of 2021 and complete data&#xD;
      collection at the end of 2023, at which time 250 primary outcome events are anticipated&#xD;
      (based on blinded observation of total events amongst all participants in April 2021). The&#xD;
      trial relies heavily on a collaboration between the volunteer family physicians of the&#xD;
      Pragmatic Trials Collaborative (www.PragmaticTrials.ca) who will recruit for the trial and&#xD;
      the Alberta SPOR Support Unit's Data Platform - which will facilitate accessing and analyzing&#xD;
      the relevant administrative databases from multiple provinces&#xD;
      (http://www.aihealthsolutions.ca/initiatives-partnerships/spor/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIURETIC SUB-STUDY: The &quot;adaptive&quot; element of the BedMed trial design refers to an interim&#xD;
      examination of bedtime diuretic tolerance. Although it is commonly believed that diuretics&#xD;
      can't be taken at bedtime without inducing unwanted nocturia, the sparse evidence in the&#xD;
      literature suggests this may not be the case.(Ref 7,8) Rather than excluding patients whose&#xD;
      only medication is a diuretic the investigators will instead initially include such patients&#xD;
      and evaluate bedtime diuretic tolerance early on in the trial to determine whether or not&#xD;
      such patients should continue to be enrolled. Specifically, upon allocating to bedtime dosing&#xD;
      203 patients whose only BP medication is an AM diuretic, the investigators will analyze&#xD;
      6-week compliance to bedtime allocation for all participants with a single morning BP&#xD;
      medication (of all types). If diuretic compliance is worse, the &quot;adaptive&quot; trial design will&#xD;
      exclude enrolment of additional patients whose only BP medication is a diuretic. The BedMed&#xD;
      investigators will report on bedtime diuretic tolerance separate from (and in advance of) the&#xD;
      main BedMed analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERIM SAFETY ANALYSIS: An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) organized and&#xD;
      chaired by Jim Wright (Cochrane Hypertension Review Group Coordinating Editor) will review&#xD;
      all data in March 2022, at which time approximately 200 events are expected. If p is ≤ 0.001&#xD;
      for benefit (the Haybittle-Peto boundary - recommended to reduce the chance of stopping too&#xD;
      early and magnifying benefit), or if p is ≤ 0.05 for harm, the DSMB will apply clinical&#xD;
      judgement and make recommendations to the steering committee on whether the trial should&#xD;
      break early.&#xD;
