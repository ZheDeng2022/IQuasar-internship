  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In July 2016, the demand for yellow fever vaccines in response to the large urban outbreaks&#xD;
      occurring concurrently and the risk of further spread through the African continent and even&#xD;
      to Asia, was larger than the available supply. In this situation, the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) developed recommendations for the use of fractional-dose of yellow fever&#xD;
      vaccine as a dose-sparing strategy. These recommendations were based on limited number of&#xD;
      clinical trials and additional studies should assess the applicability of the fractional dose&#xD;
      to all WHO-prequalified vaccines, the persistence of neutralizing antibodies and the&#xD;
      performance of the fractional dose in young children and populations in Africa including&#xD;
      those with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to respond to some of the research questions that would allow broadening the&#xD;
      recommendations on the use of fractional doses of yellow fever vaccine in emergency&#xD;
      situations. The study will be conducted in Uganda and Kenya and the main objective is to&#xD;
      assess the non-inferiority is seroconversion 28 days after vaccination of a fractional dose&#xD;
      compared to full dose for each WHO-prequalified manufacturer. As secondary objectives the&#xD;
      study will assess seroprotection 10 days and 1 year after vaccination, to assess rapidity and&#xD;
      persistence of protective antibody levels; describe the geometric mean titre and the change&#xD;
      in neutralizing antibody on Day 28 days after vaccination with fractional and full doses; and&#xD;
      assess the occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events (SAE) during 28 days after&#xD;
      administration of fractional and full doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a randomized non-inferiority trial. The study aims to start in April&#xD;
      2017 in the two sites and aims to recruit 960 adults. Results for the main outcome will be&#xD;
      reviewed by the study Data and Safety Monitoring Board and one vaccine will be selected for&#xD;
      the studies in children and HIV positive adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Yellow fever (YF) is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is endemic in 34 countries in the&#xD;
      African region and 14 in South America. YF virus infection can be asymptomatic or cause a&#xD;
      wide spectrum of disease, from mild symptoms to severe, potentially lethal illness with&#xD;
      jaundice, renal failure and haemorrhage. The vast majority of reported cases and deaths occur&#xD;
      in sub-Saharan Africa where yellow fever is a major health problem occurring in epidemic&#xD;
      patterns. There is no specific treatment for yellow fever infection. However, YF vaccine is&#xD;
      shown to be very effective for outbreak control as well as for the prevention of outbreaks.&#xD;
      YF vaccination confers protection in most vaccinated individuals and this is considered to be&#xD;
      life-long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016, YF outbreaks occurred in Africa (Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and&#xD;
      Uganda) as well as in South America (Brazil, Colombia and Peru). Factors such increased&#xD;
      urbanization in poor areas without proper water and sanitation systems and population&#xD;
      movements, have the potential to contribute to increasing incidence of yellow fever and large&#xD;
      epidemics. In July 2016, the demand for yellow fever vaccines in response to the large urban&#xD;
      outbreaks occurring concurrently and the risk of further spread through the African continent&#xD;
      and even to Asia, was larger than the available supply. In this situation, the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) developed recommendations for the use of fractional-dose of yellow fever&#xD;
      vaccine as a dose-sparing strategy. This strategy consisted on delivering 1/5th of the&#xD;
      conventional dose and was used to vaccinate over 7 million people in Kinshasa, the capital&#xD;
      city of DRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evidence to recommend the use of fractional dosing was based on a limited number of&#xD;
      clinical studies. However this was considered sufficient to provide emergency&#xD;
      recommendations. In order to broaden and also possibly simplify WHO recommendations of&#xD;
      fractional dose use in case of need for emergency campaigns, additional data is needed to&#xD;
      respond to the important data gaps. These include the applicability of the fractional dose to&#xD;
      all WHO-prequalified vaccines, the persistence of neutralizing antibodies and the performance&#xD;
      of the fractional dose in young children and populations in Africa including those with HIV.&#xD;
      Following these data gaps, WHO called for research to be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to respond to some of the research questions that would allow to broaden the&#xD;
      recommendations on the use of fractional doses of yellow fever vaccine in emergency&#xD;
      situations. The study will be conducted in Uganda and Kenya and the main objective is to&#xD;
      assess the non-inferiority is seroconversion 28 days after vaccination of a fractional dose&#xD;
      compared to full dose for each manufacturer. As secondary objectives the study will assess&#xD;
      seroprotection 10 days and 1 year after vaccination, to assess rapidity and persistence of&#xD;
      protective antibody levels; describe the geometric mean titre and the change in neutralizing&#xD;
      antibody on Day 28 after vaccination with fractional and full doses; and assess the&#xD;
      occurrence of adverse events and serious adverse events (SAE) during 28 days after&#xD;
      administration of fractional and full doses. The study aims to recruit 960 adults (480 in&#xD;
      Mbarara, Uganda, and 480 in Kilifi, Kenya). Results for the main outcome will be reviewed by&#xD;
      the study Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and if results are considered satisfactory,&#xD;
      the study will continue with the recruitment of 420 children in Uganda and 250 HIV infected&#xD;
      adults in Kenya, to assess non-inferiority of one of the WHO prequalified vaccines.&#xD;
