      Aim 1: To determine whether therapy with Alirocumab, compared to pre-treatment, will&#xD;
      effectively improve carotid atherosclerotic plaque characteristics by reducing Ktrans and&#xD;
      LRNC size. To achieve this goal, we will (a) enroll 30 subjects who are intolerant to high&#xD;
      intensity statin therapy and only able to tolerate low potency statin or low weekly dose of&#xD;
      high potency statin and have LDL-C ≥70 mg/dl; (b) initiate alirocumab at 150mg subcutaneously&#xD;
      injection every 2 weeks; (c) perform carotid DCE-MRI scans at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months;&#xD;
      (d) perform quantitative analysis for vascular inflammation and plaque LRNC volume and other&#xD;
      plaque characteristics; (e) compare vascular inflammation and LRNC volume between pre- and&#xD;
      post-alirocumab at 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine associations between reductions in atherogenic lipids (LDL-C, Lp(a),&#xD;
      non-HDL-C) and changes in atherosclerotic plaque characteristics. To achieve this goal, we&#xD;
      will (a) perform laboratory assessments of lipids, lipoproteins and apo-lipoproteins at&#xD;
      baseline and during the study; (b) compare lipids, lipoproteins and apo-lipoproteins levels&#xD;
      between pre- and post-alirocumab; (c) correlate reductions in atherogenic lipids with changes&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque characteristics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute ischemic events caused by atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) are primarily&#xD;
      due to plaque rupture/erosion determined by plaque morphologic characteristics, local&#xD;
      composition and inflammation, which can be directly assessed using magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI). Prospective carotid MRI studies have demonstrated: (1) plaques with thin or ruptured&#xD;
      cap, intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), neovascularization, or larger lipid-rich necrotic core&#xD;
      (LRNC) are strongly associated with occurrence of cerebrovascular and coronary events, (2)&#xD;
      increased LRNC size is significantly associated with increased risk for systemic ASCVD events&#xD;
      after adjusting for LDL-C or Non-HDL-C levels, (3) increased permeability of adventitial vasa&#xD;
      vasorum is associated with presence of IPH which increases plaque burden and LRNC progression&#xD;
      that appears to be resistant to conventional doses of statins, (4) intensive lipid therapy&#xD;
      decreases carotid LRNC and vascular inflammation, (5) multicenter carotid studies can be&#xD;
      conducted with good reproducibility and feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike previous clinical trials evaluating carotid artery disease using ultrasound based&#xD;
      technology that showed a weak relationship to systemic and coronary vascular events, recent&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated predictive value of carotid plaque tissue characteristics for&#xD;
      subsequent systemic ASCVD events including coronary events. Hellings and colleagues found&#xD;
      that carotid plaque composition by histology in 818 patients who underwent endarterectomy is&#xD;
      an independent predictor of future cardiovascular events during long-term post-operative&#xD;
      follow-up. Specifically, those with carotid IPH and increased neovascularization were at&#xD;
      significantly higher risk for ASCVD events. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study&#xD;
      investigators reported that carotid LRNC (HR=1.9, p=0.014) and minimum cap thickness&#xD;
      (HR=0.67, p=0.03), as identified by MRI, were significantly associated with development of&#xD;
      ASCVD including coronary events after adjusting for all clinical risk factors, treatment&#xD;
      variables and biomarkers. The carotid MRI sub-study in AIM-HIGH showed that higher Lp(a)&#xD;
      levels are associated with high-risk plaque features which are prevalent in subjects with&#xD;
      established vascular disease and &quot;well-controlled&quot; LDL-C and blood pressure. Thin or ruptured&#xD;
      cap and a larger LRNC are predictive of systemic ASCVD events that include 83% (15/18) of the&#xD;
      coronary events in AIM-HIGH, meanwhile, none of the clinical risk factors and lipids were&#xD;
      predictive of future events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alirocumab has shown substantial lowering in LDL-C, non-HDL-C and Lp(a), with or without&#xD;
      concomitant statin treatment [43]. It has the potential to be a therapy that can improve&#xD;
      plaque characteristics leading to reduction of ASCVD events. We propose to conduct a carotid&#xD;
      MRI pilot study to demonstrate that adding alirocumab for 12 months, in comparison to&#xD;
      pre-alirocumab therapy, in 30 subjects with documented carotid artery plaques who are not&#xD;
      able to tolerate high intensity statin therapy and have LDL-C ≥70 mg/dl would improve&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque characteristics by reducing Ktrans and LRNC size.&#xD;
