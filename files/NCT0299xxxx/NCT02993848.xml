  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The North American Scapula Consortium (NASCon) is a multi-center injury specific outcomes&#xD;
      registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There currently exists a paucity of outcomes data in the literature on this patient&#xD;
      population. The NASCon registry will be a resource in which investigators can conduct&#xD;
      adequately powered clinical outcomes research resulting in higher quality research with&#xD;
      meaningful results, improved patient care, and evidence-based advancement for the treatment&#xD;
      of scapula fractures. Registries can lead to significant discoveries in comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness specifically in areas where randomized control studies are not possible.&#xD;
      Collecting post-treatment (operative and non-operative) patient outcome data for similar&#xD;
      injury patterns has been shown effective in uncovering optimal standards for treatment.&#xD;

      Number of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated&#xD;
&#xD;
      Year 1 10 Sites 80 Subjects Enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
      Year 2 13 Sites 130 Subjects Enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
      Year 3 16 Sites 170 Subjects Enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
      Year 4 and on going 200 Subjects per year&#xD;
&#xD;
      The North American Scapula Consortium, NASCon is a multi center injury specific outcomes&#xD;
      registry. Patients presenting to participating surgeons with Extra Articular and/or Intra&#xD;
      Articular scapula fracture meeting inclusion criteria will be asked for their signed consent&#xD;
      to participate in the outcomes registry regardless of treatment plan (operative or&#xD;
      non-operative).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification for stated number of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to capture as many patients meeting inclusion criteria from the&#xD;
      enrolling sites as possible. The investigators estimate this to be between 10 and 13 patients&#xD;
      per site, per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating sites: Participating sites will be identified based on their experience and&#xD;
      expertise in scapula repair, their interest in research, and their desire to advance&#xD;
      knowledge and continuing education in this area. Initially, Dr. Peter Cole will personally&#xD;
      invite new sites. Future site recruitment will be approved by Dr. Peter Cole and a selected&#xD;
      board. Sites must have the necessary research infrastructure and be willing and able to&#xD;
      follow all rules and regulations associated with Human Research requirements. They will be&#xD;
      required to submit evidence of site IRB approval prior to initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time point: Day 0&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity: obtain patient consent, x-rays, chart review, data pull from electronic medical&#xD;
      record&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity conducted by: study coordinator at participating NASCon site&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time point: 6 wks , 3 mos, 6 mos, 12 mos, 24 mos&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity: patient questionnaires, Range of Motion, Strength, and x-rays&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following is a list of demographic and treatment variables that will be collected during&#xD;
      the patient's initial enrollment visit as well as from the patient's EMR:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics: Gender, date of birth, dominant hand&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injury: Inclusion indication, radiographic image, date of injury, mechanism of injury, side&#xD;
      of scapular injury, ipsilateral UE fractures, other SSSC lesions, other system injuries, Ada&#xD;
      &amp; AO/OTA Classifications, prior treatment, and workman's compensation status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Data (when applicable): Date of surgery, operative time, estimated blood loss, other&#xD;
      procedures, subsequent shoulder procedures required, scapula operative approach, type of&#xD;
      implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following is a list of outcome variables that will be collected during each follow-up&#xD;
      clinic visit as well as from the patient's EMR:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Information: Physical Therapy, activity level, return to work, pain/pain medication,&#xD;
      complications, subsequent procedures, radiographic image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Range of Motion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 14 inch goniometer will be used to evaluate flexion, abduction, external rotation, internal&#xD;
      rotation on injured and contralateral shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A handheld dynamometer (MicroFET 2, Hoggan Health Industries, Draper, Utah), which has been&#xD;
      previously published as a reliable technique10, will assess strength in shoulder flexion,&#xD;
      abduction, and external rotation on injured and contralateral shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (DASH). 11&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DASH was developed to measure physical disability and symptoms of the upper extremities&#xD;
      in people with upper extremity disorders (hand, wrist, elbow, and shoulder). It is a 30-item&#xD;
      scale that addresses difficulty in performing various physical activities that require upper&#xD;
      extremity function, stiffness, and impact of disability and symptoms on social activities,&#xD;
      work, sleep, and psychological well-being. The score ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 is&#xD;
      equivalent to no disability and 100 is equivalent to most severe disability. The DASH is a&#xD;
      validated instrument with established normative and minimal clinically important difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SF-12v2&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SF-12v2 is a multipurpose, short-form health survey with 12 questions. The SF-12v2 was&#xD;
      developed in 1994 by The Health Institute as a shortened version of the SF-36 health survey.&#xD;
      It yields an eight-scale profile of scores as well as physical and mental health summary&#xD;
      measures. The eight scales include: physical functioning, role of physical functioning,&#xD;
      mental functioning, role of mental functioning, social function, bodily pain, vitality, and&#xD;
      general health. It is a generic measure, as opposed to one that targets a specific age,&#xD;
      disease, or treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting of Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data, treatment details, and outcome variables will be summarized through&#xD;
      frequencies and proportions, if they are categorical, or through measures of central tendency&#xD;
      (e.g., mean, median) and dispersion (e.g. standard deviation, quartiles) if they are&#xD;
      continuous. Quarterly registry reporting will include enrollment rates, follow-up capture&#xD;
      rates, descriptive summaries of demographic, surgical and outcomes data as well as a&#xD;
      description of any safety events for which the membership or the sponsors should be made&#xD;
      aware. Reports will be shared with the membership and study sponsors on a minimum of an&#xD;
      annual basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication and presentation of outcomes is expected in peer-reviewed orthopaedic journals&#xD;
      and symposia, once substantial data collection and outcomes of ≥1 year post-injury are&#xD;
      accomplished. Additionally, opportunities to describe the establishment of an injury specific&#xD;
      consortium and registry, including experience, process and tools utilized in the development&#xD;
      of such a registry, may be pursued by the membership.&#xD;
