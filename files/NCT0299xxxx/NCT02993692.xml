      The aim of study was to compare the hemodynamic responses and adverse events associated with&#xD;
      nasotracheal intubation (NTI) using a fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) and a direct laryngoscope&#xD;
      (DLS) in children undergoing general anesthesia for outpatient dental surgery. Eighty&#xD;
      children (aged 5-15 years) were scheduled to undergo outpatient dental surgery under general&#xD;
      anesthesia and who required nasotracheal intubation were included.&#xD;

      Investigators obtained confirmation from the Inonu University Medical Faculty Hospital Ethics&#xD;
      Committee (2015/101) and written informed consent from the guardians of all 80 children.&#xD;
      These children, who had a American Society of Anesthesia physical status of I-II, had a&#xD;
      Mallampati Score of 1-2, were aged 5-15 years, were scheduled to undergo outpatient dental&#xD;
      surgery under general anesthesia, and required nasotracheal intubation were included in this&#xD;
      prospective and randomized study. Exclusion criteria included the following: the patient's&#xD;
      refusal for study consent, active upper respiratory infection, airway abnormalities, nasal&#xD;
      mass or nasal injury, bleeding disorders, allergies to anesthetics, uncontrolled&#xD;
      hypertension, morbid obesity, hepatic or renal failure, cardiovascular diseases, a history of&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal surgery and those who were difficult to intubate. Children were randomly&#xD;
      assigned into the direct laryngoscopy group (n = 40) or the fiberoptic bornchoscopy group (n&#xD;
      = 40) according to a computer-randomized table. General anesthesia was administered to&#xD;
      children due to the learning difficulties. The number of models was decided by a statistical&#xD;
      power analysis after the conclusions from the pretest were obtained. All children fasted at&#xD;
      least for 6 h before surgery, and the oral intake of clear fluids was restricted for 2-3 h.&#xD;
      Premedication of midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) was orally administered in apple juice (0.5 mL/kg of&#xD;
      body weight) 1 h prior to anesthesia. After being admitted to the operating room, the&#xD;
      patient's systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) were continually monitored with a&#xD;
      multichannel physiologic monitor and the baseline values for SBP and HR were recorded. Thirty&#xD;
      min before the intubation attempt, the nasal mucosa of both nostrils were anesthetized with a&#xD;
      topical vasoconstrictor (0.05% xylometazoline spray, and 2% lidocaine 1 mL two times in each&#xD;
      nostril) (9) to attenuate cardiovascular responses and adverse events in all children.&#xD;
      Anesthesia was induced with 8% sevoflurane with eight deep breaths via a face mask, and the&#xD;
      patient was maintained on 4% end-tidal sevoflurane, fentanyl 2 µr/kg and rocuronium 0.6&#xD;
      mg/kg. NTI was achieved 2 min after rocuronium injection. The more patent nostril was&#xD;
      selected for intubation. An experienced anesthetist performed all intubations in the study&#xD;
      and an assistant applied the maneuvers (jaw trust) and evaluated the patient during the&#xD;
      postoperative visits. All NTIs, both DLS and FOB, were conducted by the same experienced&#xD;
      anesthetist (the anesthetist had performed DLS and the FOB nasal intubation in more than 150&#xD;
      patients, including in at least 100 children before the study). A study nurse documented the&#xD;
      anesthetic data and timing. In the DLS group, the spiral tube was inserted into the nose and&#xD;
      intubated with a Macintosh laryngoscope according to conventional procedures using Magill&#xD;
      forceps. In the FOB group, NTI was conducted using an FOB with an outer diameter of 3.1 mm&#xD;
      through the selected clear nasal passage with a spiral tracheal tube. The appropriate size of&#xD;
      the tracheal tube for a child was determined with the following formula (10): Internal&#xD;
      diameter (mm) = age/3 + 3.5 in both groups. The same type of tube was used in each group.&#xD;
      Before intubation, enough lidocaine gel was placed on the tracheal tube, and the FOB was&#xD;
      guided into patients with a suitable spiral tracheal tube. All tracheal tubes were cuffed and&#xD;
      heat-softened in warm normal saline and lubricated to reduce mechanic stimuli to airway&#xD;
      structures. During the intubation, the head of the patient was the in supine position, and an&#xD;
      assistant applied a jaw thrust for opening the nasopharyngeal passage and improved the image&#xD;
      in all patients in the FOB group. If indicated (a suboptimal laryngeal view or resistance in&#xD;
      passing of the tracheal tube), anterior laryngeal pressure and tongue withdrawal by digital&#xD;
      traction was performed to improve the laryngeal field of view. When the glottis was clearly&#xD;
      visible, the FOB was advanced through the vocal cords, and jaw thrust movement was released.&#xD;
      To prevent the stimulation of the carina, the tube was placed 4 cm below the glottis, sliding&#xD;
      over the FOB. Intubation was verified with the FOB, and end-tidal CO2 concentrations at 35-40&#xD;
      mmHg were monitored. A throat pack was inserted by the anesthetist after the measurements&#xD;
      were taken. Anesthesia was maintained with 2% sevoflurane and 50% N20 in oxygen with 1.5 l&#xD;
      min-1 fresh gas flow and 35-40 mmHg end-tidal CO2 concentrations. Isolyte-P was administered&#xD;
      at rate of 15 mL/kg/h IV, and acetaminophen (15 mg kg-1) was infused for postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia in all children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBP and HR were recorded at baseline, after induction of anesthesia, at the time of&#xD;
      intubation, and 1, 3 and 5 min after intubation. The intubation time (the time from when&#xD;
      manual ventilation with a facemask stopped to restarting ventilation via the nasotracheal&#xD;
      tube and when carbon dioxide (CO2) was detected by capnography) was recorded by another&#xD;
      anesthetist with a digital stopwatch. Nose bleeding after intubation (epistaxis),&#xD;
      laryngospasms, bradycardia (HR&lt;65 beat min-1), hypoxic episodes (SpO2&lt;90%) and the surgery&#xD;
      type were also recorded. Adverse events (hoarseness, sore throat) were assessed 24 h after&#xD;
      surgery. If a sore throat developed, additional analgesics were not administered. If&#xD;
      bradycardia or desaturation (SpO2&lt;90%) occurred for more than 2 min, the intubation was&#xD;
      interrupted, and patients were ventilated with 100% oxygen and were administered IV atropine&#xD;
      (5-10 µg / kg).&#xD;
