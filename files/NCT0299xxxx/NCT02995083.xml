      To investigate the clinical benefit of intra-articular injections of saline in patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee and compare the clinical response of saline to the&#xD;
      current standard treatment with corticosteroids and an air injection placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As non-surgical treatments of OA are essential, multiple trials have been done to compare&#xD;
      standard of care IA injection therapies to more novel injection treatments, with many of&#xD;
      these trials using saline as the control arm. The purpose of using a control arm is to&#xD;
      attempt to eliminate placebo effect and help distinguish the true effectiveness of a therapy.&#xD;
      There has been controversy over the clinical effect of saline in treating OA with some&#xD;
      arguing that saline may have some clinical benefit. If this is true, it could allow for the&#xD;
      true effect of standard of care therapies to appear diminished when compared to saline as a&#xD;
      placebo. A recent meta analysis looked at the use of saline as a placebo in 38 randomized&#xD;
      control trials to determine if intra-articular saline injections for knee OA had a clinical&#xD;
      effect. The study found that IA injections of saline significantly improved short-term knee&#xD;
      pain in 32 of the studies which involved 1705 patients, p &lt;0.001, and long-term pain was&#xD;
      significantly decreased in 19 of the studies involving 1445 patients, p &lt;0.001. It is&#xD;
      essential to empirically determine if saline has a clinical effect due to the role it plays&#xD;
      as a placebo in many clinical studies of the management of OA with intra-articular&#xD;
      injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate the clinical benefit of intra-articular injections of saline in&#xD;
      patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee and compare the clinical response of&#xD;
      saline to the current standard treatment with corticosteroids and an air injection placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Prospective, single-blinded, randomized, clinical study. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized into three treatment arms in a 1:1:1 fashion with approximately 50 patients in the&#xD;
      saline arm, 50 patients in the corticosteroid arm, and 50 patients in the placebo arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis: Clinical knee outcomes of subjects following one intra-articular knee&#xD;
      injection of air will be similar to one intra-articular knee injection of saline or&#xD;
      corticosteroid for symptomatic patients diagnosed with knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Assumptions: Power Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Arm: 10 ml Saline (Normal Saline)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Arm: 1 ml of 40 mg corticosteroid in 9 ml 1% lidocaine (Depo-medrol, Pfizer, New&#xD;
      York, New York), 10 ml air (placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Efficacy Endpoint: The primary efficacy endpoint is the mean change in the WOMAC&#xD;
      Index score 12 weeks after first injection with regards to baseline score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Efficacy Secondary efficacy endpoints include the change in the full Endpoints:&#xD;
      WOMAC Index, KOOS, Lysholm, IKDC, VAS, SF-12 and use of rescue medication (steroid at 12&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment: Prospective, randomized, clinical study designed to evaluate 150 subjects. All&#xD;
      enrolled subjects will have a pre-procedure visit, one treatment visit, and follow-up visits&#xD;
      at week 6 and week 12 if they require a rescue injection and will fill out patient reported&#xD;
      outcome measures at 1, 6, 12, and 24 weeks.&#xD;
