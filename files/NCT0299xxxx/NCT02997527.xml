  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine if people with and without GERD or trouble swallowing&#xD;
      have increased esophageal mucosa impedance (food getting into the esophageal tissue).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) but without gross evidence of&#xD;
      esophageal injury, confirmation of acid reflux is typically performed through testing that&#xD;
      measures reflux at or proximal to 5 cm above the gastroesophageal junction. These tests such&#xD;
      as pH/impedance monitoring and Bravo probe placement in the esophagus have been the gold&#xD;
      standard for diagnosing and quantitating the degree of gastroesophageal reflux. This stands&#xD;
      in contrast to the concept that the esophagus distal to 5 cm is first and foremost exposed to&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux and that most injury in the form of erosive esophagitis is seen in&#xD;
      the 4cm segment below where this instruments measure reflux. As a result, this type of&#xD;
      testing may not allow for full understanding of the pathophysiology of GERD. Furthermore,&#xD;
      with refluxed acid exposure limited to the distal esophagus in some patients, use of&#xD;
      conventional pH testing could lead to inaccurate diagnosing of GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal impedance testing measures epithelial integrity as reflected through the ability&#xD;
      of the mucosa to conduct electric current. As dilation of intercellular spaces in biopsies&#xD;
      from patients with GERD is considered the earliest indication of esophageal injury in&#xD;
      response to reflux in the absence of gross endoscopic injury, the measure of increased&#xD;
      current conduction through these dilated spaces has been shown to be an accurate means of&#xD;
      diagnosing patients with non-erosive reflux disease. To this point, most esophageal impedance&#xD;
      has been measured using impedance ports placed at locations similar to the pH probes in a&#xD;
      combined intra-esophageal ambulatory catheter. As a result, the most distal point of&#xD;
      impedance measurement is also 5 cm above the gastroesophageal junction. Recently, a site&#xD;
      specific endoscopically placed impedance probe has been developed that can measure esophageal&#xD;
      mucosal impedance at any point of the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the Principal Investigator would like to look at patients with and without&#xD;
      reflux symptoms measuring impedance at 1,2,3,4 and 5 cm at the 6 o'clock position above the&#xD;
      Gastroesophageal Junction.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A special sensor array (Mucosal Impedance) composed of 360_ circumferential sensing rings was engineered and mounted on a 2-mm-diameter soft catheter easily traversable through the working channel of an upper endoscope. The frequency for the measuring circuit was set at 2 kHz. Impedance measurements of the esophageal mucosa were expressed in ohms as the ratio of voltage to the current, according to Ohm's law (voltage Â¼ IR). Data will be acquired with a stationary impedance data acquisition system and viewed and analyzed on BioView Analysis software. Impedance measurements will be obtained at 1,2,3,4, 5 cm at the 6 O'clock position above the gastroesophageal junction</description>

    <description>During the participant's clinical endoscopy the 2.13 mm catheter (tiny tube), called an Intraluminal Impedance, will be passed through the channel of the standard endoscope.&#xD;
The catheter (tiny tube) will be placed through the endoscope in your esophagus 1 cm above where your stomach and esophagus meet for 5 seconds.&#xD;
At 2 cm above where your stomach and esophagus meet the catheter will be placed for 5 seconds&#xD;
And at 3 cm above where the participants stomach and esophagus meet the catheter will be placed for 5 seconds.&#xD;
At 4 cm above where the participants stomach and esophagus meet the catheter will be placed for 5 seconds.&#xD;
At 5 cm above where the participants stomach and esophagus meet the catheter will be placed for 5 seconds.</description>
