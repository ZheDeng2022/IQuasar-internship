      [Background and Objective]First-aid skill training plays an important role in the education&#xD;
      of nurses. How to implement stable and efficient skill is very important. (Kardong-Edgren,&#xD;
      Oermann, Odom-Maryon, &amp; Ha, 2010). Simulation-based workshops,or training, as the most common&#xD;
      enhancing skills.(Topping et al., 2015) .This study was designed to assist nurses enhancing&#xD;
      the clinical ability and safety the patients in the first aid-related skills and knowledge.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the two groups of(1) first aid knowledge online test.&#xD;
      (2) first aid skills test.【Methods】This study is a general ward nurses first aid technical&#xD;
      examination, pre-test and post-test, the random control trial. Review by the hospital ethics&#xD;
      committee and execution date on105/12/12-107/03/08, a total of 92 cases, obtained consent of&#xD;
      all cases, then the case will be test in our hospital clinical skills center. Subject&#xD;
      condition: general ward nurse (minimum age&gt; 20 years),exclusion conditions: intensive care&#xD;
      unit nurses, emergency department nurses. Study Procedure: Subjects who obtained the informed&#xD;
      consent were randomly assigned to the first aid skill simulation training group (FAST) or the&#xD;
      traditional group (T) by using a computer generated number. Randomization envelopes were&#xD;
      opened and randomization performed by the study nurse after informed consent was obtained.&#xD;
      Each group consisted of 46 subjects. All the subjects were pre-test first aid knowledge&#xD;
      online test, followed were pre-test first aid skills test at the Clinical Skills Center.After&#xD;
      pre-test,the experimental group are give the first aid skill simulation training with&#xD;
      debriefing(75-min) and online lecture(15-min).While the traditional group only give online&#xD;
      lecture(15-min). Two weeks later, the post-test include online test and skills test for two&#xD;
      groups. After all the data were collected by the researchers who unknown the groups, the&#xD;
      names of the cases were removed and the scores of the two groups were compared before and&#xD;
      after.The test Based on 2015 AHA Guidelines for CPR &amp; ECC (2015 Adult Basic Life Support and&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Quality &amp; 2015American Heart Association and 2015).The data&#xD;
      will be archived in SPSS20.0 statistical package software. Statistical methods such as T-test&#xD;
      and Anova variance analysis are used to analyze the data【Expected Result】: The knowledge and&#xD;
      skills in the experimental group were better than the traditional group, and the first-aid&#xD;
      simulation skill training was helpful for the clinical emergency situations.&#xD;

      [Background and Objective]First-aid skill training plays an important role in the education&#xD;
      of nurses. How to implement stable and efficient skill is very important. (Kardong-Edgren,&#xD;
      Oermann, Odom-Maryon, &amp; Ha, 2010). Nursing first aid simulation is very often used to&#xD;
      teaching, the teaching have significant significance of cognitive, skills, satisfaction and&#xD;
      other indicators of achievement (Cant &amp; Cooper, 2010),simulation-based workshops,or training,&#xD;
      as the most common enhancing skills. (Topping et al., 2015) BLS as the basic first aid common&#xD;
      sense and basic knowledge of resuscitation.In our hospital BLS was trained the basic&#xD;
      knowledge and chest compression technique. According to the Department of Nursing first aid&#xD;
      site performance check list found that the first aid equipment used unskilled , 25.5% on&#xD;
      2016/01 to 2016/06.The most unfamiliar techniques and knowledge of 109 nurses(all completed&#xD;
      BLS) were as follows: 33.9% of defibrillator, 25.7% of staff role positions, 20.7% of first&#xD;
      aid medications, and 14.7% of intubation device and LMA (Laryngeal Mask Airway ) on&#xD;
      105/10/1-105/10/17.This study was designed to assist nurses enhancing the clinical ability&#xD;
      and safety the patients in the first aid-related skills and knowledge. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to compare the two groups of(1) first aid knowledge online test. (2) first aid&#xD;
      skills test.【Methods】This study is a general ward nurses first aid technical examination,&#xD;
      pre-test and post-test, the random control trial. Review by the hospital ethics committee and&#xD;

      randomization performed by the study nurse after informed consent was obtained. Each group&#xD;
      consisted of 46 subjects. All the subjects were pre-test first aid knowledge online test,&#xD;
      followed were pre-test first aid skills test at the Clinical Skills Center by eight&#xD;
      instructors who were more than 20 years worked experience. After pre-test, the experimental&#xD;
      group are give the first aid skill simulation training guidance on-site with discussion and&#xD;
      debriefing(75-min) and TMS online lecture(15-min).While the traditional group only give TMS&#xD;
      online lecture(15-min). Two weeks later, the post-test include first aid knowledge online&#xD;
      test and first aid skills test for two groups. After all the data were collected by the&#xD;
      researchers who unknown the groups, the names of the cases were removed and the scores of the&#xD;
      two groups were compared before and after about(1) first aid knowledge online test. (2) first&#xD;
      aid skills test. The test Based on 2015 AHA Guidelines for CPR &amp; ECC (2015 Adult Basic Life&#xD;
      Support and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Quality &amp; 2015American Heart Association and&#xD;
      2015).First Station: Equipment testing, Second Station: Assisted with intubation and&#xD;
      fixation, Third Station: LMA, Fourth Station: Ambu bagging, Fifth Station: Drugs, Sixth&#xD;
      Station: Defribrator, Seventh Station: Role positioning, and Eighth Station: Leader Training.&#xD;
      The data will be archived in SPSS20.0 statistical package software. Statistical methods such&#xD;
      as T-test and Anova variance analysis are used to analyze the data【Expected Result】: The&#xD;
