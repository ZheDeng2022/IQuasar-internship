      This will be an open label, prospective study to determine the association between specific&#xD;
      genotypes, epigenetics and behavioral factors, with the phenotypes, defined by pain&#xD;
      perception, postoperative pain, analgesic and side effect responses to perioperative opioids,&#xD;
      chronic postoperative pain and gene expression in adolescents following major spine surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Safe and effective analgesia is an important unmet medical need in children. Despite efforts&#xD;
      to promote non-pharmacologic interventions, drug treatment remains the standard of care for&#xD;
      children experiencing severe pain following surgery. Inadequate pain relief after invasive&#xD;
      surgery, and side effects from analgesics such as morphine occur frequently in up to 50% of&#xD;
      children. A study of patient controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine use after spine surgery in&#xD;
      adolescents observed a 45% incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and 7% incidence of&#xD;
      respiratory depression. Presently, evidence-based dosing guidelines for opioid therapy have&#xD;
      not been ascertained in the pediatric patient population, and remains a trial and error&#xD;
      method. Despite aggressive pain management after spine surgery, findings showed that neither&#xD;
      children's pain nor their analgesic use diminished significantly over time. As such, there is&#xD;
      a critical knowledge gap in the medical literature that significantly impacts the pediatric&#xD;
      pain management. Moreover, chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP, defined as pain attributable to&#xD;
      the surgical procedure lasting for more than 2 months after surgery critically impacts 13-30%&#xD;
      of children having surgery, and leads to chronic pain as adults imposing extraordinary annual&#xD;
      costs on the health care system ($560-635 billion). It has been recently shown that pain&#xD;
      unpleasantness predicts the transition from acute to moderate/severe persistent post-surgical&#xD;
      pain, whereas anxiety sensitivity predicts the maintenance of moderate/severe post-surgical&#xD;
      pain from 6 to 12 months after surgery. Spine fusion in adolescents is a particularly painful&#xD;
      surgery with 15% incidence of pain even 5 years after surgery, and hence will serve as a good&#xD;
      surgical model to evaluate the behavioral and genetic predictors of chronic postoperative&#xD;
      pain. In recognition of this therapeutic challenge the investigators plan to evaluate the&#xD;
      determinants of inter-individual differences in opioid analgesic responsiveness, adverse&#xD;
      effects, pain perception and predictors of chronic postoperative pain in children.&#xD;

      Blood samples will be analyzed for a defined set of SNPs using PCR (TaqMan, ABI)/and Omni5M&#xD;
      GWAS chip testing. DNA will be isolated from blood samples and also be used for&#xD;
      pyrosequencing studies to obtain DNA methylation information for a specified set of genes or&#xD;
      use of the MethylationEPIC array. The SNP sets were chosen using the adult studies cited in&#xD;
      the Background and Significance section as evidence of potential importance. Given that the&#xD;
      pain response in children and adolescents may involve a novel or different set of SNPs and&#xD;
      additional SNPs of the above genes, the DNA samples gathered will be held for future&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
