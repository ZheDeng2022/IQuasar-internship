  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 3D-CAM is a new 3-minute diagnostic assessment for Confusion Assessment Method-defined&#xD;
      Delirium. The primary objective of this study is to translate the 3D-CAM into the German&#xD;
      language, as well as to validate its use to detect postoperative delirium in the recovery&#xD;
      room. The validation will be based on comparisons to the Nu-DESC (Nursing Delirium Screening&#xD;
      Scale), CAM (Confusion Assessment Method), and DSM-5 criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical&#xD;
      Manual of Mental Disorders).&#xD;

      Approximately 200 patients will be enrolled in the study. They will followed up until the&#xD;
      third postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation and analysis of demographic and perioperative influencing factors on&#xD;
      postoperative delirium according to routine parameters (age, sex, body height, body weight,&#xD;
      diagnosis, physical status according to the American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA PS),&#xD;
      duration of surgery, Physiological and Operative Severity Score (POSSUM), type of anesthesia,&#xD;
      medication against pain and delirium) will be performed.&#xD;
