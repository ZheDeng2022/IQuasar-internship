  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years in the U.S., problems associated with opioid prescriptions, including&#xD;
      non-medical use and overdose, increased to historically unprecedented levels and represent a&#xD;
      public health crisis. Emergency departments (EDs) play an important role in opioid&#xD;
      prescribing, particularly to individuals at high risk for adverse opioid-related outcomes.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new mobile health (mhealth) intervention&#xD;
      can assist people in the safe use of opioid analgesic (OA) medications after leaving the&#xD;
      emergency department (ED).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this project are to: (1) adapt and enhance an existing motivational&#xD;
      intervention to decrease non-medical opioid use after an ED visit by optimizing intervention&#xD;
      intensity and duration through reinforcement learning (RL); (2) examine the impact of an&#xD;
      RL-supported intervention on non-medical opioid use level during the six months post-ED&#xD;
      visit; and (3) examine the impact of the RL intervention on the opioid-related behaviors and&#xD;
      adverse outcomes of driving after opioid use, overdose risk behaviors, and subsequent&#xD;
      opioid-related ED visits. The secondary aims of this project are to: (SA1) examine whether&#xD;
      baseline level of non-medical opioid use moderates the effects of the intervention; and (SA2)&#xD;
      understand barriers and facilitators of implementation of the intervention based on&#xD;
      qualitative interviews with ED patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will test the efficacy of an interactive voice response (IVR) and&#xD;
      reinforcement learning (RL) supported motivational intervention delivered after an emergency&#xD;
      department (ED) visit to participants with recent non-medical OA use who receive an OA in the&#xD;
      ED or who are prescribed an OA at ED discharge, compared to enhanced usual care (EUC). In the&#xD;
      intervention condition, IVR calls will ask participants to report information about their&#xD;
      health and medications using their touch-tone phone, and based on their responses they may&#xD;
      receive brief or extended motivational messages during the IVR call, or they may be assigned&#xD;
      to receive a 20 minute motivational enhancement session with a study therapist over the&#xD;
      phone. Because the most helpful intensity of intervention is unknown and likely to vary&#xD;
      between patients, the project will use an artificial intelligence strategy called&#xD;
      reinforcement learning (RL). The RL system will continuously &quot;learn&quot; from the success of&#xD;
      prior actions in similar situations with similar patients in order to select the action most&#xD;
      likely to reduce non-medical opioid use for each participant during each call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will screen ~ 5,600 ED patients to enroll 600 ED participants in the&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants will be randomized to the intervention&#xD;
      condition (n=300) or to EUC (n=300). All participants will be re-assessed at 1, 3 and 6&#xD;
      months post-ED visit for level of non-medical OA use and related outcomes. The RCT will be&#xD;
      complemented by qualitative interviews to inform later implementation.&#xD;

    <description>The Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM) assesses opioid use that is more than prescribed, for non-pain-related reasons, borrowing medications, obtaining medications from sources other than doctors, etc., on a 5-point Likert scale of &quot;Never&quot; to &quot;Very Often.&quot; The primary outcome will be a measure of severity created by summing the items.</description>
