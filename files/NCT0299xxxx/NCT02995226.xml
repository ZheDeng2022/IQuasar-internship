  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to check if patients, but also relatives (as they share familial&#xD;
      and genetic risk factors), are having more difficulties in regulating a spontaneous, pleasant&#xD;
      physical effort (doing &quot;too much&quot;) compared to healthy controls, and if physical efforts are&#xD;
      participating to core symptoms of anorexia nervosa, such as more appetite (instead of less),&#xD;
      less pain, more abnormal body image, and less cognitive flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such a result could help to further understand the role of difficulties with physical&#xD;
      exercise as part of the phenotype of anorexia nervosa.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a three steps protocol. First, patients (with anorexia nervosa), controls (with no&#xD;
      eating disorder) and first degree relatives (with no eating disorder) will be tested for&#xD;
      emotional accuracy (seing faces on a screen with different core emotions), pain threshold&#xD;
      (how long they can support a cold probe), body size (how they see themselves), appetite and&#xD;
      cognitive flexibility (a test where the capacity to change rules during a game is done easily&#xD;
      or not).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then all subjects will do a standardized physical exercise which represents an effort with&#xD;
      the equivalent level of energy for each participants as being chosen according to each level&#xD;
      of competency (assessed through the &quot;maximal aerobic power&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third step consists in the repetition of (nearly) initial tests.&#xD;
