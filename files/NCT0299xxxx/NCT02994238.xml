    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether a sensor-enabled, clinically integrated,&#xD;
      mobile health asthma program can improve asthma outcomes among 4-17 year old children with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe asthma.&#xD;

      Primary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess whether asthma control in patients enrolled in the intervention arm improved in&#xD;
           comparison to the control arm through the (ACT) measurement tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess healthcare utilization (asthma-related ED visits and hospitalizations,&#xD;
           asthma-related oral corticosteroid use) obtained through electronic medical record and&#xD;
           parent report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will use parent-report surveys of the following psycho-social outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days missed from school due to asthma; 2) pediatric asthma-related quality of life&#xD;
           (PACQLQ); and 3) Parental Asthma Management Self-Efficacy (PAMSE).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enhance parental management through improved inhaler use. The investigators will use the&#xD;
           Propeller Sensor Platform (referenced as Remote Health Management Platform) to allow&#xD;
           parents to track their child's ICS and SABA inhaler use daily. The Platform also will&#xD;
           have specific educational messaging to help parents and their children achieve adherence&#xD;
           to their prescribed plan. This constant feedback and reinforcement may lead to improved&#xD;
           asthma control therefore reducing frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations. The&#xD;
           investigators will also be assessing the factors associated with the feasibility and&#xD;
           sustainability of the Propeller Sensor Platform by observing trends in utilization.&#xD;
           Utilization and drop-off will be measured by monitoring use of the inhalers and periodic&#xD;
           surveys of families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve management by the healthcare team. The investigators will use the Remote Health&#xD;
           Management Platform to integrate inhaler use data into a web portal that the physician's&#xD;
           office can access. Through the development of this interface, the Propeller Sensor&#xD;
           Platform will be able to provide inhaler use feedback to healthcare teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Types of feedback:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emergency Management: data on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and short-acting&#xD;
           beta-agonist (SABA) use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long-term Management: data on ICS and SABA use. This interface will include data on both&#xD;
           ICS and SABA inhaler use. The interface will also have flags to notify the office of&#xD;
           under or overuse of inhalers, with a protocol in place to reach out to patients. The&#xD;
           investigators will also be assessing the factors associated with the feasibility and&#xD;
           sustainability of the Remote Health Management Platform by the healthcare team. This&#xD;
           will be done by weekly contact with the healthcare team, rapid cycle improvement of the&#xD;
           web portal, and written assessments.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 month follow-up assessment</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use the children's Asthma Control Test completed by the caregiver or parent to report child's asthma control. The ACT is a 5 item scale, with a 4-week recall (on symptoms and daily functioning) ACT assesses the frequency of shortness of breath and general asthma symptoms, use of rescue medications, the effect of asthma on daily functioning, and overall self-assessment of asthma control via item-specific response options ranging from 1-5. Total ACT scores range from 5 (poorly controlled asthma, to 25 (well controlled asthma).</description>

    <description>The Pediatric Asthma Caregiver Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire was administered. This scale is a self-administered instrument, which includes 13 items (4 concern activity limitations and 9 concern emotional function). Responses to each item of the PACQLQ are given on a seven-point scale, ranging from 1 to 7, with the higher scores indicating less impairment. A total average score was calculated to reflect Pediatric Asthma Caregiver Quality of Life, which also ranged from 1-7.</description>

    <description>The intervention group will have the full Remote Health Management Sensor Platform. Research staff will review uploaded sensor data on a daily basis. If participants are enrolled into the control group, they will only receive Standard Asthma Education. The Standard Asthma Education follows the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines for asthma management. This will include the following topics: 1. Explanation of symptoms; 2. Asthma triggers (description and how to avoid them); 3. Using medications (how to use prescribed asthma medications, the difference between controller medications and rescue inhalers, how to use a spacer, how to use a mask); and 4. Managing asthma control (purpose of asthma control test, asthma action plan, how to use a peak flow meter).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English-speaking parents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children 4-&lt;17 years of age. Using both NHLBI (National Heart, Lung, and Blood&#xD;
             Institute) guidelines and based off of a physician expert panel, the research team has&#xD;
             limited the ages to 4-&lt;17 years old. It has been shown to be difficult to properly&#xD;
             diagnose individuals less than 4 years of age with asthma. Usually, they are diagnosed&#xD;
             with reactive airway disease or bronchial virus. Individuals &lt;17 years old was the&#xD;
             oldest group because investigators wanted to avoid adolescence and make sure that&#xD;
             parents have an active role in the health management of the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate or severe persistent asthma, defined by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood&#xD;
             Institute. This will be done by a physician-trained research assistant who will be&#xD;

             asthma symptoms: Chronic Lung Disease, Broncho-Pulmonary Dysplasia, Cystic Fibrosis,&#xD;
             Pulmonary Hypertension, Interstitial Lung Disease, Immunodeficiency, Bronchiectasis,&#xD;
             Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia, Chronic Respiratory Insufficiency, Neuromuscular Weakness,&#xD;
             Sickle Cell Lung Disease, Restrictive Lung Disease, and Tracheostomy or&#xD;

The ACT is a 5 item scale, with a 4-week recall (on symptoms and daily functioning) ACT assesses the frequency of shortness of breath and general asthma symptoms, use of rescue medications, the effect of asthma on daily functioning, and overall self-assessment of asthma control via item-specific response options ranging from 1-5. Total ACT scores range from 5 (poorly controlled asthma, to 25 (well controlled asthma).</description>

This scale is a self-administered instrument, which includes 13 items (4 concern activity limitations and 9 concern emotional function). Responses to each item of the PACQLQ are given on a seven-point scale, ranging from 1 to 7, with the higher scores indicating less impairment. A total average score was calculated to reflect Pediatric Asthma Caregiver Quality of Life, which also ranged from 1-7.</description>

            <description>The intervention group will have the full Remote Health Management Sensor Platform. Research staff will review uploaded sensor data on a daily basis. If participants are enrolled into the control group, they will only receive Standard Asthma Education. The Standard Asthma Education follows the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines for asthma management. This will include the following topics: 1. Explanation of symptoms; 2. Asthma triggers (description and how to avoid them); 3. Using medications (how to use prescribed asthma medications, the difference between controller medications and rescue inhalers, how to use a spacer, how to use a mask); and 4. Managing asthma control (purpose of asthma control test, asthma action plan, how to use a peak flow meter).&#xD;
Remote Health Management Sensor Platform: The Propeller sensor monitors the use of inhaled medications, capturing the date, time, and number of uses. The sensor then transmits this information using Bluetooth to a paired smart phone or hub. Data can be uploaded to the caregiver's smart phone and to the patient's web portal, which their healthcare team will have access to help overall management.</description>

          <description>Investigators will use the children's Asthma Control Test completed by the caregiver or parent to report child's asthma control. The ACT is a 5 item scale, with a 4-week recall (on symptoms and daily functioning) ACT assesses the frequency of shortness of breath and general asthma symptoms, use of rescue medications, the effect of asthma on daily functioning, and overall self-assessment of asthma control via item-specific response options ranging from 1-5. Total ACT scores range from 5 (poorly controlled asthma, to 25 (well controlled asthma).</description>
