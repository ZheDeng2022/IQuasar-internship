      PROSPECT-C is a phase II study investigating the molecular markers of response or resistance&#xD;
      to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cetuximab or panitumumab are two monoclonal antibodies that are routinely offered to patients&#xD;
      with metastatic colorectal cancer when they have no mutation in RAS genes. In Royal Marsden&#xD;
      Hospital patients, who are refractory to all standard therapies and have metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer are offered one of these agents in third line metastatic setting. Whilst&#xD;
      the mechanisms of response/resistance to these therapies are well studies, they are still&#xD;
      incompletely understood. The main hypothesis of this study is that finding mechanisms of&#xD;
      response and/or resistance by using novel techniques such as next generation sequencing (NGS)&#xD;
      and/or digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) to these therapies will allow better&#xD;
      patient selection and application of precision medicine in such patients.&#xD;
