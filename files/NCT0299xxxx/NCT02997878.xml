      MERLIN is an adaptive, single arm, multi-centre, phase IIa multi-disease clinical trial. It&#xD;
      is designed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Determine dose safety of ORBCEL-C (selected Mesenchymal stromal cells derived from human&#xD;
      umbilical cord) ii) Evaluate treatment activity through assessment of biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial has two main stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 1 will determine the maximum tolerated dose that can be administered by observing&#xD;
           for occurrence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 2 will use the maximum tolerated dose found in stage 1 to and further determine&#xD;
           safety and activity outcomes of ORBCEL-C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of this trial we hope to be able to justify and conduct separate, larger&#xD;
      scale trials using ORBCEL-C.&#xD;

      MERLIN is an adaptive, single arm, multi-centre, phase IIa multi-disease clinical trial. It&#xD;
      is designed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Determine dose safety of ORBCEL-C (selected Mesenchymal stromal cells derived from human&#xD;
      umbilical cord) ii) Evaluate treatment activity through assessment of biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial has two main stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 1 will determine the maximum tolerated dose that can be administered by observing&#xD;
           for occurrence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 2 will use the maximum tolerated dose found in stage 1 to and further determine&#xD;
           safety and activity outcomes of ORBCEL-C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of this trial we hope to be able to justify and conduct separate, larger&#xD;
      scale trials using ORBCEL-C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES For Both PSC and AIH patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of Stage 1 is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the maximum tolerated single intravenous infusion dose of ORBCEL-C over a&#xD;
      14-day reporting period to take forward to Stage 2 of the clinical trial (study). All&#xD;
      patients who have been recruited to and completed the 14-day reporting period in stage 1 will&#xD;
      continue to be evaluated for outcomes as per Stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of Stage 2 are to investigate whether a single intravenous infusion of&#xD;
      ORBCEL-C in patients with PSC and AIH:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Is safe and tolerated over the period of trial follow up (up to 56 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For PSC patients only • Reduces serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in patients with PSC. This&#xD;
      is a non-invasive biochemical surrogate of clinical outcomes in PSC&#xD;
&#xD;
      For AIH patients only&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Reduces serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in patients with AIH. This is a non-invasive&#xD;
      biochemical surrogate marker of hepatic inflammatory activity and outcomes in AIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of Stage 2 are to investigate whether a single intravenous infusion&#xD;
      of ORBCEL-C elicits a change over the duration of the study after treatment in patients with&#xD;
      PSC and AIH:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver biochemistry and function, immunoglobulin G concentrations (in AIH patients) and&#xD;
           composite risk scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-invasive clinical markers of fibrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severity of co-existent IBD in patients with PSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further exploratory research objectives of the trial determine whether MSC infusion modulates&#xD;
      the immune response by measuring whether treatment elicits a change in patients with PSC and&#xD;
      AIH:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Markers of immune activation including immunoglobulin values and C-reactive protein&#xD;
           concentration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Markers of biliary injury including total bile acid levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circulating inflammatory cells profile this includes phenotypic expression of T&#xD;
           regulatory cells (Tregs) a common mechanistic primary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endothelial cell activation markers such as VAP-1 and ICAM1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum cytokine, chemokine, microRNA and RNA expression profiles&#xD;
