      The primary study objectives are&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate the safety and tolerability profiles of DCB-BO1301 and to determine the&#xD;
           maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DCB-BO1301 as add-on therapy to dacarbazine in subjects&#xD;
           with advanced melanoma (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to evaluate the efficacy profile of DCB-BO1301 at MTD or lower dose level as add-on&#xD;
           therapy to dacarbazine in subjects with advanced melanoma in terms of progression free&#xD;
           survival (Phase IIa)&#xD;
