  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will compare conventional sequential bilateral rTMS to a bilateral theta burst&#xD;
      stimulation protocol. The right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortices will be the site of&#xD;
      stimulation in both treatment conditions. The site of stimulation will be targeted using MRI&#xD;
      co-registration. The study seeks to determine if the bilateral theta burst protocol has&#xD;
      similar effectiveness to the conventional bilateral rTMS protocol in treating major&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
