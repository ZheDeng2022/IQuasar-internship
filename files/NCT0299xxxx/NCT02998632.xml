      -  Patients will be diagnosed to determine whether they are eligible for the inclusion&#xD;
           criteria of this study or not. Patients who are eligible will start their surgical&#xD;
           treatment in the next visit after radiographic and surgical site evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the day of surgery, each patient will be assigned to either intervention or control&#xD;
           group, the patients will receive inferior alveolar nerve block and long buccal nerve&#xD;
           anesthesia. Future implant site will be planned, an incision will be made and flap will&#xD;
           be reflected along the defective ridge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implant fixture/s will be inserted in the previously planned site. Uncovered fixture&#xD;
           threads and bone defect will be covered by MPM or autogenous bone graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the control group, autogenous particulate bone graft will be used for vertical&#xD;
           augmentation and covered with titanium reinforced membrane. In the intervention group,&#xD;
           MPM (Mineralized plasmatic matrix) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Edges will be approximated, Sutures will be placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Osstell instrument will be used to measure and record fixture primary stability in ISQ&#xD;
           units.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be referred to the fixed prosthodontics department for placement of the&#xD;
           crowns after ensuring success of osseointegration and implant stability (after 4&#xD;
           months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will evaluate their overall satisfaction after fitting the final prosthesis&#xD;
           using a questionnaire at 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 9 months, CBCT will be performed to evaluate augmented bone height to be compared&#xD;
           with the bone height previously recorded in CBCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Osstell instrument will be used to evaluate the implant stability ratio in ISQ unit to&#xD;
           be compared to the ratio recorded before.&#xD;

      In the study group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full medical and dental history will be obtained from all the patients participating in&#xD;
           this study (figure 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thorough clinical and radiographic examination for the ridge area to be treated will be&#xD;
           done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Future implant site will be planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each patient will be asked to evaluate their overall satisfaction using a questionnaire&#xD;
           before any intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive 2 gm of amoxicillin 1 hour before surgery. They will be instructed&#xD;
           to wash their mouths with a 0.12% chlorhexidine solution for 30 seconds immediately&#xD;
           before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will receive inferior alveolar nerve block and long buccal nerve anesthesia&#xD;
           using articane HCl 4% with 1:100,000 adrenaline local anesthetic solution using&#xD;
           aspirating syringe and 27-gauge needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After confirming the success of profound local anaesthesia, an incision will be made and&#xD;
           flap will be reflected along the ridge of the previously planned intraoral donor site to&#xD;
           completely expose bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autogenous bone graft will be obtained and will be grinded according to the dimensions&#xD;
           of the present defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MPM (Mineralized plasmatic matrix) will be prepared:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tubes of 9 ml of venous blood will be taken from the patient and will be placed in a&#xD;
      centrifuge at 2500 rpm / min for 5 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the centrifugation, the blood in the tube will be separated into two&#xD;
      compartments one yellow and one red.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The yellow part will be withdrawn with a syringe to be mixed with the grinded autogenous bone&#xD;
      previously obtained from intra oral site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Components will be mixed using a probe until the formation of a single homogeneous component,&#xD;
      called the MPM (Mineralized Plasmatic Matrix).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The graft site receiver will be prepared by perforating the lateral cortical bone to&#xD;
           improve the vascularization and facilitate cell migration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implant fixture/s will be inserted in the previously planned site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncovered fixture threads and bone defect will be covered by MPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Osstell instrument will be used to measure and record fixture primary stability in ISQ&#xD;
           units precisely and objectively 48.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Edges will be approximated, Sutures will be placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sutures will be removed 7 days later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immediate postoperative CBCT will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antibiotic (combination of 500mg amoxicillin and 125mg clavulanic acid) and analgesic&#xD;
           and anti-inflammatory (Ibuprofen 600mg) will be prescribed after the surgical procedure&#xD;
           to be administrated by the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be referred to the fixed prosthodontics department for placement of the&#xD;
           crowns after ensuring success of osseointegration and implant stability (after 4&#xD;
           months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Same previously mentioned procedure will be performed, But here gold standards are&#xD;
           to be performed (Autogenous particulate bone graft used for vertical augmentation will&#xD;
           be covered with titanium reinforced membrane).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Osstell tool will be used to measure and record fixture primary stability in ISQ units.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suturing will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then Immediate Post operative CBCT will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antibiotic (combination of 500mg amoxicillin and 125mg clavulanic acid) and analgesic&#xD;
           and anti-inflammatory (Ibuprofen 600mg) will be prescribed after the surgical procedure&#xD;
           to be administrated by the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be referred to the fixed prosthodontics department for placement of the&#xD;
           crowns after ensuring success of osseointegration and implant stability (after 4&#xD;
           months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative follow up in both groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 4 months, Osstell instrument will be used to evaluate the implant stability ratio&#xD;
           in ISQ unit to be compared to the ratio recorded before.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 9 months, Patients will evaluate their overall satisfaction after fitting the&#xD;
           final prosthesis using a questionnaire to be answered by YES or NO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  -After 9 months, CBCT will be performed to evaluate augmented bone height to be compared&#xD;
           with the bone height previously recorded in CBCT.&#xD;
