&#xD;
          1. Aged18-85years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject who is contraindicated or failed (when the physician withdraws the tPA per&#xD;
             physician discretion) intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) therapy given at&#xD;
             local institutions or within national practice. Failed means that the physician does&#xD;
             not continue with IV tPA after thrombolysis; there is still an occlusion with TICI&#xD;
             that is &lt;/= 1 as the relevant inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is able to be treated within 8 hours of stroke symptoms onset with minimum of&#xD;
             one deployment of the Amnis Thrombectomy Device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. NIHSS score ≥8.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pre-stroke mRS (modified Rankin Scale) score of 0 to 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) ≤1 and causative occlusion of the M1 or M2&#xD;
             portion of the MCAs, anterior cerebral arteries, vertebral arteries, basilar artery&#xD;
             ,or posterior cerebral arteries (P1 o rP2), confirmed by CT or MR angiography that is&#xD;
             accessible to the Amnis thrombectomy device (i.e. according to IFU; 2-5.5 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. ASPECTS of ≥6 based on CT or MRI that was performed within 60 min prior to the start&#xD;
             of endovascular procedure.&#xD;

             Informed Consent and agrees that subject will attend follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Rapid neurological improvement prior to or at time of treatment suggesting resolution&#xD;

&#xD;
         17. Clinical Symptoms or CT/MRI imaging suggest subarachnoid hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Imaging evidence that suggests, in the opinion of the investigator, the subject is not&#xD;
             appropriate for mechanical thrombectomy intervention (e.g. inability to navigate to&#xD;
             target lesion, moderate/large infarct with poor collateral circulation, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
             General - related to the protocol or device:&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Known sensitivity to nickel, titanium metals or their alloys.&#xD;
