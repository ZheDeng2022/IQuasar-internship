  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, multicenter, single arm, phase II study aimed at collecting data on&#xD;
      preference for iron chelation therapy in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia&#xD;
      (TDT) or non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT) throughout a 48 week treatment period.&#xD;
      Participants who were either chelator-naïve, or who were previously treated with iron&#xD;
      chelators (excluding deferasirox) for at least 6 months continuously, were eligible to&#xD;
      participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was divided into 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Core Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Screening phase which lasted for a maximum of 4 weeks to determine patient&#xD;
                eligibility followed by&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Period 1: Participants were treated with deferasirox DT from Baseline visit Day 1&#xD;
                to Week 24&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Period 2: Participants were treated with deferasirox FCT from Week 25 to Week 48:&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the discretion of the investigator, patients could switch from deferasirox DT to&#xD;
           deferasirox FCT at any time during Period 1 of the Core phase, and vice versa, from&#xD;
           deferasirox FCT to deferasirox DT at any time during Period 2 of the Core phase.&#xD;
           Re-switching treatments was not allowed within each period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Extension Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants could continue deferasirox FCT formulation as per the judgment of the&#xD;
      investigator, through an extension phase for a maximum of 48 weeks months from the last dose&#xD;
      of deferasirox FCT received at the end of period 2 in the Core Phase or until one of the end&#xD;
      of study criteria defined is met, whichever came first. Participation in the extension phase&#xD;
      was optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of study was defined as the earliest occurrence of one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient reached Week 96 in the Extension phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deferasirox FCT was locally reimbursed for this indication (only applicable for the&#xD;
           Extension phase)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Another clinical study or post-trial access program became available that could continue&#xD;
           to provide deferasirox FCT in this patient population and all patients ongoing were&#xD;
           eligible to be transferred to that clinical study.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Consumed Tablet Counts During Deferasirox DT and Deferasirox FCT Treatment Periods</measure>
    <time_frame>Deferasirox DT: From Baseline up to Week 24. Deferasirox FCT: From Week 25 up to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of consumed tablet counts (compliance) was calculated for each treatment period in the core phase: deferasirox DT (period 1) and deferasirox FCT (period 2). Compliance was defined as the total tablet count consumed divided by total tablet count prescribed and multiplied by 100. Total tablet count consumed was calculated as total number of tablets dispensed minus total number of tablets lost/wasted or returned. Total tablet count prescribed was calculated as the number of tablets that the patient should have taken during this period. If a patient did not return the study drug, the compliance was not calculated.</description>

    <measure>Change Over Time in Aftertaste Score of Palatability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, 24, 28 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The palatability questionnaire consisted of 4 items, three items measuring taste and one item measuring aftertaste. The aftertaste item scored on a 5-point response scale with the response option: Very good = 1, Good = 2, Neither good nor bad = 3, Bad = 4, Very bad = 5. This item offered an additional response option of &quot;no aftertaste&quot;. The aftertaste score was calculated among participants who had an aftertaste. Higher aftertaste scores indicated a worse aftertaste.&#xD;
For participants less than (&lt;) 10 years old, an observer palatability questionnaire was administered. Items and scoring algorithm remained the same as for participants greater than or equal to (≥) 10 years old.&#xD;
Change in aftertaste score over time was assessed</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change Over Time in Palatability Score of Palatability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, 24, 28 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The palatability questionnaire consisted of 4 items, three items measuring taste and one item measuring aftertaste. Among the taste items, first one measured taste on a 5-point response scale. The other two items measured what happened after taking the medicine and how the perceived amount of liquid taken with the medicine was. Responses to these 3 items were combined and converted into a single palatability score using a scoring matrix: each combination of responses on each of 3 items corresponded to a predefined palatability score. E.g. if a participant responded &quot;bad&quot; to item 1, &quot;vomited &lt;30min&quot; to item 2 and &quot;not enough&quot; to item 3, then the palatability score assigned was 0. This score ranged from 0 to 11; higher scores indicated better palatability. For participants &lt;10 years old, an observer palatability questionnaire was administered. Items and scoring algorithm were the same as for participants ≥10 years old. Change in palatability score over time was assessed</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Adherence Domain Score of Modified Satisfaction With Iron Chelation (mSICT) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 2 or, if missing, week 3), week 24, 28 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The mSICT patient reported outcome (PRO) consisted of 15 items that represented 3 domains: Adherence, Preference, and Concerns. The adherence domain score consisted of 6 adherence items, measured using a 5-point response scale. The adherence score was calculated by summing these 6 items, with scores ranging from 6 to 30. Higher scores indicated worse adherence.&#xD;
For participants &lt;10 years old, an observer version (ObsRO) was administered. The adherence score remained the same as for participants ≥10 years old.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Concerns Domain Score of Modified Satisfaction With Iron Chelation (mSICT) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 2 or, if missing, week 3), week 24, 28 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The mSICT patient reported outcome (PRO) consisted of 15 items that represented 3 domains: Adherence, Preference, and Concerns.&#xD;
The concerns domain score consisted of 3 items to address any concerns or worries with the medication. All 3 items were measured on a 5-point response scale. The concerns score was calculated by summing the 3 items, with scores ranging from 3 to 15. Higher scores indicated fewer concerns. For participants &lt; 10 years old, an observer version (ObsRO) was administered. Concerns score remained the same as for participants ≥ 10 years old.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Gastrointestinal (GI) Symptom Score Based on GI Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week -1 or, if missing, week -2), week 24, 28 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The GI symptom score was calculated from responses to 5 questions of the GI questionnaire, each with a possible score of 1 to 5, for an overall possible score range of 5 to 25, where a lower score represents a less severe GI symptom and a higher score represents a more severe GI symptom.&#xD;
An observer GI symptom questionnaire was administered to those patients who were &lt; 10 years old. The questionnaire was completed by the parents of the participants. All items and the scoring algorithm remained the same as for participants ≥ 10 years old.</description>

The number of participants who selected each response option for item 3 was assessed. Participants could select multiple reasons for treatment preference at each timepoint.</description>

        <description>The percentage of consumed tablet counts (compliance) was calculated for each treatment period in the core phase: deferasirox DT (period 1) and deferasirox FCT (period 2). Compliance was defined as the total tablet count consumed divided by total tablet count prescribed and multiplied by 100. Total tablet count consumed was calculated as total number of tablets dispensed minus total number of tablets lost/wasted or returned. Total tablet count prescribed was calculated as the number of tablets that the patient should have taken during this period. If a patient did not return the study drug, the compliance was not calculated.</description>

        <title>Change Over Time in Aftertaste Score of Palatability Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The palatability questionnaire consisted of 4 items, three items measuring taste and one item measuring aftertaste. The aftertaste item scored on a 5-point response scale with the response option: Very good = 1, Good = 2, Neither good nor bad = 3, Bad = 4, Very bad = 5. This item offered an additional response option of &quot;no aftertaste&quot;. The aftertaste score was calculated among participants who had an aftertaste. Higher aftertaste scores indicated a worse aftertaste.&#xD;
For participants less than (&lt;) 10 years old, an observer palatability questionnaire was administered. Items and scoring algorithm remained the same as for participants greater than or equal to (≥) 10 years old.&#xD;
Change in aftertaste score over time was assessed</description>

          <title>Change Over Time in Aftertaste Score of Palatability Questionnaire</title>
          <description>The palatability questionnaire consisted of 4 items, three items measuring taste and one item measuring aftertaste. The aftertaste item scored on a 5-point response scale with the response option: Very good = 1, Good = 2, Neither good nor bad = 3, Bad = 4, Very bad = 5. This item offered an additional response option of &quot;no aftertaste&quot;. The aftertaste score was calculated among participants who had an aftertaste. Higher aftertaste scores indicated a worse aftertaste.&#xD;
For participants less than (&lt;) 10 years old, an observer palatability questionnaire was administered. Items and scoring algorithm remained the same as for participants greater than or equal to (≥) 10 years old.&#xD;

        <title>Change Over Time in Palatability Score of Palatability Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The palatability questionnaire consisted of 4 items, three items measuring taste and one item measuring aftertaste. Among the taste items, first one measured taste on a 5-point response scale. The other two items measured what happened after taking the medicine and how the perceived amount of liquid taken with the medicine was. Responses to these 3 items were combined and converted into a single palatability score using a scoring matrix: each combination of responses on each of 3 items corresponded to a predefined palatability score. E.g. if a participant responded &quot;bad&quot; to item 1, &quot;vomited &lt;30min&quot; to item 2 and &quot;not enough&quot; to item 3, then the palatability score assigned was 0. This score ranged from 0 to 11; higher scores indicated better palatability. For participants &lt;10 years old, an observer palatability questionnaire was administered. Items and scoring algorithm were the same as for participants ≥10 years old. Change in palatability score over time was assessed</description>

        <description>The mSICT patient reported outcome (PRO) consisted of 15 items that represented 3 domains: Adherence, Preference, and Concerns.&#xD;
The preference/satisfaction domain score consisted of 2 preference/satisfaction items, measured using a 5-point response scale. The preference score was calculated by summing these 2 items, with scores ranging from 2 to 10. Higher scores indicated worse satisfaction.&#xD;
For participants &lt; 10 years old, an observer version (ObsRO) was administered. Preference score remained the same as for participants ≥ 10 years old.</description>

        <description>The mSICT patient reported outcome (PRO) consisted of 15 items that represented 3 domains: Adherence, Preference, and Concerns.&#xD;
The concerns domain score consisted of 3 items to address any concerns or worries with the medication. All 3 items were measured on a 5-point response scale. The concerns score was calculated by summing the 3 items, with scores ranging from 3 to 15. Higher scores indicated fewer concerns. For participants &lt; 10 years old, an observer version (ObsRO) was administered. Concerns score remained the same as for participants ≥ 10 years old.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Gastrointestinal (GI) Symptom Score Based on GI Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The GI symptom score was calculated from responses to 5 questions of the GI questionnaire, each with a possible score of 1 to 5, for an overall possible score range of 5 to 25, where a lower score represents a less severe GI symptom and a higher score represents a more severe GI symptom.&#xD;
An observer GI symptom questionnaire was administered to those patients who were &lt; 10 years old. The questionnaire was completed by the parents of the participants. All items and the scoring algorithm remained the same as for participants ≥ 10 years old.</description>
