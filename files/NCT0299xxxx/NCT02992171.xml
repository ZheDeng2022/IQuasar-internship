      Study investigators will develop and pilot-test an oncology nurse-led care management&#xD;
      intervention to meet the primary palliative care needs of patients with advanced hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 is a case series to develop and refine the intervention. During this time, we will&#xD;
      develop initial interventionist training materials, study protocols, and a web-based outcomes&#xD;
      database; train 2 hematology-oncology nurses; enroll 10 patients with advanced hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies and their informal caregivers to receive intervention visits; conduct debriefing&#xD;
      interviews; iteratively refine the intervention based on nurse, oncologist, patient, and&#xD;
      caregiver feedback; and prepare the protocol for Aim 2. Aim 2 is a pilot study to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of administering the intervention and assessing outcomes. We&#xD;
      will recruit 30 patients and their informal caregivers to receive the intervention developed&#xD;
      in Aim 1 and collect measures of quality of life, symptom burden, anxiety and depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, caregiver burden, and healthcare utilization at baseline and monthly for up to&#xD;
      three months. Trial outcomes will include: rates of enrollment, study completion, and outcome&#xD;
      completion; intervention fidelity; and self-reported measures of study burdensomeness and&#xD;
      effectiveness among patients, caregivers, and clinicians.&#xD;

    <description>We will assess acceptability based on patient, caregiver, and clinician responses to closed-end survey questions. Definitions of adequate acceptability based on these surveys include:&#xD;
&gt; 80% of patient and caregiver participants would recommend the intervention to other patients with advanced hematologic malignancies and their caregivers.&#xD;
&gt; 80% of patient and caregiver participants agree or strongly agree that intervention visits have been helpful for (a) improving pain or other symptoms, (b) helping with illness understanding, (c) helping with coping, and (d) helping with planning for the future.&#xD;
&gt; 80% of oncologist participants disagree or strongly disagree that (a) working with intervention nurses has been burdensome or (b) the intervention has been disruptive to clinic workflow.&#xD;
&gt; 80% of oncologist and nurse participants agree or strongly agree that the intervention (a) has helped me to take better care of my patients and (b) has improved the quality of care.</description>
