      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past decades there have been seen an increase in life expectancy in Denmark. One of&#xD;
      the consequences is that the patients who need heart surgery have a higher average age and&#xD;
      some of these patients have a fragile physique that increases the risks of major surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cardiac surgery, there are different types of scoring system for assessing the&#xD;
      preoperative risk of death associated with surgery. Among them are EuroSCORE and STS systems&#xD;
      the most used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluate the preoperative risk using the frailty score system, CAF (comprehensive&#xD;
      assessment of frailty), based on an assessment of the patient's physical condition. If the&#xD;
      patient has a lower than expected physical condition, the patient is frail. The assessment of&#xD;
      the physical condition generated from questions about the patient's medical history and&#xD;
      physical activity as well as performing less physical tests, consisting of strength, balance&#xD;
      and walking speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective observational study, who investigates how many of the patients who must undergo&#xD;
      heart surgery, that is frail. Then compare the patients who are frail with non-frail patients&#xD;
      in terms of complications, mortality and quality of life after the procedure. By use of CAF&#xD;
      score the patients are scored frail or non-frail. There is planned a further study which&#xD;
      compare degree of kidney injury in frail with non-frail patients. Our assumption is that&#xD;
      patients which are frail, have an increased risk of complications and longer hospital stay,&#xD;
      higher consumption of intensive days and more readmissions. Using frailty score in&#xD;
      combination with the existing score systems EuroSCORE and STS score, are believed to be a&#xD;
      better predictor of complications following heart surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      FICS study is a prospective observational study of patients undergoing cardiac surgery in the&#xD;
      cardiothoracic department of Rigshospitalet. Planned to enroll 600 patients over a two year&#xD;
      period. The study consists of various smaller physical test and questions. Which is used to&#xD;
      assess whether the patient is frail and not frail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively follow-up after 30 days with a phone call and after 12 months through danish&#xD;
      data register. At the both follow-up times, data are collected on the somatic readmissions /&#xD;
      diagnoses and vital status through the national register and review of relevant journal&#xD;
      notes. Afterwards comparing complications and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who can enter:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One patients can be included if the following criteria are met: Age&gt; 65 years, Elective or&#xD;
      subacute surgery, CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting),valve substitution or combination of&#xD;
      these&#xD;
&#xD;
      If one or more of the following criteria are met, the patient is not included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute surgery, Clinical unstable, Severe neuropsychiatric impairment, Uncooperative&#xD;
      (psychiatric diagnosis) and Re-operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects, risks and disadvantages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today preoperative risk assessment are assessed by EuroSCORE. Introduction of CAF, frailty&#xD;
      score will not expose patients to the risk or side effect, since the course or treatment does&#xD;
      not change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are considered that the study are economically justified, since hypothetically this&#xD;
      would lead to fewer readmissions, fewer days in intensive care and shorter hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acquisition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will in this trial be over 65 years old and must have completed elective or&#xD;
      subacute cardiac surgery. They will receive participant information and thus the opportunity&#xD;
      to read about the study before the first appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At first appearance they meet our project assistant and get here verbal information about the&#xD;
      study, where also questions can be answered. Subsequently, the patients will be asked to sign&#xD;
      a consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication of test results / research ethics statement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knowledge and results obtained through the survey will provide essential scientific&#xD;
      information of significance for the future course and treatment of patients undergoing&#xD;
      cardiac surgery with regard to the number of hospital days, intensive days and readmissions.&#xD;
      Thus, the investigator believes that the study is appropriate and ethically&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, patients referred to cardiac surgery are aging. An increasing number of patients&#xD;
      are now older than 70 years. [1]This older population of patients undergoing cardiac surgery&#xD;
      often has several comorbidities and has an increased risk of complications and mortality&#xD;
      compared to the younger patients.[1,2] Furthermore, several studies have shown that elderly&#xD;
      patients with cardiovascular diseases may be frail. Frailty is a term used to assess the true&#xD;
      biological status of a patient and defined as a patient's impaired resistance to stressors&#xD;
      due to a decline in physiologic reserve.[3-8] In cardiac surgery there are several risk&#xD;
      scores to assess 30-day mortality exists. The most common are the European system for cardiac&#xD;
      operative risk evaluation (EuroSCORE) I, EuroSCORE II and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons&#xD;
      (STS) score. However, the EuroSCORE seems to have a tendency to overestimate the&#xD;
      perioperative risk in the elderly population and opposite the STS score a tendency to&#xD;
      underestimate the risk. One of the reasons for this may be that none of the risk scores&#xD;
      incorporate the biological status of the patients.[9-11] Within the last 5 years a few&#xD;
      studies evaluating different 'frailty scores' in cardiac patients has been published.&#xD;
      [3-6,8,12-16] None of these frailty risk scores are fully validated and therefore widely&#xD;
      adopted. In a German single center study of 400 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery&#xD;
      and aged 74 or above frailty was assessed by the comprehensive assessment of frailty (CAF)&#xD;
      score. The CAF scores assess weakness, self-reported exhaustion, slowness of gait speed, low&#xD;
      activity and physical performance. [14,15] The CAF score correlates well with the EuroSCORE&#xD;
      and STS score, but is a very complex and time consuming risk score. In an effort to make the&#xD;
      test more clinical practical a simpler version of the CAF score has been developed. The&#xD;
      'frailty predicts death one year after elective cardiac surgery test' (FORECAST) includes;&#xD;
      chair rise, self-reported weakness, stair climbing, two physicians estimation of frailty and&#xD;
      serum creatinine level. [14,17]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an observational prospective study, we will identify and describe the number of frail&#xD;
      patients undergoing first time cardiac surgery in our department, compare the risk of&#xD;
      short-term and long-term complications and compare quality of life in frail versus non-frail&#xD;
      patients. Frailty will be assessed with the CAF score. In a substudy we will analyze the risk&#xD;
      of renal insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients deemed frail using the CAF score have increased risk of short-term and long-term&#xD;
      complications. With the frailty score in addition to EuroSCORE or STS score, we can better&#xD;
      predict complications compared to EuroSCORE or STS score alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Patients/study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      FICS study is a prospective observational study of elderly patients undergoing cardiac&#xD;
      surgery at the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University&#xD;
      Hospital, Denmark. Expect to include 600 patients during a two years inclusion period. With a&#xD;
      minimum of 12 month inclusion period, but all included in the analysis, with a maximum&#xD;
      follow-up time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patients aged above 65 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients referred to elective and subacute cardiac surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All undergoing CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting), valve replacement and CABG with&#xD;
           valve replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;

        5. Reoperations&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed after discharge by searching The Danish National Registry, which&#xD;
      contains informations an all somatic hospital admissions. From which there will be collected&#xD;
      a copy of the patient record for all hospital admissions. Patient records will be assessed&#xD;
      for pour predefined outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about vital status will be achieved by searching the Danish Central Civil&#xD;
      Register. The cause of death will be obtained from patients records and death certificates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 30 days we will contact the patients through phone to ask about their quality of life&#xD;
      and intake/changes in medicine and again a follow up in Danish Central Civil Register at 12&#xD;
      month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E) Substudies:&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study 3,Predicting postoperative Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in frail vs. non-frail patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AKS is a major complication after cardiac surgery and associated with increased mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity. It has been proven that knowing patients renal reserve before surgery is&#xD;
      important, both for predicting mortality and AKI outcomes. Since early detection of these&#xD;
      patients may contribute to improving outcomes. Estimation of the renal reserve by Serum&#xD;
      creatinine, eGFR, Serum cystatin C, Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin&#xD;
      (NGAL), Cr EDTA Clearance and 24 hr. collection of urine to determine Cr Clearance, protein&#xD;
      and albumin. This samples will be collecte on preoperative day, postoperativly day 5 and 3 a&#xD;
      follow-up 3 months postoperativley.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: In this study the primary outcome is development of AKI and the severity of&#xD;
      AKI in frail vs. non-frail patients, defined as having one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diuresis &lt;0,5ml/kg/hr. for &gt;6 consecutive hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum creatinine raised by &gt;26umol/L within 48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  serum creatinine rises &gt;1,5 fold from the reference value ( the lowest value recorded&#xD;
           within 3 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Persistent AKI: Having AKI for 48 hours or longer. Study 4, To examine the correlation&#xD;
      between frailty score and the other two commonly used surgical risk scores, EuroSCORE and STS&#xD;
      and their performance characteristics in patients over the age of 65 undergoing cardiac&#xD;
      surgery. This study compare the commonly used risk estimation systems for patients undergoing&#xD;
      cardio-surgical procedures, as STS in north America and EuroSCORE in Europe with the frailty&#xD;
      score CAF and FORECAST for estimation of mortality and morbidity 30 days and 12 month&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F) The Frailty scoring scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAF:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of frailty by using the comprehensive assessment of frailty (CAF) scoring scale of&#xD;
      S. Sündermann. [14][15]This is based on a combination of different scoring scales. The first&#xD;
      part is based on the Fried criteria: weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, low activity,&#xD;
      slowness of gait speed and weakness. Where CAF includes all except weight loss. Self-reported&#xD;
      exhaustion are two questions by the original CES-D scale, Center for epidemiological study&#xD;
      Depression. Low activity by asking to instrumental activity of daily living (IADL). The IADL&#xD;
      used are, walking, housework, outdoor activity, regular sport and others. Following are&#xD;
      kilocalories per week calculated by formula: Kilo Cal= (w x frequency of activity x duration&#xD;
      of activity)/2. Slowness, speed in meters per second, where the patient walk 4 meters in&#xD;
      normal walking speed and weakness through grip strength by pulling as strong as you can the&#xD;
      grasp of the dynamometer in kilograms (kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part is physical performance tests. Testing the balance, how long you can stand&#xD;
      still with your feet together, with one feet halfway in front of the other (semi-tandem) and&#xD;
      with one feet completely in front of the other one (tandem). At each position the time is&#xD;
      measured and put in to frailty table to score points. In the last element of balance the&#xD;
      patients is asked to turn around themselves 360 degrees and again the time is obtained. Then&#xD;
      testing the body control, get up and down from a chair three times, put on and remove a&#xD;
      jacket and pick up a pen from the floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last part is Laboratory tests, including level of serum albumin, Creatinine and calculate&#xD;
      Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end two physicians, different from the person observing the CAF test (one cardiac&#xD;
      surgeon and one experienced clinician) estimate the patients frailty after the Clinical&#xD;
      frailty scale score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clinical frailty scale is from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging, Which is based on&#xD;
      a frailty index composed of 70 items, from where you estimate the frailty on a scale 1-7. 1.&#xD;
      Very fit: robust, active, energetic, well motivated and fit; these people commonly exercise&#xD;
      regularly and are in the most fit group for their age. 2. Well: without active disease, but&#xD;
      less fit than people in category 1. 3. Well, with treated comorbid disease: disease symptoms&#xD;
      are well controlled compared with those in category 4. 4. Apparently vulnerable: although not&#xD;
      frankly dependent, these people commonly complain of being &quot;slowed up&quot; or have disease&#xD;
      symptoms. 5. Mildly frail: with limited dependence on others for instrumental activities of&#xD;
      daily living. 6. Moderately frail: help is needed with both instrumental and non-&#xD;
      instrumental activities of daily living. 7. Severely frail: completely dependent on others&#xD;
      for the activities of daily living, or terminally ill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally to get the patients total CAF score, you add each individual test scores together. It&#xD;
      has a maximum score of 35 points. That is divided into not frail 1-10, moderately frail 11-25&#xD;
      and severely frail 26-35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Out from the CAF score, there is a ability to score and use FORECAST (Frailty predicts death&#xD;
      One year after elective cardiac surgery test) which include only 5 of CAF items: chair rise,&#xD;
      weakness, stair climb, CFS (clinical frailty scale) and Serum creatinine. FORECAST has a&#xD;
      maximum score of 14 points, which also is divided into, not frail 0-4, moderately frail 5-7&#xD;
      and severely frail 8-14.[17]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation. Based on the CAF frailty score patients will categorizes into the&#xD;
      non-frail group (CAF score &lt;11) or the frail group (CAF score 11 or above). In a previous&#xD;
      study Sündermann et al. found that 50% of the patients above 75 years undergoing first time&#xD;
      CABG were deemed frail using the CAF score. Furthermore, they observed that 1 year mortality&#xD;
      was 7% in the non-frail group versus 14% in frail-group[17] . Based on a power of 80% and a&#xD;
      risk of type I error of 5% and the mortality reported above gives an inclusion of at least&#xD;
      300 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Categorical data will be presented as numbers and percentages and compared&#xD;
      using chi square test or Fischer exact test, as appropriate. Continuous data will be&#xD;
      described as means with corresponding standard deviations (SD) and compared using students&#xD;
      t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to event for the primary and secondary outcomes will be analyzed using a Cox regression&#xD;
      model. Survival curves will be illustrated with Kaplan-Meier plots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A P-value of less than 0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preoperative testing for frailty will take place in the Department of Cardiothoracic&#xD;
      Surgery Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-profit study. The expenses will be covered by the involving departments at&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet. The department of cardiothoracic surgery will cover the costs of a project&#xD;
      nurse during the inclusion period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today our department use EuroSCORE as a risk score preoperative. The use of frailty score has&#xD;
      been used in the department of cardiology the last years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admission of frailty scoring in our department is humanly justified since the patient takes&#xD;
      no risk and there are no side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We find it financially responsible to introduce, because we hypothetical expect that this&#xD;
      will lead to fewer readmissions, fewer ICU days and hospitalization days.&#xD;
