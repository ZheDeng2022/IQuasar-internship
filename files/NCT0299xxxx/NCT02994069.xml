      Patients will receive standard of care radiation therapy to the primary tumor of the head and&#xD;
      neck and involved nodal metastasis and draining nodal basin and either weekly cisplatin or&#xD;
      every 3-week cisplatin in locally advanced SCCHN. The relationship between cisplatin toxicity&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will first be designated as either: a) Cohort 1 (locally advanced non-nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      SCCHN that is unresectable) OR b) Cohort 2 (resected and at high risk of recurrence with at&#xD;
      least one of the following criteria: extracapsular nodal extension, or invasive cancer at the&#xD;
      primary tumor resection margin (positive margin), lymphovascular invasion or perineural&#xD;
      invasion, pT3 or pT4 primary, or the presence of multilevel nodal disease. Subjects will then&#xD;
      be randomized to receive either Arm 1 or Arm 2 cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation and Cisplatin will be given concurrently and should start on the same day, ±1 day.&#xD;
      Radiation will continue without interruption whenever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will consist of standard of care radiation therapy to the primary tumor of the head&#xD;
      and neck and involved nodal metastasis and draining nodal basin, as determined by treating&#xD;
      radiation oncologist. Patients will be randomized to receive cisplatin at 100 mg/m2 every 3&#xD;
      weeks (3 doses) during radiation versus cisplatin at 40 mg/m2 once weekly (7 doses) during&#xD;
      radiation. This will provide similar cumulative doses of cisplatin in all arms of the&#xD;
      study.IMRT will be delivered in 30-35 fractions over 6-7 weeks, 5 fractions weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment will continue for 7&#xD;
      weeks or until one of the following criteria applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease progression,Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,&#xD;
      Unacceptable adverse event(s), Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or General or&#xD;
      specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further&#xD;
      treatment in the judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for 2 years after completion of chemoradiation or until death,&#xD;
      whichever occurs first, for toxicity and PFS.&#xD;

             63 days prior to registration. Patients must have at least 1 of the following&#xD;
             high-risk pathologic features: extracapsular nodal extension, invasive cancer at the&#xD;
             primary tumor resection margin (positive margin), lymphovascular invasion or&#xD;
             perineural invasion, or the presence of multilevel nodal disease. Patients must be&#xD;
             without evidence of distant metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential and male participants who are sexually active must&#xD;
             agree to use a medically effective means of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 1: Patients in Cohort 1 must have measurable disease, defined as at least one&#xD;
             lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to&#xD;
             be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥ 20 mm (≥ 2&#xD;
             cm) with conventional techniques or as ≥ 10 mm (≥ 1 cm) with spiral CT scan, MRI, or&#xD;
             calipers by clinical exam. See Section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease.&#xD;
             Cohort 2: Subjects in the post-operative setting (Cohort 2) are not required to have&#xD;
             measurable disease and response rate will not be assessed in cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have a history of prior head and neck malignancy, but must be able to&#xD;
             tolerate full dose radiation and chemotherapy for the current head and neck cancer, as&#xD;
             determined by the treating oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function assessed within 14 days prior to&#xD;

             ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior chemotherapy for the current locally advanced SCCHN is allowed. Prior&#xD;
             radiation or chemotherapy for a previous head and neck cancer is allowed provided full&#xD;
             dose cisplatin and radiation can be delivered to the patient in this clinical trial&#xD;
             and provided the patient is in remission from the prior head and neck cancer, and can&#xD;
             undergo full dose radiation and chemotherapy for the current primary head and neck&#xD;
             cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry,&#xD;
             throughout the duration of active treatment and for 4 months after completion of&#xD;
             chemotherapy and radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cisplatin and radiation are known teratogens. For this reason, women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, throughout the duration of active&#xD;
             treatment and for 4 months after completion of chemotherapy and radiation. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men&#xD;
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to the study, for the duration of active study treatment, and for 4 months after&#xD;
             completion of chemotherapy and radiation (both induction and definitive)&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with greater than grade 2 hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: head and neck cancer in&#xD;
             remission, adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ&#xD;
             cervical cancer, adequately treated previous Stage I or II cancer from which the&#xD;
             patient is currently in complete remission or other cancer from which the patient has&#xD;
             been disease-free for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with nasopharynx or salivary gland primary site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with distant metastatic disease (M1c) from the current head and neck cancer&#xD;
             including brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection (grade 3 or greater), symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements. Subjects with significant&#xD;
             symptoms of congestive heart failure who would not be expected to tolerate the IV&#xD;
             hydration for cisplatin are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because cisplatin and radiation are agents&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with cisplatin and radiation, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with cisplatin or radiation on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients with uncontrolled HIV despite combination antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
             are ineligible because of the potential for increased risk of lethal infections when&#xD;
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in&#xD;
             patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
