    <textblock>
      HyPeR is a multi-centre Phase 1 Dose Escalation Study of Guadecitabine (SGI-110) a Second&#xD;
      Generation Hypo-Methylating Agent in Combination with Pembrolizumab (MK3475) in Patients with&#xD;
      Refractory Solid Tumours. The investigators will be investigating the safety and toxicity of&#xD;
      the combination.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial of the combination of the hypo-methylating agent guadecitabine and an&#xD;
      anti-PD1 antibody (anti- programmed cell death protein 1) pembrolizumab. Patients will&#xD;
      receive subcutaneous guadecitabine daily on Days 1-4 of each 21-day cycle. Patients will&#xD;
      receive pembrolizumab intravenously once per 21-day cycle: on Day 8 of Cycle 2 and on Day 1&#xD;
      of each cycle from Cycle 3 onwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rational for this design is that this pre-loading with Guadecitabine will sensitise the&#xD;
      tumour to Pembrolizumab through the re-expression of genes that enhance tumour recognition,&#xD;
      the increase in density of tumour infiltrating T-cells and stimulation of the adaptive immune&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A (Dose Escalation) the investigators will investigate escalating doses of&#xD;
      Guadecitabine in combination with Pembrolizumab. Patients with advanced solid tumours will be&#xD;
      recruited in cohorts of 3 to 6 patients to investigate the combination of 200 mg of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, administered as an intravenous injection, with escalating doses of&#xD;
      guadecitabine, administered via a subcutaneous injection, once a day for 4 days (Days 1-4).&#xD;
      Guadecitabine dosing will start at 45mg/m2 but can be decreased to 30mg/m2 in the event of&#xD;
      toxicities or increased to 60mg/m2 in the absence of toxicities. Once the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose is reached (or under the advice from the Safety Review Committee) patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled to the dose expansion phase (Part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B (Dose Expansion): 20 patients will be recruited to Part B to further explore the&#xD;
      safety and activity of the combination of guadecitabine and pembrolizumab. This cohort will&#xD;
      include, but not be limited to patients with: castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC),&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and possibly other solid tumours based on emerging&#xD;
      anti-tumour activity data from Part A and any other relevant preclinical or clinical&#xD;
      published data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 30 to 35 patients will be entered into this trial, 6 to 12 patients in Part A&#xD;
      and 20 patients in Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated accrual rate of the dose escalation phase will involve approximately 3&#xD;
      patients per month across 2 centres. Accrual rates could be higher or lower but this estimate&#xD;
      takes into consideration that the first patient on an escalation cohort should complete Cycle&#xD;
      2 Day 15 prior to accrual of further patients in the cohort. Accrual in the expansion phase&#xD;
      is estimated at 2-4 patients per month across 2 centres. It is expected that the duration of&#xD;
      recruitment will be 12-24 months.&#xD;

             (programmed death-ligand 1) analysis 9. Agree to provide a fresh tumour biopsy at&#xD;
             baseline and on Cycle 2 Day 8 of a tumour lesion not previously irradiated (tumours&#xD;
             progressing in a prior site of radiation are allowed for PD-L1 characterization, other&#xD;
             exceptions may be considered after consultation with the Chief Investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
             10. Female subjects of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 14 days prior to receiving the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
             If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
             11. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of&#xD;
             birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the&#xD;
             course of the study through 6 months after the last dose of study medication. Subjects&#xD;
             of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have&#xD;
             not been free from menses for &gt;1 year. Decitabine, a metabolite of Guadecitabine, can&#xD;

             patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             12. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting&#xD;

             therapy. Decitabine, a metabolite of Guadecitabine, can affect fertility and so&#xD;
             cryopreservation of sperm should be discussed with male patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             nitrosoureas, Mitomycin-C and 4 weeks for investigational medicinal products) before&#xD;
             treatment, except for hormonal therapy with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone&#xD;

             potentially curative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Spinal cord compression or brain metastases unless asymptomatic, treated and stable&#xD;
             and not requiring steroids for at least 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments. Exceptions to this are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Grade 1 toxicities, which in the opinion of the investigator should not exclude&#xD;
                  the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alopecia of any grade&#xD;
&#xD;

             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 14 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             trial treatment. The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after&#xD;
             consultation with the chief Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 3 months&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment. Patients with Sjogren's syndrome will not be excluded from&#xD;
             the study. In addition patients that experienced a Grade 2 or higher immune-related&#xD;
             AE's on treatment with immunotherapy will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has evidence of interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroid treatment or has&#xD;
             active pneumonitis. Pneumonitis includes acute interstitial pneumonitis, pneumonitis&#xD;
             and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;

             The killed virus vaccines used for seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are&#xD;
             allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. FluMist®) are live attenuated&#xD;
             vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Major surgery (excluding minor procedures, e.g. placement of vascular access) from&#xD;
             which the patient has not yet recovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. At high medical risk because of severe or uncontrolled non-malignant systemic disease&#xD;
             including active uncontrolled infection, active bleeding diathesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Known to be serologically positive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Screening for chronic conditions is not required.&#xD;

                  events, such as heart failure, hypokalaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family&#xD;
                  history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age or&#xD;
                  any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval&#xD;
