      In this study the investigators will try to discover whether there is a difference for any of&#xD;
      the stimulation preparations - recombinant FSH + recombinant LH (pergoveris &amp; luveris) vs.&#xD;
      human menopausal gonadotropin (menopur) during GnRH-antagonist cycles in the meaning of&#xD;
      androgenic hormones profile. The study question is whether using recombinant LH will result&#xD;
      in different follicular hormonal milieu, serum endocrine profile or IVF outcomes than using&#xD;
      highly purified urinary gonadotropins with hCG mimicking LH activity.&#xD;

      ABSTRACT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal controlled ovarian stimulation (COH) protocol is yet to be decided and most&#xD;
      probably there is no right protocol that is optimal for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of luteinizing hormone (LH) administration during controlled ovarian stimulation&#xD;
      (COH) is widely debated in the current medical literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently the only source for exogenous LH activity was HMG preparations, however, in&#xD;
      the past few years an advancement in the field of recombinant technology resulted in&#xD;
      recombinant preparations of LH. In contrast to LH activity in HMG which is mainly due to hCG&#xD;
      rather than from LH, using r-LH provides true, consistent and precise LH activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past years few papers were published about the difference between recombinant follicle&#xD;
      stimulating hormone (r-FSH) and menotropins but there is still a need for researching the&#xD;
      different effects of gonadotropins preparations and in particular the effect of LH&#xD;
      administration during COH in the manner of follicular endocrine characteristics, embryo&#xD;
      quality and pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study the investigators aim to elucidate whether there is a difference for any&#xD;
      of the stimulation preparations - recombinant FSH + recombinant LH (pergoveris &amp; luveris) vs.&#xD;
      human menopausal gonadotropin (menopur) during GnRH-antagonist cycles. The study question is&#xD;
      whether using recombinant LH will result in different follicular hormonal milieu, serum&#xD;
      endocrine profile or IVF outcomes than using highly purified urinary gonadotropins with hCG&#xD;
      mimicking LH activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the relevant medical literature there is one prospective study dealing with the same&#xD;
      question, but, during long-GnRH-agonist cycles. In the aforementioned paper there were no&#xD;
      significant differences between the two stimulation preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS &amp; METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design - A non-intervention observational trial. Primary endpoint - Serum &amp; follicular&#xD;
      fluid hormonal profile during COH (FSH, LH, progesterone, estradiol, testosterone,&#xD;
      androstendione, 17-OH progesterone) Secondary endpoints - Implantation rate, clinical&#xD;
      pregnancy, # of follicles, # of oocytes, # of embryos, top quality embryos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sample - 100 patients undergoing COH for IVF using the GnRH-antagonist protocol&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria - 20-40 years old IVF patients, BMI 19-35 undergoing their 1-4 IVF cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria - Suspected PCOS, history of OHSS, Patients who had a chronic illness or&#xD;
      were receiving chronic medical treatment will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gonadotropin preparations -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. As HP-HMG we will use Menopur© (menotropins for injection, FERRING) which contains equal&#xD;
           amount of FSH &amp; LH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. As the recombinant preparation we will use Pergoveris© (follitropin alfa/lutropin alfa,&#xD;
           MERCK SERONO) which contains 150 units of FSH + 75 units of LH and Luveris© (lutropin&#xD;
           alfa, MERCK SERONO) which is LH only preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients - The study population will consist of all consecutive eligible patients&#xD;
      attending the IVF unit of our department for treatment of infertility. The study required no&#xD;
      modification of our routine, flexible, multi-dose GnRH antagonist protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, after the presence of quiescent ovaries on transvaginal ultrasound and low serum E2&#xD;
      level were confirmed on day 2/3 of menstruation, recombinant FSH - Gonal-F© (follitropin&#xD;
      alfa; MERCK SERONO) will be administered subcutaneously at a starting dose of 150-300 IU,&#xD;
      depending on patient's age and/or ovarian responsiveness in previous cycles. The gonadotropin&#xD;
      dosage will be adjusted individually according to serum E2 levels and vaginal ultrasound&#xD;
      measurements of follicular diameter, obtained every one or two days. LH will be added to the&#xD;
      protocol as urinary preparation Menopur© (menotropins for injection, FERRING) or as&#xD;
      recombinant preparations - Pergoveris© (follitropin alfa/lutropin alfa, MERCK SERONO) with or&#xD;
      without Luveris© (lutropin alfa, MERCK SERONO). GnRH-antagonist - Cetrotide© (cetrorelix,&#xD;
      MERCK SERONO), 0.25 mg daily subcutaneously, will be added when the leading follicle reached&#xD;
      14-16 mm diameter, and will be continued until the day of ovulation triggering. When at least&#xD;
      three mature (&gt;17 mm) follicles will be obtained, patients will receive an injection of&#xD;
      either Ovitrelle© 250 mcg (Choriogonadotropin alfa, MERCK SERONO) or GnRH-agonist -&#xD;
      Decapeptyl© 0.2 mg (Triptorelin acetate, FERRING).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, for the purpose of the study, in addition to the routine monitoring during the&#xD;
      COH cycle, blood samples will be drawn to determine the hormonal profile (E2, progesterone),&#xD;
      levels of serum androgens, namely, testosterone, androstendione, 17-OH progesterone and LH&#xD;
      and FSH: (1) day 1-3 of menstruation (Day-S); (2) day of or prior to hCG administration&#xD;
      (Day-hCG); and (3) day of ovum pick-up (Day-OPU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, pooled follicular fluid will be collected after oocytes retrieval (fluid destined&#xD;
      to be discarded) and will be examined for hormonal profile (FSH, LH, progesterone, estradiol,&#xD;
      testosterone, androstendione, 17-OH progesterone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To note - participation in this study WILL NOT change the COH treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics - The chi-squared test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be applied to detect&#xD;
      statistically significant differences among the groups with regard to proportions or means. A&#xD;
      two-sided P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
