    <intervention_name>Nellix Endovascular Aneurysm Sealing System (Nellix®-System)</intervention_name>
    <description>The Nellix system is comprised of two independent flow channels, one to each iliac artery. Each flow channel consists of a balloon-expanded ePTFE covered stent surrounded by a Polymer-filled EndoBag which fills the blood lumen within the aorta, and seals the aneurysm from side-branch flow.</description>
