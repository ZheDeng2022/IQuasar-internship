      Trial comparing standard treatment (chemotherapy) with pembrolizumab treatment in patients&#xD;
      with advanced pretreated malignant mesothelioma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mesothelioma is an aggressive malignancy usually affecting the surfaces of body coelomic&#xD;
      cavities. It most commonly originates from the pleura with a propensity to the lower parietal&#xD;
      pleura and costo-diaphragmatic recess, and is almost always caused by asbestos exposure, with&#xD;
      a usual lag time of 30 years between exposure and presentation. Outcomes for most patients&#xD;
      are invariably fatal, with median survival from presentation around 9-12 months in most&#xD;
      series due to difficulties in achieving a complete microscopic surgical resection and tumour&#xD;
      relative chemo-refractoriness. Whilst initially considered rare, due to the demand of&#xD;
      asbestos of all varieties associated with industrialization following the Second World War,&#xD;
      the background incidence of mesothelioma of 1/million has risen to 40/million in some&#xD;
      countries. In the UK, where substantial asbestos exposure continued until the 1970s, the&#xD;
      death rate is the highest in the world with a current epidemic of new cases, predicted to&#xD;
      continue for another 5-10 years. Two main histological subtypes of mesothelioma are&#xD;
      identified. The epitheliod subtype is the commonest, accounting for around 40% of cases,&#xD;
      whilst the sarcomatoid subtype is observed in 20% of cases; the latter being typically&#xD;
      aggressive and chemorefractory. Around 35% cases have features of both epitheliod and&#xD;
      sarcomatoid subtypes and are termed biphasic subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with pleural mesothelioma, in whom surgery is not considered appropriate,&#xD;
      systemic chemotherapy (platinum combined with pemetrexed) remains the international standard&#xD;
      of care. Cisplatin/pemetrexed is associated with a response rate of 41% and confers an OS&#xD;
      advantage of 3 months over cisplatin alone, and is the only licensed systemic therapy for&#xD;
      mesothelioma in Europe. Despite this, the median survival is 9-12 months from most series in&#xD;
      unresectable cases. At relapse, after platinum-based chemotherapy, no anti-cancer systemic&#xD;
      therapies are licensed. Whilst several small phase II studies and retrospective series have&#xD;
      suggested potential efficacy for chemotherapy with agents including carboplatin/gemcitabine,&#xD;
      or vinorelbine, none thus far have demonstrated efficacy benefit in a randomised study, with&#xD;
      median PFS rates reported of about 3 months for both gemcitabine and vinorelbine. There is&#xD;
      therefore a huge unmet need for effective therapy for patients with relapsed pleural&#xD;
      mesothelioma. The largest trial ever performed of systemic therapy in relapsed pleural&#xD;
      mesothelioma in 661 patients documented the natural outcome of this group of relapsed&#xD;
      mesothelioma patients, reporting a median OS of 27.1 weeks (6 months) and median PFS for 6.1&#xD;
      weeks (1.5 months) for placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) is a co-inhibitory molecule at the immunological synapse that&#xD;
      acts as a major regulator of adaptive immunity, and is exploited by tumour cells to result in&#xD;
      adaptive immune resistance (tolerance). This occurs when PD-1 binds to the ligands PD-L1&#xD;
      (B7H1) or PD-L2, which are expressed on many tumour types. High PD-L1 expression on tumours&#xD;
      is associated with poorer outcomes. Mesothelioma has been shown to express PD-L1, with a&#xD;
      small study identifying PDL1 expression in up to 40% of mesotheliomas. Moreover,&#xD;
      immunologically-mediated inflammation is known to be a key driver for mesothelioma&#xD;
      development via the Nalp3 imflammasome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb)&#xD;
      of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its&#xD;
      ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need to identify new ways for the systemic therapy of malignant mesothelioma and&#xD;
      immune checkpoint inhibition is a promising way forward. Results from the proposed trial will&#xD;
      contribute to overcoming tumour-specific immune suppression with immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibition.&#xD;
