    <textblock>
      In a previous study at the Appalachian State University (ASU) Human Performance Laboratory at&#xD;
      the North Carolina Research Campus (NCRC), investigators showed that cyclists ingesting about&#xD;
      one-half of a banana with water every 15 minutes cycled 75-km faster (5%) than with water&#xD;
      alone. The polyphenols (i.e., chemicals in plants with health benefits) in the banana&#xD;
      improved the capacity to counter oxidative stress, and the sugars lowered post-exercise&#xD;
      inflammation. The cyclists reported some gastrointestinal discomfort, however, from the high&#xD;
      volume of bananas consumed. Dole Foods, the sponsor of this study, has a banana collection&#xD;
      that includes many different varieties, including the Mini banana that has a higher sugar&#xD;
      (50%) and phenolic (63%) content than the typical banana (Cavendish) available in stores.&#xD;
      Thus athletes should experience similar performance benefits from a smaller volume of Mini&#xD;
      compared to Cavendish bananas, and reduced gastrointestinal symptoms. If study results are&#xD;
      favorable, Dole Foods may market the Mini banana as the &quot;sport&quot; banana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare ingestion of Mini and Cavendish bananas with an&#xD;
      equicaloric, sugar-only beverage or water on 75-km cycling performance and post-exercise&#xD;
      oxidative capacity and stress, inflammation, immune function, muscle damage and soreness, and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research procedures will be conducted at the Human Performance Laboratory (Room 1201,&#xD;
      Plants for Human Health Institute Building, 600 Laureate Way), operated by Appalachian State&#xD;
      University at the North Carolina Research Campus (NCRC) in Kannapolis, NC. Participants will&#xD;
      come here for orientation/baseline testing and then 4 exercise test sessions (with each&#xD;
      including two additional lab visits to provide 1- and 2-day 7:00 am recovery blood samples)&#xD;
      (thus 13 total lab visits). The total amount of time participants will be asked to volunteer&#xD;
      for this study is about 35 hours at the Human Performance Laboratory (over a 7 to 8-week&#xD;
      period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ORIENTATION AND BASELINE TESTING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One to two weeks prior to the first 75-km cycling time trial, participants will report to the&#xD;
      NCRC Human Performance Lab for orientation/baseline testing. Participants will be screened to&#xD;
      verify &quot;low risk&quot; status for cardiovascular disease, and provide voluntary consent.&#xD;
      Demographic and training histories will be acquired with questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be tested for VO2max (i.e., maximal oxygen consumption) using the Lodi&#xD;
      cycle ergometer. The purpose of the VO2max test is to determine maximum exercise capacity.&#xD;
      The time commitment is about 30 to 60 minutes, and participants will wear exercise clothes&#xD;
      and shoes that allow for free movement during vigorous exercise. Participants will be rested,&#xD;
      well nourished, and hydrated for the test and avoid alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco 3 hours&#xD;
      before the test. Participants will avoid significant exertion or exercise the day of testing&#xD;
      and report any medication that are being used to the testing staff before the test. The test&#xD;
      will begin with an exercise warm-up period of a few minutes, and then participants will pedal&#xD;
      at progressively harder workloads. The test will continue until participants become fatigued&#xD;
      and decide to stop, or other symptoms prohibit further exercise. Both leg tiredness and&#xD;
      breathlessness are common sensations of the fatigue that participants may experience. During&#xD;
      the test, participants will wear a facemask that allows exhaled air to be analyzed, and a&#xD;
      chest strap for heart rate monitoring. Participants will communicate with the lab personnel&#xD;
      during the test by the use of a perceived exertion chart to indicate how the exercise feels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percent body fat will be measured using the BodPod. Participants will sit inside the BodPod&#xD;
      with a tight-fitting swim suit for about 10 minutes while body fat is calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      75-km CYCLING TIME TRIALS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. 3-day pre-75 km cycling preparation: During the 3-day period prior to each 75-km cycling&#xD;
      trial, participants will taper exercise training (as if preparing for a race) and ingest a&#xD;
      moderate-carbohydrate diet using a food list restricting high fat foods and visible fats.&#xD;
      Participants will record all food and beverage intake during the 3-day period, with nutrient&#xD;
      intake assessed using a computerized dietary analysis software system. Participants will&#xD;
      bring the food log to each exercise lab session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Testing procedures: Participants will come to the lab four times at 7:00 am in an&#xD;
      overnight fasted state (at least 9 h with no food or beverage other than water) and complete&#xD;
      75-cycling time trials (at least two weeks apart) under four separate conditions (random&#xD;
      order, crossover): Water only (WAT); Cavendish bananas and water (BAN); Mini bananas and&#xD;
      water (SPORT-BAN); 6% carbohydrate beverage (SUGAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 7:00 am: A blood sample will be collected through a needle inserted into an arm vein&#xD;
           (about 35 ml or 2.5 tablespoons). An ultrasound scan of the thigh muscle will be&#xD;
           conducted to measure pre-exercise muscle glycogen levels. The side of the thigh will be&#xD;
           scanned through a smooth probe attached to the General Electric LOGIQ-e ultrasound&#xD;
           machine (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). Participants will lie on their backs with the&#xD;
           skin over the thigh exposed. Three baseline scans will be obtained (each taking 10&#xD;
           seconds), just prior to the exercise test, and then this muscle will be scanned three&#xD;
           times again following the exercise bout. A simple questionnaire will be used for to&#xD;
           indicate muscle soreness (DOMS). Participants will complete a symptom log, which will&#xD;
           include questions on digestive and mental health (heartburn, bloating, diarrhea, nausea,&#xD;
           energy levels, ability to focus, etc.). Participants will indicate responses using a&#xD;
           12-point Likert scale, with 1 relating to &quot;none at all&quot;, 6 &quot;moderate&quot;, and 12 &quot;very&#xD;
           high&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 7:10 am: Ingest 5 ml/kg water alone (about 1.5 cups), or SUGAR beverage, or water (5&#xD;
           ml/kg) and BAN or SPORT-BAN (volume adjusted to provide 0.4 g carbohydrate per kilogram&#xD;
           of body weight) (about two cups SUGAR beverage, one Cavendish banana, or 1.5 Mini&#xD;
           bananas).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 7:30 am: Start 75-km cycling time trial. Participants are to complete the 75-km course&#xD;
           as fast as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will use their own bicycles on CompuTrainer Pro Model 8001 trainers&#xD;
                (RacerMate, Seattle, WA).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A mountainous 75-km course with moderate difficulty will be utilized using the&#xD;
                CompuTrainer software system.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Heart rate and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) will be recorded every 30&#xD;
                minutes, and workload (watts) continuously monitored using the CompuTrainer&#xD;
                MultiRider software system (version 3.0, RacerMate, Seattle, WA).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and ventilation will be measured&#xD;
                using the Cosmed metabolic cart after 16 km and 55 km cycling (through a facemask&#xD;
                similar to what occurred during baseline testing). Performance will be monitored&#xD;
                throughout the 75-km cycling time trial using percentage of maximal watts to ensure&#xD;
                that a full effort is being given.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will consume 3 ml/kg water every 15 min (e.g., about one cup for a 75&#xD;
                kg cyclist).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will ingest 0.2 g carbohydrate/kg body weight every 15 minutes of BAN,&#xD;
                SPORT-BAN, or SUGAR beverage during the 75-km time trials. For a 75-kg cyclist,&#xD;
                intake will be approximately 0.5 Cavendish banana, just under one Mini Banana, or&#xD;
                one cup SUGAR beverage every 15 minutes. Bananas will be provided by Dole Foods at&#xD;
                the appropriate ripening stage (equal to stage six). The SUGAR beverage will be&#xD;
                prepared by Dole Foods, and will contain 60 grams sugar per liter using the same&#xD;
                sugar profile found in Cavendish bananas.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  No other beverage or food containing energy or nutrients will be allowed during the&#xD;
                cycling time trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ~10:00-11:30 am: Immediate-post-exercise, 0.75-h, 1.5-h recovery blood samples; lunch&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood samples will be taken from an arm vein immediately after completing the 75-km&#xD;
                time trial, and then 0.75-h and 1.5-h post-exercise. Participants will be allowed&#xD;
                to shower and change clothes in the facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  An ultrasound scan for muscle glycogen levels will be conducted immediately&#xD;
                post-exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Immediately post-exercise, participants will complete the symptom log.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will indicate muscle soreness using the DOMS questionnaire immediately&#xD;
                post-exercise and 1.5-h post-exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will ingest no food or beverage other than water (7 ml/kg or about two&#xD;
                cups during the 1.5 h post-exercise period).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Right after the 1.5-h recovery blood sample has been collected, participants will&#xD;
                ingest a meal adjusted to 12 kcal/kg body weight. The meal will be prepared by Dole&#xD;
                Foods and include grilled chicken, rice, corn, green beans, salt, and water.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. ~11:30 am to 2:30 pm: 3-h and 4.5-h recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Additional blood samples will collected 3-h and 4.5-h post-exercise. During this&#xD;
                time, participants will rest quietly in the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The DOMS questionnaire will be administered 4.5-h post-exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will ingest no food or beverage other than water (7 ml/kg per hour).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At ~2:30 pm, participants will be allowed to leave the lab, and will be instructed&#xD;
                to adhere to the food list requirements, and to keep exercise training intensity&#xD;
                moderate with duration under 1.5 h per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 7:00 am: 21-h and 45-h Recovery samples (following two mornings) • Participants will&#xD;
           return to the lab the following two mornings in an overnight fasted state at about 7:00&#xD;
           am (~21-h and 45-h after completing the 75-km time trial). Blood samples and responses&#xD;
           to the DOMS questionnaire will be collected at both lab visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be analyzed for markers of muscle damage, inflammation and oxidative&#xD;
      stress indicators (using blood levels and gene expression), and immune function. Stored&#xD;
      samples will be measured for post-exercise shifts in hundreds of biochemicals using a special&#xD;
      method called metabolomics, pending additional sponsor funding.&#xD;
