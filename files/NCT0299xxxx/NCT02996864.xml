  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      College students are in a newly independent phase of life; many of whom encounter unhealthy&#xD;
      dietary decision- making, barriers to physical activity, and poor sleep behaviors. Healthy&#xD;
      Detours is a location-based smartphone application tailored in real-time to a student's&#xD;
      schedule and locale, and aims to guide students toward healthier eating, exercise, and&#xD;
      lifestyle choices as a way to prevent the onset of damaging and costly health outcomes.&#xD;
      Through a randomized control trial, this Phase II project will test the effectiveness of an&#xD;
      evidence-based smartphone application that will provide students with on-demand,&#xD;
      location-specific information about healthy lifestyle choices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor eating habits, sedentary behavior, and deficient sleep quality are problematic for many&#xD;
      college students. Surrounded by numerous unhealthy food choices and physical activity&#xD;
      barriers, students are vulnerable to overweight and chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart&#xD;
      disease, and cancer. Today's college students are more technologically connected than&#xD;
      previous generations positioning mobile devices as an ideal method for reaching this&#xD;
      population with healthy lifestyle information. In a Phase I Small Business Innovation&#xD;
      Research (SBIR), our team developed Healthy Detours, an innovative mobile phone application&#xD;
      (app) designed to assist college students make healthier choices about food and physical&#xD;
      activity on and around their college campus. Specifically, we (a) developed a comprehensive&#xD;
      database to provide user-specific information through the use of location-based services&#xD;
      (LBS) focused on healthy lifestyle choices; (b) conducted an online survey with a national&#xD;
      sample of undergraduates which examined eating and physical activity preferences, interest in&#xD;
      smartphone technology to monitor healthy lifestyle choices, and use of &quot;check-ins&quot; for health&#xD;
      information; (c) conducted focus groups which demonstrated the prototype app's ability to&#xD;
      provide the user with rudimentary aspects of the LBS database to facilitate real-time&#xD;
      decision making for healthier choices; (d) conducted lab and field usability testing of the&#xD;
      app for its accuracy in identifying user location and functionality; and (e) developed a&#xD;
      specifications document to outline the Phase II development plan. The results of the Phase I&#xD;
      activities provided strong support for this project in which we propose to develop an&#xD;
      interactive, mobile app that is guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Social&#xD;
      Cognitive Theory (SCT). This project will produce a fully functional LBS smartphone app that&#xD;
      will provide (1) immediate and relevant feedback at the point of decision-making to reinforce&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle behaviors, (2) person- and location-specific tailored data, acquired&#xD;
      through activity tracking, to provide users with necessary information to improve future&#xD;
      decision-making, and (3) multiple health-tracking features that will aid in self-monitoring.&#xD;
      Healthy Detours will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (n=300) with students at a&#xD;
      large 4-year university. Primary outcomes include changes in dietary intake, physical&#xD;
      activity behavior, sleep quality, and quality of life. Overall, the proposed project has the&#xD;
      potential to significantly impact college students' health and quality of life by providing&#xD;
      them with real-time healthy choices. Healthy Detours is one of the first comprehensive&#xD;
      wellness apps offered to college students, and provides an opportunity via the SBIR funding&#xD;
      mechanism to reach a large number of students as evidenced by the commercialization plan.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) will be administered at baseline (pre-test). The SF-12 survey contains categorical questions (e.g., yes/no) that assess limitations in role functioning. The survey also contains Likert response formats on a three-point scale (e.g., not at all, a little bit, moderately, quite a bit, and extremely) to assess pain, and a five-point scale to assesses overall health (excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor). A six-point scale (e.g., all of the time, most of the time, a good bit of the time, some of the time, a little of the time, and none of the time) assesses mental health, vitality, and social functioning. The SF-12 is scored using the recommended Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) SAS software program that creates two summary scores, mental health (MCS12), and physical health (PCS12). The scores are represented as t-scores that are linear transformations with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 in the general U.S. population.</description>

        <description>A nine-item International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short-form (IPAQ-SF) will be administered at baseline. The IPAQ-SF calculates the MET-minutes per week expended. MET minutes represent the amount of energy expended carrying out physical activity. A higher score represents a better outcome. Scores can range from 0 to 10,080.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life (QOL)</title>
        <description>The 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) will be administered at baseline (pre-test). The SF-12 survey contains categorical questions (e.g., yes/no) that assess limitations in role functioning. The survey also contains Likert response formats on a three-point scale (e.g., not at all, a little bit, moderately, quite a bit, and extremely) to assess pain, and a five-point scale to assesses overall health (excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor). A six-point scale (e.g., all of the time, most of the time, a good bit of the time, some of the time, a little of the time, and none of the time) assesses mental health, vitality, and social functioning. The SF-12 is scored using the recommended Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) SAS software program that creates two summary scores, mental health (MCS12), and physical health (PCS12). The scores are represented as t-scores that are linear transformations with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 in the general U.S. population.</description>

          <description>The 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) will be administered at baseline (pre-test). The SF-12 survey contains categorical questions (e.g., yes/no) that assess limitations in role functioning. The survey also contains Likert response formats on a three-point scale (e.g., not at all, a little bit, moderately, quite a bit, and extremely) to assess pain, and a five-point scale to assesses overall health (excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor). A six-point scale (e.g., all of the time, most of the time, a good bit of the time, some of the time, a little of the time, and none of the time) assesses mental health, vitality, and social functioning. The SF-12 is scored using the recommended Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) SAS software program that creates two summary scores, mental health (MCS12), and physical health (PCS12). The scores are represented as t-scores that are linear transformations with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 in the general U.S. population.</description>
