    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1 study to determine the safety and tolerability of single-agent&#xD;
      treatment with AutoSynVax™ vaccine with QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant in subjects with advanced&#xD;
      cancer that is refractory to standard therapies and a life expectancy of ≥6 months from the&#xD;
      time tissue is obtained. A minimum of 6 (≤20) subjects will be enrolled to receive every&#xD;
      other week subcutaneous injection of 240 μg AutoSynVax™ vaccine + 50 μg QS-21 Stimulon®&#xD;
      adjuvant for up to 1 year.&#xD;

&#xD;
               5. ≤7 days for immunosuppressive-based treatment for any reason. Systemic&#xD;
                  corticosteroids are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Note: Patients receiving physiologic steroid replacement for adrenal&#xD;
                  insufficiency are eligible (i.e. &lt; 10 mg prednisone per day).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Note: The use of physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy may be approved&#xD;
                  after consultation with the sponsor.&#xD;
