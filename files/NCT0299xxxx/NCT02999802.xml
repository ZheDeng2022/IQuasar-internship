      This research seeks to better understand how cellular and molecular bases of changes&#xD;
      associated with aging contribute to decreased function and increased incidence of disease.&#xD;
      Specific mechanism in muscle responsible for anabolic resistance - a key component of&#xD;
      sarcopenia and frailty - will be identified. The proposed research is relevant to public&#xD;
      health because the discovery of new targets for interventions and novel therapeutics to&#xD;
      improve muscle strength and function, prevent falls, and reduce physical dependency will&#xD;
      improve the healthspan and quality of life in older adults by improving their physical&#xD;
      function and ability to remain independent and healthy for a longer period of time.&#xD;

      Anabolic resistance to nutrition is the reduced ability of skeletal muscle to increase&#xD;
      protein synthesis in response to feeding. It is a major contributor to muscle atrophy in&#xD;
      aging, inactivity, burns, trauma, and cancer cachexia. The effects of anabolic resistance on&#xD;
      health and physical function are important. For example, the loss of muscle mass and strength&#xD;
      with aging (sarcopenia) increases the risk for falls, physical dependency and morbidity in&#xD;
      older adults. A major determinant of muscle size is muscle protein content, which is&#xD;
      controlled by the fine balance between protein synthesis and breakdown. Recently,&#xD;
      investigators have found that amino acids and exercise independently increase muscle protein&#xD;
      synthesis and overall anabolism by activating the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin&#xD;
      complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway in humans. Aging and inactivity reduce these anabolic&#xD;
      effects, but the underlying mechanisms of anabolic resistance are not known. The purpose of&#xD;
      this application is to better understand how anabolic resistance develops in skeletal muscle.&#xD;
      The long-term goal is to identify specific molecular targets for the development of&#xD;
      evidence-based clinical interventions to counteract anabolic resistance and muscle wasting in&#xD;
      clinical populations. Here, investigators will focus on one potential mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      anabolic resistance to amino acids: activation of mTORC1 in human muscle cells. The central&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the physical activity restores mTORC1 signaling which is the primary&#xD;
      contributor to anabolic resistance in human skeletal muscle. Investigators will test this&#xD;
      hypothesis in healthy subjects with the following specific aim: Determine the effect of&#xD;
      increasing habitual physical activity on anabolic resistance. Investigators will study human&#xD;
      subjects utilizing stable isotopes model to measure amino acid kinetics and muscle protein&#xD;
      metabolism in combination with molecular analysis of muscle to determine the regulatory role&#xD;
      of amino acids, physical inactivity, and amino acid transporter functional activity on&#xD;
      mTORC1. The proposed approach is innovative because it represents a new and substantial&#xD;
      departure from the status quo as investigators will examine the underlying mechanisms of&#xD;
      anabolic resistance to nutrition using novel methodological approaches. The proposed research&#xD;
      is significant because it will lead to the development of evidence-based interventions to&#xD;
      treat sarcopenia and muscle wasting.&#xD;
