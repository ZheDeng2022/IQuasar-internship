      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People get Zika virus from infected mosquitos. They usually don t get very sick. But birth&#xD;
      defects were reported in babies born to mothers who had Zika infection. In rare cases, people&#xD;
      with Zika infection had a nervous system disease that causes severe muscle weakness and can&#xD;
      be life threatening. A new vaccine made from DNA in the code for a Zika virus protein could&#xD;
      help the body build an immune response against the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if a new vaccine against Zika virus disease is safe and causes any side effects. To&#xD;
      study specific immune responses to the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 18-50&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 18 visits over 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. All will get 3 vaccines at 3&#xD;
      separate monthly visits. They will receive the vaccine in the upper arm muscle. Some will get&#xD;
      it by needle and syringe, others by a device that uses high pressure to push the vaccine&#xD;
      through the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccine visits last 4-6 hours. Participants will get a thermometer to measure their&#xD;
      temperature and a ruler to measure any skin changes at the injection site. They will record&#xD;
      this data for 7 days after each injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other visits last 1-2 hours. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of any health changes or problems&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests: Some samples may be used for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with side effects may have extra visits.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I, randomized clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a 3 dose vaccination regimen with the Zika virus (ZIKVwt) DNA vaccine,&#xD;
      VRC-ZKADNA090-00-VP. Subjects will be randomized to one of three groups to receive a full 4&#xD;
      mg dose: 1) full dose by one intramuscular (IM) injection with needle and syringe; 2) split&#xD;
      dose given as two 0.5 mL IM injections with needle and syringe; 3) split dose given as two&#xD;
      0.5 mL IM injections with PharmaJet, a needle-free injection device. The primary hypothesis&#xD;
      is that the investigational ZIKVwt DNA vaccine will be safe and well tolerated in healthy&#xD;
      adults. A secondary hypothesis is that the vaccine will elicit a ZIKV-specific immune&#xD;
      response. The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the vaccine&#xD;
      in healthy adults. Secondary objectives are related to the immunogenicity of the vaccine and&#xD;
      vaccination regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational vaccine, VRC-ZKADNA090-00-VP, was developed by the Vaccine Research&#xD;
      Center (VRC), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health (NIH) and is composed of a single closed-circular DNA plasmid (VRC 5283)&#xD;
      that encodes the wild type (wt) precursor membrane M (prM) and envelope (E) proteins from the&#xD;
      H/PF/2013 strain of ZIKV. ZIKVwt&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults 18 to 50 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PLAN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-five subjects will be enrolled at the NIH Clinical Center and randomized to 3 groups to&#xD;
      receive study product on Day 0, Week 4 and Week 8. The protocol requires about 18 scheduled&#xD;
      clinic visits and a telephone follow-up contact after each study product administration.&#xD;
      Solicited reactogenicity will be evaluated using a 7-day diary card. Assessment of vaccine&#xD;
      safety will include clinical observation and monitoring of hematological and chemical&#xD;
      parameters at clinical visits throughout the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
      STUDY DURATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated for safety and immune responses throughout the study for 44 weeks&#xD;
      following the first vaccine administration. Durability of immune responses will be evaluated&#xD;
      at two long term follow-up visits, occurring at 18 and 24 months&#xD;
