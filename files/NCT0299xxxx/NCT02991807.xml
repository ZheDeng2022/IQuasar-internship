  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phosphatase and TENsin homolog (PTEN) gene germline mutations are associated with a spectrum&#xD;
      of clinical manifestations characterized by neurocognitive deficits, intellectual disability,&#xD;
      autism symptomatology, skin lesions, macrocephaly, hamartomatous overgrowth of tissues, and&#xD;
      an increased risk of cancers. Investigators are conducting research to evaluate the potential&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of RAD001 (everolimus) in this patient population, and the potential&#xD;
      neurocognitive benefits from treatment with RAD001 or placebo for a six month period. The&#xD;
      investigators hope this trial will lead to a better understanding of PTEN and to new forms of&#xD;
      treatment that may benefit children and adults with PTEN in the future.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a signal seeking Phase I/II 6-month, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial of everolimus in individuals, ages 5 to 45 years with a PTEN mutation, with safety and&#xD;
      neurocognition as the primary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's or a legal guardian will need to sign an informed consent prior to enrollment&#xD;
      in the study. To determine eligibility participants will undergo a series of screening tests&#xD;
      and safety measures. If determined to be eligible for the blinded phase of the study,&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to take either the study drug or a placebo (pill with&#xD;
      no medicine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blinded phase of the study involves about eight visits, five of which will occur at the&#xD;
      study site, and three of which will be conducted over the phone. These visits will take place&#xD;
      over a six month period. Study visits will vary in length. Baseline, three month and six&#xD;
      month visits may last up to 8 hours, if optional measures are done, while all other visits&#xD;
      will be less than 2 hours. The study visits include blood draws, general health exams, and&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessments. The study will also include optional eye-tracking, EEG and&#xD;
      auditory evoked potential (AEP) measures, and the collection of microbiome/mycobiome and&#xD;
      biomarker blood sample. There is no fee to participate in this study. The study drug will be&#xD;
      provided at no charge during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 6 month treatment phase, individuals who were randomly assigned to take placebo&#xD;
      will be offered inclusion in a 6 month open label phase where the study drug will be provided&#xD;
      at no charge. The open label phase assessments will be similar to those done in the blinded&#xD;
      phase, but patients/families will only need to return to the study site three times during&#xD;
      this phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a developmental assessments report after completing the study.&#xD;
      After all study data has been analyzed, patients and families will also be informed of the&#xD;
      overall results. Treatment on this study may or may not improve an individual's learning&#xD;
      skills (neurocognition) or behavior. We hope that future patients and families will benefit&#xD;
      from what is learned by this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims /Objectives Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate the safety of everolimus compared with placebo in patients with PTEN mutations&#xD;
      focusing on NCI CTCAE Grade 3 and 4 adverse events, serious adverse events, and Grade 3 and 4&#xD;
      laboratory toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate the efficacy of everolimus on neurocognition and behavior in inividuals with&#xD;
      PTEN mutations compared to placebo as measured by standardized, direct and indirect&#xD;
      neurocognitive tools and behavioral measures.&#xD;
