  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether achieving 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH] Vit D) levels (&gt;40 ng/mL)&#xD;
      among myocardial infarction patients will result in a reduction of cardiovascular-related&#xD;
      adverse events. Half of the patients will be randomized to receive standard of care and half&#xD;
      will receive clinical management of 25[OH] Vit D levels.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low 25[OH] Vit D levels have become a public epidemic with increasing recognition of its&#xD;
      widespread insufficiency both in the United States and worldwide. Epidemiologic studies have&#xD;
      associated low 25[OH] Vit D levels with coronary risk factors and adverse cardiovascular&#xD;
      outcomes. However, randomized trials are needed to establish the relevance of 25[OH] Vit D&#xD;
      status to cardiovascular health. While a few randomized trials have evaluated vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation, none have &quot;treated to target&quot; (i.e., individual dosing so that adequate&#xD;
      25[OH] Vit D levels are obtained), but have rather given &quot;blanket&quot; doses regardless of 25[OH]&#xD;
      Vit D level.&#xD;

    <description>Patients randomized to the standard of care arm will have a 25[OH] Vit D test performed, a sample taken and stored for future tests, and completion of a PHQ-9 depression survey at baseline and at study conclusion. No other contact is planned with the standard of care patients. Follow-up will be done by the querying of electronic records, which includes any 25[OH] Vit D testing, use of vitamin D supplementation, and outcomes.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the treatment arm will have a 25[OH] Vit D test performed, a sample taken and stored for future tests, and completion of a PHQ-9 depression survey. If at baseline a patient has a 25[OH] Vit D &gt;40 ng/mL then follow-up testing will occur 1 year from baseline and the patient will continue current treatment strategy (no supplementation or current supplementation dosage). If baseline 25[OH] Vit D levels are &lt;40 ng/mL then the patient will initiate or increase dose and return in 3 months (Â±15 days) to determine 25[OH] Vit D level. At 3 months, if 25[OH] Vit D &gt;40 ng/mL then current dose should be kept and the patient will return in 1 year for follow-up testing. However, if 25[OH] Vit D &lt;40 ng/mL then patients should double current dose and test again in 3 months. This should occur until 25[OH] Vit D reaches a level &gt;40 ng/mL and once achieved, the patient will return in 1 year for follow-up 25[OH] Vit D testing.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients, both male and female, &gt;18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Undergone angiography for a MI (troponin positive [&gt;0.04 ng/mL] and ACS diagnosis)&#xD;
             within the past month&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Receive follow-up care at an Intermountain Healthcare facility&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Not taking or taking &lt;1000 IU of vitamin D daily within the last 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willing to provide informed consent and participate in follow-up visits&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Hypersensitivity to vitamin D products&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of previous vitamin D supplementation of &gt;1000 IU daily within the past 3&#xD;
             months (i.e., &gt;40% of the days during the past 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Systemic disease (including terminal cancer, cirrhosis, end stage COPD, etc) with a&#xD;
