      1. Study name:A randomized clinical trial on atrial fibrillation screening by using an&#xD;
           automated electrocardiogram system in an elderly Chinese population&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rationale: Failure in the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation leads to high&#xD;
           incidence of stroke and high mortality and disability. It is therefore imperative to&#xD;
           diagnose and manage atrial fibrillation in a timely and effective fashion to prevent the&#xD;
           complications of atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objective:The primary objective is to investigate whether more frequent ECG recordings&#xD;
           and analyses with this automated ECG system (4 times/year) would significantly improve&#xD;
           the detection of atrial fibrillation compared to a single annual ECG screen.The&#xD;
           secondary objective is to explore whether even more frequent ECG recordings and analyses&#xD;
           (8 times/year) would further improve the detection of atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study design: The present study is designed as a randomized controlled trial of parallel&#xD;
           group (two).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study population: Men and women aged at least 65 years (n=7000) meet the&#xD;
           inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Randomization and treatment: Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into&#xD;
           the usual and intensive screening groups with 3500 patients in each group, and within&#xD;
           the intensive screening group in a 3:1 ratio into the intensive and more intensive&#xD;
           subgroups with 2625 and 875 patients, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Follow up: 1)Usual screening group: ECG recordings at baseline plus at 1 and 2 year of&#xD;
           follow-up; three ECG recordings in total. 2)Intensive screening subgroup: ECG recordings&#xD;
           at baseline plus quarterly during follow-up, at months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24; 9&#xD;
           ECG recordings in total. 3)More intensive screening subgroup: ECG recordings at baseline&#xD;
           plus weekly during the first month of follow-up and quarterly afterwards, at weeks 1, 2,&#xD;
           3 and 4 and months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24; 13 ECG recordings in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Sample size estimation: The number of required subject for the whole trial is 7000.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Timeline: Start of subjects enrollment : December 2016; End of subjects enrollment :&#xD;
           June 2017; End of study : October 2020&#xD;

      1. Study name:A randomized clinical trial on atrial fibrillation screening by using an&#xD;
           automated electrocardiogram system in an elderly Chinese population&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rationale: The incidence of atrial fibrillation rises continuously.The main detrimental&#xD;
           effect of atrial fibrillation is its complication of stroke.Failure in the diagnosis and&#xD;
           management of atrial fibrillation before the incidence of stroke leads to high mortality&#xD;
           and disability. It is therefore imperative to diagnose and manage atrial fibrillation in&#xD;
           a timely and effective fashion and prevent the complications of atrial fibrillation, by&#xD;
           screening followed by the use of proven therapy, such as warfarin. An automated handheld&#xD;
           ECG system based on a smartphone has recently become available for the screening of&#xD;
           atrial fibrillation in high risk people.However, how this system can be most effectively&#xD;
           used for the widespread screening of atrial fibrillation remains a question that&#xD;
           requires investigation. Moreover, while repeated recordings will have a higher yield of&#xD;
           atrial fibrillation diagnosis [11], it is not certain what constitutes an optimum number&#xD;
           of ECG recordings balancing cost and effectiveness. The present study was therefore&#xD;
           designed as a randomized controlled trial to investigate whether more frequent ECG&#xD;
           recordings and analyses with this automated ECG system would significantly improve the&#xD;
           detection of atrial fibrillation compared to a single annual ECG screen in elderly&#xD;
           Chinese population in the community health centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objective:The primary objective is to investigate whether more frequent ECG recordings&#xD;
           and analyses with this automated ECG system (4 times/year) would significantly improve&#xD;
           the detection of atrial fibrillation compared to a single annual ECG screen.The&#xD;
           secondary objective is to explore whether even more frequent ECG recordings and analyses&#xD;
           (8 times/year) would further improve the detection of atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study design: The present study is designed as a randomized controlled trial of parallel&#xD;
           group (two)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study population: Men and women aged at least 65 years (n=7000) will be recruited from 5&#xD;
           community health centers in the city of Shanghai. Eligible patients should meet the&#xD;
           following inclusion and exclusion criteria.Inclusion Criteria:1) Age≥65 years; 2)&#xD;
           Absence of atrial fibrillation at baseline; 3) Willing and capable to visit the&#xD;
           outpatient clinic on his/her own for long-term follow-up. Exclusion Criteria:1) Known&#xD;
           persistent or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation : Sinus rhythm after pharmacological or&#xD;
           electric cardioversion, or radiofrequency ablation;Use of anticoagulant therapy and&#xD;
           atrial fibrillation;Use of medication for heart rate control;Untreated atrial&#xD;
           fibrillation.2) Serious life-threatening diseases, such as, cancer, severe cardiac,&#xD;
           cerebral, liver, kidney diseases, etc;3) Difficult for long-term follow-up visit for any&#xD;
           reason&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Randomization and treatment: Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into&#xD;
           the usual and intensive screening groups with 3500 patients in each group, and within&#xD;
           the intensive screening group in a 3:1 ratio into the intensive and more intensive&#xD;
           subgroups with 2625 and 875 patients, respectively. 1)Usual screening group: ECG&#xD;
           recordings at baseline plus at 1 and 2 year of follow-up; three ECG recordings in total.&#xD;
           2)Intensive screening subgroup: ECG recordings at baseline plus quarterly during&#xD;
           follow-up, at months 3, 6, 9,12, 15, 18, 21 and 24; 9 ECG recordings in total. 3)More&#xD;
           intensive screening subgroup: ECG recordings at baseline plus weekly during the first&#xD;
           month of follow-up and quarterly afterwards, at weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 and months 3, 6, 9,&#xD;
           12, 15, 18, 21 and 24; 13 ECG recordings in total. The automated electrocardiogram&#xD;
           analysis system AliveCor® Heart Monitor will be used to perform ECG recordings and&#xD;
           analysis for the immediate diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. At one and two year of&#xD;
           follow-up, a follow-up questionnaire will be administered and physical examinations will&#xD;
           be performed. All detected cases of atrial fibrillation will be further evaluated with a&#xD;
           regular 12-lead ECG, and then referred to a specialists' centre for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Follow up: In the usual screening group, patients will be followed-up in the community&#xD;
           health centre at baseline and at 12 and 24 months of follow-up. In the intensive&#xD;
           screening group, patients will be followed-up at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21&#xD;
           and 24 months of follow-up. In the more intensive screening subgroup, patients will be&#xD;
           followed-up weekly in the first month of follow-up and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24&#xD;
           months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Sample size estimation: The detection rate of atrial fibrillation by a single 12-lead&#xD;
           ECG was 2.5% in elderly people living in Shanghai Of the 2.5%, only 0.5% were aware of&#xD;
           atrial fibrillation. The detection rate of atrial fibrillation by an ECG recording at&#xD;
           baseline and another in 12 months could be estimated to be 2.0% in elderly people&#xD;
           without awareness of atrial fibrillation. The primary hypothesis is that the detection&#xD;
           rate could be improved by 50% with more frequent ECG recordings. If =0.05, power=80% and&#xD;
           one-sided test are assumed, and a 1:1 ratio would be used to assign patients to usual&#xD;
           and intensive ECG screening, the study will require a sample size of 3013 subjects per&#xD;
           group. In consideration of a 15% of super-addition, approximately 3500 eligible subjects&#xD;
           per group should be enrolled. The number of required subjects for the whole trial is&#xD;
           7000.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Timeline : Enrollment rate : 1000 patients /month ; Planned publication /presentation :&#xD;
           October 2020; Start of subjects enrollment : December 2016; End of subjects enrollment :&#xD;
           June 2017; End of study : October 2020&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Organization: The study will be conducted in a single research center (Ruijin Hospital)&#xD;
           with 5 community health centers. Patients will be recruited and followed up by the&#xD;
           community health physicians in 5 community health centers, under the supervision of&#xD;
           cardiologists from Ruijin Hospital. ECG will be recorded in each of the community health&#xD;
           centers. Atrial fibrillation will be initially diagnosed by the software build in the&#xD;
           smart phone. ECG will also be transmitted to a cloud platform for storage and further&#xD;
           analysis. If atrial fibrillation is detected, a 12-lead ECG will be immediately&#xD;
           performed for the verification and confirmation of the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
           The identified patients with atrial fibrillation will be referred to the outpatient&#xD;
           clinic of Ruijin Hospital for management.&#xD;
