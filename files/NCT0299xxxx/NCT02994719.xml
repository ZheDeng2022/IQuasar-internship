  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether speed-dependent measures of gait can be&#xD;
      identified in patients with neurological conditions that affect gait, particularly in&#xD;
      subjects with parkinsonian disorders.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine whether the gait patterns in these subjects differ in&#xD;
      predictable and quantifiable ways from those of age- and sex-matched healthy controls. This&#xD;
      will be conducted by asking 40 Parkinsonian disorder subjects and 40 age-matched healthy&#xD;
      control subjects to walk 9 trials over an 18 ft walkway embedded with pressure sensors at&#xD;
      baseline, self-selected slower and faster speeds. In addition, the protocol aims to&#xD;
      investigate whether clusters of gait patterns can be identified within subgroups of&#xD;
      individuals with parkinsonian disorders with varying co-morbidities or treatment conditions&#xD;
      as well as patients with ataxia syndromes. For this aim an additional 20 Parkinsonian&#xD;
      disorder subjects need to be recruited. Patients with parkinsonism as defined by UK PD Brain&#xD;
      Bank Criteria (n=60), subjects with acquired or inherited ataxic syndromes (n=10) and age-&#xD;
      and sex matched controls (n=40) will be recruited. There is an optional second visit in the&#xD;
      protocol during which approximately 20 subjects with Parkinsonian disorders, who are willing&#xD;
      to come off antiparkinson medication and if applicable, off both medication and deep brain&#xD;
      stimulation, are asked to walk an additional 9 trials.&#xD;
