      Indicated for the Treatment of Secondary Lymphedema Associated with the Treatment of Breast&#xD;
      Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of Lymfactin®&#xD;
      in patients with secondary lymphedema associated with the treatment of breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, uncontrolled first in human trial that uses a standard 3&#xD;
      + 3 dose escalation scheme. Lymfactin® will be administered as a single dose by ex vivo&#xD;
      perinodal injection into the fat pad of a flap of tissue containing lymph nodes from the&#xD;
      abdominal wall. This flap of tissue will then be surgically implanted into the axillary&#xD;
      region of the affected arm. This treatment with Lymfactin® may be performed in conjunction&#xD;
      with or without breast reconstruction surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to two dose cohorts are planned to be included. Each dose of Lymfactin® will be&#xD;
      administered as a single dose via perinodal injection in a volume of 2 mL:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Lymfactin® [1 x 10E10 vp]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Lymfactin® [1 x 10E11 vp]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should the dose escalation go up to Cohort 2 with initiation of a subsequent Extension Cohort&#xD;
      a total of 15 - 21 patients may be treated in this study.&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study&#xD;
             drug administration, that would affect the patient's ability to follow study-related&#xD;
             procedures, or that may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             Investigator's opinion, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
