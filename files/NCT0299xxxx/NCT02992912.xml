  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although it is usually described as an immunosuppressive modality and not thought of as&#xD;
      immunotherapy, there are new preclinical evidences suggesting that high-dose ionizing&#xD;
      irradiation (IR) results in direct tumour cell death and augments tumour-specific immunity,&#xD;
      which enhances tumour control both locally and distantly. Importantly, IR effects exceed the&#xD;
      classical cytocidal properties by also causing phenotypic changes in the fraction of&#xD;
      surviving cells, markedly enhancing their susceptibility to T cell-mediated elimination.&#xD;
      However, not all IR-induced modifications of the tumour and its microenvironment favor immune&#xD;
      rejection. The tumour microenvironment is populated by various types of inhibitory immune&#xD;
      cells including Tregs, alternatively activated macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppression&#xD;
      cells (MDSCs), which suppress T cell activation and promote tumour outgrowth. Chiang et al.&#xD;
      showed the accumulation of pro-tumourigenic M2 macrophages in areas of hypoxia present in&#xD;
      irradiated tumours. IR then may also induced responses that are inadequate to maintain&#xD;
      antitumuor immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Close interaction between IR, T cells, and the PD-L1/PD-1 axis exsit and provide a basis for&#xD;
      the rational design of combination therapy with immune modulators and radiotherapy. Deng et&#xD;
      al. demonstrate that PD-L1 was upregulated in the tumour microenvironment after IR. Moreover,&#xD;
      administration of anti-PD-L1 enhanced the efficacy of IR through a cytotoxic T cell-dependent&#xD;
      mechanism. Concomitant with IR-mediated tumour regression, IR and anti-PD-L1 synergistically&#xD;
      reduced the local accumulation of tumour-infiltrating MDSCs, which suppress T cells and alter&#xD;
      the tumour immune microenvironment. Finally, activation of cytotoxic T cells with combination&#xD;
      therapy mediated the reduction of MDSCs in tumours through the cytotoxic actions of TNF.&#xD;
      Sagiv-Barfi et al, also demonstrated in 5 patients receiving atezolizumab and radiation&#xD;
      therapy, at least stabilization of systemic progression in all patients and a RECIST partial&#xD;
      response at systemic sites in 1 patient. Transient, grade 1-2 inflammatory adverse events&#xD;
      (fevers, flu-like symptoms) occurred with no serious immune-related toxicities. Abscopal&#xD;
      out-field effects of irradiation has also been described in addition to a reduction in&#xD;
      circulating MDSCs in a melanoma patient treated with the anti CTLA-4 ipilimumab and&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, recent evidence demonstrates that loco-regional curative treatment with stereotactic&#xD;
      ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a good alternative as compared with conventional 3D RT for&#xD;
      patients with solid tumour, with durable remissions and a low toxicity profile. Many&#xD;
      non-randomised studies have shown that SBRT for oligometastases is safe and effective, with&#xD;
      local control rates of about 80%. Importantly, these studies also suggest that the natural&#xD;
      history of the disease is changing, with 2-5 year progression-free survival of about 20%. For&#xD;
      colorectal, non-small cell, and renal cell cancers, 1-year metastasis control rates ranged&#xD;
      from 67 to 91%. Moreover, abscopal reponses in the setting of immune checkpoints inhibitors&#xD;
      and radiotherapy combinations have been made in the setting of metastatic disease event in&#xD;
      patients with extensive tumor burden. The goal of SABR is to deliver appropriate metastasis&#xD;
      directed radiotherapy while minimizing exposure of surrounding normal tissues. Interestingly,&#xD;
      the dose and fractionation employed modulate RT ability to synergize with immunotherapy.&#xD;
      Vanpouille-Box et al, showed that immune response genes were differentially expressed in&#xD;
      irradiated tumours by 8Gyx3 but not 20Gyx1. This highlight the interest of hypofractionated&#xD;
      SABR acting as a &quot;in situ tumour vaccine&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As hypofractionated SABR may, in addition to its good local control, increase the&#xD;
      effectiveness of anti PD-L1, investigators aimed to investigate the efficacy and the&#xD;
      tolerability of the combination of anti-PD-L1 antibody with SABR.&#xD;
