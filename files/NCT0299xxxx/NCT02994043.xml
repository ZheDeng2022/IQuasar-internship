      The goal of the AIM Study is to examine the effectiveness of Mindfulness Based Relapse&#xD;
      Prevention (MBRP) versus Relapse Prevention (RP) for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorders&#xD;
      (AUD) by implementing an 8-week long intervention and examining neurobiological,&#xD;
      immunological, and epigenetic characteristics of AUD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the effect of two outpatient, individually-administered,&#xD;
      psychosocial interventions (Relapse Prevention vs. Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention).&#xD;
      Participants are recruited via mass media advertisements, flyers, and local outreach to&#xD;
      clinical providers that do not address substance use. We will recruit 226 individuals. Our&#xD;
      previous experience with clinical trials, as well as the experience of our research team&#xD;
      members with these interventions support the feasibility of recruiting approximately 50&#xD;
      patients per year. This sample size provides adequate statistical power for the research&#xD;
      questions undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are screened over the telephone and invited into the laboratory for a baseline&#xD;
      assessment. Immediately after the baseline assessment, they are randomized to a therapist and&#xD;
      then to a treatment condition. At the end of each year, the distribution of participants&#xD;
      across conditions and therapists are evaluated for imbalances. If attrition has resulted in&#xD;
      an imbalance across conditions, the randomization procedure will be adjusted to ensure equal&#xD;
      numbers of participants in RP and MBRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within a week of completing the baseline assessments, participants are seen by their&#xD;
      individual therapist for a motivational interviewing, goal-setting session. After the&#xD;
      goal-setting session, the eight-session MBRP or RP treatments are administered. To ensure&#xD;
      that therapists adhere to treatment manuals, a checklist is provided consisting of the&#xD;
      primary content addressed each session (four to seven primary content pieces each session).&#xD;
      Further, questionnaires assessing mindfulness practice and facets of mindfulness (e.g., being&#xD;
      nonjudgmental, nonreactive) are administered at each assessment. At the most recent RPPR,&#xD;
      these questionnaires validated that participants in the MBRP condition were increasing in&#xD;
      some facets of mindfulness during treatment (and up to three months after treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We estimate that the completion of assessments and procedures across the duration of the&#xD;
      trial, excluding therapy sessions, will total about 15 hours of time. To compensate subjects&#xD;
      for their time and travel costs, each subject will be paid $300 if they complete all&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct extensive analyses of any attrition encountered in the project to determine&#xD;
      bias. However, note that in each of the analyses described herein, we will have the&#xD;
      capability of using modern approaches to the handling of missing data including full&#xD;
      information maximum likelihood estimation of missing data within Proc Mixed in SAS and within&#xD;
      EQS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distributional properties of all continuously scaled variables will be examined for&#xD;
      skewness and kurtosis to determine the need for normalizing transformations or for&#xD;
      alternations to our analysis plan (i.e., generalized estimating equations or robust&#xD;
      estimation) prior to the primary analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To confirm the validity of random assignment, pretest equivalence of the two treatment&#xD;
      conditions across demographics, drinking history, smoking, and all other baseline measures&#xD;
      will be assessed via t-tests on continuous items and c2 tests of categorical items. We will&#xD;
      use the Bonferroni approach to correct for alpha inflation with a familywise alpha of .05.&#xD;
      Any variables on which the two groups are unequal at pretest will be covariates in all&#xD;
      further analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attrition analyses will be conducted after each follow-up data collection effort to provide&#xD;
      assurance that differential attrition by treatment condition has not occurred. Following&#xD;
      previously published procedures, a series of ANOVAs of treatment (MBRP versus RP) X retention&#xD;
      (retained, not retained) will be conducted on continuous baseline measures. Significant&#xD;
      treatment X retention interactions identify measured variables on which differential&#xD;
      attrition may have occurred. The logit model analog procedure will be applied to categorical&#xD;
      baseline measures to test for differential attrition on categorical variables such as gender&#xD;
      and ethnicity. We will conduct these analyses to assure that differential attrition by&#xD;
      treatment condition does not account for any of the effects of the treatments.&#xD;
