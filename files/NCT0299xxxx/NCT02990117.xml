  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of inhaled medication as the primary treatment for asthma has led to&#xD;
      substantial improvements in asthma control [1, 2]. However, uncontrolled asthma is still&#xD;
      common and represents a considerable burden to patients and society [3, 4]. An important&#xD;
      reason for poor asthma control and consequently, increased healthcare expenditure is&#xD;
      suboptimal adherence to the prescribed regimen [5-7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real-world market research study in hospitals across China reported that physicians perceived&#xD;
      that only 23% of patients were fully compliant with their medication regime (77%&#xD;
      non-adherent), compared to 55% in the European Union and 63% in the US [AZ internal&#xD;
      document]. The physician reported rate of full adherence was lower than the patient-reported&#xD;
      rate (38%). Poor patient adherence was the challenge most frequently mentioned (by 41% of&#xD;
      physicians) when treating an asthma.[8]&#xD;
&#xD;
      However&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some evidence on the drivers of patient behaviour around low adherence but more&#xD;
      depth research is needed&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is little evidence on variation of determinants of asthma inhaled treatment across&#xD;
      different age of group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research aims to address above data gap Mean while this research can guide the&#xD;
      development of new module on Red Scarf patient education program.&#xD;

      Study site(s) and number of subjects planned 8 level-3 hospitals across West China will&#xD;
      participate in this study. 40 not well controlled asthma patients will participate the&#xD;
      structured interview in stage1 and a total number of 300 patients are expected to participate&#xD;
      cross sectional survey in stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period Estimated Time CSP approved Oct. 2016 First subject in Jan. 2017 Last subject in&#xD;
      Aug. 2017 Database lock Dec. 2017 CSR Mar. 2017&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design It is study including 2 stage, stage 1 of structured patient interview by&#xD;
      investigators, Stage 2 of a multi-center, cross-sectional survey. 40 eligible asthma patients&#xD;
      and/or their family supporter will be invited to participate in a one-time face to face&#xD;
      structured interview in stage 1. Around 350 eligible asthma patients will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in cross sectional survey which all Information and relevant data of their&#xD;
      compliance to inhaled treatment therapy and response to measurement of compliance risk&#xD;
      factors (determinants explored from stage 1) will be collected according to CRF, and inputted&#xD;
      into an on-line electronic questionnaire data capture (EDC) system by site investigator(s),&#xD;
      and valid data will be taken into statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target subject population Stage 1: Asthmatic patients with in adequate asthma control&#xD;
      (defined by GINA partly or un-control due to inhaled treatment compliance (physician&#xD;
      judgement) Stage 2: Asthmatic patient who visit the outpatient clinic will be interviewed by&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: Outcome Measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non- Assumptive Deep Dive Qualitative Scoping to investigate determinants of poor adherence&#xD;
      to ICS treatment through structured interview &amp; taskforce workshop Decide key measures for&#xD;
      phase2 survey through steering committee group review. Categorized &quot;risk factors&quot; (patient&#xD;
      behavior/belief, social status, medical care availability etc.) which very likely led to poor&#xD;
      patient adherence on inhaled treatment adherence in partly or uncontrolled asthma patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Therapy related factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient related factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Provider related factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Disease related factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Practice and system related factors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire with measures for asthma patient adherence determinants in survey on stage 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: Outcome Measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the relationship different risk factors (determinants explored from stage 1)&#xD;
      and treatment adherence to further identify top 5 determinants most closely relative to&#xD;
      inhalation treatment adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decide key measures for phase2 survey through steering committee group review. Asthma patient&#xD;
      compliance level on Inhaled treatment (ICS or ICS/LABA) by using validated MARS-A scale&#xD;
      questionnaire below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors (determinants explored from stage 1) measurements response from asthma patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: Outcome Measure :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar objectives on deferent life-stage group of asthma patients. Similar analysis by&#xD;
      different life-stage group of patients (18- 30, 31-45,45-60, 60+)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All results will be described. In general, the descriptive statistics (number, mean, and&#xD;
           median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum) will be presented for continuous&#xD;
           variables. The frequency and percentage of subjects at each level or category will be&#xD;
           presented for categorical variables. Where appropriate, 95% confidence intervals will be&#xD;
           constructed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Risk factor analysis will be performed using univariate and multivariate regression&#xD;
           model to explore the relationship between risk factors and the compliance level. In&#xD;
           addition to multivariate analysis using all variables, a step-wise variable selection&#xD;
           can be used. The level of both variable inclusion and exclusion will be set as 0.15. The&#xD;
           important variable (s) can be forced in the model if applicable.&#xD;
