  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a complex biologic syndrome of diminished physiologic reserve that leads to&#xD;
      decreased resistance to stressors and is associated with adverse health outcomes. The&#xD;
      syndrome has been well studied in adults and is quantified by the Fried criteria, which are&#xD;
      comprised of five components- slowness, weakness, self-reported exhaustion, shrinkage and&#xD;
      diminished physical activity. The concept of frailty is novel in children. A study in young&#xD;
      adult childhood cancer survivors demonstrated increased incidence of frailty in this&#xD;
      population along with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. This suggests that frailty&#xD;
      as a phenotype has relevance outside of the geriatric age group. Pediatric patients with&#xD;
      single ventricle physiology, heart failure and pulmonary artery hypertension- all represent&#xD;
      populations with significantly increased risk of mortality, morbidity and decreased quality&#xD;
      of life. Currently, such patients are monitored outpatient by serial echocardiograms and&#xD;
      blood work that only gives information about end organ damage. But there is no validated tool&#xD;
      available to measure global infirmity in such children. Better understanding of the relevance&#xD;
      and applicability of frailty in pediatrics may allow for identification of the most&#xD;
      vulnerable pediatric cardiac patients and be of value in optimizing their clinical management&#xD;
      and improving health outcomes.&#xD;

&#xD;
        SUBJECT/CASE POPULATION herein referred to as Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children and adolescents between the ages of 8.0-17.50 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be diagnosed with one of the following heart conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with single ventricle physiology and Fontan surgery completion at least&#xD;
                  6 months prior to study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with diagnosis of heart failure by a cardiologist&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with a diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension, confirmed by&#xD;
                  cardiac catheterization, requiring use of at least 1 pulmonary vasodilator or&#xD;
                  oxygen for their pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        CONTROL POPULATION herein referred to as Controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy children and adolescents between the ages of 8.0-17.50 years&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects or controls with known severe neurological or respiratory diseases, eating&#xD;
             disorders (such as anorexia, bulimia) or physical limitations (wheelchair bound) which&#xD;
             may impact their ability to perform study procedures in the opinion of the provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects or controls with tracheostomy and ventilator dependency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects or controls with unstable angina/ myocardial infarction in the last 4 weeks&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with heart transplantation within the past 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        CONTROL POPULATION:&#xD;
