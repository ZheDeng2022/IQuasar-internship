      Men with progressive metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer post first-line&#xD;
      treatment with either androgen deprivation therapy alone or androgen deprivation therapy plus&#xD;
      docetaxel who have an identified related female donor (mother sister, daughter, second degree&#xD;
      relative such as granddaughter or niece) will undergo bone marrow transplantation followed by&#xD;
      post-transplant Cytoxan (PT/Cy) and testosterone.&#xD;

      Men will undergo pre-transplant screening evaluation and be enrolled in the study. Subjects&#xD;
      will be treated with a standard non-myeloablative conditioning regimen consisting of&#xD;
      Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV Days -6 to -2; Cy 14.5 mg/kg IV Days -6 and -5; Total body&#xD;
      irradiation (TBI) 200 cGy Day -1. On Day 0, patients will be infused with non-T-cell depleted&#xD;
      bone marrow from a related female donor. Patients will receive GVHD prophylaxis consisting&#xD;
      of: Cy 50mg/kg IV on Days +3 and +4; tacrolimus (IV or PO) beginning on Day +5 [dose adjusted&#xD;
      to maintain trough level of 5-15 ng/mL] through day+180; Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 15 mg/kg&#xD;
      PO TID, with a maximum dose of 1g TID beginning on Day +5 through Day +35. Patients will&#xD;
      receive filgrastim (G-CSF) 5 mcg/kg/day beginning on Day +5 and continued until ANC ≥&#xD;
      1500/mm3. Lastly, to produce maintenance tumor antigen stimulation, patients will be&#xD;
      maintained on continuous LHRH agonist/antagonist therapy (if not previously surgically&#xD;
      castrated) to suppress endogenous testosterone production throughout the treatment period;&#xD;
      testosterone cypionate 400 mg IM will be administered on Day +60, +90, and +120 (every 30&#xD;
      days x 3 doses). Patients who achieve biochemical CR will stop LHRH agonist/antagonist&#xD;
      treatment at day 180. Patients will be followed for 3 years post-BMT.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with any amount of donor chimerism around day 60 will be considered as having engrafted. Chimerism determinations will be made on peripheral blood by a number of different methods depending on the specific patient. Methods may include (i) the usual standard of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) if the donor and recipient RFLPs are informative, (ii) fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) for Y-chromosome markers on PBMC if the donor is male, (iii) cytogenetic analysis, (iv) flow cytometric analysis of HLA-A, B or DR on lymphocytes in the peripheral blood if haploidentical and suitable reagents exist or (v) PCR analysis of variable nucleotide tandem repeats (VNTR) in PBMC if informative. Mixed donor chimerism will be defined as &gt;0%, but &lt;95%. Complete donor chimerism will be defined as &gt;95%. Patients who have relapsed or died prior to day 60 will not be evaluable for full donor chimerism, as these are competing risk factors.</description>
