    <textblock>
      This study seeks to explore the efficacy of immersive multimedia experiences as a practical&#xD;
      adjunctive therapeutic intervention in the self-management of the chronic pain associated&#xD;
      with cancer patients. A comparative controlled interventional trial and qualitative&#xD;
      interpretative-descriptive exploration will be undertaken with 100 cancer patients who are&#xD;
      experiencing chronic pain. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a virtual reality&#xD;
      (VR) therapy group or a 2D computer based multimedia control group (50 subjects in each).&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will undertake either a series of VR interventions, or 2D computer based multimedia&#xD;
      control sessions in their own homes over a period of a month. The intervention will be used&#xD;
      daily for a month to enable customization to the therapy and record data over a long enough&#xD;
      period of time to account for any individual short-term changes in pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VR sessions will consist of using a VR head mounted display (HMD) and computer to explore&#xD;
      interactive immersive environments. The control group will be exposed to similar 2D computer&#xD;
      based multimedia experiences (without a VR headset) that on home computers. Pre, during, and&#xD;
      post pain test scores and quality of sleep assessments will be recorded using standardized&#xD;
      tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, ten of the subjects who demonstrated the most improvement in their&#xD;
      pain using the VR experience will be selected and invited to explore for any measurable&#xD;
      changes in neurological activity using pre and post exposure magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

      This study seeks to explore the efficacy of an immersive multimedia experience as a practical&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention in the self-management of the chronic pain associated with cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work will inform further clinical studies and future research into the potential uses of&#xD;
      immersive multimedia in the treatment of cancer associated pain. Furthermore, it will help&#xD;
      identify optimal immersive multimedia environments for use in chronic pain applications,&#xD;
      practical determinants for implementation of immersive multimedia for wider practice, and&#xD;
      will provide a better theoretical understanding of the mechanisms whereby immersive&#xD;
      multimedia works in chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer survivorship refers to individuals who have remained cancer free for a minimum of 5&#xD;
      years. Due to developments and greater outcomes associated with cancer therapy and&#xD;
      management, the number of individuals who survive cancer has risen considerably over the past&#xD;
      decade. Currently, 65% of adults and 80% of children can be expected to live at least 5 years&#xD;
      post cancer diagnosis. However, for some, survivorship is associated with debilitating&#xD;
      chronic pain which impacts negatively on quality of life. Reviews have suggested that up to&#xD;
      40% of individuals have survived cancer remain with cancer related chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With rapidly emerging immersive multimedia technologies and clinical work in this field, it&#xD;
      would appear that immersive multimedia may have significant potential for use as an&#xD;
      adjunctive therapeutic measure for pain control. However, there has been little work done to&#xD;
      establish the potential use of immersive multimedia in the management of chronic cancer pain&#xD;
      to date, as most work on immersive multimedia for pain management has focused on acute pain&#xD;
      via distraction. Several researchers have recommended the investigation of immersive&#xD;
      multimedia for chronic, long term pain, and the research team completed a pilot study in 2015&#xD;
      to establish best methods and approaches for using immersive multimedia in chronic pain&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if immersive multimedia therapy is effective as an adjunctive intervention in&#xD;
      the management of chronic pain in cancer patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can exposure to a immersive multimedia environment as an adjunctive pain-relieving&#xD;
           measure provide a pain-reducing experience for for chronic cancer pain patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How long (if at all) do any therapeutic effects of immersive multimedia last after&#xD;
           exposure in chronic cancer pain patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Are there any significant side effects of immersive multimedia exposure for chronic&#xD;
           cancer pain patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Do any identifiable neurological changes occur on fMRI pre and post immersive multimedia&#xD;
           exposure?&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH METHODS A longitudinal mixed-methods study to evaluate the impact of immersive&#xD;
      multimedia for chronic pain in cancer patients is proposed which will consist of a&#xD;
      comparative controlled interventional trial and qualitative interpretative-descriptive&#xD;
      exploration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Interventional Trial (Quantitative):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be randomly assigned to either a VR therapy group or the control group&#xD;
           (50 subjects in each). They will undertake either a series of immersive VR&#xD;
           interventions, or control sessions (using 2D multimedia on personal computers) in their&#xD;
           own homes over a period of a month.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To ensure the multi-dimensional aspects of chronic pain experienced by individuals are&#xD;
           measured adequately, pain assessment tools have been selected that will address&#xD;
           different aspects of each participant's' chronic pain and functional capacity. To&#xD;
           measure the impact of VR on each participant's pain intensity, the Visual Analog Scale&#xD;
           will be used during the VR and control experiences, pre and post exposure and at 10&#xD;
           minute intervals. In order to measure the change in pain during the therapy experience,&#xD;
           and overall sleep quality, at the end of each week, participants will also be asked to&#xD;
           complete post-intervention questionnaires: Health Survey (Short-Form 12), McGill Pain&#xD;
           Questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and also a brief Virtual Reality&#xD;
           Immersion Tool (to assess how immersive they found the experience that week).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Interpretive Description Study (qualitative):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Qualitative Interpretative- Descriptive exploration will be undertaken alongside the trial&#xD;
      to allow for a more open exploration of participants experiences and to further understanding&#xD;
      of the perceptions associated with the use of immersive multimedia and any impact upon their&#xD;
      chronic pain. An interpretative description (ID) approach will be used for this aspect of the&#xD;
      study. This methodology allows for an inductive descriptive analysis of the phenomena, and&#xD;
      was chosen as it is ideal for small scale studies, allowing for generation of themes,&#xD;
      patterns and theory associated with the patient's experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the completion of the clinical trial all participants will be sent an exploratory&#xD;
      questionnaire to discover their perceptions of immersive multimedia and its value (if any) in&#xD;
      the control of their chronic pain. In this questionnaire they will also be invited to&#xD;
      participate in one of two focus group interviews. Data from this will be analyzed and used to&#xD;
      support purposeful sampling of individuals to take part in the following focus-group&#xD;
      interviews, to include those subjects with a range of diverse opinions and ideas. As themes&#xD;
      and categories emerge from the data the researchers will seek to adapt the focus-group&#xD;
      interview sample with the purpose of strengthening the emerging theory and patterns by&#xD;
      including individuals who will help further define the characteristics of these themes and&#xD;
      categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative Data: Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis will be performed on the&#xD;
      pain scores. For face-value quantitative indicators of potential effects univariate&#xD;
      descriptive statistics will be employed. Data will be analyzed for central tendency,&#xD;
      dispersion (standard deviation, interquartile range), skewness and kurtosis using SPSS&#xD;
      statistical analysis software to establish distribution and variance. Likewise, quantitative&#xD;
      data from the questionnaires will be analysed in this fashion. Data will be explored for&#xD;
      differences in the pain scales for the VR group and the control group at each time point to&#xD;
      analyze for any indications of changes immediately following the experience using Linear&#xD;
      Mixed Effects Modelling using SPSS software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Data: The focus-group interviews will be audiotaped. The questionnaire open text&#xD;
      results and transcriptions of focus groups will be recorded into NVivo 11.0 qualitative data&#xD;
      analysis software and read, re-read and coded for thematic elements by the PIs.&#xD;
