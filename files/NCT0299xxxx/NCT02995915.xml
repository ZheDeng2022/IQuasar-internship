  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol misuse and smoking constitute two of the three leading preventable causes of death in&#xD;
      the United States. Reluctance to treat tobacco dependence among those with AUD is misguided&#xD;
      as recent research suggests smoking cessation treatment can be effective, does not increase&#xD;
      risk of relapse to alcohol, and may even improve rates of sobriety. There is strong evidence&#xD;
      for the short-term efficacy for alcohol misuse and smoking of contingency management (CM). It&#xD;
      is an intensive behavioral therapy that provides incentives (vouchers, money) to individuals&#xD;
      misusing substances contingent upon objective evidence from drug use. Implementation of CM&#xD;
      has been limited because of the need to verify abstinence multiple times daily using clinic&#xD;
      based monitoring. The investigators recently developed a smart-phone application which allows&#xD;
      a patient to video themselves several times daily while using a small CO monitor and to&#xD;
      transmit the data to a secure server which has made the use of CM for outpatient smoking&#xD;
      cessation portable and feasible. This mobile CM (mCM) approach paired with&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral counseling and pharmacological smoking cessation aids has been effective&#xD;
      in reducing smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the purpose of this project is to develop a combined alcohol and smoking mCM&#xD;
      intervention. The intervention will be developed in two successive cohorts of five&#xD;
      participants, who will provide information on treatment acceptability and feasibility. A&#xD;
      third cohort of participants (n=45) will participate in a randomized clinical trials to&#xD;
      further examine feasibility and efficacy. The long term goal is to develop mCM procedures&#xD;
      that will be used as part of a multi-component intervention to concurrently and effectively&#xD;
      treat both alcohol misuse and smoking. As part of this project, the investigators will&#xD;
      develop a multi-component telehealth alcohol and smoking mCM intervention. It will include&#xD;
      mCM, cognitive-behavioral phone counseling, and standard smoking cessation pharmacotherapy.&#xD;
      The work proposed in these aims will provide the first step toward implementation of an&#xD;
      innovative approach that builds upon the power of mHealth technology to reduce the prevalence&#xD;
      of both alcohol misuse and smoking.&#xD;

          <title>Tele-health Mobile Contingency Management Intervention</title>
          <description>This arm includes a tele-health intervention that combines evidence-based telephone cognitive behavioral treatment for alcohol and smoking cessation, smoking cessation pharmacotherapy (including nicotine replacement therapy and bupropion), and mobile contingency management treatment administered via a smart-phone based application (mobile CM).&#xD;
Nicotine Replacement Therapy: Participants will be prescribed NRT patch and one nicotine rescue method (e.g., nicotine gum, lozenge, inhaler) for use during the post-quit phase of the study. Participants will be given the choice between nicotine gum or lozenge, and will be instructed to use the rescue method as needed to reduce cigarette cravings&#xD;
Bupropion: All medically eligible participants will be prescribed bupropion, which they will start two weeks prior to their quit day. Dosage will be 150 mg/daily for days 1-7 and 300 mg/daily (administered in two daily doses) until the 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
Cognitive Behavioral Treatment: Participants will receive 4 60-minute sessions of CBT telephone counseling for alcohol and smoking cessation.&#xD;
Mobile Contingency Management: Participants will be asked to provide video recordings of themselves taking carbon monoxide readings in order to confirm smoking abstinence, and breathalyzer to confirm abstinence from alcohol. Participants are provided monetary reward for videos that suggest smoking abstinence and alcohol abstinence.</description>

Nicotine Replacement Therapy: Participants will be prescribed NRT patch and one nicotine rescue method (e.g., nicotine gum, lozenge, inhaler) for use during the post-quit phase of the study. Participants will be given the choice between nicotine gum or lozenge, and will be instructed to use the rescue method as needed to reduce cigarette cravings&#xD;
Bupropion: All medically eligible participants will be prescribed bupropion, which they will start two weeks prior to their quit day. Dosage will be 150 mg/daily for days 1-7 and 300 mg/daily (administered in two daily doses) until the 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
Cognitive Behavioral Treatment: Participants will receive 4 60-minute sessions of CBT telephone counseling for alcohol and smoking cessation.&#xD;
Mobile Contingency Management: Participants will be asked to provide video recordings of themselves taking carbon monoxide readings in order to confirm smoking abstinence, and breathalyzer to confirm abstinence from alcohol. Participants are provided monetary reward for videos that suggest smoking abstinence and alcohol abstinence.</description>

Nicotine Replacement Therapy: Participants will be prescribed NRT patch and one nicotine rescue method (e.g., nicotine gum, lozenge, inhaler) for use during the post-quit phase of the study. Participants will be given the choice between nicotine gum or lozenge, and will be instructed to use the rescue method as needed to reduce cigarette cravings&#xD;
Bupropion: All medically eligible participants will be prescribed bupropion, which they will start two weeks prior to their quit day. Dosage will be 150 mg/daily for days 1-7 and 300 mg/daily (administered in two daily doses) until the 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
Cognitive Behavioral Treatment: Participants will receive 4 60-minute sessions of CBT telephone counseling for alcohol and smoking cessation.&#xD;
Mobile Contingency Management: Participants will be asked to provide video recordings of themselves taking carbon monoxide readings in order to confirm smoking abstinence, and breathalyzer to confirm abstinence from alcohol. Participants are provided monetary reward for videos that suggest smoking abstinence and alcohol abstinence.</description>

Nicotine Replacement Therapy: Participants will be prescribed NRT patch and one nicotine rescue method (e.g., nicotine gum, lozenge, inhaler) for use during the post-quit phase of the study. Participants will be given the choice between nicotine gum or lozenge, and will be instructed to use the rescue method as needed to reduce cigarette cravings&#xD;
Bupropion: All medically eligible participants will be prescribed bupropion, which they will start two weeks prior to their quit day. Dosage will be 150 mg/daily for days 1-7 and 300 mg/daily (administered in two daily doses) until the 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
Cognitive Behavioral Treatment: Participants will receive 4 60-minute sessions of CBT telephone counseling for alcohol and smoking cessation.&#xD;
Mobile Contingency Management: Participants will be asked to provide video recordings of themselves taking carbon monoxide readings in order to confirm smoking abstinence, and breathalyzer to confirm abstinence from alcohol. Participants are provided monetary reward for videos that suggest smoking abstinence and alcohol abstinence.</description>

            <description>This arm includes a tele-health intervention that combines evidence-based telephone cognitive behavioral treatment for alcohol and smoking cessation, smoking cessation pharmacotherapy (including nicotine replacement therapy and bupropion), and mobile contingency management treatment administered via a smart-phone based application (mobile CM).&#xD;
Nicotine Replacement Therapy: Participants will be prescribed NRT patch and one nicotine rescue method (e.g., nicotine gum, lozenge, inhaler) for use during the post-quit phase of the study. Participants will be given the choice between nicotine gum or lozenge, and will be instructed to use the rescue method as needed to reduce cigarette cravings&#xD;
Bupropion: All medically eligible participants will be prescribed bupropion, which they will start two weeks prior to their quit day. Dosage will be 150 mg/daily for days 1-7 and 300 mg/daily (administered in two daily doses) until the 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
Cognitive Behavioral Treatment: Participants will receive 4 60-minute sessions of CBT telephone counseling for alcohol and smoking cessation.&#xD;
Mobile Contingency Management: Participants will be asked to provide video recordings of themselves taking carbon monoxide readings in order to confirm smoking abstinence, and breathalyzer to confirm abstinence from alcohol. Participants are provided monetary reward for videos that suggest smoking abstinence and alcohol abstinence.</description>
