  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is exploring chemotherapy in combination with immunotherapy (a therapy&#xD;
      that uses the body's own immune system to control cancer) as a possible treatment for hormone&#xD;
      receptor positive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab (MK-3475; Keytruda™)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nab-Paclitaxel (Abraxane&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining&#xD;
      this study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking at how the participants body and tumor&#xD;
      respond to the combination of Nab-paclitaxel and Pembrolizumab. Also, the investigators will&#xD;
      be examining the participants tumor tissue to learn more about the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Pembrolizumab for this&#xD;
      specific disease; but it has been approved in the United States for the treatment of other&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved Nab-paclitaxel as a treatment option for this type of breast cancer;&#xD;
      but it has been approved in the United States for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      (breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is a medicine that may treat cancer by working with the participant's immune&#xD;
      system. The immune system is the body's natural defense against disease. The immune system&#xD;
      sends types of cells called &quot;T cells&quot; throughout the body to detect and fight infections and&#xD;
      diseases, including cancer. For some types of cancer, the T cells do not work as they should&#xD;
      and are prevented from attacking the tumors. Pembrolizumab is thought to work by blocking a&#xD;
      protein in the T cells called PD-1 (&quot;programmed death 1&quot;), which then allows these cells and&#xD;
      other parts of the immune system to attack tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) is part of a class of medications called antimicrotubule agents. It&#xD;
      works by stopping the growth and spread of cancer cells by blocking the action of proteins&#xD;
      called microtubules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of Pembrolizumab and Nab-paclitaxel is investigational. &quot;Investigational&quot;&#xD;
      means that the combination of study drugs is being studied. The study drugs, when given&#xD;
      separately, work in different ways to stop the cancer cells from growing and spreading.&#xD;
      However, it is not known if giving the two study drugs at the same time will have a better&#xD;
      anti-cancer effect than giving each treatment on its own.&#xD;

             are not required to undergo a repeat biopsy in order to continue on protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
             reason, both women and men of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (Section 5.5.2) starting with the first dose of study therapy and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, through 120 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception&#xD;
        for the subject. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her&#xD;
        partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
        immediately. While on the study, women may not breast-feed. Women of childbearing potential&#xD;
        are defined as those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from&#xD;
        menses for &gt; 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
             If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants on bisphosphonates may continue receiving bisphosphonate therapy during&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has received prior pembrolizumab or any other anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1,&#xD;
             or anti-PD-L2 therapy, or has participated in any prior studies involving&#xD;
             pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has any history or evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis or&#xD;
             interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited&#xD;
             to, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV; see&#xD;
             Appendix B), active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within the previous&#xD;
             six months, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, chronic liver or renal disease, or severe&#xD;
             malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (see Appendix C), such as ketoconazole and&#xD;
             erythromycin, should be avoided during the study treatment with nab-paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because pembrolizumab has the potential&#xD;
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential&#xD;
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             pembrolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at week 1 day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of a second malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible&#xD;
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator&#xD;
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following&#xD;
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer&#xD;
             in situ, and non-melanoma cancer of the skin. Participants with other cancers&#xD;
             diagnosed within the past 5 years and felt to be at low risk of recurrence should be&#xD;
             discussed with the study sponsor to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             or any other form of immunosuppressive medication including disease modifying agents,&#xD;
             or has required such therapy in the last 2 years. Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine,&#xD;
             insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary&#xD;
             insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune&#xD;
             disease or syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant is known to be positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen, or Hepatitis&#xD;
             C RNA. Testing for screening is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive participants.HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
             pembrolizumab. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal&#xD;
             infections with bone marrow suppressive therapy, i.e. nab-paclitaxel. Appropriate&#xD;
             studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy when indicated. Testing for screening is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has received a live vaccine within 28 days of planned start of study&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seasonal influenza vaccines for infection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (i.e. Flu-Mist ®) are live&#xD;
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
