  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of Making Healthy Decisions is to design and rigorously evaluate a new sexual&#xD;
      health education program, &quot;Your Move&quot; (YM) against a nutrition control program, &quot;Eat Smart&quot;&#xD;
      (ES). YM is intended to improve teen females' (ages 14-19) ability to make healthy sexual&#xD;
      decisions with the ultimate goal of reducing unplanned pregnancies and STIs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Making Healthy Decisions includes two technology-based interventions designed to improve teen&#xD;
      females' healthy decision making in relation to sexual relationships (YM) and nutrition (ES).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health educators from Planned Parenthood are trained to implement both YM and ES at&#xD;
      youth-serving community organizations in their geographic area across several U.S. states. In&#xD;
      a multi-site randomized controlled trial, females ages 14-19 are recruited from their local&#xD;
      community-based organization (CBO) into groups/cohorts of 8-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cohort is randomly assigned to participate in one of the two interventions prior to&#xD;
      baseline data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants attend seven 75-minute program sessions that include facilitator-led games,&#xD;
      activities, and discussions as well as personal reflection time in which girls practiced&#xD;
      healthy decision making individually on an electronic tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-reported survey data related to attitudes, knowledge, and behavior around sex and&#xD;
      nutrition are collected at baseline as well as 3 months after the intervention ends.&#xD;
