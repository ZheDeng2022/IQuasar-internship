      Recently, the investigators have demonstrated a novel hyperpolarized helium tagging Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Image (MRI) technique that is capable of directly, in vivo, and non-invasively&#xD;
      measuring physiological lung deformation on a regional basis. This unique imaging technique&#xD;
      holds great promise for assessing, validating, and improving the use of Deformable image&#xD;
      Registration (DIR) algorithms in the lung. Our long term aim is to apply hyperpolarized gas&#xD;
      tagging MRI to study lung biomechanics, develop more physiologically sound DIR algorithms for&#xD;
      the lungs, and eventually improve radiotherapy of lung cancer. The overall aim of this&#xD;
      application is to optimize the hyperpolarized helium tagging MRI technology and establish its&#xD;
      usefulness for DIR assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our first objective is to develop and optimize a methodology based on 3 Dimensional (3D)&#xD;
      hyperpolarized helium tagging MRI of healthy subjects, for directly measuring lung&#xD;
      deformation between inhalation and exhalation. Our second objective is to develop&#xD;
      physiologically sound digital thorax phantoms based on helium-3 tagging MRI of healthy&#xD;
      subjects and demonstrate their use for DIR assessment in the lung. These phantoms will be&#xD;
      used to evaluate a range different DIR algorithms, by comparing the errors between the&#xD;
      DIR-derived deformation vector fields and the ground truth represented in the digital&#xD;
      phantom. Successful completion of these aims will yield a novel methodology for DIR&#xD;
      assessment in the lung for radiotherapy.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to develop new ways to make medical images of the lungs and&#xD;
      liver of adults using a technique called four-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (4D-MRI). This technique produces three-dimensional movies of the inside of the chest and&#xD;
      abdomen while the patient is breathing. (The fourth dimension is time!)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new way of medical imaging is being developed to help cancer patients undergoing&#xD;
      radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is used to treat cancerous tumors. For radiation therapy&#xD;
      to be effective, the precise size, shape, and location of the tumor within the body must be&#xD;
      known. A particular difficulty for radiation treatment of lung and liver cancer is that the&#xD;
      tumor moves during treatment because the patient is breathing. Therefore, tumor motion must&#xD;
      also be incorporated into the treatment plan. This study aims to improve radiation treatment&#xD;
      planning through better targeting and dose estimation based on 4D-MRI. Before this new&#xD;
      imaging method can be used for radiation treatment planning, it must be tested in living,&#xD;
      breathing volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You are being asked to take part in a research study because you are a cancer patient or a&#xD;
      healthy volunteer. You do not have to take part in this study. You should only agree to take&#xD;
      part in this study after reading this consent form and discussing it with the study team. You&#xD;
      may also discuss this with your family, friends, health care providers or others before you&#xD;
      make a decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though you may not be directly helped by being in this study, the information gained by doing&#xD;
      this study may help others in the future. You might not want to take part in this study&#xD;
      because of the temporary risk of discomfort during the time the subject is asked to lie still&#xD;
      in the confined space of the MRI scanner. This discomfort may include claustrophobia (fear of&#xD;
      being in a small space), feelings of warmth, muscle twitching due to excited nerves, and&#xD;
      exposure to loud thumping noises produced by the MR scanner. If you are pregnant or think you&#xD;
      may be pregnant, if would not be safe for you to be in this study.&#xD;
