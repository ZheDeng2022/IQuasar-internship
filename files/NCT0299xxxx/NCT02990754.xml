  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Fearless Physical Activity&quot; are fun, physical literacy events where people with congenital&#xD;
      heart disease (CHD) and sport/recreation leaders can do community-based sport/recreation&#xD;
      opportunities &quot;without fear&quot; (i.e., appropriate for their health). Ontarians with CHD are a&#xD;
      large and rapidly growing population;1% of children are born with CHD, adding 1,440 new&#xD;
      children/year to the 113,900 Ontarians of all ages who are living with CHD. 'Fearless' will&#xD;
      target CHD children, youth or adults, while encouraging family-based participation. During&#xD;
      each season, the investigators will offer a one-day event for each age group (children,&#xD;
      youth, adults) in each region of Ontario (4 seasons x 3 age groups x 4 regions = 48 events).&#xD;
      Event activities will be hosted by community partners, such as the MLSE Launch Pad (Toronto)&#xD;
      or the YMCA/YWCA of the National Capital Region (Ottawa), so that they are sustainable beyond&#xD;
      this project. Activities will be chosen based on opportunities available in local communities&#xD;
      at little to no cost (e.g., use of local trails and parks). Event leaders and participants&#xD;
      will be educated about physical literacy and screening tasks will be used to identify those&#xD;
      needing significant or specialized physical literacy support. People with CHD lead mostly&#xD;
      sedentary lives. They are much less active than their friends and colleagues, even when their&#xD;
      heart disease is mild, and inactivity can contribute to a higher risk for heart attacks,&#xD;
      stroke, obesity, and depression. Uncertainty about physical activity, even though it is&#xD;
      recommended (American Heart Association, May 2014), is an important barrier to the physical&#xD;
      and mental health benefits of physical activity. &quot;How much is too much?&quot; and &quot;Will it be too&#xD;
      much for my heart?&quot; are top-of-mind. &quot;Fearless Physical Activity&quot; will provide children,&#xD;
      youth and adults living with CHD with new physical activity experiences and opportunities to&#xD;
      enhance their physical literacy so they are better able to be &quot;active for life&quot;.&#xD;

      &quot;Fearless Physical Activity&quot; will deliver high-quality, meaningful physical&#xD;
      literacy-enhancing experiences to children, youth and adults with congenital heart disease&#xD;
      (CHD). People with CHD have historically been much less active than other Ontarians,&#xD;
      regardless of heart disease severity. 'Fearless' will increase opportunities for&#xD;
      sport/recreation participation by directly providing 48 days of fun, physical activity&#xD;
      specifically designed for children, youth and adults with CHD and their families. Each event&#xD;
      day, physical literacy screening tasks will identify those with CHD who are likely to require&#xD;
      very significant support to be &quot;active for life&quot;. 'Fearless' participants and leaders will&#xD;
      learn about physical literacy, and it's fundamental role as the foundation of a healthy&#xD;
      active lifestyle. A physical literacy workshop will educate leaders within the Canadian&#xD;
      Congenital Heart Alliance (CCHA) about the importance of physical literacy for people with&#xD;
      CHD and the role that CCHA can play in supporting active lifestyles. Joint organization of&#xD;
      'Fearless' events will develop new partnerships between the CCHA and the community sport and&#xD;
      recreation sector. These partnerships will enhance sport and recreation sector capacity to&#xD;
      understand, and better support, the physical literacy needs of people with CHD. The project&#xD;
      outcomes will be increased physical literacy among children, youth and adults with CHD, more&#xD;
      physically active people with CHD and enhanced sport and recreation sector capacity to&#xD;
      provide opportunities that are accessible to Ontarians with CHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planning and partnership phase of 'Fearless' (April to December 2016) will lay the&#xD;
      groundwork for the delivery of the &quot;Fearless Physical Activity&quot; events. The Project&#xD;
      Coordinator will work collaboratively with the leadership of the Canadian Congenital Heart&#xD;
      Alliance (CCHA) and existing CCHA chapters in London and Eastern Ontario to develop the&#xD;
      educational content and desired physical activity opportunities that will be delivered&#xD;
      through the 'Fearless' events. A previous one-day 'Fearless' event evaluated the feasibility&#xD;
      of our concept and the interest among families of those with CHD. The previous one-day event&#xD;
      combined education sessions about physical activity goal setting, identifying personal&#xD;
      activity interests, and finding community physical activity opportunities with opportunities&#xD;
      to participate in a wide variety of physical activities (e.g., geocaching, Frisbee golf,&#xD;
      croquet, beachball volleyball). Feedback from participating families rated all aspects of the&#xD;
      'Fearless' event as excellent or outstanding. However, this one event was held for children&#xD;
      with CHD and their families during the summer, therefore the project coordinator and project&#xD;
      partners will need to develop additional content and activity plans to ensure that we can&#xD;
      provide events for three age groups (children, youth, adults) and in all four seasons of the&#xD;
      year. Providing events in all four seasons is important because people with CHD are highly&#xD;
      susceptible to temperature extremes (cold, hot) and humidity; leading many people with CHD to&#xD;
      believe that physical activity is not a feasible option at many times of the year. During the&#xD;
      planning phase, the project coordinator will strengthen existing partnerships and networks&#xD;
      within the CCHA and the sport and recreation sector, as well as develop the new partnerships&#xD;
      (recreation/sport partners in western and northern Ontario) and expanded networks (northern&#xD;
      Ontario) needed to ensure that people with CHD know about the Fearless events, which will be&#xD;
      offered in all regions of Ontario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'Fearless' events will be held during 2017 (winter, spring, summer, fall) in each region&#xD;
      of Ontario. Each one-day event will be held on a weekend, to facilitate the participation of&#xD;
      people with CHD and their families. Having a series of education and activity sessions on one&#xD;
      day, rather than shorter sessions held more frequently, will better enable people with CHD to&#xD;
      attend from across the wide geographic areas served by each CCHA chapter / CHD clinic. Each&#xD;
      'Fearless' event will include education sessions, participatory physical activity&#xD;
      opportunities and the completion of physical literacy screening tasks that will identify&#xD;
      those needing the greatest support to be active for life. The topic for one education session&#xD;
      will be physical literacy - its importance, how it can be developed throughout life, and its&#xD;
      relationship to physical and mental health. Each 'Fearless' event will be hosted by a&#xD;
      community sport and recreation partner, enhancing project sustainability and sector capacity&#xD;
      to support the physical activity of people with CHD.&#xD;
