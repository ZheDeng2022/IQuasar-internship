  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who are obese often have insulin resistance (inability of insulin to properly control&#xD;
      blood sugar) and high blood sugar. However, not all people with obesity have this problem.&#xD;
      About one-third of people with obesity have normal sugar metabolism (the way your body uses&#xD;
      sugar). Similarly, not all people who are lean are also metabolically healthy and a subset of&#xD;
      people who are lean are referred to as metabolically abnormal lean (MAL) or metabolically&#xD;
      obese lean because they have the abnormalities in glucose metabolism typically associated&#xD;
      with obesity. The reasons why some people with obesity have a problem with blood sugar&#xD;
      control and others do not are not entirely clear. It is thought that impaired muscle sugar&#xD;
      uptake is the main problem related to high blood sugar in people with obesity. However,&#xD;
      adipose tissue (fat tissue) also consumes a substantial amount of blood sugar. Therefore, it&#xD;
      is unclear whether muscle or adipose tissue (fat tissue) are primarily responsible for&#xD;
      altered blood sugar concentrations in persons with metabolically abnormal obesity (MAO)&#xD;
      (those with insulin resistance), compared to those with metabolically normal (healthy)&#xD;
      obesity (MNO), or whether &quot;healthy&quot; adipose tissue (fat tissue) expansion in MNO people&#xD;
      compared with lean people provides a vessel for blood sugar removal that helps maintain&#xD;
      normal blood sugar concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the investigators will determine the amount of sugar that is taken up by the&#xD;
      body and in the cells of adipose tissue (fat tissue) and muscle by infusing labeled sugar&#xD;
      into the blood and looking at its disappearance from blood and appearance in adipose tissue&#xD;
      (fat tissue) and muscle. The investigators will also determine how well insulin, a hormone&#xD;
      that controls blood sugar, turns on signals that stimulate sugar uptake in fat and muscle&#xD;
      cells. These studies will be done after an overnight fast and during an infusion of sugar and&#xD;
      insulin (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp), in sex- and age-matched people who are insulin&#xD;
      resistant and insulin sensitive. People with obesity will also be invited to complete a ~10%&#xD;
      diet-induced weight loss program and will be studied again after they have achieved the&#xD;
      weight loss goal. A group of sex- and age-matched metabolically normal lean participants will&#xD;
      serve as control group. An attempt will be made to also study a group of sex- and age-matched&#xD;
      metabolically abnormal lean participants.&#xD;

        The investigators plan to study a total of 45 men and women of all races and ethnic groups:&#xD;
        15 MAO (metabolically abnormal obese, likely insulin resistant), 15 MNO (metabolically&#xD;
        normal obese, likely insulin sensitive), and 15 lean. All three groups will be balanced&#xD;
        with regards to sex and race/ethnicity distribution, and the two obese groups will also be&#xD;
        matched on percent total body fat. They will also attempt to recruit 15 metabolically&#xD;
        abnormal lean participants.&#xD;
