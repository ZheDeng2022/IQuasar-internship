    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, pilot study of pembrolizumab, exemestane, and&#xD;
      leuprolide for subjects being resistant for front-line hormonal therapy for inoperable&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic hormonal receptor positive (HR+)/ Human epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer. All the patients will be included in the&#xD;
      final tolerability and preliminary efficacy analysis. The efficacy objectives including PFS,&#xD;
      overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and duration of response (DOR).&#xD;
      Adverse effects will be recorded according to CTCAE v4.0.&#xD;
