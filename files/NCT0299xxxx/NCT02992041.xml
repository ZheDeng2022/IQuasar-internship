  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 2 study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an analgesic drug&#xD;
      candidate, VVZ-149 Injections. The study is designed as randomized, double-blind, parallel,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VVZ-149 is a dual antagonist of GlyT2 and 5HT2A. GlyT2 blockage increases inhibitory synaptic&#xD;
      transmission by glycine in the spinal cord, resulting in a reduction of pain transmissions to&#xD;
      the brain. 5HT2A blockage decreases descending serotonergic facilitatory modulation on pain&#xD;
      transmission by the brain and reduces nociceptor activation in peripheral nerves, which are&#xD;
      primary sources of pain in post-surgical pain. VVZ-149 has been shown to have comparable&#xD;
      efficacy to morphine in well controlled (blind, complete randomization with a positive&#xD;
      control) animal studies using rat models of post-operative pain and formalin-induced pain.&#xD;
      The PK/PD study in animals indicates that therapeutic plasma concentration in human subjects&#xD;
      will be 600-1,900 ng/ml. A clinical Phase 1 study performed in healthy subjects has shown no&#xD;
      clinically significant adverse events up to a plasma concentration level of 3,261 ng/ml other&#xD;
      than brief symptoms of mild nausea or dizziness, and mild somnolence when the plasma exposure&#xD;
      level is more than 2,000 ng/ml. A clinical Phase 2 study performed in laparoscopic&#xD;
      gastrectomy patients showed that patients who received VVZ-149 had reduced opioid consumption&#xD;
      after surgery compared to those who received placebo, without any significant drug-related&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
