  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In England each year over 70,000 people fracture their hip. Most of these patients are&#xD;
      elderly females with the fracture occurring after a simple trip or stumble. Approximately&#xD;
      half of these fractures are classified from their relationship to the hip joint capsule as&#xD;
      intracapsular. These fractures are subdivided into those that are displaced and those that&#xD;
      are undisplaced. The majority of displaced fractures are treated with a replacement&#xD;
      arthroplasty. Current treatment for the undisplaced fractures is generally by internal&#xD;
      fixation of the fracture using screws and a plate, although some centres prefer replacement&#xD;
      arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent randomised study on patients from Norway with undisplaced intracapsular fractures&#xD;
      treated with either internal fixation or arthroplasty has just reported reduced complications&#xD;
      and re-operations for those patients treated with an arthroplasty. In addition functional&#xD;
      results were marginally better for those patients treated with an arthroplasty. Current&#xD;
      practice in the UK is generally to treat these fractures by internal fixation. This study&#xD;
      aims to see if replacement arthroplasty can indeed lead to the advantages suggested from the&#xD;
      Norwegian study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who satisfy the inclusion criteria and are willing to participate will be randomised&#xD;
      to receive either reduction and internal fixation of the fracture with a screw and plate&#xD;
      device or alternatively replacement of their femoral head with an artificial hip replacement&#xD;
      (hemiarthroplasty). After surgery patients will receive the same treatment as normal and be&#xD;
      discharge home when able, with follow-up review in the hip fracture clinic. Subsequent&#xD;
      follow-up for the research project is by phone calls from a research nurse who is blinded to&#xD;
      the type of treatment that the patient has received. There will be no additional&#xD;
      investigations or out-patient follow-up visits for these patients in comparison to normal&#xD;
      treatment protocols. Results of the study will ultimately be published in a medical journal.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients admitted to Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust with&#xD;
             an undisplaced intracapsular fracture will be considered for inclusion within the&#xD;
             study. Patients who lack Capacity for example dementia who are unable to provide&#xD;
             informed consent will be included if the assent of their next of kin or legal guardian&#xD;
             can be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  â€¢ patients who decline to participate or in whom consent or assent is not available&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  patients admitted when MJP is not available to supervise treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  patients with pathological fractures from Paget's disease of bone secondary's&#xD;
                  from tumour&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  patients with delayed presentation who would be treated conservatively&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  patients considered unfit for either surgical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  younger patients, aged less than 80 years who are independently mobile and very&#xD;
                  active will be excluded at treated by internal fixation (the risk of fracture&#xD;
                  healing complication for this group is less, whilst there is an increased risk of&#xD;
                  long term complications after arthroplasty&#xD;
