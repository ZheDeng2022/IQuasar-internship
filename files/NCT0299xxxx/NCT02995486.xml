    <textblock>
      A randomized, control trial will be conducted to evaluate the effects of a post-discharge&#xD;
      falls prevention program in patients with neurological diseases and disorders. The objective&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate if implementing a falls prevention program is effective in&#xD;
      reducing subsequent falls and re-hospitalizations, and improving gait, strength and balance&#xD;
      in older adults after hospital discharge. Patients from Baptist Health Neuroscience Center&#xD;
      will be randomized on the day of discharge to receive an exercise falls prevention program,&#xD;
      delivered by Baptist Health physical therapists, or an educational pamphlet on falls&#xD;
      prevention. Baseline and follow up assessments for gait, balance, and strength will be&#xD;
      completed at regular intervals to examine effects of the exercise program. In addition,&#xD;
      participants will be surveyed to find out about recent falls and hospitalizations. This is a&#xD;
      minimal risk study such that the assessments involve conditions in which subjects likely&#xD;
      encounter on a daily basis. The risks of the exercise intervention also are no more than one&#xD;
      might expect from a community exercise program. Potential benefits include reduced&#xD;
      hospitalizations and/or emergency visits related to falls in the intervention group,&#xD;
      increased activity levels and improved falls efficacy in the intervention group, and&#xD;
      increased system capacity at Baptist Health to deliver a falls prevention program.&#xD;

      After signing the consent form, eligible participants will complete a health-related&#xD;
      questionnaire and undergo a gait, balance and strength testing at the time of discharge and&#xD;
      then be randomly referred to an intervention (n=30) or to a control group (n=30).&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited until the target sample (n=60) is reached. Randomization will&#xD;
      be by coin flip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures (intervention and control groups): The evaluation involves non-invasive assessments&#xD;
      of physical functioning conducted by physical therapists including balance, gait, and lower&#xD;
      limb strength testing. Both groups will be tested by physical therapists at baseline 3, and 6&#xD;
      months post-discharge. A 12-month follow-up call will be made to all participants to ask&#xD;
      about falls and physical activity. The physical therapists that conduct the testing will be&#xD;
      different from the physical therapists that deliver the intervention (Otago Exercise&#xD;
      Program). All tests will be completed in 60-90 minute sessions at Baptist Outpatient&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Center. The participants will complete a questionnaire including information&#xD;
      on health and falls history, falls self-efficacy (Falls Efficacy Scale), hospitalizations,&#xD;
      doctors' visits, and emergency department visits. The participants will also complete a&#xD;
      physical assessment including gait analysis using an instrumented mat (GaitRite) to collect&#xD;
      data on the temporo-spatial parameters of gait during preferred gait speed and gait during&#xD;
      street crossing simulation with regular time: 7 seconds. Street crossing regular time&#xD;
      allowance was calculated based on the pre-programmed pedestrian street signals, which give&#xD;
      pedestrians 20 seconds to cross a four-lane street. The GaitRite is a thin mat with pressure&#xD;
      sensors; an integrated software and web-cam that measures and calculates the gait&#xD;
      temporo-spatial parameters. The videos are used only as a visual reference to inspect the&#xD;
      task for quality control during data collection and review and will not be used in the&#xD;
      analysis or in any other way. The physical assessment will also include the BalanceMaster&#xD;
      (Natus Medical, Inc.), a fixed force plate to measure the vertical forces exerted through the&#xD;
      feet to measure center of gravity position and postural control, Tinneti Balance Assessment,&#xD;
      lower limb strength testing using the 30-second chair stand test, and the Timed Up and Go&#xD;
      (TUG) assessment for mobility testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (intervention and control groups): The participants will complete the gait,&#xD;
      balance and chair-rise tests in random order. They will be asked a priori to wear non-slip&#xD;
      socks provided by the research team. During the preferred gait speed condition, the&#xD;
      participants will be instructed to walk on the GAITRiteÂ® at their preferred speed as they&#xD;
      usually do during their daily activities. During the simulated street crossing condition, the&#xD;
      participants will be instructed to cross the street when the pedestrian lights turn green and&#xD;
      complete the crossing within the time allowed as displayed by the pedestrian lights on the&#xD;
      video. The video includes audio of traffic noise for a more realistic road crossing&#xD;
      environment, and it displays an intersection situation in which the subject will be&#xD;
      positioned at the intersection, on the sidewalk looking at the oncoming motor vehicle traffic&#xD;
      from both directions. A pedestrian light with countdown will also be displayed on the screen.&#xD;
      Thus, a functional dual-task paradigm will be used including visual cues and the participants&#xD;
      will have to interpret those cues and adjust their gait accordingly. A familiarization trial&#xD;
      will be completed, followed by three recording trials under each condition. The order of gait&#xD;
      conditions will be randomized for each participant. Participants are free to stop&#xD;
      participating at anytime without needing to provide a reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Intervention (intervention group only): The intervention is a comprehensive program&#xD;
      addressing aging-related functional decline, fear of falling and inactivity. It targets&#xD;
      adults with a history of falls or at-risk for falls. Following the assessments, the&#xD;
      participants will be assigned to a control group who will receive the standard educational&#xD;
      information on falls prevention, or to an individualized exercise program prescribed and&#xD;
      delivered by physical therapists (Otago Exercise Program for Falls Prevention). The program&#xD;
      is an easy-to-implement and affordable exercise program for individuals with high risk for&#xD;
      falls. The program design model is person-centered and customized to the individual needs. It&#xD;
      includes a set of leg muscle strengthening and balance retraining exercises, and a walking&#xD;
      plan. Subjects will go to Baptist Outpatient Rehabilitation Center before discharge for the&#xD;
      baseline assessment and exercise prescription, then biweekly during the first 2 months (4&#xD;
      times) for exercise progressions and follow ups, once at month 3 for the first re-assessment,&#xD;
      then again at 6 months for a booster session and second re-assessment. At 12 months a phone&#xD;
      call follow up will be done to ask about falls and physical activity. The assessments and&#xD;
      sessions will be covered by the Baptist Health Neuroscience Center and Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Services. As part of the program, the participants will do 30 minutes of exercise three times&#xD;
      per week, and walk continuously or not for 30 minutes at least two times per week for six&#xD;
      months. Participants record (physical activity log) the days they exercise and walk and&#xD;
      provide the information to the physical therapists during subsequent visits and/or calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical therapists will prescribe the exercises based on a large selection available on the&#xD;
      program manual. The participants receive an illustration with explanations of the exercises&#xD;
      they need to do. They receive a booklet with exercise instructions and ankle cuff weights.&#xD;
      The physical therapists will do exercise progressions by increasing intensity and/or&#xD;
      difficulty during the subsequent client visits to Baptist Outpatient Rehabilitation Center.&#xD;
      The program also includes monthly telephone calls from study staff to maintain motivation,&#xD;
      collect information on any falls, and answer questions between visits.&#xD;
