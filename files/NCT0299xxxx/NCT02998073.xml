  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research focuses on youth with conduct disorder (CD), and a history of violence. CD is a&#xD;
      youth neurodevelopmental disorder that is commonly associated with criminality. Although&#xD;
      psychosocial interventions that address impulsivity and self-control have been shown to be&#xD;
      effective at helping promote prosocial behavior in patients with CD, the biological changes&#xD;
      that occur as a result of treatment are not well understood. This study will explore changes&#xD;
      in the brain function of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in response to a common&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention (Stop, Now and Plan). This study will contribute to our&#xD;
      understanding of biological mechanisms involved in therapeutic gains among children with&#xD;
      behavioural problems and youth offenders; therefore, it will inform further development of&#xD;
      treatment programs for children/youth with impulsive behaviours.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CD is a youth-limited neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impulsivity and&#xD;
      dysfunctional social behavior. CD is associated with increased risks of mortality, lower&#xD;
      educational and occupational achievement, criminal behavior and other psychosocial&#xD;
      difficulties, and hence presents a significant burden to society. Impulsivity is a prominent&#xD;
      predictor of violence in CD. Treatment programs targeting impulsivity in CD have been shown&#xD;
      to be effective at increasing pro-social functioning in CD, but the biological mechanisms&#xD;
      that underpin these therapeutic gains are not well understood. Past research suggests that&#xD;
      the ACC play a role in CD and impulsivity. This study explores biological and behavioral&#xD;
      changes in response to Stop, Now and Plan (SNAP), a validated 13-week psychosocial&#xD;
      intervention addressing impulsivity and self-control in youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) CD youth who respond to SNAP treatment will exhibit greater post-treatment ACC activation&#xD;
      during an fMRI imaging task compared with their baseline, pre-treatment ACC activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) CD youth will exhibit lower ACC activation at baseline during an fMRI imaging task&#xD;
      compared with the baseline ACC activation exhibited by typically developing youth.&#xD;

    <description>Difference in ACC BOLD activation to commission errors (contrast of BOLD response during commission errors vs. BOLD response during correct hits) will be tested using a 2 (Session: pre-SNAP vs. post-SNAP) Ã— 2 (Group: treatment responders vs. non-treatment responders) within subject, mixed model analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), controlling for the effect of age, to investigate the two-way interaction between session and group.

    <description>SNAP program was developed to target justice-involved youth (6 years and older) who have problems with aggression, CD, and/or gang affiliation. SNAP focuses on engaging youth in interesting and creative learning modules by providing real life scenarios designed to improve self-control, impulsive behaviors, decision-making skills, and pro-social skills. SNAP treatment is delivered over a 13-week period.</description>
