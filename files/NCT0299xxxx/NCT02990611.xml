      The purpose of this study is to describe the safety and effectiveness of nivolumab treatment,&#xD;
      either in monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab, overall and according to various&#xD;
      subgroups of interest, in participants with advanced melanoma and in participants with&#xD;
      adjuvant nivolumab therapy.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Adult participants who are at least 18 years of age of the time of treatment decision with&#xD;
        a primary diagnosis of advanced melanoma (histologically confirmed Stage III [unresectable]&#xD;
        or Stage IV skin, ocular, or mucosal melanoma) and whose physician has already decided to&#xD;
        initiate a treatment with nivolumab or nivolumab/ipilimumab for the first time for the&#xD;
        treatment of melanoma, according to the label approved in Germany. Participants with a&#xD;
        current primary diagnosis of a cancer other than advanced melanoma, participants currently&#xD;
        included in an interventional clinical trial, or participants who have already received&#xD;
        nivolumab in a prior line of therapy (for monotherapy arm) will all be excluded from this&#xD;
        study. Adult participants in the adjuvant nivolumab treatment cohort will be enrolled after&#xD;
        complete surgical resection and no evidence of disease after the treating physician has&#xD;
        decided to initiate an adjuvant therapy with nivolumab according to the label approved in&#xD;
        Germany.&#xD;
