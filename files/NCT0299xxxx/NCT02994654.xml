      The overall purpose of this is study to provide continued access to the ReCell device&#xD;
      following completion of protocol CTP001-6, and allow for collection of supplementary clinical&#xD;
      outcome data for the ReCell device when used as an adjunct to meshed grafts in subjects with&#xD;
      acute thermal burn injuries who require skin grafting for closure of burn injuries.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With Confirmed Treatment Area Closure of RECELL-treated Wounds Compared to Control (Non-inferiority)</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to or at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Complete wound closure is defined as skin re-epithelialization without drainage, confirmed at two consecutive study visits at least 2 weeks apart by direct visualization by a qualified clinician blinded to treatment assignment. The incidence of complete wound closure is hypothesized to be non-inferior for ReCell-treated areas as compared to control areas.</description>

    <measure>Relative Reduction in Donor Skin Area Requirement</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to or at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For this second co-primary endpoint, it is hypothesized that the expansion ratio associated with the RECELL treatment area will be superior to that of the control, i.e. less donor skin will be required for RECELL-treated areas compared with the control areas.</description>

    <description>The ReCell-assigned treatment area will be treated as described in the product's Instructions for Use. In summary, 1ml of fluid physically covers a treatment area of 80 cm2. Each milliliter of fluid contains cells harvested from a square centimeter of thin split-thickness skin sample.&#xD;
The reagents and components of the ReCell kit are used, in a scalable fashion, to facilitate disaggregation of cells from skin samples into filtered cell suspension. Areas to be harvested for skin samples are to be clean and show no evidence of surrounding cellulitis or infection. Treatment area sizes and cell suspension volumes are to be recorded.</description>

ReCell: The ReCell-assigned treatment area will be treated as described in the product's Instructions for Use. In summary, 1ml of fluid physically covers a treatment area of 80 cm2. Each milliliter of fluid contains cells harvested from a square centimeter of thin split-thickness skin sample.&#xD;
The reagents and components of the ReCell kit are used, in a scalable fashion, to facilitate disaggregation of cells from skin samples into filtered cell suspension. Areas to be harvested for skin samples are to be clean and show no evidence of surrounding cellulitis or infection. Treatment area sizes and cell suspension volumes are to be recorded.</description>

          <description>Complete wound closure is defined as skin re-epithelialization without drainage, confirmed at two consecutive study visits at least 2 weeks apart by direct visualization by a qualified clinician blinded to treatment assignment. The incidence of complete wound closure is hypothesized to be non-inferior for ReCell-treated areas as compared to control areas.</description>
