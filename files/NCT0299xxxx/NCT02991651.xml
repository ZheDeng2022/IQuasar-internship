    <textblock>
      Patient selection: a) Pathological confirmation of non-small cell lung cancer without&#xD;
      activating EGFR mutations; b) Advanced stage disease (IV or IIIB with malignant effusion)&#xD;
      with at least two prior chemotherapy regimens; c) No available curative therapy; d) Pregnant&#xD;
      women are excluded; e) Informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pretreatment evaluation: a) Medical history and physical examination; b) Hepatic and renal&#xD;
      function (bilirubin, aspartate aminotransaminase, creatinine); c) Preoperative staging&#xD;
      evaluation including CT-chest or PET/CT scan;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment plan: Three dose levels of IRX4204 and erlotinib will be studied using&#xD;
      intra-patient dose escalation for dose levels 1 and 2. These study agents will be&#xD;
      administered orally until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicities, activation of a&#xD;
      phase II study of the combination, or exhaustion of the IRX4204 drug supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation on study: Adverse events will be graded on a scale of 0 to 5, using the Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 4.0. Efficacy will be assessed using the&#xD;
      RECIST v1.1 criteria based on CT-chest or PET/CT scan after 8 weeks of study treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies in pre-clinical models and in human clinical trials have clearly established&#xD;
      the potential for the use of rexinoids in the treatment and prevention of cancer. IRX4204, a&#xD;
      second generation rexinoid, is a highly potent and specific activator of RXRs. Because&#xD;
      IRX4204 is significantly more potent and more selective for the RXRs relative to the RARs&#xD;
      than a first generation approved RXR agonist drug, bexarotene, it potentially will be&#xD;
      associated with fewer adverse events and greater activity in clinical use. Preclinical&#xD;
      studies of the combination of IRX4204 plus erlotinib, and previous clinical studies of the&#xD;
      combination of the bexarotene plus erlotinib indicated at least additive beneficial effects&#xD;
      for treatment of NSCLC. This study seeks to investigate the safety and activity of IRX4204 in&#xD;
      combination with erlotinib in patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
