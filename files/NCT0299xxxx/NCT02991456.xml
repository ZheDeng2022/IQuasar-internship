  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 2 study is to assess the efficacy and patient satisfaction of oral&#xD;
      rolapitant plus ondansetron vs. oral ondansetron monotherapy in malignant glioma (MG)&#xD;
      patients receiving standard of care radiation (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) therapy. This is a&#xD;
      randomized phase 2 trial of rolapitant plus ondansetron vs. ondansetron monotherapy for the&#xD;
      prevention of chemo-radiation induced nausea and vomiting in primary MG subjects receiving RT&#xD;
      and concomitant multi-dose TMZ.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All eligible subjects should receive a planned total dose of 54-60 gray (GY) of radiation and&#xD;
      75 mg/m2 of TMZ daily for a total of six weeks. Patients will be randomized to receive one of&#xD;
      two antiemetic treatment sequences: sequence A that involves administration of ondansetron&#xD;
      alone for 3 weeks followed by a single dose of rolapitant (day 22) plus daily ondansetron for&#xD;
      3 weeks or sequence B that involves a single dose of rolapitant (day 1) plus daily&#xD;
      ondansetron for 3 weeks followed by 3 weeks of daily ondansetron alone. The study has one&#xD;
      primary endpoint: complete response (CR) rate. Participation in this study may result in&#xD;
      reduced chemo-radiation induced nausea and vomiting, however, risks include the common side&#xD;
      effects of rolapitant including decreased appetite, neutropenia, dizziness, dyspepsia,&#xD;
      urinary tract infection, stomatitis, and anemia.&#xD;
