  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This interventional Phase II, single-arm, multicenter, open-label study will investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of a combination regimen of 6 months eltrombopag and cyclosporine&#xD;
      treatment in adult patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) as first line therapy, with an&#xD;
      additional 18 months follow-up for cyclosporine tapering and duration of response until&#xD;
      relapse or 24 months whichever is earlier (responders only who do not relapse prior to 6&#xD;
      months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usage of eltrombopag and cyclosporine combines two therapies with different modes of&#xD;
      action. Cyclosporine acts as an immunosuppressant and eltrombopag acts as a stimulator of&#xD;
      bone marrow progenitor cells. Given that SAA is currently viewed as having an autoimmune&#xD;
      pathogenesis resulting in bone marrow progenitor cell destruction, the combination of&#xD;
      eltrombopag and cyclosporine is attractive. Preliminary experience with their combined use&#xD;
      appears favorable, with no untoward toxicity observed to date.&#xD;
