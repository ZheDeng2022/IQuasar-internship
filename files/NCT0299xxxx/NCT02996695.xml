      Single site, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of PfSPZ-CVac&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and efficacy against naturally occurring malaria in&#xD;
      malaria-exposed Malian adults. The overall goal of the study is to evaluate if a regimen of&#xD;
      PfSPZ-CVac (PfSPZ Challenge under chemoprophylaxis) is safe, well-tolerated, and provides&#xD;
      sterile protection against naturally-occurring malaria in malaria-experienced adults. The&#xD;
      study population includes 62 healthy, malaria-experienced adults aged 18-45 years, inclusive,&#xD;
      residing in Bougoula Hameau and surrounding villages, Mali. The primary objective of this&#xD;

      This is a single site, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of&#xD;
      PfSPZ-CVac safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and efficacy against naturally occurring&#xD;
      malaria in malaria-exposed Malian adults. The overall goal of the study is to evaluate if a&#xD;
      regimen of PfSPZ-CVac (PfSPZ Challenge under chemoprophylaxis) is safe, well-tolerated, and&#xD;
      provides sterile protection against naturally-occurring malaria in malaria-experienced&#xD;
      adults. Participants will receive three immunizing PfSPZ Challenge injections via direct&#xD;
      venous inoculation (DVI) four weeks apart under chloroquine chemoprophylaxis. The PfSPZ&#xD;
      Challenge dose will be 204,800 PfSPZ. This is based on results of studies in Europe and in&#xD;
      Africa. In T端bingen, Germany, 100% of malaria-na誰ve adults who received three doses of 51,200&#xD;
      PfSPZ every four weeks under chloroquine chemoprophylaxis were protected against homologous&#xD;
      controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). At the same time, studies of PfSPZ Vaccine in&#xD;
      malaria-experienced adults in Mali and in Tanzania demonstrate that higher doses of PfSPZ are&#xD;
      required to demonstrate immunogenicity and high grade protection in malaria-experienced&#xD;
      adults that is comparable to that achieved in malaria-na誰ve adults studied in the USA. For&#xD;
      this reason, the dose selected for this study is four-fold higher than the dose used for&#xD;
      T端bingen, Germany. Controls will receive 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) as placebo. All&#xD;
      participants will receive a standard chemoprophylactic regimen of chloroquine (CQ) for 10&#xD;
      weeks. Chloroquine will be given as a loading dose (600mg chloroquine base) two days before&#xD;
      the first administration of PfSPZ Challenge, followed by weekly doses of chloroquine (300mg&#xD;
      chloroquine base weekly). Participants will also be treated with a 7-day regimen of&#xD;
      artesunate (200 mg per day) after the last PfSPZ Challenge dose of 204,800 sporozoites for&#xD;
      malaria parasite clearance, one week after the last CQ dose is given. A total of 62&#xD;
      participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two groups and will be inoculated&#xD;
      with PfSPZ Challenge or 0.9% NaCl by DVI so that a total of 62 adults will participate in the&#xD;
      study. Participants will be recruited from the MRTC's Bougoula-Hameau site. All volunteers&#xD;
      recruited will be healthy adults aged between 18 and 45 years. Safety and infectivity data&#xD;
      will be collected. Volunteers, clinical and laboratory investigators will be blinded to group&#xD;
      allocation. Participants will be followed every four weeks after the last vaccination as&#xD;
      outpatients for active malaria diagnosis and treatment. Passive follow-up will be&#xD;
      accomplished by continuous availability of study staff onsite to diagnose and treat malaria&#xD;
      and other medical issues that arise. The primary objective of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of PfSPZ Challenge compared to placebo among malaria-experienced&#xD;
      adults taking chloroquine prophylaxis (PfSPZ-CVac). The secondary objectives are: 1. to&#xD;
      assess the protective efficacy of PfSPZ-CVac against naturally transmitted P. falciparum&#xD;
      malaria infection as diagnosed by thick blood smear microscopy, 2. To assess protective&#xD;
      efficacy of PfSPZ-CVac against naturally transmitted P. falciparum malaria infection as&#xD;
      diagnosed by qPCR, 3. to assess the expanded efficacy of PfSPZ-CVac compared to placebo, and&#xD;
      4. to examine the immune response to P. falciparum malaria infection.&#xD;
