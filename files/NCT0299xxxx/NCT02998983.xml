    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will be carried out in children diagnosed with high-risk neuroblastoma&#xD;
      that have achieved a complete or very good partial response after standard therapy. An&#xD;
      additional cohort of children who could not achieve these response criteria or that relapsed&#xD;
      after standard therapy but do not have progressive disease will receive Racotumomab together&#xD;
      with metronomic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this study are to determine the immune response after one-year&#xD;
      duration immunization with Racotumomab, to describe the response of Racotumomab therapy in&#xD;
      minimal residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow and to describe the toxicity profile of&#xD;
      Racotumomab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma is the most common extra-cranial tumor in childhood but prognosis is still&#xD;
      poor, even with the advances in its treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New therapeutic strategies have been examined, and several immunotherapeutic approaches,&#xD;
      including combined therapy with monoclonal antibodies (anti-GD2), intravenous interleukin-2&#xD;
      (Il-2) and intravenous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and&#xD;
      anti-idiotype vaccines are currently being assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Racotumomab is an anti-idiotype antibody capable of inducing anti-N-glycolyl GM3 antibodies&#xD;
      in patients with neuroblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expression of the ganglioside N-glycolyl GM3 was shown in neuroblastoma and this&#xD;
      expression could be useful as a specific target for immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ractoumomab will be administered once standard therapy for neuroblastoma has been completed.&#xD;
