      The overarching goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and&#xD;
      sustainability of utilizing statewide Immunization Information Systems (IIS) to conduct&#xD;
      centralized reminder/recall (R/R) to improve HPV vaccination rates among adolescents ages&#xD;
      11-17, and additionally look at the 11-14 year old subset for whom a new 2 dose series has&#xD;
      recently been recommended. The investigators will extend previous research on effectiveness&#xD;
      of centralized R/R to a new population--adolescents due for HPV vaccine-- and test the use of&#xD;
      centralized R/R as a cancer-prevention strategy. Investigators will assess the effect of&#xD;
      centralized R/R in two states--one with and one without mandated reporting of vaccinations to&#xD;
      IISs, and disseminate IIS R/R to other states. Investigators will implement, evaluate (using&#xD;
      the RE-AIM framework 31-36), and disseminate a collaborative, IIS-based centralized HPV&#xD;
      vaccine R/R model in which partnerships of public health systems and primary care practices&#xD;
      in two states (NY, CO) collaborate to remind parents about HPV vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims and hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #1: Adapt IIS messages and delivery systems (e.g., algorithms) previously developed for&#xD;
      centralized R/R for other vaccines to fit HPV vaccine IIS R/R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2: Assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of centralized IIS-based (IIS-C) autodialer&#xD;
      (phone) R/R in increasing vaccine rates [initial dose (HPV#1) and a complete series (HPV#2 or&#xD;
      #3)] among teens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct a pragmatic trial, to assess the impact and cost effectiveness of centralized&#xD;
      IIS-based (IIS-C) autodialer (phone) R/R in increasing initiation and completion rates for&#xD;
      the HPV vaccine series in adolescents ages 11-17 years. The investigators will use a&#xD;
      within-practice design, randomizing patients within randomly selected primary care practices&#xD;
      to IIS-C R/R (1, 2, or 3 reminders per dose) compared to usual care (0 reminders from this&#xD;
      study). The investigators will apply the RE-AIM framework to evaluate the reach,&#xD;
      effectiveness/cost effectiveness, adoption, and implementation of IIS-C R/R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2a: IIS-C R/R will result in higher HPV vaccination rates than usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2b: IIS-C R/R will result in higher HPV vaccination rates than usual care in key&#xD;
      subgroups (males and females, younger and older teens, urban//rural teens).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2c: IIS-C R/R will be more cost-effective (cost/vaccine received) than usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #3: Assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of centralized IIS-based (IIS-C) R/R using&#xD;
      autodialer (phone) or mail in increasing vaccine rates [initial dose (HPV#1) and a complete&#xD;
      series (HPV#2)] and decreasing time to completion among teens 11-14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct a pragmatic trial, to assess the impact and cost effectiveness of centralized&#xD;
      IIS-based (IIS-C) R/R using either autodialer (phone) or postcard (mail) in increasing&#xD;
      initiation and completion rates for the newly implemented HPV vaccine 2 dose series in&#xD;
      adolescents ages 11-14 years. We will use a within-practice design, randomizing patients&#xD;
      within randomly selected primary care practices to IIS-C R/R using either an autodailer or&#xD;
      postcards (up to 2 reminders per dose needed) compared to usual care (0 reminders from this&#xD;
      study). We will apply the RE-AIM framework to evaluate the reach, effectiveness/cost&#xD;
      effectiveness, adoption, and implementation of IIS-C R/R.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3a: IIS-C R/R (either modality) will result in higher HPV vaccination rates than&#xD;
      usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3b: IIS-C R/R (either modality) will result in higher HPV vaccination rates than&#xD;
      usual care in key subgroups (males and females, younger and older teens, urban//rural teens).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3c: IIS-C R/R will be more cost-effective (cost/vaccine received) than usual care.&#xD;
      IIS-C R/R using autodialer will be more cost effective than IIS-C R/R using postcards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #4: Disseminate IIS-C R/R across NY and CO and pilot in four IISs: (a) Develop an IIS-C&#xD;
      HPV R/R toolkit, (b) Use a technical advisory group, (c) Initiate IIS-C R/R in four other&#xD;
      IISs [Yr. 4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the end of the study investigators will have a feasible, sustainable, cost-effective model&#xD;
      for HPV vaccine reminders that can be used nationally to prevent cervical cancer and other&#xD;
      HPV-related cancers.&#xD;

    <measure>Initiation of the HPV vaccine series (receipt and documentation of initial dose of vaccine series within immunization registry)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Did the adolescent initiate the HPV vaccine series? The investigators are allowing up to 5 months after the initial recall notice for the adolescent to make an appointment and receive their dose. After that time frame, the investigators will not attribute vaccination to the recall. Receipt will be documented by providers within the state immunization registry via EMR direct transfer or manual entry.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Completion of the HPV vaccine series (receipt and documentation of final dose of vaccine series within immunization registry)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Did those eligible to complete the HPV vaccine series within the time frame of the study do so? The investigators are allowing up to 5 months after the initial recall notice for the adolescent to make an appointment and receive their dose. After that time frame, the investigators will not attribute vaccination to the recall. Receipt will be documented by providers within the state immunization registry via EMR direct transfer or manual entry.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences between arms - initiation</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Is 1, 2, or 3 reminders per arm most effective and cost effective for initiation. Only those who need an initial dose at baseline will be eligible for this outcome. Adolescents in each arm will be allowed up to 5 months after the first recall notice to get a vaccine. Receipt will be documented by providers within the state immunization registry via EMR direct transfer or manual entry. This will be tested in the 11-17 year old group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differences between arms - completion</measure>
    <time_frame>20 months</time_frame>
    <description>Is 1, 2, or 3 reminders per arm most effective and cost effective for completion. Because the second or third dose of the series is dependent on when the adolescent receives their initial dose, the investigators will be following eligible adolescents for 20 months to allow time for those who did not respond to the recall for the initial dose right away to be able to complete the series within the time frame. However, receipt of the completion dose will only be attributed to the recall if it was received within 5 months of the 1st recall for the completion dose. Receipt will be documented by providers within the state immunization registry via EMR direct transfer or manual entry. This will be tested in the 11-17 year old group. For 11-14 year olds, completion is 2 doses. For 15-17 year olds, completion is 3 doses.</description>

    <description>Are mail or phone reminders most effective and cost effective for initiation. Only those who need an initial dose at baseline will be eligible for this outcome. Adolescents in each arm will be allowed up to 5 months after the first recall notice to get a vaccine. Receipt will be documented by providers within the state immunization registry via EMR direct transfer or manual entry. This will be tested with the 11-14 year old group only.</description>

    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Are mail or phone reminders most effective and cost effective for completion. This will be tested only in the 11-14 year old group, so completion will equal 2nd dose. Because the second dose of the series is dependent on when the adolescent receives their initial dose, the investigators will be following eligible adolescents for 17 months to allow time for those who did not respond to the recall for the initial dose right away to be able to complete the series within the time frame. However, receipt of the completion dose will only be attributed to the recall if it was received within 5 months of the 1st recall for the completion dose. Receipt will be documented by providers within the state immunization registry via EMR direct transfer or manual entry.</description>
