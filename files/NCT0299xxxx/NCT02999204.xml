      To evaluate in patients with chronic kidney disease the impact of two dosages of per os&#xD;
      vitamin D3 supplementation (cholecalciferol) on large arterial stiffness (evaluated non&#xD;
      invasively by pulse wave velocity and high-resolution echotracking system). We will also&#xD;
      study arterial calcification (lateral abdominal radiography and echocardiogram), arterial&#xD;
      remodeling (high-resolution echotracking system), endothelial function (evaluated by a&#xD;
      non-invasive finger biosensor device), and bone remodeling (evaluated by serum biomarkers and&#xD;
      bone mineral density).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Structural changes to large arteries and abnormalities in mineral and bone metabolism are&#xD;
      frequent manifestations in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Together, they&#xD;
      contribute in a large part to the heightened morbidity and mortality observed in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological data in end stage renal disease and in the general population suggest the&#xD;
      existence of a bone-vascular axis. Metabolic bone disease (MBD) in CKD encompasses altered&#xD;
      bone remodeling and the propensity for vascular calcification. These pathological processes&#xD;
      are driven by the multiple disorders of mineral metabolism in CKD, among them, abnormalities&#xD;
      of vitamin D metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D] is widely observed in CKD patients and has been associated&#xD;
      with an increased rate of cardiovascular events in both the general population and in CKD&#xD;
      patients. The mechanisms involved are not clearly established. Vitamin D influences blood&#xD;
      pressure through effects on the renin-angiotensin system (via a vitamin D response element in&#xD;
      the renin gene), vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocyte proliferation and&#xD;
      hypertrophy, vascular inflammation and calcification. Vitamin D deficiency has been&#xD;
      associated with large arterial stiffness in end-stage renal disease patients. Aortic and&#xD;
      carotid stiffness are independent predictors of cardiovascular and overall mortality in&#xD;
      end-stage renal disease patients. Large arterial remodeling and stiffening could be the&#xD;
      missing pathogenic link between vitamin D deficiency and increased cardiovascular event rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of mineral metabolism, many CKD patients develop secondary hyperparathyroidism. This&#xD;
      results from a combination of hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia and low levels of active&#xD;
      Vitamin D [1,25(OH)D2]. Since several observational studies have shown that parathyroid&#xD;
      hormone (PTH) levels are inversely correlated with blood 25(OH)D levels, it is possible that&#xD;
      25(OH)D deficiency may also be contributing to the hyperparathyroid state. Secondary&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism contributes to cardiovascular risk and to bone disease. Elevated PTH has&#xD;
      been associated with large arterial stiffness and remodeling. Elevated PTH is also associated&#xD;
      with high bone turnover and participates in the development of bone disease of CKD-MBD. Bone&#xD;
      disease in CKD-MBD comprises abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, linear growth&#xD;
      and strength. Bone biopsy remains the gold standard for evaluation of bone disease in CKD but&#xD;
      its invasive nature limits its practice. Serum biomarkers of bone remodeling allow direct&#xD;
      estimation of bone remodeling but lack evaluation and precision. Among them, guidelines&#xD;
      issued by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommend PTH (1-84) and bone&#xD;
      specific alkaline phosphatase (BSALP). Other biomarkers exist including osteocalcin,&#xD;
      osteoprotegerin, tartrate-resistant acid phosphate-5b (TRAP-5b), pyridinoline and&#xD;
      deoxypyridinoline, procollagen type 1 amino-terminal extension peptides, C terminal&#xD;
      cross-link (CTX) , FGF-23 and fetuin-A. The major limitation of the use of these biomarkers&#xD;
      is their kidney-dependent elimination that affects their measured levels depending on the&#xD;
      degree of kidney dysfunction. We have chosen to study, in addition to PTH (1-84) and BSALP,&#xD;
      CTX, osteoprotegerin, osteocalcin, fetuin-A and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) because&#xD;
      a relationship between these biomarkers and arterial disease has never been demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to compare the impact of standard versus aggressive Vitamin D3&#xD;
      supplementation (in Vitamin D deficient CKD patients) on important vascular and bone health&#xD;
      endpoints.&#xD;
