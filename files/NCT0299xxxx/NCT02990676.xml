  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairments, especially deficits of executive function, have been well documented&#xD;
      as a core and early feature in Huntington's disease (HD). Cognitive impairments can be&#xD;
      considerably burdensome and devastating for people and families affected by HD. Computerised&#xD;
      cognitive training interventions that focus on improving executive function present a&#xD;
      potentially exciting non-pharmacological treatment option. Novel work conducted in mouse&#xD;
      models of HD, has demonstrated that cognitive training, administered from an early stage in&#xD;
      the disease, can improve motor performance at an older age, even in the absence of further&#xD;
      training in the intervening time. This represents proof of principle in an animal model of HD&#xD;
      that cognitive training can improve HD disease symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvements associated with executive function training have also been reported in a&#xD;
      clinical setting in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. For example, cognitive training,&#xD;
      can improve executive function as people age, and training specifically focused on tasks of&#xD;
      executive function has been shown to improve both cognitive and motor outcomes in&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).&#xD;
      Therefore, this study is a feasibility study which aims to establish proof of principle for&#xD;
      using computerised cognitive training in people with HD. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      determine the feasibility, acceptability and gather preliminary evidence of the effectiveness&#xD;
      of a cognitive training intervention programme, targeted for people with HD. The&#xD;
      investigators will also aim to investigate the most appropriate outcome measures to use in&#xD;
      this study and gather feedback on the cognitive training intervention. The investigators will&#xD;
      also establish proof of concept via the study of brain structure and function, using MRI&#xD;
      scanning techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The computerised cognitive training software and the associated outcome measures will be&#xD;
      investigated, taking into account the views of people and families who are affected by HD. A&#xD;
      randomised feasibility study of computerised cognitive training for people with HD will then&#xD;
      be conducted. Participants who are randomised to the cognitive training intervention group&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a cognitive training intervention utilising &quot;HAPPYneuron&quot; software.&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group will be asked to complete the cognitive training&#xD;
      programme for a minimum of 30 minutes, 3 times a week for the 12 week study duration.&#xD;
      Participants in the control group will not receive any cognitive training and will be asked&#xD;
      to continue as normal, however they will have home visits to control for the confounding&#xD;
      effect of social interaction. Additional monitoring and prompting for the intervention group,&#xD;
      will be conducted via email, text or telephone reminders (as preferred by the participant)&#xD;
      and home visits. The motor and cognitive function of participants will be assessed at the&#xD;
      beginning and end of the study, using a range of motor and cognitive assessments. Additional&#xD;
      cognitive measurements will be recorded as part of the HAPPYneuron programme throughout the&#xD;
      cognitive training intervention, such as accuracy and response time measures of particular&#xD;
      computer games. MRI scans (optional) will be conducted at the beginning and end of the study&#xD;
      to identify any structural changes in the brain that may be associated with the cognitive&#xD;
      training intervention. As part of the feasibility and acceptability assessment, participants,&#xD;
      family members and carers will be invited to complete a semi-structured interview at the end&#xD;
      of the study, if consent is obtained, focusing on using this type of software as a home based&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention.&#xD;

      Due to space constraints a more extensive description of the research study can be found in&#xD;
      the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Background and Rationale Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat&#xD;
           trinucleotide expansion within the first exon of the huntingtin gene and causes a range&#xD;
           of symptoms including motor, cognitive and psychiatric disturbances, which significantly&#xD;
           affect daily activities, independence and quality of life, even during the early stages&#xD;
           of the disease. Cognitive dysfunctions from early on in the HD disease process have been&#xD;
           well documented and can include specific problems with attention, cognitive flexibility&#xD;
           and memory. Indeed, difficulty sharing attention between more than one task has been&#xD;
           demonstrated to be a specific and core deficit in HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cognitive training interventions, which focus on executive function, present a&#xD;
           potentially exciting non-pharmacological treatment option for neurodegenerative diseases&#xD;
           including HD. Studies in HD mice have previously demonstrated executive function&#xD;
           impairments, including deficits in attention and subsequent studies have shown that&#xD;
           cognitive training can benefit HD mice and prevent the onset of cognitive and motor&#xD;
           disease symptoms. This work suggests that an early cognitive training intervention can&#xD;
           have significant and long-lasting beneficial effects on HD symptoms. Although further&#xD;
           systematic studies in mouse models of HD are required to inform the translational&#xD;
           aspects of cognitive training interventions, these results provide important proof of&#xD;
           principle evidence that cognitive training can provide benefit in mouse models of HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Studies in human populations suggest that cognitive training, via repeatedly conducting&#xD;
           tasks that require specific aspects of executive function such as attention, reasoning&#xD;
           and memory, can improve cognitive function as people age. Computerised cognitive&#xD;
           training studies have also been conducted in a number of neurodegenerative diseases&#xD;
           including Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). These studies have&#xD;
           found that computerised cognitive training that can improve cognition in PD and AD.&#xD;
           However, a systematic literature review of Europe PubMed Central using the keywords,&#xD;
           'Huntington's disease' and 'cognitive training' or 'cognitive therapy' or 'brain&#xD;
           training' or 'executive function training' conducted from the years 1950 to 2015,&#xD;
           produced 2 results. A review on cognitive burden in HD and a paper on exercise in a&#xD;
           mouse model of HD benefiting cognitive symptoms. Thus, the use of cognitive training in&#xD;
           HD is a considerably under researched area and to our knowledge cognitive training is&#xD;
           yet to be explored in HD. Therefore, feasibility studies, such as the one proposed in&#xD;
           this application are crucial in trialing novel potential therapeutic interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The outcome measures used to determine patient benefit in cognitive training studies can&#xD;
           vary significantly between studies. Furthermore, this is the first time that such an&#xD;
           intervention has been used in people with HD. Therefore, the outcome measures used in&#xD;
           cognitive training studies to determine patient benefit need to be carefully explored&#xD;
           and defined prior to beginning the study. The candidate outcome measures for use in this&#xD;
           study have been chosen to include both cognitive and motor measures specific to people&#xD;
           with HD to best evaluate the outcome of the intervention. Difficulty sharing attention&#xD;
           has been shown to be a specific problem in HD. Attentional sharing can be measured&#xD;
           clinically using dual tasks where participants are required to do two tasks at the same&#xD;
           time. The two tasks can be from the same modality such as walking and carrying a tray,&#xD;
           or from different modalities such as walking combined with a cognitive component such as&#xD;
           counting. Dual task studies have shown that people with HD have reduced attentional&#xD;
           sharing capacity, particularly when the dual task has a cognitive element. As the&#xD;
           ability to complete dual tasks and increasing attentional demand are key skills in&#xD;
           everyday life, deficits in such tasks can severely affect independence, increase the&#xD;
           risk of falls and reduce quality of life. The proposed study will use dual task&#xD;
           performance to assess feasibility, acceptability and to gather preliminary efficacy data&#xD;
           on the effect of cognitive training interventions in people with HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Environmental enrichment has been shown to improve disease symptoms in HD mice and a&#xD;
           retrospective study regarding lifestyle of people with HD suggests that a passive or&#xD;
           sedentary lifestyle, lacking in enriching activities, may contribute to earlier onset of&#xD;
           disease symptoms. There is also preliminary evidence that motor training can produce&#xD;
           functional benefits in HD and accumulating evidence of feasibility and functional&#xD;
           improvements from both in- and out-patient exercise and rehabilitation programmes. Motor&#xD;
           training exercise studies have shown that multi-modal exercise interventions are well&#xD;
           tolerated and associated with improvements in movement, cognition and mood alongside&#xD;
           increases in health related quality of life. Work is now ongoing to develop methods to&#xD;
           support and enhance adherence to home exercise in HD. Furthermore, the investigators now&#xD;
           have preliminary evidence that an intervention with both motor and cognitive components&#xD;
           (a training regimen in which patients' train to drum increasingly complex rhythms to&#xD;
           music) can produce improvements on the symbol digit modalities, a test of executive&#xD;
           function, with accompanying changes on MRI tractography. Brain imaging studies are&#xD;
           hugely important in greater understanding the biological mechanisms which may underpin&#xD;
           any intervention in a neurodegenerative disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Strategies for conducting cognitive training can vary between research studies. Some use&#xD;
           taught exercises or puzzles which participants learn and then repeat. However, the&#xD;
           utilisation of computerised cognitive training strategies provides several advantages&#xD;
           over repeating practical tasks. Computerised cognitive training strategies are automated&#xD;
           and can be completed by participants at their convenience, they provide automated tasks&#xD;
           which require comparatively little movement to complete and provide several objective&#xD;
           outcome measures. Furthermore, the specific HAPPYneuron cognitive training software that&#xD;
           the investigators are using in this study provides an interface for the researcher to&#xD;
           observe the progress of study participants and it can be made available in different&#xD;
           languages to allow for consistent training globally. However, as this is a feasibility&#xD;
           study, the computerised cognitive training intervention will be optimised taking into&#xD;
           account the feedback and views of people with HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Aims The primary aim of this study is to determine if computerised cognitive&#xD;
           training, is feasible and acceptable for people with HD. The researchers will&#xD;
           investigate the familiarity of participants with the computerised cognitive training&#xD;
           programme, its usability and determine key outcome measures for use in cognitive&#xD;
           training studies, before conducting a randomised feasibility study. The randomised&#xD;
           feasibility study will also explore the biological underpinnings of any observed&#xD;
           behavioral changes using MRI scanning, this is an optional component of the study.&#xD;
           During this study, important parameters will be established, which will allow us to&#xD;
           develop the intervention programme for use in a larger patient cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. Specific Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           The objectives of the proposed study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
           (i) investigate the familiarity of participants ad usability of computerised cognitive&#xD;
           training programmes and determine key outcome measures for use in cognitive training&#xD;
           studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (ii) assess the feasibility of delivering a home based computerised cognitive training&#xD;
           programme for people with HD, considering:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The willingness of eligible participants to receive the intervention and&#xD;
                participate in a feasibility study (including the feasibility of randomisation)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Potential barriers to recruitment or completion of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Response rates and adherence to the cognitive training programme (iii) determine&#xD;
                any behavioural changes which may occur during the intervention or comparable&#xD;
                control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (iv) use brain imaging techniques to explore the biological underpinnings of any&#xD;
           observed behavioral change (optional).&#xD;
&#xD;
           (v) evaluate the intervention using participant and family member/carer feedback to&#xD;
           future use in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Design Participants will be recruited from the Cardiff Huntington's disease&#xD;
           Centre. Participants will be asked to complete a range of computer and paper based&#xD;
           cognitive tasks, motor tasks and interviews in their first research visit, which may&#xD;
           coincide with their ENROLL-HD visit. Participants will then be invited back to complete&#xD;
           baseline assessments for the feasibility study within the next 4 weeks. After&#xD;
           randomisation, those allocated to the intervention group will receive the 12-week&#xD;
           home-based cognitive training intervention, supported by home visits and email or&#xD;
           telephone reminders, as preferred. Those allocated to the control group will be asked to&#xD;
           continue as normal although they will also receive home visits. At 6 weeks an optional&#xD;
           MRI scan will be conducted in addition to cognitive tasks. 12 weeks after completing&#xD;
           baseline assessments, participants will be invited back to complete the final outcome&#xD;
           assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participant Selection The Cardiff HD Centre is an Enroll-HD (previously Registry) site&#xD;
           and many patients attending the clinic are enrolled in this study (REC no. 04/WSE05/89).&#xD;
           Patients already enrolled to a global Enroll-HD observational study will be invited to&#xD;
           take part in this study. The progression of symptoms in these Enroll-HD participants are&#xD;
           monitored longitudinally. One of the optional components within the Enroll-HD study is&#xD;
           the giving of permission by participants to be contacted about other additional and&#xD;
           affiliated HD research studies, and for their coded data to be accessed by researchers&#xD;
           conducting HD related research. As such, a full clinical data set including full medical&#xD;
           and medication history will be available for each research participant and this data may&#xD;
           be used during the study. In addition, the investigators would like to gather the views&#xD;
           of family members, friends and carers. Participants will be asked to provide consent so&#xD;
           that the investigators can talk to their family member, friend or carer, who may be&#xD;
           attending research visits with the participant, about their involvement in the study. If&#xD;
           informed consent is obtained, via a participant dated consent form, the family member,&#xD;
           friend or carer will be invited to be interviewed about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Recruitment 5.1. Number of Participants This is an initial proof of principle study;&#xD;
           thus no formal sample size calculations have been completed. The investigators will aim&#xD;
           to recruit 50 participants with a target of randomising 40 participants. The suggested&#xD;
           numbers are based on previous literature regarding cognitive training in other diseases&#xD;
           and considering that MRI is an optional component of the study. The study team have&#xD;
           funds for the MRI scanning of 16 participants during the study, scanning will be&#xD;
           conducted on a first come first served basis and once the funds for scanning are used no&#xD;
           further participants will be able to be scanned. This study is an essential step towards&#xD;
           a larger systematic study of cognitive training and will inform the design and delivery&#xD;
           of such a trial, as well as providing data to inform a power calculation to estimate&#xD;
           sample size in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2. Recruitment Process Potential participants, who have already consented to&#xD;
           participate in ENROLL-HD may be approached during their clinical visits and will be&#xD;
           informed of the study. Potential participants will receive an information sheet about&#xD;
           this study and be will be given sufficient time to ask questions and discuss the study&#xD;
           with the researcher. If required, potential participants can take the information sheets&#xD;
           home and discuss the study with their family and friends. Potential participants who&#xD;
           wish to consent will be reminded that they can change their mind or withdraw without&#xD;
           reason at any time. If the potential participant is willing to proceed with the study,&#xD;
           they will be asked to sign a consent form and the study assessments will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.3. Informed Consent The participant will be allowed as much time as needed to consider&#xD;
           the Participant Information Sheet (PIS) and the opportunity to question the research&#xD;
           team or independent parties to decide whether he/she will participate in the study. All&#xD;
           participants will have the procedures explained in detail, including that the study&#xD;
           design is randomised, that MRI scanning is an optional component and that they can&#xD;
           withdraw at any time. Informed consent will then be obtained by means of participant&#xD;
           dated signature and dated signature of the person who presented and obtained the&#xD;
           informed consent. The original signed form will be retained at the study site. After&#xD;
           informed consent has been received the first study visit will take place. Participants&#xD;
           will be reminded that they can withdraw from the study at any time, without the need to&#xD;
           give a reason and this will not affect their current or future care. Participants will&#xD;
           be asked during the consent process if their family member or carer can be asked their&#xD;
           opinions of cognitive training interventions, this is an optional component of the&#xD;
           consent form. If consent is provided to ask family members, friends or carers that&#xD;
           attend the clinic with the participant, they will be asked to read a separate&#xD;
           information sheet. If they agree to participate, they will be asked to sign a consent&#xD;
           form and they will then be interviewed regarding the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.4. Health Checks/Screening Required for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scanning MRI&#xD;
           scanning is an optional component of the study. Thus, as part of the pre-screening&#xD;
           process, all participants will be screened for contraindications to MRI. In addition,&#xD;
           comprehensive screening for MRI contraindications will be completed immediately before&#xD;
           each MRI scan by the researcher and the MRI operator before the participant is allowed&#xD;
           into the scanning room.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.5. Randomisation Procedures As the study includes an intervention and control group,&#xD;
           randomisation will be performed using a minimisation procedure and programme to ensure&#xD;
           balance between the groups for categorical variables of age and cognitive function.&#xD;
           Minimisation will be performed by the researcher, considering age and cognitive results&#xD;
           of the most recently published global ENROLL-HD study data. Age and cognitive function&#xD;
           will be given the same weighting during the minimisation procedure. Age will be&#xD;
           classified into two categories: 1) &lt; 45 years and 2) &gt; 45 years. The total cognitive&#xD;
           score of the participant in the Categorical Verbal Fluency Test, will be used to&#xD;
           classify participants into two categories. The randomisation procedure will be carefully&#xD;
           explained to all potential research participants and is specifically outlined in both&#xD;
           the PIS and CF. Randomisation will only be performed after the participant has signed&#xD;
           the CF and completed the initial and baseline assessments. Participants allocated to the&#xD;
           control group will be asked to carry on as normal. Once allocated to a group,&#xD;
           participants will receive an allocation letter detailing the group that they have been&#xD;
           randomised to. Unfortunately, due to licencing restrictions those allocated to the&#xD;
           control group will only be able to use the cognitive training software in the first&#xD;
           research visit and during the baseline and outcome assessments of the second and third&#xD;
           research visits. It will be made clear to all potential participants at the end of the&#xD;
           study, they will have to stop using the cognitive training software as their access to&#xD;
           the login system will expire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.1 The 12-week Cognitive Training Intervention The 12-week cognitive training&#xD;
           intervention will be completed in participant homes. The intervention will be supported&#xD;
           by email, text and telephone reminders (as preferred by the participant and detailed in&#xD;
           the Case Report Form) and home visits. Home visits will be conducted for both the active&#xD;
           and control groups. Although additional home visits may be necessary if a participant is&#xD;
           concerned about using the software. During the research visits, for the active group,&#xD;
           the researcher will ensure that the participant is comfortable with the software,&#xD;
           offering support and guidance and a battery of cognitive assessments will be performed.&#xD;
           For the control group during home visits the researcher will complete the cognitive test&#xD;
           battery and talk to the participant about their day. The intervention is designed to be&#xD;
           conducted with minimal supervision and this is something that will be explored during&#xD;
           participant and friend, family member or carer interviews. When completing home visits,&#xD;
           the researcher will comply with the Lone Workers Policy in existence at the Cardiff HD&#xD;
           Centre and will discuss visits with the research team prior to completing them to ensure&#xD;
           that safety is not compromised at any time. Participants will be asked to complete the&#xD;
           training programme provided using HAPPYneuron software for a minimum of 30 minutes 3&#xD;
           times a week for 12 weeks. After the participant completes the 30 minute training&#xD;
           programme they will be free to complete any other of the 'games' available on the&#xD;
           HAPPYneuron computerised cognitive training software. Completion of the cognitive&#xD;
           training programme will be monitored and supported using email or telephone reminders&#xD;
           (as preferred by the participant) and home visits by the researcher. This will allow&#xD;
           patient adherence with the cognitive intervention programme to be monitored and&#xD;
           therefore the feasibility and acceptability of the programme by the participant to be&#xD;
           explored. Each participant will be provided with a unique log in. The software provides&#xD;
           an interface that allows the researcher to track the regularity of use and progress of&#xD;
           all study participants. Therefore, the investigators will be able to remotely determine&#xD;
           how often and for how long participants are using the software and can analyse&#xD;
           participant performance on each cognitive task. Furthermore, the performance of&#xD;
           participants for each specific task, during each cognitive training session is measured&#xD;
           and can be used to determine improvements in specific cognitive tasks, for example in&#xD;
           response accuracy or response time, throughout the study. Participants will be made&#xD;
           aware that the researcher is able to see their training activity throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The cognitive training software the investigators plan to use in this study is easy to&#xD;
           use, is automated, provides non-biased data recording, provides an interface which&#xD;
           allows the researcher to track compliance remotely. It has previously been validated in&#xD;
           both healthy controls and patients with depression, and has shown patient benefit&#xD;
           including improved cognition and functionality. At the end of the study the participant&#xD;
           login details will expire and they will no longer be able to access the cognitive&#xD;
           training software, this is made clear in the PIS. The intervention is designed to be&#xD;
           completed independently, although in this feasibility study, with the agreement of the&#xD;
           participant, the investigators will be specifically exploring the involvement of any&#xD;
           friends, family members of carers using semi-structured interviews at the beginning and&#xD;
           end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.2. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scanning Cardiff University has a world leading&#xD;
           brain imaging research centre (CUBRIC) which provides access to state of the art&#xD;
           research facilities and equipment. Therefore, MRI scanning will be used in this study,&#xD;
           as an optional component, to greater explore the biological effects if any, that the&#xD;
           cognitive training programme may have. Prior to consent, potential participants will be&#xD;
           screened for any contradictions to MRI. Further screening will be conducted prior to any&#xD;
           MRI scanning procedures. MRI scanning is an optional component of the feasibility study,&#xD;
           therefore if participants cannot or do not want to undergo the MRI scanning procedures,&#xD;
           they will still be able to take part in the study. Participants will also be made aware&#xD;
           that they are free to withdraw from the MRI scanning component of the study at any time,&#xD;
           without the need to give a reason and this will not affect the care that they receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If a participant consents to MRI, the MRI scanning procedure will be carefully explained&#xD;
           and discussed with the participant and the participant will have the opportunity to&#xD;
           experience the 'mock' MRI scanner, if they feel this may be helpful. The MRI scan will&#xD;
           be conducted at a research visit 6 weeks into the intervention. An MRI scan will then be&#xD;
           conducted by a fully trained MR Operator with the help of a researcher who is MR safety&#xD;
           trained. The scan will be acquired on a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner with 32 head coils.&#xD;
           The MRI scanning protocol will include scans to assess a structural scan to assess gross&#xD;
           macrostructure, microstructural scans to assess white matter and myelination changes as&#xD;
           well as quantitative fMRI to measure resting cerebral blood flow. The complete scanning&#xD;
           protocol is expected to last no longer than 90 minutes, but will be led by the&#xD;
           participant to ensure that they are comfortable throughout the scanning procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Data Collection For the majority of assessment procedures, data will be collected on&#xD;
           paper data collection forms and the results of the tests subsequently transferred to a&#xD;
           secure online database. The data in the online database will be verified against the&#xD;
           paper form to ensure data integrity. Original data collection sheets will be filed and&#xD;
           stored securely in the TMF.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the semi-structured interviews, questions will be asked orally by the researcher,&#xD;
           audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Although some flexibility may be necessary to&#xD;
           avoid the need for protocol amendments. A list of topics to be included in the interview&#xD;
           schedule for participants and family members, friends or carers who attend the research&#xD;
           visit with the participant include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  How the intervention is perceived/was received?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Expected or perceived impact on daily routine&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Expected or perceived impact on family members/ carers&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Overall expectations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Expected or perceived acceptability (support or help required)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Thoughts and views on the randomisation procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Potential barriers to completing the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  General views or comments on the cognitive training intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Data Analysis As the proposed study is a feasibility study for the use of computerised&#xD;
           cognitive training for people with HD, the study is not formally powered. The primary&#xD;
           aim is that of feasibility, so eligibility, recruitment and acceptability of the study&#xD;
           will all be evaluated. Adherence to the proposed cognitive training intervention and any&#xD;
           adverse effects will also be reported. Therefore, crucial inferences will be made which&#xD;
           will allow an estimation of parameters that can inform definitive and future trials in&#xD;
           this specific patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.1. Statistical Analyses Summary statistics of demographics (age, gender, height and&#xD;
           weight) and disease burden scores will be reported. Descriptive data will include an&#xD;
           evaluation of eligibility, recruitment, retention rates and acceptability of, and&#xD;
           adherence to the intervention, with 95% confidence intervals. The completion of outcome&#xD;
           measures and assessments will also be reported. Graphical illustration will be used to&#xD;
           check distributions of outcome data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Successful adherence to the intervention will be defined as having completed 12 weeks of&#xD;
           the computerised cognitive training for a minimum of 3, 30 minute sessions per week.&#xD;
           This is a feasibility study; thus an estimation of retention rates may be difficult with&#xD;
           such as small sample size. Therefore, it is suggested that if retention rates are&#xD;
           greater than 75%, the investigators will consider this intervention to be feasible. If&#xD;
           the proportion retained is less than this but greater than 65%, the investigators will&#xD;
           consider adjusting the intervention to increase this in future investigations. The&#xD;
           qualitative work will help to establish why retention rates are as they are at the end&#xD;
           of the study. A retention rate lower than this would require substantial changes to the&#xD;
           intervention and therefore would require further piloting and feasibility studies.&#xD;
           Changes in the outcome assessments in will be analyzed using analysis of covariance&#xD;
           (ANCOVA) with the baseline score of that variable in addition to the balancing variables&#xD;
           (age and UHDRS TMS) as covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection will be performed via HAPPYneuron software systems and initially on data&#xD;
           collection forms before transfer to a database. Data completeness will be monitored at&#xD;
           the point of collection; therefore, the investigators do not expect large amounts of&#xD;
           missing data. As it is our intention to inform future confirmatory trials, the&#xD;
           investigators will explore the feasibility of outcomes as applied in this trial and this&#xD;
           population. The investigators will consider internal reliability of all outcome&#xD;
           measures, as some have not been previously used in HD or applied to computerised&#xD;
           cognitive training interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Dissemination The research team are committed to disseminating the research findings to&#xD;
           the general public and patient groups and will seek to present the results at patient&#xD;
           open days, engagement events and outreach activities. Dissemination is a particular&#xD;
           passion of the CI. Furthermore, in order to communicate the research widely, the results&#xD;
           may be disseminated via social media, through newsletters and other patient engagement&#xD;
           outlets in appropriate language and format for the general public to understand. If a&#xD;
           participant indicates that they would like to be informed of the results of the trial a&#xD;
           report of the findings will be sent to them at trial closure. Where results are&#xD;
           presented, they will always be presented in such a way that data from individual&#xD;
           participants cannot be identified. In addition to the significant public and patient&#xD;
           outreach dissemination, the research findings will be written up for publication in a&#xD;
           scientific journal. The results may also be presented at scientific meetings, or in&#xD;
           talks at academic institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Data Storage, Handling, Retention and Confidentiality All data will be stored within a&#xD;
           firewall and password-protected computer system within a swipe-card secured building.&#xD;
           Researchers associated with the study will have confidential access to files, which&#xD;
           allow the matching of recorded data to participants. No data, whether paper or&#xD;
           electronic, will leave Cardiff University sites without being completely anonymised,&#xD;
           i.e., all identifiable data will be removed from the dataset. Any electronic files or&#xD;
           disks will be stored on Cardiff University sites and electronically on Cardiff&#xD;
           University systems. At the conclusion of the study identifiable data will be destroyed&#xD;
           and non-identifiable data will be archived, although it will still be accessible to the&#xD;
           study team. Data will be archived for 15 years, in line with Cardiff University policies&#xD;
           and procedures. Study data may be shared with the organisation funding the study. Where&#xD;
           data leaves Cardiff University it will be strictly anonymised. Anonymised data may be&#xD;
           shared with researchers at other organisations in the UK or overseas and it may be made&#xD;
           publicly available for future research use. In the case of the data generated using&#xD;
           HAPPYneuron systems, this data is captured centrally and stored outside of the Cardiff&#xD;
           University systems and is therefore subject to HAPPYneuron's policies and procedures.&#xD;
           However, a subset of this data will be extracted for use in the study and transferred on&#xD;
           to Cardiff University systems as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All participant identification and referral procedures as well as procedures for data&#xD;
           storage, processing and management will comply with the Data Protection Act 1998. Data&#xD;
           will be kept for 15 years in line with Cardiff University's Research Governance&#xD;
           Framework Regulations for clinical research. This data will be stored confidentially on&#xD;
           password protected servers maintained on the Cardiff University Network. Data will be&#xD;
           stored in locked cabinets and/or on secured computer hard-drives (password protected) in&#xD;
           an access controlled building and will be retained indefinitely. This is in compliance&#xD;
           with the guidelines set by the Cardiff University Research Governance Framework. The&#xD;
           confidentiality of participants will be preserved in accordance with the Data Protection&#xD;
           Act 1998. All participants will be allocated an Enroll-HD unique study number identifier&#xD;
           and in the case of family members, friends or carers, they will be allocated a unique&#xD;
           study number in relation to the participant. All data collected will be held in a linked&#xD;
           anonymised form.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Study Closure Definition The end of study is the date of the last visit of the last&#xD;
           research participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Indemnity Cardiff University will provide indemnity and compensation in the event of a&#xD;
           claim by, or on behalf of participants, for negligent harm as a result of the study&#xD;
           design and/or in respect of the protocol authors/research team. Cardiff University does&#xD;
           not provide compensation for non-negligent harm.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Sponsorship Cardiff University will act as sponsor for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Funding&#xD;
