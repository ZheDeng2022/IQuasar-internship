  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of sleep in patients admitted to the intensive care unit is an emerging field of&#xD;
      research. There have been studies that show patients in the ICU have poor sleep including&#xD;
      sleep fragmentation, multiple arousals, decreased stage 3 sleep and reduced REM sleep (1, 2,&#xD;
      3). Causes of poor sleep in the ICU include severity of illness, abnormal light exposure, and&#xD;
      frequent arousals for medical care. Not only does poor sleep contribute to reduced cognitive&#xD;
      function and delirium, but there are also implications for the immune system function and&#xD;
      wound healing (4). Polysomnography is regarded as the gold standard for sleep studies,&#xD;
      however it has limited utility in the ICU population (5) and alternative methods of sleep&#xD;
      analysis need to be investigated to better understand the underlying physiologic mechanisms&#xD;
      and subsequent cognitive effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The importance of sleep for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) has been well&#xD;
      documented. Research has shown that the ICU has multiple risk factors for poor sleep, and&#xD;
      that this has multiple effects on patient outcomes. Further research is needed to better&#xD;
      define the best tool to use for measuring sleep stages in ICU patients. Furthermore, there is&#xD;
      very limited data comparing sleep interruption in ICU patients and the effects on sleep&#xD;
      architecture and cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a: The number of episodes of rapid eye movements (REM), stage 1, stage 2, stage 3&#xD;
      sleep, sleep spindles, and alpha activity will increase while the total duration of activity&#xD;
      and the duration of episodes will decline in the postoperative neurologic critical care unit&#xD;
      (NCCU) with neurological checks every two hours over a 12 hour period of recording as&#xD;
      compared to every 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b: As the number of episodes of REM, stage 1, stage 2, stage 3 sleep, sleep&#xD;
      spindles, and alpha activity increase while the total duration of activity and the duration&#xD;
      of episodes decline in the postoperative NCCU with neurological checks every two hours over a&#xD;
      12 hour period of recording as compared to every 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: The number of episodes, the total duration, and the interval durations, of REM,&#xD;
      stage 1, stage 2, stage 3 sleep, sleep spindles, and alpha activity will be identical in the&#xD;
      automated recordings as compared to human reading by a sleep trained Neurologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: The group with awakenings every two hours will report more objective sleepiness&#xD;
      and perform psychomotor visual task (PVT) with increased time and reduced performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performing this study will allow for validation of an automated EEG system for the&#xD;
      interpretation of sleep. If this tool is a reliable method of sleep interpretation, it may be&#xD;
      expanded to a larger population of ICU patients for further research on the effects of sleep&#xD;
      deprivation. Additionally, it will add prospective data to the literature regarding the&#xD;
      psychomotor effects of increased sleep interruption in ICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Detect the effects of disrupted sleep resulting from frequent neurological exams in the&#xD;
           NCCU in post-surgical patients. The investigators will use an automated EEG detection&#xD;
           system used in patients with continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring to detect duration of&#xD;
           sleep related EEG brain activity, number of intervals of activation, and the duration of&#xD;
           the intervals for sleep activities including: REM, Stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 sleep,&#xD;
           sleep spindles, and alpha activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators will study the precision, accuracy and bias of the automated algorithm&#xD;
           by comparing it to the interpretations of two sleep trained neurologists who will read&#xD;
           these recordings in a&#xD;
&#xD;
           blinded manner independently of one another. The investigators will select records to&#xD;
           validate the automatic scorer including the identification and duration of all aspects&#xD;
           of the cEEG sleep recording during the first four hours of sleep recording for each&#xD;
           patient. The investigators will compare the accuracy of identification and measured&#xD;
           duration of REM, Stage one, stage two, stage 3 sleep, sleep spindles, and alpha&#xD;
           activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjective measure of sleep assessment using the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire&#xD;
           (RCSG).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quantitative assessment of alertness using a psychomotor vigilance task (PVT).&#xD;
