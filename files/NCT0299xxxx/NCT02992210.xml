  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with refractory and/or recurrent solid tumor have poor prognosis despite complex&#xD;
      multimodel therapy and therefore, novel approaches are urgently needed. The investigators are&#xD;
      attempt to treat these diseases using T cells genetically modified with a 4th generation&#xD;
      lentiviral chimeric antigen receptor (4SCAR fused with an inducible apoptotic caspase 9&#xD;
      domain) targeting GD2 (4SCAR-GD2). The 4SCAR-GD2-modified T cells can recognize and kill&#xD;
      tumor cells through the recognition of GD2, a surface protein expressed at high levels on&#xD;
      many types of tumors but not on normal tissues. This study will evaluate the side effects and&#xD;
      effective doses of 4SCAR-GD2 T cells in treating refractory and/or recurrent tumors.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with refractory and/or recurrent solid tumors have poor prognosis despite complex&#xD;
      multimodal therapy; therefore, novel curative approaches are needed. The investigators are&#xD;
      attempting to use T cells obtained directly from the patient, which can be genetically&#xD;
      modified to express a 4th generation GD2-specific chimeric antigen receptor (4SCAR-GD2). The&#xD;
      chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) molecules enable the T cells to recognize and kill tumor&#xD;
      cells through the recognition of a surface antigen, GD2, which is expressed at high levels on&#xD;
      tumor cells but not at significant levels on normal tissues. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      side effects and the best dose of a novel 4th generation anti-GD2 CAR T cells to refractory&#xD;
      and/or recurrent solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened through physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
      samples will be collected. Imaging studies or bone marrow aspirates may be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be obtained by apheresis, and T cells will be&#xD;
      activated and modified to express the 4SCAR-GD2 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -5 to -7, PBMC will be activated and enriched for T cells, which will be followed by&#xD;
      4SCAR-GD2 lentiviral transduction. The total culture time is approximately 5-7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a preparative conditioning regimen comprising&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide/fludarabine to prepare their immune system to accept the modified CAR T&#xD;
      cells.The preparative regimen will be based on patient immune condition and consistent with&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy conditioning regimen.&#xD;
