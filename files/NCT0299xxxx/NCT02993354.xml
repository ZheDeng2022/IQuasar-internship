  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EUM (electrical uterine myography) (OB Tools, Israel) was tested and found to be reliable&#xD;
      as a non-invasive method for evaluating uterine contractions and the fetal heart rate. It is&#xD;
      safe and effective in monitoring uterine contractions. The investigators propose to perform a&#xD;
      series of studies to validate the accuracy and clinical usefulness of the EUM device by&#xD;
      simultaneously monitoring patients with current methods (with either external or internal&#xD;
      devices) as clinically indicated and with the EUM device. Providers will be blinded to the&#xD;
      results of the EUM device. The investigators will continue care as per current guidelines&#xD;
      using the information obtained from the current monitoring methods. Information obtained from&#xD;
      the EUM devices will not be used to determine the clinical course of action.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to perform a study to validate the accuracy and clinical usefulness&#xD;
      of the EUM device by comparing it with simultaneous use of current methods (both external or&#xD;
      internal devices) among obese patients and patients with normal body mass indexes (BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the contractions obtained using the EUM device vs. those obtained using the&#xD;
           intrauterine pressure catheter vs. those obtained from external tocodynamometer among&#xD;
           current obese patients (BMI greater than 30 kg/m2) and nonobese patients using&#xD;
           simultaneously obtained, 30 minute tracings with regards to the frequency of&#xD;
           contractions, the duration of contractions, maximum height of the contractions, the&#xD;
           total Montevideo units recorded, the timing of the contractions, and the amount of&#xD;
           discontinuous tracings from the devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the fetal heart rate tracing obtained via the EUM device vs. external fetal&#xD;
           Doppler vs. fetal scalp electrode (simultaneously obtained, 30 minute tracings will be&#xD;
           compared) among obese patients and nonobese patients with regards to the amount of&#xD;
           discontinuous/unterinterpetable tracing, average fetal heart rate, baseline heart rate,&#xD;
           the number accelerations, the number of decelerations, the timing of the accelerations,&#xD;
           the timing of decelerations, the maximum fetal heart rate achieved during acceleration,&#xD;
           the lowest fetal heart rate achieved during deceleration, and compare the degree of&#xD;
           variability in the tracing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare tracings of productive vs. non-productive contractions in patients presenting to&#xD;
           triage to rule out labor (30 minutes of simultaneously obtained tracings of external&#xD;
           tocodynamometer and EUM device will be compared) with regards to the frequency of&#xD;
           contractions, the duration of contractions, maximum height of contractions, the timing&#xD;
           of the contractions and the amount of discontinuous tracings from both devices, as well&#xD;
           as changes in cervical exam on the basis of body mass index.&#xD;
