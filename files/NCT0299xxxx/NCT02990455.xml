  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will investigate whether smokers with vs. without current at-risk&#xD;
      alcohol drinking (ARD) respond to reduced nicotine cigarettes by increasing their alcohol&#xD;
      consumption or smoke exposure, thereby diminishing the hypothesized public health benefit of&#xD;
      these new products.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current proposal examines response to two RNCs, one with low nicotine content (RNC Low;&#xD;
      0.03mg) and one with moderate nicotine content (RNC Moderate; 0.8mg) in daily smokers with&#xD;
      and without ARD. Participants (N = 70) will attend a total of five visits to the laboratory.&#xD;
      The first visit will be to classify participants as either ARD (n = 35) or Non ARD (n = 35)&#xD;
      and gather baseline data. Participants will be assigned to undergo two experimental&#xD;
      conditions (i.e., exclusive smoking of RNC Low or Moderate in their home environment for 7&#xD;
      days) in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. The two experimental conditions will&#xD;
      be separated by a 7-day period of return to smoking of participants' own brand of cigarette.&#xD;
      On the first and last day of each of the two experimental conditions, participants will smoke&#xD;
      the assigned RNC in the laboratory, and data on toxicant exposure (i.e., boost in exhaled&#xD;
      carbon monoxide and plasma nicotine and cotinine; solanesol from smoked cigarette butts),&#xD;
      subjective acceptability (i.e., subjective response; risk perceptions; relative reinforcing&#xD;
      efficacy); and smoking compensation (i.e., smoking topography measures) related to the smoked&#xD;
      RNC will be collected. During each 7-day period of exposure to the RNCs, participants will&#xD;
      provide daily data on alcohol and nicotine use, nicotine withdrawal, smoking urge, and&#xD;
      alcohol urge via telephone-based Interactive Voice Response technology. The strength of our&#xD;
      study design is that we can evaluate both between-group (i.e., ARD vs. Non ARD) and&#xD;
      within-person (i.e., RNC Low vs. Moderate) differences in response to RNCs and, furthermore,&#xD;
      can examine whether increased nicotine withdrawal, smoking urge, and alcohol urge mediate the&#xD;
      relation between decreased nicotine exposure and alcohol consumption. Results from this study&#xD;
      will show what mechanisms underlying drinking and smoking may need to be addressed in future&#xD;
      integrated interventions for both problems and will immediately inform the practical&#xD;
      implementation of market-wide reductions in cigarette nicotine content among smokers with&#xD;
      ARD.&#xD;
