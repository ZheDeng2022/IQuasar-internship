  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality post solid organ transplantation.&#xD;
      While mortality from the other leading causes of death post-transplantation (e.g.&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and infection) is declining, mortality from cancer&#xD;
      post-transplantation is increasing. This is due to both general and transplant-specific risk&#xD;
      factors that combine to increase risk for cancer compared to the general population. However,&#xD;
      there is a shortage of research exploring cancer epidemiology post solid organ&#xD;
      transplantation in the UK. This is essential to guide clinicians and for counselling patients&#xD;
      regarding expectations and outcomes after developing cancer post-transplantation. This is&#xD;
      especially important as the aetiology, pathophysiology and outcomes of cancer&#xD;
      post-transplantation may differ from the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available data registries in the UK separately contain valuable cancer and&#xD;
      transplant-specific data that can be combined to explore cancer epidemiology&#xD;
      post-transplantation more comprehensively, which can be directly translated into patient&#xD;
      benefit by utilizing transplant-specific data (rather than translating from general&#xD;
      population or non-UK patient demographics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to combine existing data resources to link up the complete&#xD;
      patient journey for solid organ transplant recipients nationally and focus on the entire&#xD;
      spectrum of cancer from incidence to mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Solid organ transplantation is associated with an increased incidence of cancer versus the&#xD;
      general population, and broadly on par with comparable immune deficiency states such as&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS. The aetiology of cancer post-transplantation is primarily due to the burden of&#xD;
      immunosuppression that is compulsory for all transplant patients to prevent allograft&#xD;
      rejection. Skewed standardised incidence ratios are observed for cancer post-transplantation&#xD;
      compared to the general population, with preponderance for cancers with a strong viral&#xD;
      component. The literature on cancer-related mortality after transplantation is scarce, but&#xD;
      again disparate mortality risk has been documented comparing solid organ transplant&#xD;
      recipients to the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a shortage of UK-specific data to guide transplant clinicians on how best to deal&#xD;
      with cancer. This is important as countries differ with regards to ethnic demographics and&#xD;
      post-transplant immunosuppression protocols, both of which are important confounders to&#xD;
      translate data from other transplant cohorts. Collett and colleagues have previously&#xD;
      published registry data of cancer incidence in British transplant recipients (by linking UK&#xD;
      Transplant Registry to various national cancer registries) for a cohort transplanted between&#xD;
      1980 and 2007. They found similarities but also important differences between cancer&#xD;
      incidence in a British solid organ recipient cohort versus registry data from Sweden,&#xD;
      Finland, Canada and the United States. Importantly, the relevance of this data to the&#xD;
      contemporary solid organ transplant cohort is unclear, as immunosuppression protocols have&#xD;
      evolved since 2007 to a predominantly tacrolimus-based regimen since publication of the&#xD;
      SYMPHONY study in 2007. No subsequent analysis has been done to determine the impact of&#xD;
      tacrolimus introduction into cancer occurrence post-transplantation in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous work has analysed cancer-related mortality in the UK, providing data on site of&#xD;
      cancer-related mortality and stratifying analysis along demographic factors such as age,&#xD;
      gender and/or ethnicity that are relevant to the British population. This analysis linked two&#xD;
      different national data resources from the study by Collett and colleagues - Hospital Episode&#xD;
      Statistics and the Office for National Statistics. It demonstrated the crude cancer-related&#xD;
      mortality rate in England (between 2001 and 2012) was 361 cancer-related deaths per 100,000&#xD;
      person years (compared to 424 and 416 for cardiovascular- and infection-related deaths&#xD;
      respectively). Of note, cancer-related mortality within the first year post kidney&#xD;
      transplantation (7.4%) has been shown to rise in incidence with increasing time&#xD;
      post-transplantation (22.0% beyond the first year post kidney transplantation and second&#xD;
      leading cause of death).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This previous work has identified the strengths and limitations of utilising such data&#xD;
      resources. One of the major limitations with registry data is the absence of important and&#xD;
      relevant information that can confound the data, which can be overcome by linking data&#xD;
      between registries. For example, previous analyses identified kidney cancer accounted for&#xD;
      over half of all cancer-related mortality for kidney transplant recipients with a history of&#xD;
      pre-transplant cancer. However, the limitation of that data was the inability to probe this&#xD;
      association further for a number of important issues; 1) location of kidney cancer (whether&#xD;
      native or transplant kidney), 2) whether pre-transplant cancer was kidney-related, and 3)&#xD;
      time on dialysis pre-transplant (which is a strong risk factor for acquired cystic renal&#xD;
      disease and malignant transformation). While this information was unavailable in isolated&#xD;
      data sets, such information is contained within other national data resources and could be&#xD;
      combined by data linkage to create a broad and comprehensive epidemiological resource.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data or record linkage has been defined as &quot;a process of pairing records from two files and&#xD;
      trying to select the pairs that belong to the same entity.&quot; Cancer data is not routinely&#xD;
      collated by transplant centers and there is no robust mechanism to explore cancer&#xD;
      epidemiology data post solid organ transplantation through the UK Transplant Registry.&#xD;
      However, linking information to other existing data registry resources will facilitate such&#xD;
      analysis. This is an under-researched area within both transplant and cancer communities, but&#xD;
      increasingly important due to the increasing incidence and prevalence of cancer post solid&#xD;
      organ transplantation.&#xD;
