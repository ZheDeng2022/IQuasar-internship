  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 parts: Dose Escalation phase (Part A) and Expansion phase (Part B).&#xD;
      The dose escalation phase will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of avelumab in&#xD;
      combination with M9241 in subjects with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic solid&#xD;
      tumors. Expansion phase will assess the safety and clinical activity of the combination&#xD;
      regimen in selected tumor types. In Expansion phase subjects who have completed the&#xD;
      combination treatment of avelumab at a given dose level of M9241, a safety review will be&#xD;
      performed by the Safety monitoring committee in order to make a decision on the next dose&#xD;
      level. Successive cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects will be treated with escalating doses of M9241&#xD;
      with avelumab intravenous (IV).&#xD;

             sterile or sexually inactive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Highly effective contraception (ie, methods with a failure rate of less than 1% per&#xD;

             at least 50 days after stopping study treatment for both men and women if risk of&#xD;
             conception exists. The effects of avelumab and M9241 on developing human fetus are&#xD;
             unknown; thus, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use highly&#xD;
             effective contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Part B:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of a fresh tumor biopsy is mandatory for eligibility in the RCC cohort.&#xD;
             The biopsy or surgical specimen should be collected within 28 days prior to the first&#xD;
             IMP administration. If a subject has 2 separate biopsy attempts in which usable tissue&#xD;
             is not obtained, enrollment may be possible after discussion with the Medical Monitor.&#xD;
             For other expansion cohorts, availability of either tumor archival material (&lt; 6&#xD;
             months old) or fresh biopsies (obtained within 28 days) is acceptable with one of&#xD;
             these being mandatory. For formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, either block or&#xD;
             sections (&gt; 15) may be provided. Tumor biopsies and tumor archival material must be&#xD;
             suitable for biomarker assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Locally advanced or metastatic UC that has progressed during or after at least one&#xD;

             transitional cell carcinoma of urothelium(including renal pelvis, ureters, urinary&#xD;
             bladder, and urethra). Subjects must have progressed during or after treatment with at&#xD;
             least 1 platinum-containing regimen for inoperable locally advanced or metastatic UC&#xD;
             or disease recurrence. Subjects who received prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
             and progressed within 12 months of treatment with a platinum-containing regimen will&#xD;
             be considered as second line. Subjects with mixed histologies are required to have a&#xD;
             dominant transitional cell pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), first-line metastatic: Stage IV (per seventh&#xD;
             International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer classification) histologically&#xD;

             disease. Subjects could have received adjuvant chemotherapy or loco-regional treatment&#xD;
             that included chemotherapy for locally advanced disease, as long as disease recurrence&#xD;
             occurred at least 6 months after the completion of the last administration of&#xD;
             chemotherapy. Only epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma&#xD;
             kinase (ALK) wild-type are allowed (ie, EGFR mutation and ALK translocation / re&#xD;
             arrangement excluded). Non squamous cell histologies and never / former light smoker&#xD;
             (&lt; 15 pack years) squamous cell carcinoma subjects (per local standard of care)&#xD;
             require testing if status is unknown. Subjects must have low tumor PD-L1 expression&#xD;
             defined as &lt; 50% tumor proportion score determined using PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx test&#xD;
             or an equivalent Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- approved PD-L1 test. Availability&#xD;
             of either tumor archival material or fresh biopsies within 28 days is acceptable with&#xD;
             one of these being mandatory. For FFPE samples, either block or sections (&gt; 15) may be&#xD;
             provided. Tumor biopsies and tumor archival material must be suitable for biomarker&#xD;
             assessment. This cohort will not be opened for enrollment in Belgium, Czech Republic,&#xD;
             France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Colorectal cancer (CRC): Histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent or&#xD;

             International Union Against Cancer Tumor Node Metastasis [TNM] Staging System seventh&#xD;
             edition) after failure of prior therapy containing oxaliplatin / fluoropyrimidine and&#xD;
             / or irinotecan / fluoropyrimidine and, if eligible, cetuximab (Erbitux®) and&#xD;
             bevacizumab (Avastin®). Only subjects with microsatellite instability (MSI)-low or&#xD;
             microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic CRC are eligible. Subjects without existing MSI&#xD;
             test results will have MSI status performed locally by a Clinical Laboratory&#xD;
             Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified IHC or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based&#xD;
             test (PCR based MSI test is preferred). Subjects must be willing to undergo an&#xD;
             on-treatment biopsy procedure. Availability of either tumor archival material or fresh&#xD;
             biopsies within 28 days is acceptable with one of these being mandatory. For FFPE&#xD;
             samples, either block or sections (&gt; 15) may be provided. Tumor biopsies and tumor&#xD;
             archival material must be suitable for biomarker assessment. For Belgium, Czech&#xD;
             Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom,&#xD;
             subjects in the second-line setting should have exhausted or be considered ineligible&#xD;

             chemotherapy options.&#xD;
&#xD;

             overall response of stable disease (SD) for ≥ 6 months following start of therapy with&#xD;
             any antibody / drug targeting T cell co-regulatory proteins (immune checkpoints) such&#xD;
             as anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anticytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) for&#xD;
             advanced or metastatic disease (either as monotherapy or combination therapy, in any&#xD;
             line). Fresh tumor biopsy is required for enrollment. If a subject has 2 separate&#xD;
             biopsy attempts in which usable tissue is not obtained, enrollment may be possible&#xD;
             after discussion with Medical Monitor. Subjects must be willing to undergo an&#xD;
             on-treatment biopsy procedure. In France, in addition to having received checkpoint&#xD;
             inhibitor therapy, subjects should have already received recommended local-standard&#xD;
             therapy per discretion of the Investigator.&#xD;
