      The primary objective of this study is to determine the normative range of brain volume and&#xD;
      brain volume change in healthy control (HC) participants whose age, race, and gender&#xD;
      distribution is approximately matched to the age, race, and gender distribution of patients&#xD;
      with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) enrolled in Study 888MS001. The secondary objective is to use&#xD;
      the results of the primary endpoint to ensure consistency of brain volume measurements across&#xD;
      MS PATHS centers.&#xD;

        Healthy control (HC) participants enrolled at each institution will be carefully selected&#xD;
        to result in a group whose age, race, and gender distribution is approximately matched to&#xD;
        the age, race, and gender distribution of patients with MS enrolled in MS PATHS at that&#xD;
        center. Patients enrolled in MS PATHS at each center will be encouraged to enlist a friend&#xD;
        or family member to participate in the study as an HC. Subsequently, on approximately&#xD;
        quarterly review of participant participation, particular demographic groups will be&#xD;
        targeted for recruitment, if needed, in order for the age, race, and gender distribution of&#xD;
        a center's HC sample to be similar to their MS PATHS participant sample (within the study&#xD;
        age range).&#xD;
