  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Damage to teeth from decay or previous old silver fillings can be repaired with&#xD;
      tooth-coloured filling materials that stick to the tooth. These materials have been around&#xD;
      for some years and have become more sophisticated; with greater ease of placement by the&#xD;
      dentist and better durability for the patient. The fillings are designed to be used in&#xD;
      combination with a specific glue (adhesive) that is designed to stick to the different parts&#xD;
      of the tooth to provide a good seal, the outer enamel and the inner dentine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the performance of a state-of-the-art modern tooth coloured filling&#xD;
      material (Ceram X) in combination with an existing adhesive (control adhesive) and a new&#xD;
      adhesive (Prime &amp; Bond Universal) used in two different techniques; both of which are known&#xD;
      to work but one is easier to apply. This results in three treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of the study, the test material Prime&amp;Bond Universal is CE-marked, as are all&#xD;
      other medical devices used. Thus, this study is not conducted to meet any regulatory&#xD;
      requirements. The rationale of this study is the extension of knowledge primarily concerning&#xD;
      the clinical performance of Prime&amp;Bond Universal in molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two investigators (to be confirmed) will place a minimum of 25 restorations per group (75&#xD;
      restorations in total) to assess the performance of the materials in a comparative design.&#xD;
      The study restorations will be monitored for a period of 18 months (with the option to extend&#xD;
      the evaluation period to 48 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After placement of restorations under controlled clinical conditions, the primary objective&#xD;
      of the study is the determination of post-operative sensitivity and pulp vitality, marginal&#xD;
      adaptation and staining of margins of the restorations. In addition, fracture of material and&#xD;
      retention, recurrent caries, occlusal contour and wear, approximal anatomical form will be&#xD;
      determined as well as the failure rate as defined by the ADA.&#xD;
