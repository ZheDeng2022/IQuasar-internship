  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine the efficacy of the immunotherapy with MVX-ONCO-1&#xD;
      in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. MVX-ONCO-1 consists of dead&#xD;
      tumor cells from the patient itself and genetically modified cells within a capsule. The&#xD;
      whole treatment takes 9 weeks. At weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8, the tumor cells are injected&#xD;
      underneath the skin and two capsules are implanted for a week. At weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9&#xD;
      the capsules are removed again. The patients are then followed-up for 5 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced HNSCC after platinum-based palliative chemotherapy have a poor&#xD;
      prognosis, with no well-defined standard treatment and a survival between 6 to 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MVX-ONCO-1 is a patient specific, cell-based, active immunotherapy, where the patient's&#xD;
      immune response to tumor cells is stimulated and/or increased by triggering an immune&#xD;
      response against the patients' cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for this trial is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. HNSCC: there is a clear medical need in this patient population,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Relapsing HNSCC often have accessible tumor tissue,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. HNSCC is considered an immunogenic tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase II study is a first step towards a potentially innovative immunotherapy for HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MVX-ONCO-1 is composed of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An immune-modulator (GM-CSF: granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor) released&#xD;
           from an immuno-protected, encapsulated, allogeneic, genetically modified cell line&#xD;
           (MVX-1), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Irradiated, autologous tumor cells as source of antigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each treatment consists of two macrocapsules containing the MVX-1 cell line implanted&#xD;
      subcutaneously and lethally irradiated autologous tumor cells injected subcutaneously.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive a treatment once weekly starting on week 1 for 4 weeks&#xD;
      followed by two additional treatments 2 weeks apart (total 6 treatments over 8 weeks). Each&#xD;
      pair of macrocapsules is removed after 1 week, and the last implanted capsules are removed in&#xD;
      week 9. The patients are then followed-up for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and&#xD;
      innovation programme under grant agreement No 880194.&#xD;
