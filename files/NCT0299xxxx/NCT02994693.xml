  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to determine the natural history of Barrett's esophagus (BE)&#xD;
      using tethered capsule endomicroscopy (TCE) in patients undergoing surveillance endoscopy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MGH will be the first site in the multi-center study to begin enrolling. At the MGH 100&#xD;
      subjects with a previous diagnosis of Barrett's Esophagus (BE) will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will undergo a minimum of 2 esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGD), one around the&#xD;
      time of inclusion into the study and one at the end of the study, and 4 TCE imaging sessions&#xD;
      (baseline, 1-year, 2-years and at the end of the 3-years follow-up). If it is determined by&#xD;
      the treating physician that additional EGDs are needed, for extended follow-up or treatment,&#xD;
      capsule imaging will be performed whenever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have received written information prior to the day of the capsule procedure and&#xD;
      patients will have another chance to discuss the procedure with the study coordinator and&#xD;
      clinical study staff during the consent process prior to the capsule procedure. Participation&#xD;
      in this study is completely voluntary, and the patient can stop the procedure at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each of the imaged patients, inclusion criteria and clinical characteristics such as age,&#xD;
      sex, body mass index (BMI), current medication regimen, smoking history and GI related&#xD;
      history will be recorded in the clinical form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be seated and asked to sip water to facilitate swallowing the capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device will be operated by experienced study staff trained in the procedure such as a&#xD;
      registered nurse or one of the endoscopist co-investigators in this study. Emergency phone&#xD;
      and/or pager contact of the collaborating GI clinician(s) will be provided. They will also be&#xD;
      accessible during the procedure if any problems are encountered that require their expertise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging will be performed in the same manner as in our other current IRB approved tethered&#xD;
      capsule endomicroscopy studies. The capsule position will be controlled manually via the&#xD;
      tether outside of the subject's mouth by the catheter operator. Recorded real-time&#xD;
      cross-sectional images displayed on the monitor and distance marks on the tether will be used&#xD;
      for confirmation of capsule position in the esophagus. Images will be viewed in real time to&#xD;
      determine when the capsule has reached the stomach. The resistance of the tether can also&#xD;
      give information of the cardia position. Once in the stomach, the capsule will be gradually&#xD;
      pulled back up through the esophagus to the mouth, also while imaging. The capsule may be&#xD;
      repositioned for imaging up to 4 times up and 4 times down the esophagus. The subject may be&#xD;
      asked to swallow a different size capsule (ranging from 5-12.8 mm in diameter and 20-30 cm in&#xD;
      length) to obtain the best distal esophageal images. It is expected that the maximum&#xD;
      experimental time including swallowing the capsule, the imaging procedure, and removal of the&#xD;
      capsule will take approximately 10 minutes in total.&#xD;
