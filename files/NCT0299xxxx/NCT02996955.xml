  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is worldwide a common musculoskeletal condition with a high number of&#xD;
      recurrences. Recurrence rate and the number of recurrences could be reduced and time to a&#xD;
      next episode could be prolonged by advising an active lifestyle. Advising regular physical&#xD;
      activity is the mainstay in physical therapy treatment. This includes an appeal to patients&#xD;
      to adhere to an activity advice. Patient adherence to an activity advice is poor. In this&#xD;
      study an intervention consisting of treatment of illness perceptions with or without&#xD;
      organizing social support to increase adherence to an activity advice will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether social support by a partner or&#xD;
      friend and treatment of patients' illness perceptions influences the rate of adherence to an&#xD;
      activity advice compared to treatment of patients' illness perceptions alone in patients&#xD;
      suffering non-specific low back pain. Secondary objectives are; a) whether 'treatment of&#xD;
      illness perceptions' changes patients' maladaptive illness perceptions into realistic ones,&#xD;
      b) whether maladaptive illness perceptions, comorbidity and/or overweighed/obesity and/or&#xD;
      rate of recurrences of non-specific low back pain and/or attitude and intention to physical&#xD;
      activity influences patient's adherence .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multi-centre randomized two-arm controlled clinical trial. Patients ≥18 years&#xD;
      presenting with at least a second episode of non-specific low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention and control group will be asked to perform a physical activity&#xD;
      advice. During two physiotherapy treatment sessions treatment of illness perceptions is&#xD;
      performed in both groups. In the intervention group organizing social support by a partner or&#xD;
      friend is added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-five percent absolute improvement of walking and/or cycling according the NNGB in the&#xD;
      intervention group is clinically relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During four appointments several questionnaires have to be filled in and during two&#xD;
      physiotherapy treatment sessions half an hour treatment of illness perceptions will be&#xD;
      performed. Social support by a partner or friend will be organized during the same&#xD;
      physiotherapy treatment sessions in the intervention group. During three separate weeks&#xD;
      patients have to wear an activity monitor. Patients will be treated according to the Dutch&#xD;
      Low Back Pain guideline; no adverse effects will be expected.&#xD;

      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether social support by a partner or&#xD;
      friend and treatment of patients' illness perceptions influences the rate of adherence to an&#xD;
      activity advice compared to treatment of patients' illness perceptions alone in patients&#xD;
      suffering non-specific low back pain. Secondary objectives are; 1) Whether 'treatment of&#xD;
      illness perceptions' changes patients' maladaptive illness perceptions into realistic ones,&#xD;
      2) Whether maladaptive illness perceptions, comorbidity and/or obesity and/or rate of&#xD;
      recurrences of non-specific low back pain and/or attitude and intention to physical activity&#xD;
      influences patient's adherence to an activity advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multicentre randomized two arm, controlled clinical trial. During a&#xD;
      twelve-week intervention period, one group of patients will receive an activity advice added&#xD;
      to usual treatment including 'treatment of illness perceptions' (C-group). The other group&#xD;
      will receive an activity advice and the intervention addressing social support by a partner&#xD;
      or friend added to usual treatment including 'treatment of illness perceptions'&#xD;
      (SoSup-group). Patients will be assessed at baseline, and after one, 6 and 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Recruitment is scheduled from October 2016 to July 2017. The study will be performed in 12&#xD;
      centres for physiotherapy in the province Zuid-Holland, the Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is mentioned that individuals with recurrent non-specific low back pain score more&#xD;
      unfavourable on lifestyle risk factors including physical inactivity than individuals without&#xD;
      or first time non-specific low back pain (van Oostrom et al., 2012). To include potential&#xD;
      physically inactive non-specific low back pain sufferers, patients ≥18 years presenting with&#xD;
      at least a second episode of non-specific low back pain who are not physical active in&#xD;
      accordance with the NNGB are recruited for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both the C- and SoSup-group an activity advice will be added to usual treatment. The&#xD;
      advised activities will be walking and/or cycling outdoors, meeting the Dutch Standard&#xD;
      Healthy Physical Activity (NNGB) (Hildebrandt et al., 2007). In both groups cognitive&#xD;
      treatment on illness perceptions according to the common sense model to the patient in the&#xD;
      presence of the partner or friend will be given. During a maximum of two half-hour contacts&#xD;
      in a standardised dialogue on maladaptive beliefs and feelings about identity, time-line,&#xD;
      causes, controllability, and curability of low back pain are mapped, maladaptive perceptions&#xD;
      are challenged, alternative perceptions are formulated (Siemonsma et al., 2013). The&#xD;
      intervention in the SoSup-group (intervention group), organizing social support by a partner&#xD;
      or friend depending on patient's preferences, will be added. During a maximum of two&#xD;
      half-hour contacts (one for explanation and one for evaluation), in a standardised discussion&#xD;
      the partner or friend will be stimulated to support the patient in executing the activity&#xD;
      advice. During 12 weeks the social support by a partner or friend will be executed for at&#xD;
      least 5 times a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be walking and/or cycling according to the NNGB and social&#xD;
      support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secundary study parameters/outcome of the study (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other outcomes will be 1. measures of illness perceptions. 2. measures of comorbidity, BMI,&#xD;
      number of recurrences of non-specific low back pain, measures of attitude and intention to&#xD;
      physical activity 3. measures of refusal of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The social support described in this study is designed for better outcomes of physical&#xD;
      activity levels patients suffering low back pain, and has no proven advantage on better&#xD;
      outcomes on pain and disability in non-specific low back pain sufferers. Therefore we&#xD;
      consider there is no disadvantage in the SoSup-group versus the C-group because patients in&#xD;
      both groups receive concomitant best evidence healthcare according to the Dutch guideline for&#xD;
      low back pain (Staal et al., 2013). No adverse effects of the interventions are expected.&#xD;
      There are no ethical implications to be expected as a result of this study, treatment of all&#xD;
      patients during the intervention period will be according to the Dutch guideline for low back&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
