  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proof of concept, pilot study is to determine whether the unique&#xD;
      combination of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-receptor antagonist, Maraviroc, and&#xD;
      the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, Sirolimus, in HIV-infected kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients has an impact on chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) density, the&#xD;
      HIV-reservoir, or rejection of the transplanted kidney. 15 HIV-infected kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients will be recruited and their immunosuppressant regimen will be changed to include&#xD;
      an mTOR inhibitor (such as Sirolimus) unless they are already on one. In addition, Maraviroc&#xD;
      will be added to their HIV regimen, unless they are already on Maraviroc. Blood will be taken&#xD;
      to measure markers of the HIV reservoir, their CCR5 density and expression, and immune&#xD;
      activation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a pilot, prospective, single-center, open-label, non-randomized,&#xD;
      non-controlled clinical trial. 15 HIV-infected kidney transplant recipients will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the study. Recruitment will be conducted through the renal transplant and infectious&#xD;
      diseases outpatient clinics at the University of Maryland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include patients with stable glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) &gt;25 with&#xD;
      suppressed HIV with CD4 counts &gt;200. These patients will be recruited from the University of&#xD;
      Maryland's transplant nephrology and infectious diseases clinics. The transplant nephrology&#xD;
      clinic is a multidisciplinary clinic that incorporates nephrologists, pharmacists to aid in&#xD;
      medication management, and coordinators to assist the patients in coordination of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be screened either at the Institute of Human Virology (IHV) Clinical&#xD;
      Research Unit or in the transplant nephrology or infectious disease clinics. At this visit,&#xD;
      all patients will sign an informed consent as approved by our institutional review board&#xD;
      (IRB), have a history and physical examination, and have screening clinical and research labs&#xD;
      drawn. Additional requirements will be Trofile testing prior to enrollment. Eligibility will&#xD;
      be determined based upon these results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drugs will be prescribed (if the patient is not already taking them) starting on day 0&#xD;
      after an interval history and physical examination is performed and safety labs (and&#xD;
      pregnancy tests for women of childbearing potential) are checked. The medications will be&#xD;
      filled by the patient's pharmacy, using their insurance as these are both Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) approved drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be initially monitored weekly for sirolimus levels and renal function, until&#xD;
      their sirolimus is at the pre-determined (by their transplant nephrologist) steady state.&#xD;
      They will then be followed at week 4, and then every 12 weeks while they are on the new&#xD;
      medication combination. Safety labs (blood counts, renal and liver function), HIV viral&#xD;
      loads, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) counts, and rapamycin levels will be reviewed at&#xD;
      each of these visits and if not checked within the specified time period these labs will be&#xD;
      repeated at the study visit. Patients will also be advised about study adherence and&#xD;
      monitored for adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and adverse event monitoring will occur each study visit. Research nurses will inquire&#xD;
      about adverse events that may or may not be related to study drugs. Any unfavorable medical&#xD;
      occurrences will be recorded, whether or not considered related to the patient's&#xD;
      participation in the research or temporally associated with the patient's participation in&#xD;
      the research. Any grade 3 or 4 AEs and all serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reviewed as&#xD;
      they occur by the study team. Adverse events (AEs) classified as grade 3 or higher occurring&#xD;
      at a frequency greater than that expected by the study team will be reported to the IRB and&#xD;
      principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of treatment visit will occur at week 96. Clinical safety labs (blood counts, renal&#xD;
      and liver function), HIV viral load, CD4 counts and rapamycin levels will be performed at&#xD;
      this visit if not done in the pre-specified time period. Patients will be given the option,&#xD;
      in conjunction with their transplant nephrologist and their infectious disease provider, to&#xD;
      discontinue or continue the new medications at this time.&#xD;
