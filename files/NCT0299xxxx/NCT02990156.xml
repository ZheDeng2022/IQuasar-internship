      The scope of this trial is the collection and analysis of effectiveness and safety endpoints,&#xD;
      related to the use of the MicroPort NeuroTech Coil Embolization System in the treatment of&#xD;
      intracranial aneurysms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A cerebral aneurysm (also known as an intracranial or intracerebral aneurysm) is a weak or&#xD;
      thin spot on a blood vessel in the brain that balloons out and fills and intermixes with&#xD;
      parent artery blood. Aneurysms can occur at any age. Global incidence varies by country, with&#xD;
      reports of prevalence ranging from 5.1 to 19.6 cases per 100,000 persons. With the&#xD;
      development of imaging technology and the greater attention paid by people to their overall&#xD;
      health,there will be more aneurysms be detected. The combination of sophisticated imaging&#xD;
      equipment, more frequent use of imaging in patients, and the aforementioned emphasis on&#xD;
      optimum health, has led to a greater proportion of asymptomatic aneurysms being discovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common type of aneurysms are saccular; and, aneurysms are more likely to occur in&#xD;
      women. The most devastating presentation of an intracranial aneurysm is subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage (SAH). It is estimated that, on average, five percent of the population is&#xD;
      afflicted and the incidence of aneurysm rupture (SAH) is between 6 and 9 per 1000 000&#xD;
      individuals . Mortality can approach 50%, with fewer than 60% of survivors returning to&#xD;
      independent living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive treatment of aneurysms began with an open surgical procedure referred to as&#xD;
      'surgical clipping'. This treatment was once considered the gold standard treatment for&#xD;
      aneurysms. The first neurovascular interventional medical device was the Guglielmi Detachable&#xD;
      Coil (GDC), which was developed and tested in the mid-1990s and was introduced by Dr. Guido&#xD;
      Guglielmi and Target Therapeutics, Fremont, California. These bare platinum coils were&#xD;
      electrolytically detached for placement in the aneurysm sac. It took approximately one decade&#xD;
      to prove coiling superiority over surgical clipping, after publication of the results of the&#xD;
      ISAT Study. Since that time, coils have become more sophisticated in makeup and conformation.&#xD;
      Coil use is also a mainstay for neurovascular procedures.&#xD;

    <description>For the MicroPort NeuroTech Coil Embolization System, this endpoint will be based upon the 6-month Core Lab identification of patients with &quot;Successful occlusion&quot; rate: % of subjects who at 6 months' post coiling, reported as a combination of Raymond 1 and Raymond 2 outcomes (95%-100%). The endpoint will be expressed as a percentage of all evaluable subjects with complete and nearly complete (95%-100%) occlusion in the context of the whole population of evaluable subjects (n/N).</description>

    <description>6-months post-treatment &quot;Clinical Worsening&quot;, &quot;Clinical Worsening&quot; will be calculated as the percentage of subjects who meet the following condition: Final mRS score is more than 2 and is at least 1 point higher than the pre study measurement.&#xD;
For most subjects, this will be determined at the 6-months follow up visit. However, for those subjects whose trial participation is prematurely shortened, as a result of death (mRS will count as 6) or very serious device or procedure related debilitating injury, their final mRS determination will be counted, as the most recent score at the time of leaving the study.</description>
