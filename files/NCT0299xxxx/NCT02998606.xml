    <textblock>
      To date, few studies have assessed the effect of opioids on esophageal motility, mostly&#xD;
      assessed the effect of single-dose intravenous morphine on esophageal motility. Recently a&#xD;
      large retrospective study assessing the effect of opioids on esophageal motility found that&#xD;
      esophageal motor dysfunction are common in chronic opioid users whether studied on opioids&#xD;
      and off opioids. In addition, current opioid users also had significantly higher integrated&#xD;
      relaxation pressure and manometric patterns consistent with type III achalasia. (Ratuapli&#xD;
      2015) Peripherally acting mu opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORA) appear to be useful to&#xD;
      reduce the peripheral effects of mu opioid receptor agonists to delay gastrointestinal&#xD;
      transit without affecting the centrally mediated analgesic effects. MOVANTIK™ (Naloxegol) is&#xD;
      the first oral peripherally acting mu opioid receptor antagonists for opioid-induced&#xD;
      constipation. MOVANTIK™ (Naloxegol) has been recently approved for opioid-induced&#xD;
      constipation. Given orally, 25 mg daily it improves symptoms of constipation. At this dose,&#xD;
      MOVANTIK™ (Naloxegol) is effective and safe, with a limited side effect profile and is&#xD;
      associated with preservation of centrally mediated analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will explore the safety and tolerability of MOVANTIK™ (Naloxegol) in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational hypothesis is that MOVANTIK™ (Naloxegol) could improve opioid- induced&#xD;
      esophageal motility disorders&#xD;

      Background MOVANTIK™ (Naloxegol) can alleviate the adverse effects associated with frequent&#xD;
      opiate use. The GI system is a common site for their unintended effects of opiate use, but&#xD;
      literature suggests that peripherally acting opioid agonist may provide relief in the&#xD;
      instance of GI dysfunction. (Holzer 2007) Toxicology and pharmacology summary&#xD;
&#xD;
      14 Phase I studies were completed with 439 health volunteers participating. MOVANTIK™&#xD;
      (Naloxegol) has been tested in a standard range of safety pharmacology studies including an&#xD;
      absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion study, a QTc (corrected QT interval)&#xD;
      study, several PK (pharmacokinetic) studies, and a study to determine its central and&#xD;
      peripheral pharmacodynamics effects. MOVANTIK™ (Naloxegol) is metabolized primarily by&#xD;
      cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP)-3A4 and CYP3A5 and is a substrate for a P-glycoprotein&#xD;
      transporter. Drug-drug interaction studies were performed for a strong and a moderate CYP3A4&#xD;
      inhibitor, a CYP3A5 inhibitor and P-glycoprotein transporter inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Safety summary MOVANTIK™ (Naloxegol) was initially tested in 439 healthy volunteers&#xD;
      across 14 Phase I studies. Ascending-dosing studies were performed with first dose ranging&#xD;
      from 8-1000 mg, followed by twice daily dosing ranging from 25-250 mg, all administered&#xD;
      intravenously. Another ascending dose study was completed in older volunteers (age 65 and&#xD;
      older) in Japan to determine the effects of advanced age on PK values. Phase IIb and II&#xD;
      studies exposed 1497 patients to dosages ranging from 5 mg to 50 mg for periods of time&#xD;
      varying from 24 to 52 weeks. MOVANTIK™ (Naloxegol) has shown acceptable safety profile and&#xD;
      was well-tolerated at 5 mg and 25 mg. The 50 mg cohort had shown increased frequency of GI&#xD;
      adverse events (abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhea) when compared to the 25 mg and 5 mg&#xD;
      cohorts. The 25 mg dose was the maximum used across the 5 phase III studies. Two 12 week&#xD;
      placebo-controlled double-blind studies were completed to confirm safety and efficacy, as&#xD;
      well as a 12 week double-blind safety extension, a randomized 52-week open-label parallel&#xD;
      group, long-term safety study and a placebo-controlled, double-blind study in patients with&#xD;
      cancer-related pain. The efficacy studies demonstrated the therapeutic effect of MOVANTIK™&#xD;
      (Naloxegol) was independent of age, gender, race, body mass index, region, use of&#xD;
      anticholinergics, response to previous laxative use, type of opioid, or dose of opioid. Phase&#xD;
      III studies demonstrated that MOVANTIK™ (Naloxegol) is generally safe and well tolerated at&#xD;
      doses up to 25 mg once daily in patients with OIC (opioid-induced constipation) up to 52&#xD;
      weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute and chronic use of opioids is associated with a variety of adverse effects on the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract. The effect of opioids on gastric, small bowel, and colonic motility&#xD;
      has been well characterized. The main esophageal abnormalities seen were impaired LES (lower&#xD;
      esophageal sphincter) relaxation. Recently a large retrospective study assessing the effect&#xD;
      of opioids on esophageal motility using, for the first time, HREM and the Chicago&#xD;
      classification of esophageal motility disorders v3.0 found that Esophageal motor dysfunction&#xD;
      are common in chronic opioid users whether studied on opioids and off opioids. (K raichely&#xD;
      2010) However, opioid use within 24 h of manometry was associated with increased EGJ (&#xD;
      Esophagogastric junction) outflow obstruction and other spastic esophageal motor&#xD;
      abnormalities. In addition, current opioid users also had significantly higher integrated&#xD;
      relaxation pressure and manometric patterns consistent with type III achalasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefit/risk and ethical assessment Preliminary data suggests a relationship between opioid&#xD;
      use and esophageal dysfunction. The decline in quality of life associated with esophageal&#xD;
      disorders may discourage patients from taking opioids, subjecting them to unwarranted pain.&#xD;
      MOVANTIK™ (Naloxegol) is an opioid antagonist specifically designed to work outside of the&#xD;
      central nervous system. This allows relief from undesired peripheral effects of opioids&#xD;
      without disrupting analgesic effects. The use of MOVANTIK™ (Naloxegol) has the potential to&#xD;
      mediate esophageal dysfunction while preserving vital pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients for whom MOVANTIK™ (Naloxegol) is contraindicated will be excluded as well as those&#xD;
      taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inducers and other opioid antagonists. In&#xD;
      the Phase III studies, adverse events of abdominal pain (21% v 7%), diarrhea (9% v 5%),&#xD;
      nausea (8% v 5%), flatulence (6% v 3%), vomiting (5% v 4%), headache (4% v 3%), and&#xD;
      hyperhidrosis (3% v &lt;1%) were observed at greater rates among the 25 mg cohort when compared&#xD;
      to placebo.. The current study is designed to explore the potential benefit or effect of&#xD;
      Naloxegol on upper GI motility and clinical symptoms inpatients receiving opioid&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to&#xD;
      determine the effect of MOVANTIK™ (Naloxegol) on opioid-related esophageal motility&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;

      Rationale for study design, doses and control groups This study seeks to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of MOVANTIK™ (Naloxegol) in treating patients with opioid-induced esophageal&#xD;
      disorders. MOVANTIK™ (Naloxegol) has already been shown to be effective in other opioid&#xD;
      induced gastric disorders. To the Investigator's knowledge there has been no double-blind&#xD;
      randomized control trial evaluating the effects of MOVANTIK™ (Naloxegol) on opioid&#xD;
      induced-esophageal disorders. The same dosage that has been proven effective in other patient&#xD;
      populations will be used. The use of a control group eliminates potential bias in the&#xD;
      patient-reported outcome endpoints. The enrollment goal is 50 patients for this study. A&#xD;
      recent study showed all 15 enrolled patients showed signs of opioid-induced motility&#xD;
      abnormalities on HREM. (Kraichely 2010) Relatively large effects can be expected in this&#xD;
      sample size. Using G* power 3 will ensure that that a sample size of 42 patients will give&#xD;
      provide a 95% chance of detecting a large effect size (defined as 0.80 population s.d.&#xD;
      between groups) between the two groups as significant at the 5% level (two tailed) using t&#xD;
      -test between means. Enrolling 50 patients ensures an adequate amount of patients complete&#xD;
      the course of treatment.&#xD;
