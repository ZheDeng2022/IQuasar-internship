  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that BVN G-1000 can precisely and consistently&#xD;
      measure the position of female breast lesions regardless of patient rotation and probe angle&#xD;
      during ultrasound examination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research consists of quantitatively detecting and reporting the effect of body&#xD;
      rotation and ultrasound probe position on the breast on the position of breast lesions&#xD;
      relative to the breast nipple and body orientation planes, required for positional&#xD;
      annotations, in female subjects at one study visit. Measurements will be manually and&#xD;
      automatically recorded by two ultrasound operators with each image and will be compared among&#xD;
      these conditions to detect effects of probe position and probe orientation and patient's body&#xD;
      position relative to the exam table. The manual and automated measurements will be compared&#xD;
      to determine the differences between the data obtained using the two different methods.&#xD;
