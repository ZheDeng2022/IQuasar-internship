    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immune response to an HIV clade C DNA&#xD;
      vaccine and to an MF59-adjuvanted clade C Env protein in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity to DNA-HIV-PT123 (an&#xD;
      HIV clade C DNA vaccine) and to Bivalent Subtype C gp120/MF59 in healthy, HIV-uninfected&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected participants aged 18 to 40 years. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of 6 groups. Each group will receive experimental vaccine&#xD;
      and protein and/or placebo at 4 study visits. Participants in Groups 1-3 will receive all&#xD;
      injections via needle and syringe. Participants in Groups 4-6 will receive the DNA vaccine&#xD;
      via Biojector, and protein and/or placebo via needle and syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Groups 1 and 4 will receive the DNA vaccine at months 0, 1, 3, and 6 and the&#xD;
      protein at months 3 and 6. Participants in Groups 2 and 5 will receive the DNA vaccine and&#xD;
      the protein at months 0, 1, and 6 and placebo at month 3. Participants in Groups 3 and 6 will&#xD;
      receive placebo at months 0, 1, 3, and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will include a physical examination, an interview and/or questionnaire, HIV&#xD;
      testing and HIV risk-reduction counseling, and urine and blood collection. Participants may&#xD;
      optionally choose to provide rectal fluid, cervical fluid, or semen samples.&#xD;
