  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In England each year over 9,000 people fracture their hip. Most of these are elderly females&#xD;
      with the fracture occurring after a fall. Approximately half of these fractures are&#xD;
      classified as intracapsular fractures because of their close proximity to the hip joint. The&#xD;
      majority of these fractures are treated surgically by excising the broken femoral neck and&#xD;
      removing the femoral head (ball part of the hip joint) and replacing it with an artificial&#xD;
      hip joint. This hip replacement has traditionally been a hemiarthroplasty or sometimes termed&#xD;
      a 'half hip replacement' in which only the ball part of the hip joint is replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative type of hip replacement is the full total hip replacement in which the socket&#xD;
      part of the joint is also replaced. This is the operation that is used for replacing&#xD;
      arthritic hips. In recent years there have been a number of randomised trials that have&#xD;
      compared the outcome for patients with an intracapsular hip fracture treated with either a&#xD;
      partial hip replacement (hemiarthroplasty) against those treated with a total hip replacement&#xD;
      (THR). Results to date have suggested slightly better long term functional results for those&#xD;
      treated with a THR, but it still remains unclear if these benefits are offset by the&#xD;
      increased surgical complexity of the procedure and the extra cost involved for a THR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present the numbers of studies on this topic are too few with limited patient numbers to&#xD;
      make any definite conclusions. This study aims to add to the research studies by comparing&#xD;
      the two surgical procedures, to enable orthopaedic surgeons to determine the optimum surgical&#xD;
      treatment for this common and disabling condition.&#xD;

      The trial will be run as close to the ideal trial methodology for a randomised trial as&#xD;
      specified by the CONSORT statement as possible. This will include secure randomisation,&#xD;
      intention to treat analysis, full reporting of outcomes and follow-up by a person who is&#xD;
      blinded to the prosthesis used. The trial will follow the code of good clinical practice as&#xD;
      specified by the hospital trusts Research and Development Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Peterborough all hip fracture patients are admitted to the acute trauma ward and&#xD;
      transferred to the care of MJP. Those patients that are willing to participant in one of our&#xD;
      randomised trials are consented prior to surgery. Treatment follows standard evidence based&#xD;
      protocols with follow-up of all patients in a hip fracture clinic. A comprehensive database&#xD;
      is maintained for all patients containing both audit and research data. Included in this is a&#xD;
      standardised assessment of outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical treatments under comparison will be either a cemented Exeter stem monoblock&#xD;
      prosthesis inserted via an anteriolateral surgical approach or a cemented Total hip&#xD;
      replacement. The stem for the THR will be a polished tapered stem of the Exeter type with a&#xD;
      32 or 36mm head articulating with a cemented high density polyethylene cemented acetabular&#xD;
      cup. All operations will be undertaken or supervised by MJP. Post-operative care programmes&#xD;
      for the two patients will be identical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge patient will be seen once in the hip fracture clinic by MJP. At this time&#xD;
      they will also be assessed by the research nurse who is blinded to the type of prosthesis&#xD;
      used. The outcome questionnaire is completed which includes an assessment of hip movement and&#xD;
      limb shortening. All subsequent follow-up assessments will be done by phone call from the&#xD;
      research nurse. Any patient with significant residual symptoms will be asked to re-attend the&#xD;
      hip fracture clinic.&#xD;

               -  All other patients in which the injury is to be treated by reduction and internal&#xD;
                  fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Those with impaired mobility prior to the injury (defined as not able to walk out&#xD;
