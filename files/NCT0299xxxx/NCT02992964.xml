    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, multi-center, pilot study of Nivolumab in pediatric&#xD;
      patients with recurrent or refractory hypermutant malignancies aged 12 months to 18 years of&#xD;
      age. This study is to assess clinical and radiological benefits of treatment with Nivolumab&#xD;
      in children with hypermutated cancers, including those with bMMRD syndrome. It is our&#xD;
      expectation that patients with bMMRD syndrome will account for the majority of patients&#xD;
      enrolled on this study.&#xD;

&#xD;
        10. For patients with brain tumors, debulking surgery prior to treatment with nivolumab&#xD;
        should be considered when appropriate to reduce the risk of pseudoprogression-associated&#xD;
