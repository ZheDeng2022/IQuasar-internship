      BACKGROUND The majority of errors in healthcare in general, and the operating theatre in&#xD;
      particular, are caused by human factors1,2. Hindering of these errors can be accomplished by&#xD;
      good non-technical skills (NTS), including good teamwork and efficient communication within&#xD;
      the operating room (OR) team3,4. NTS are defined as 'the cognitive, social and personal&#xD;
      resource skills that complement technical skills and contribute to safe and efficient task&#xD;
      performance'5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, safety studies have analysed and measured adverse events as an indication of&#xD;
      patient safety4,6. A new safety theory by Erik Hollnagel, named Safety II, argues that&#xD;
      instead of only investigating adverse events as a 'measure' for safety, we should also be&#xD;
      investigating what happens when these do not occur or when they are avoided as equally&#xD;
      important7. This broader perspective on patient safety has also been advocated by others8-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an explorative, interview-based study, we took a Safety-II perspective when examining&#xD;
      which NTS were most important for ensuring safe and efficient video-assisted thoracoscopic&#xD;
      surgery (VATS) lobectomy, a high risk minimally invasive surgery with complementary and&#xD;
      overlapping scope of practice between the surgical and anaesthesia subteams. The&#xD;
      multi-professional teams identified specific important NTS that served as the basis for&#xD;
      shared mental models (SMMs) regarding the patient, the current situation or the resources&#xD;
      within the team. These mental models were accomplished through communication and&#xD;
      coordination, and enabled the team to anticipate problems and stay ahead of the situation11.&#xD;
      These teams performing high-risk procedures emphasized the importance of the six identified&#xD;
      NTS for them to be able to obtain an accurate SMM to enable them to be ahead which they&#xD;
      viewed as most important for a successful and safe operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the first to look at SMM as a requirement for effective team performance was&#xD;
      Cannon-Bowers and Salas in the 1990s12. They defined SMMs as common or overlapping cognitive&#xD;
      representations of task requirements, procedures, and role responsibilities. More recent,&#xD;
      SMMs have been specified as a shared understanding of the task (including equipment), the&#xD;
      situation and resources of other team members. In turn, this will enable them to understand&#xD;
      and interpret the situation and what the other team members know, what they need to know and&#xD;
      what they are doing12-14. Moreover, others have found identical or similar constructs to&#xD;
      SMMs, i.e. team mental models/shared situation models/team knowledge/team situation&#xD;
      awareness, and the importance of these constructs for patient safety is largely agreed&#xD;
      upon15-21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMMs are more than the sum of individual mental models20,22. They need to be similar,&#xD;
      accurate and shared within the team; however, what level of information sharing and team&#xD;
      monitoring in the team will result in high team performance is less clear17,18,23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent methodology publication, different probe questions were used to establish team&#xD;
      members' knowledge in order to measure the team's SMM and situation awareness13. The probe&#xD;
      questions related to the task, the situation, and future predictions of the situation&#xD;
      including possible outcomes. The teams in these experiments were at a second-line emergency&#xD;
      centre where team members had distinct responsibilities. These teams differ from OR teams&#xD;
      which work closely together in and with the same 'physical environment', namely in the OR&#xD;
      with the patient, on a high-risk but at the same time rather standardized task, namely an&#xD;
      operation, which in our case is an elective procedure of VATS lobectomy. One can speculate if&#xD;
      the SMMs of OR teams are identical or differ to these emergency centre teams. So far,&#xD;
      measurement of SMMs in OR teams has to our knowledge only been conducted in simulation&#xD;
      settings17. To what extent this shared mental modelling occurs within the OR teams in the&#xD;
      clinical setting is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the correlation between OR teams' NTS and technical skills (TS) has previously been&#xD;
      investigated, however, there is still no clear picture of whether or not a correlation&#xD;
      exists4,24-26. Additionally, some studies found a positive correlation27-29, whereas others&#xD;
      found a negative correlation30. As the SMMs of the VATS teams seem to be enabled by the NTS&#xD;
      perceived as important, it could be hypothesised that this relationship for SMMs and TS in&#xD;
      the clinical setting is clearer than for NTS and TS. Yet, it is unknown whether the OR teams'&#xD;
      SMMs are correlated to TS or other patient- and procedure-related measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are twofold. First, to explore to what extent SMM occur within the&#xD;
      VATS teams in a cardiothoracic surgery setting. Second, to establish whether the VATS team's&#xD;
      SMM is associated with the surgeons' TS, procedural specific times, per-operative bleeding,&#xD;
      or patient characteristics (age, gender, FEV %, comorbidity, tumour size or location).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To what extent are the individual team members' mental models in agreement within the&#xD;
           VATS team?&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Pre-operatively?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Post-operatively?&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Pre- and post-operative correlations?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How is the team's shared mental model associated with&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The surgeon's TS assessed by VATS lobectomy assessment tool (VATSAT)?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Procedural specific times (see later for description)?&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Amount of bleeding?&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Patient characteristics?&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Design This study will be a case series study of VATS lobectomies purposefully&#xD;
      sampled at all four cardiothoracic surgery centres in Denmark. Data will be gathered from 60&#xD;
      lobectomies performed by multi-professional VATS teams including both experienced and&#xD;
      intermediate level surgeons. Gathering of data is planned to start in December 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sampling Team members' mental models will be explored through two questionnaires handed&#xD;
      out to all team members before and after the operation (see Appendix to protocol (in&#xD;
      Danish)). The questionnaires were constructed using the probe questions from Sætrevik et al.,&#xD;
      adapted to fit VATS lobectomy settings11,13,14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the pre-operative questions concern team members' perceived technical skills,&#xD;
      teamwork skills and familiarity; risk assessment ('global' and 'global in view of the current&#xD;
      team'); and risk assessment of specific tasks. The post-operative questions concern team&#xD;
      members' perceived technical skills and teamwork skills; risk assessment ('global' and&#xD;
      'global in view of the current team'), leadership and teamwork during the procedure, and&#xD;
      knowledge of challenges experienced during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceived technical and teamwork skills, familiarity, 'global' and 'global in view of the&#xD;
      current team' risk assessments are rated on a Likert scale from 1-7, and risk assessment of&#xD;
      specific possible challenging situations are rated on a Likert scale from 1-3. The remaining&#xD;
      items are either yes/no-questions or open-ended questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires will be handed out to each team member individually before and after the&#xD;
      VATS lobectomy. Endoscopic video-recordings of all the VATS lobectomies will be collected&#xD;
      from the thoracoscope using the recording device MedCapture. Using these video-recordings,&#xD;
      the TS level of the VATS surgeon will be evaluated by two independent raters using a VATSAT&#xD;
      assessment tool31. The VATSAT tool evaluates eight items on a five point Likert scale and&#xD;
      produces a pass/fail score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An observer will be present throughout all the operations to collect data on amount of&#xD;
      bleeding (in ml) and procedural specific times. The procedural specific times will be both&#xD;
      pre-specified times and a continuous registration of time for tasks. The pre-specified times&#xD;
      will be from the time the patient enters the OR to anaesthesia begins, to the surgeon makes&#xD;
      the first incision, to the surgeon finishes the last suture, to the patient wakes up from&#xD;
      anaesthesia, and to the patient leaves the OR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observer will in addition take field notes for qualitative analysis with special focus on&#xD;
      the six NTS identified in our previous study as important to safe and successful VATS&#xD;
      lobectomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics The Regional Ethics Committee of the Capital Region of Denmark has been applied, and a&#xD;
      letter of exemption has been given according to Danish Law (H-16041772). The participants&#xD;
      will receive oral and written information and will give informed consent on the day of the&#xD;
      operation with the continuous option of retraction of consent and participation. The&#xD;
      endoscopic recordings will not start until the thoracoscope is inside the patient. All&#xD;
      video-recordings, physical examples of questionnaires and master sheets will be stored&#xD;
      according to Danish Data Protection Law, and any written description in the final manuscript&#xD;
      and article will be presented anonymously. Only the members of the research team will review&#xD;
      the endoscopic video-recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses Questionnaire data The preoperative questionnaire will have in all 24&#xD;
      items concerning risk assessment and team resources. The post-operative questionnaire&#xD;
      contains 16 items. It will describe the risk, skills and teamwork as perceived by each team&#xD;
      member as it unfolded during the procedure. For each item, percentage of answers 'I don't&#xD;
      know' will be calculated. For the remaining answers of each specific item, Cronbach's α will&#xD;
      be calculated thereby representing the agreement within the team. These two numbers&#xD;
      (percentage however revised to a number between 0-1) will be multiplied, thereby giving a&#xD;
      number between 0-1. This will be done for all items. For each questionnaire, all item scores&#xD;
      can be added to give a total score, between 0-24 or 0-16. For the pre-operative&#xD;
      questionnaire, 24 will represent total agreement within the team before the operation,&#xD;
      indicating complete overlap in the team's SMM of team resources and risk assessment. For the&#xD;
      post-operative questionnaire, 16 will represent total agreement within the team after the&#xD;
      operation, indicating complete overlap in the team's view on team resources, teamwork and&#xD;
      risk assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-operative questionnaire will conclude with an open-ended question concerning&#xD;
      challenges faced during the procedure by all the different team members. From these it will&#xD;
      be possible to categorize each of these answers as either correct (given a score of 1) or&#xD;
      wrong (including 'I don't know'; given a score of 0) when compared to the answer given by the&#xD;
      person in question. An example of this could be if the scrub nurse answers that the surgeon&#xD;
      did not have any challenges, and the surgeon himself answers that he did have challenges&#xD;
      dissecting the lymph nodes, the scrub nurse will get a score of zero.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all, this will result in the calculations of three scores for SMMs regarding team&#xD;
      resources, risk assessment and awareness of challenges within the team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlation calculations The items concerning team members' perceived technical skills,&#xD;
      teamwork skills, and risk assessment ('global' and 'global in view of the current team') will&#xD;
      be collected both before and after the procedure. This will enable analysis of how well each&#xD;
      team member predict these items before the operation as compared to the assessment after.&#xD;
      This will be done by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient r for each team member and&#xD;
      for the team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scores representing the total SMM in the team pre- and post-operatively can be correlated&#xD;
      to the surgeon's technical skills (the VATSAT score), procedural specific times, bleeding and&#xD;
      patient characteristics. Pearson's correlation coefficient r will be used if the data are&#xD;
      normally distributed or Spearman's correlation coefficient (rho) if the data are&#xD;
      non-parametrically distributed. Statistical analyses will be performed using IBM SPSS&#xD;
      statistics 22; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA.&#xD;
