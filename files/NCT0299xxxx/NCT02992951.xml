  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infection is an infection at a place in the body where surgery has taken place,&#xD;
      and has been reported in around 5% of people undergoing an operation. In vascular surgery,&#xD;
      infection rates are as high as 30%. Methods to reduce this rate of infection should be&#xD;
      investigated thoroughly for their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to conduct a research trial examining one such method. Leukomed Sorbact&#xD;
      is a wound dressing coated with a chemical (DACC) derived from spider-silk that interacts&#xD;
      with, and binds bacteria, causing them to be mechanically removed from a wound when the&#xD;
      dressing is changed.The trial aims to compare the effectiveness of this dressing to a&#xD;
      standard, non-coated dressing, in the reduction of surgical site infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      718 patients from a number of centres across the UK will be recruited to this study. Adult&#xD;
      patients who are having a vascular surgery operation will be approached for entry into the&#xD;
      trial. The trial will be explained to them, as well as an explanation that participation is&#xD;
      voluntary and their operation or other aspects of their care will not be impacted in any way&#xD;
      should participants not wish to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised by computer into one of two groups - one group whose wounds&#xD;
      are dressed with Leukomed Sorbact, and the other whose wounds are dressed with a standard&#xD;
      dressing. Patients will be followed up at 5-7 days and 30 days, and at 1 year. At the follow&#xD;
      up, their wounds will be inspected for infection, and participants will be asked to complete&#xD;
      short questionnaires measuring quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will aim to answer a number of questions, with the primary question being does a&#xD;
      DACC coated dressing applied after an operation reduce the risk of an infection at the&#xD;
      surgery site? It will also ask whether this treatment is cost-effective and whether it&#xD;
      promotes satisfactory healing.&#xD;
