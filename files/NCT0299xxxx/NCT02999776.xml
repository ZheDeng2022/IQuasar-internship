  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and safety of topical administration&#xD;
      of etanercept via AFL micropores to psoriatic plaques in patients with mild to moderate&#xD;
      plaque-type psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While a wide variety of therapeutic innovations to treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis&#xD;
      (accounting for around 30% of the cases) become available each year, there are few&#xD;
      innovations for topical therapies to treat mild/localized psoriasis (accounting for around&#xD;
      70% of the cases). Given that only about half of the patients respond adequately to the&#xD;
      current standard of care, the topical application of a fixed combination of calcipotriole and&#xD;
      betamethasone, there is a medical need for better topical therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Etanercept has been used successfully to treat moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis in&#xD;
      children and adults for more than a decade. Its standard route of application is through&#xD;
      subcutaneous injections. Different dosing regimens have been used: 1 x 50 mg or 2 x 50 mg per&#xD;
      week as well as 1 x 25 mg or 2 x 25 mg per week. Under these regimens, etanercept has a&#xD;
      well-established favorable long-term safety record, with injection site reactions (pain,&#xD;
      swelling) the most frequently reported side effects. However, rare but serious side effects&#xD;
      such as serious opportunistic infections resulting from immune system inhibition common to&#xD;
      anti-TNF agents limit its systemic use to these patients. For this reason, a localized&#xD;
      topical alternative route of administration would be desirable. However, the large molecular&#xD;
      size and chemical nature of etanercept prevent it from crossing the epidermal barrier. A CE&#xD;
      certified ablative fractional laser (AFL) device with Er:YAG source will be used to create&#xD;
      micropores in plaques to allow local delivery of etanercept directly into psoriatic plaques.&#xD;

      Monocentric, observer partially-blinded Phase I study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, three similar plaques on each patient will be prospectively identified by the&#xD;
      blinded observer and then randomized by an unblinded investigator by using the eCRF to one of&#xD;
      the three study treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard of care (daily administration of Daivobet® by the patient),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ablative fractional laser microporation + topical application of etanercept&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ablative fractional laser microporation alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the treatment period of 8 weeks, patients will return to the clinic twice weekly for&#xD;
      assessment of the three study plaques by the blinded observer, followed by administration of&#xD;
      the treatment of plaques assigned to AFL microporation with or without etanercept. Patients&#xD;
      will treat the remaining plaque with Daivobet® themselves on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although no incompatibilities of AFL and etanercept are anticipated, because this is the&#xD;
      first time etanercept is administered topically via AFL micropores and using a AFL&#xD;
      microporation device, the study will be conducted in two stages: a Safety Stage consisting of&#xD;
      the first five patients and the Study Stage with thirty patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Safety Stage of the study, three different plaques of the first 5 patients will be&#xD;
      randomized and administered the respective treatments only once. Enrollment will be suspended&#xD;
      after the 5th patient has been enrolled to permit the data monitoring committee (DMC) to&#xD;
      review of the initial safety data from these first 5 patients to reassess risk. Based on this&#xD;
      review, the DMC will make one of three recommendations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to continue the study as planned,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to continue the study with adjustments to study procedures, such as changes to laser&#xD;
           parameters, frequency of treatments or concentration of etanercept or,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. in the event of extreme safety concerns, to terminate the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If option 1 is recommended, the study will resume with the Study Stage (Stage 2), in which&#xD;
      the initial 5 patients will once again begin treatment, with their plaques receiving the same&#xD;
      treatments to which they were previously randomized. Their treatment will continue for 8&#xD;
      weeks. Enrollment will also resume and continue until an additional 25 patients have been&#xD;
      enrolled. If the DMC recommends option 2, treatment and enrollment will resume as just&#xD;
      described after an adapted protocol has been submitted to and approved by the relevant&#xD;
      authorities. If the DMC recommends option 3, then the study will terminate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Stage will consist of 2 periods: screening period (up to 2 weeks prior to baseline&#xD;
      assessments and randomization) and treatment period (for the first 5 patients: initially 1&#xD;
      set of treatments, followed by suspension of treatment until after DMC review, then 8 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment; for the remaining 25 patients: 8 weeks of treatment depending on plaque&#xD;
      randomization, either daily Daivobet® or biweekly AFL with or without etanercept).&#xD;

             that have been treated with no evidence of recurrence in the past 3 months, and except&#xD;
             for carcinoma in situ of the cervix or non-invasive malignant colon polyps that have&#xD;
             been removed)&#xD;
&#xD;
         30. Current severe progressive or uncontrolled disease which in the judgment of the&#xD;
             clinical investigator renders the patient unsuitable for the trial&#xD;

             used in Enbrel® (see list of excipients in Table 5-1)&#xD;

             syringes for Enbrel® contain dry natural rubber)&#xD;
&#xD;
         35. Any medical or psychiatric condition which, in the Investigator's opinion, would&#xD;
             preclude the participant from adhering to the protocol or completing the study per&#xD;
             protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
         36. History or evidence of ongoing alcohol or drug abuse, within the last six months&#xD;
             before baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
         37. Plans for administration of live vaccines during the study period or live vaccination&#xD;
             within 6 weeks prior to baseline&#xD;
