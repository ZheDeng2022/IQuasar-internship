      This is a Phase II trial to determine the ability of a reduced intensity conditioning regimen&#xD;
      to allow successful engraftment with alpha/beta T and CD19+ depleted peripheral stem cell&#xD;
      grafts from unrelated or partially matched related donors. There are two conditioning&#xD;

      This is a Phase II trial to determine the ability of a reduced intensity conditioning regimen&#xD;
      to allow successful engraftment with alpha/beta T and CD19+ depleted peripheral stem cell&#xD;
      grafts from unrelated or partially matched related donors. There are two conditioning&#xD;
      regimens depending upon patient diagnosis and age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include patients 0-25 years with PID, including immune dysregulation syndromes&#xD;
      for which hematopoietic stem cell transplant is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;

      depleted donor peripheral stem cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduced intensity conditioning with busulfan x 8 doses, fludarabine 40 mg/m2 x 4,&#xD;
           thiotepa 5 mg/kg x 2, anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) 3 mg/kg x 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
           OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Myeloablative regimen with busulfan x 16 doses or Daily for four days, fludarabine 30&#xD;
           mg/m2 x 5, thiotepa 5 mg/kg x 2, ATG 3 mg/kg x 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Immunotherapy regimen on days -9, 8, 7 with anti-thymocyte globulin 3 mg/kg/day (for&#xD;
           severe combined immunodeficiency patients only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Infusion of alpha/beta T and CD19+ depleted donor peripheral stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Follow up, including evaluation of chimerism and immune reconstitution.&#xD;
