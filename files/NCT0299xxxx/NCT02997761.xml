  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib and blinatumomab work in treating patients&#xD;
      with B acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has come back or is not responding to treatment.&#xD;
      Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as blinatumomab, may interfere with the ability of cancer&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread. Giving ibrutinib and blinatumomab may work better in treating&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib and blinatumomab in patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) as measured by complete response (CR) rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To further examine the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib and blinatumomab in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory B-ALL as measured by overall response rate (ORR, defined as CR plus CR&#xD;
      with incomplete count recovery [CRi]), relapse free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS),&#xD;
      minimal residual disease (MRD) response, proportion of patients bridged to allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT), and toxicity.&#xD;
