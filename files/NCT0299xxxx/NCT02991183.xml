  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a therapy that helps people to notice&#xD;
      and accept difficult thoughts and emotions. ACT also helps people to identify what they value&#xD;
      in life (e.g. a good relationship with their partner) and make changes to their behaviour to&#xD;
      promote these values. Carers of people with dementia may experience reduced wellbeing&#xD;
      associated with their role. Those whose wellbeing is greater than previously are said to be&#xD;
      'flourishing'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this feasibility study is to evaluate the potential value of ACT as a group&#xD;
      intervention for carers of people with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Participants will include adult carers of people with dementia. Study participants&#xD;
      will be identified from two older people community mental health teams. Informed consent will&#xD;
      be sought prior to group invitations being sent out. There will be two groups in total (12 in&#xD;
      each group) and both groups will attend three 2.5 hour sessions of ACT. All participants will&#xD;
      complete questionnaires at the beginning and 21 days later (asking questions about their&#xD;
      thoughts and feelings, flourishing and about being a carer). Eight group participants will be&#xD;
      invited to a focus group to understand what they found more helpful and less helpful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applications: Results from this study will potentially provide useful information to enable a&#xD;
      further study with more participants to be conducted. The outcomes of this study will be&#xD;
      shared with older people community mental health teams, dementia and carer specialist groups&#xD;
      and potentially published in a relevant journal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants: two groups of participants will receive the ACT group intervention (Total n=24Í¾&#xD;
      n/Group = 12). One group of participants (n=8) who attend the ACT intervention will be&#xD;
      invited to a focus group exploring intervention acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Procedures: prior to recruitment commencing the researcher will present details&#xD;
      of the study (recruitment procedures, eligibility criteria etc.) to the relevant Community&#xD;
      Mental Health Teams (CMHTs) and at the Older Adult Psychology Team meeting. Carers of People&#xD;
      with Dementia (CPwD) will be identified by National Health Service (NHS) staff working in&#xD;
      Older People's CMHTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will receive patient information sheet at routine appointments they&#xD;
      attend with the person with dementia for whom they care. Carers will provide permission for&#xD;
      their contact details to be passed to the research team using 'Notice of Interest' slip. The&#xD;
      researcher will then arrange to meet with the carer to recruit them to the study. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be sought and a member of the research team will complete a consent form with&#xD;
      participants after they have had time to read the Participant Information Sheet. Consenting&#xD;
      participants will be sent appointment letters with further details of the group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: participants will complete the following measures at the beginning and end of the&#xD;
      ACT group intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic questionnaire (including age, gender, length of time being in a caring role,&#xD;
           fulltime or part-time carers, any other employment, number of individuals they care for,&#xD;
           and their relationship to the individual they care for (e.g. spouse, sibling, child,&#xD;
           other).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acceptance and Action Questionnaire: (AAQII). The AAQII is a 7 item questionnaire, which&#xD;
           measures psychological flexibility on a 7 point Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF). The MHC-SF is a 14 item questionnaire,&#xD;
           measuring wellbeing on a 6 point Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Experiential Avoidance in Caregiving Questionnaire (EACQ) The EACQ is a 15 item&#xD;
           questionnaire, which measures experiential avoidance on a 5 point Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Caregiver Burden Scale (CBS).The CBS is a 21 item questionnaire, which measures the&#xD;
           overall level of burden carers experience in relation to their spouse or relative on a 5&#xD;
           point Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Recruitment and retention parameters: A sample size of at least 12 people per group for&#xD;
           pilot pharmaceutical studies will be an indicator of sufficient recruitment. However, 8&#xD;
           has been suggested as the optimum number of group participants in psychological&#xD;
           interventions. Therefore, a figure of no more than 33% attrition from baseline to final&#xD;
           assessment will be used to indicate that the ACT group intervention is feasible in terms&#xD;
           of retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Group Evaluation Form: A brief survey will be completed with Likert scales and free text&#xD;
           boxes for reflections on participants experience of attending the ACT groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Focus group: A smaller number of participants (n = 8) will also be invited to attend a&#xD;
           focus group to explore their view of taking part in the ACT groups. This will be&#xD;
           audio-recorded and transcribed for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: this project will be an uncontrolled feasibility trial, using convenience sampling,&#xD;
      and measuring a range of variables pertinent to the feasibility of delivering ACT&#xD;
      intervention groups for CPwD. Process evaluation methodology, including quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative methods, will be applied to measure feasibility of the group intervention and&#xD;
      develop a greater understanding of the intervention delivered and its causal assumptions (see&#xD;
      research questions above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data collected will include demographic information, number of participants&#xD;
      recruited and retained throughout the study, outcome measures (carer burden, psychological&#xD;
      flexibility, flourishing), and responses to Likert scale acceptability questions. Qualitative&#xD;
      data will include responses to open-ended acceptability questions in the format of a&#xD;
      questionnaire and focus group exploring participants' experience of attending the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Procedures Measures will be completed by all participants at baseline (beginning of&#xD;
      group) and 21 days post-baseline (end of group). Baseline measures will be completed prior to&#xD;
      the first session. Post-baseline measures will be completed following the third session.&#xD;
      Feedback surveys will be given to all participants at the last group session with Likert&#xD;
      scales and free text boxes for reflections on their experience of attending the ACT groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A focus group of 8 participants who have completed the ACT group intervention will be&#xD;
      conducted by a facilitator independent from the ACT group facilitators. The participants will&#xD;
      be selected to provide a range of experiences of the group to elicit rich discussion and&#xD;
      qualitative data regarding acceptability. A semi-structured interview will be used to guide&#xD;
      discussions (including open questions related to group format and structure, ACT approach,&#xD;
      practicalities of attending) but the participants will be encouraged to openly discuss their&#xD;
      opinions of their experience of the ACT group.&#xD;
