      The purpose of this study is to determine whether APR-246, 5-FU and cisplatin are safe and&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of platinum resistant oesophageal cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer of the oesophagus (OC) is distinguished by having a poor outcome for most patients and&#xD;
      an incidence that is rising faster than any other solid cancer. It is already the eighth most&#xD;
      common cancer, and the sixth most common cause of death from cancer, worldwide. The majority&#xD;
      of patients are diagnosed with late stage disease, which is incurable with the current&#xD;
      standard multimodality therapy. Thus, there is a critical need to develop new treatments for&#xD;
      this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surprisingly, despite its high prevalence in developing countries, and its increasing&#xD;
      incidence in Western populations, metastatic OC remains an 'orphan disease' with very few&#xD;
      good quality or randomised trials available to guide practice. As a result, treatment for OC&#xD;
      has changed little over the past few decades, and as a consequence there has been only modest&#xD;
      improvement in overall survival for patients with this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TP53, a key tumour suppressor gene, is mutated in 70-80% of OC (both adenocarcinoma and&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma) providing an attractive potential target for an OC therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although paired tissue studies in primary and metastatic OC are lacking, p53 mutations occur&#xD;
      very early in oesophageal carcinogenesis and are unlikely to be lost in advanced disease. OC&#xD;
      with mutant (mut)-p53 are more resistant to conventional chemotherapy and mut-p53 is&#xD;
      associated with poor patient prognosis. Over the last decade, several novel drugs have been&#xD;
      developed that target mut-p53 and restore wild-type (wt)-p53 function in cancer cells. Of&#xD;
      these, APR-246 (also known as PRIMA-1MET), a first-in-class agent targeting mutant p53&#xD;
      resulting in re-expression of wild-type p53 activity, has proven to be the most effective&#xD;
      against a wide range of mutants. APR-246 is a pro-drug that gives rise to the active compound&#xD;
      methylene quinuclidinone (MQ), which covalently binds to thiol groups on cysteine residues in&#xD;
      the p53 core domain resulting in refolding of mut-p53 protein and restoration of its tumour&#xD;
      suppressor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the reactivation of mut-p53 is thought to be the primary mode of action of APR-246,&#xD;
      preclinical studies have suggested potential alternative mechanisms (e.g. through the&#xD;
      depletion of cellular glutathione levels) may also be contributing to the efficacy of&#xD;
      APR-246, especially when used in combination with cisplatin/5-FU chemotherapy. Thus, the&#xD;
      anti-tumour activity of APR-246 may not be limited to mut-p53 bearing tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mutation of p53 is the most common genetic aberration in oesophageal cancer being detected in&#xD;
      up to 80% of both oesophageal squamous cell cancers and adenocarcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APR-246 is a first-in-class agent targeting mutant p53. In vitro and in vivo preclinical&#xD;
      models have demonstrated that APR-246 has excellent efficacy in OC (both adenocarcinoma and&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma) and potently synergises with chemotherapies used in the treatment of&#xD;
      OC, restoring sensitivity to chemotherapy-resistant tumours. An initial phase I clinical&#xD;
      trial has shown APR-246 to be safe in humans and early results from a currently running phase&#xD;
      Ib/II trial of APR-246 with carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin in ovarian cancer have been&#xD;
      promising. Together, these data provide a strong rationale for investigating the efficacy of&#xD;
      APR-246 in OC.&#xD;

    <description>The trial regimen consists of the investigational agent APR-246, along with standard chemotherapy, Cisplatin and 5-FU. A maximum of 8 cycles of treatment will be given.&#xD;
APR-246 and 5-FU must both commence on Day 1 and given on days 1 to 4 via intravenous infusion over 6 hours, whilst 5-FU must be given as a continuous infusion over 96 hours.&#xD;
On Days 2-4, APR-246 must be given first via intravenous infusion over 6 hours, then commence cisplatin via intravenous infusion over one hour.&#xD;
This is a dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination therapy. The 3 dose levels are described as follows:&#xD;
Dose Level 1:&#xD;
APR-246 Dose: 75mg/kg LBM Cisplatin Dose: 25mg/m2 5-FU Dose: 750mg/m2/ day CI&#xD;
Dose Level 2:&#xD;
APR-246 Dose: 100mg/kg LBM Cisplatin Dose: 25mg/m2 5-FU Dose: 750mg/m2/ day CI&#xD;
Dose Level -1:&#xD;
APR-246 Dose: 50mg/kg LBM Cisplatin Dose: 25mg/m2 5-FU Dose: 750mg/m2/ day CI</description>

&#xD;
          2. Histologically-confirmed metastatic or advanced oesophageal or oesophago-gastric&#xD;
             junction adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Radiologic disease progression at or within 6 months of platinum containing&#xD;
             chemotherapy in the advanced/metastatic or adjuvant setting&#xD;

             following radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients may have had up to 2 lines of previous chemotherapy in the&#xD;
             metastatic/advanced setting or 3 lines including adjuvant therapy. If patients have a&#xD;
             maintenance strategy following platinum containing chemotherapy (e.g. fluoropyrimidine&#xD;
             alone) this will not be considered a separate line of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient has provided written informed consent for the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Tumour tissue available from the initial surgical resection or any previous biopsies&#xD;

             the tumour tissue block must be available for the purpose of translation research&#xD;
             studies. Obtaining archived tumour material or unstained sections from an archived&#xD;
             tumour block will suffice to meet this requirement. The availability of the tumour&#xD;
             material must be confirmed at Screening for a patient to be eligible. If no archival&#xD;
             tissue block is available and/or fewer than 15 unstained sections are available,&#xD;
             eligibility must be confirmed with the Coordinating Principal Investigator or&#xD;
             delegate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must have adequate haematological, renal, hepatic and pulmonary functions as&#xD;

             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course&#xD;
             of the study through 60 days after the last dose of study medication. Patients of&#xD;
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not&#xD;
