  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The surgical treatment of less than severe (≤2+/4+) functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR)&#xD;
      in patient undergoing mitral valve surgery, is still controversial: some observational&#xD;
      studies have suggested that performing tricuspid annuloplasty in patients undergoing mitral&#xD;
      valve surgery with a dilated tricuspid annulus, and TR≤2+ may provide a clinical benefit,&#xD;
      while in other observational studies such benefit has not been documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ESC Guidelines assign the class IIa recommendation for surgical treatment in patients&#xD;
      with tricuspid regurgitation ≤2+ and a dilated annulus, if surgery is concomitant to the&#xD;
      repair or replacement of the mitral valve. However the level of evidence C (expert opinion)&#xD;
      confirms the absence of clear scientific evidence to support this recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore very important to carry out randomized trials designed to really prove the&#xD;
      supposed efficacy of prophylactic tricuspid annuloplasty, especially in patients with&#xD;
      degenerative etiology where the data are particularly controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study will be to establish the effectiveness of the tricuspid annuloplasty in&#xD;
      the early stage of TR. The investigators enrolled patients with TR≤2+ and annular dilation&#xD;
      undergoing mitral valve repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-point will be the freedom from recurrence of TR≥3+ and from progression of 2&#xD;
      degrees of TR compared to pre-operative, at discharge and 12 months after surgery, assessment&#xD;
      by transthoracic echocardiography. Secondary endpoints are to demonstrate the superiority of&#xD;
      combined treatment (M &amp; T Repair Group) compared to single treatment (Mitral-Only Group) at 5&#xD;
      and 10 years after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an experimental superiority, prospective, spontaneous, multicenter, randomized&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to two parallel arms with an allocation ratio 1:1&#xD;
      stratified by center, to receive mitral repair only (Mitral-Only group) or both mitral and&#xD;
      tricuspid repair (M &amp; T Repair group).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current guidelines recommend surgical treatment of secondary tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in&#xD;
      patients with mild or moderate TR undergoing mitral valve (MV) surgery if significant&#xD;
      dilatation of the tricuspid annulus is documented. Indeed, several observational series and&#xD;
      small randomized studies have shown that in the presence of tricuspid annulus dilatation, not&#xD;
      treating less than severe secondary TR may lead to progression of the tricuspid disease&#xD;
      despite correction of the associated left-sided lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the level of evidence C (expert opinion) confirms the absence of clear scientific&#xD;
      evidence to support this recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore very important to carry out randomized trials designed to really prove the&#xD;
      supposed efficacy of prophylactic tricuspid annuloplasty, especially in patients with&#xD;
      degenerative etiology where the data are particularly controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study will be to establish the effectiveness of the tricuspid annuloplasty in&#xD;
      the early stage. The investigators enrolled patient with TR≤2+ and annular dilation&#xD;
      undergoing mitral valve repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multicenter single-blind parallel group randomized controlled trial. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to two parallel arms with an allocation ratio 1:1, to receive one&#xD;
      of two surgical procedures. Patients that will match the inclusion criteria at the&#xD;
      preoperative evaluation will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be randomized according to a computer-generated list of casual numbers.&#xD;
      Information about patient allocation will be kept in closed opaque envelopes and nobody will&#xD;
      know patient allocation before randomization. Patients will be blind to allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day of surgery patients will be subsequently randomized into two arms with an allocation&#xD;
      ratio 1:1 stratified by center, to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. M &amp; T Repair Group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mitral-Only Group Each group will consist of 71 patients. All patients will receive the&#xD;
           mitral valve repair and in patients enrolled in the M &amp; T Repair Group an Edwards MC3&#xD;
           Tricuspid ring will be implanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-point will be the freedom from recurrence of TR≥3+ and from progression of 2&#xD;
      degrees of TR compared to pre-operative, at discharge and 12 months after surgery, assessment&#xD;
      by transthoracic echocardiography. Secondary endpoints are to demonstrate the superiority of&#xD;
      combined treatment (M &amp; T Repair Group) compared to single treatment (Mitral-Only Group) at 5&#xD;
      and 10 years after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For statistical analysis the data will be expressed as &quot;average ± standard deviation&quot; or as&#xD;
      percentage. A &quot;probability value&quot; less than 0.05 will be considered as &quot;statistically&#xD;
      significant.&quot; Outcomes will be compared using the &quot;X2&quot; analysis for categorical variables and&#xD;
      the &quot;t-test&quot; for the continuous onces. The data will be analyzed using SPSS version 11.5&#xD;
      (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA). Survival and freedom&#xD;
      from reoperation, freedom from TR≥3+ or from a progression of TR of at least 2 grades (as&#xD;
      compared to baseline), will be analyzed by the method of Kaplan-Meier. The analysis&#xD;
      &quot;univariate&quot; and possibly &quot;multivariate&quot; of risk factors will be performed with &quot;Cox&#xD;
      proportional hazards regression&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Fine and Gray model will be used in a &quot;competing risk analysis&quot; for &quot;time to TR ≥ 3+/4+&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;time to TR progression of at least 2 grades compared to baseline&quot; considering the death&#xD;
      event as competitive risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, estimates of the respective cumulative incidence (CIF) of these events in the 2&#xD;
      groups will be compared to determine the impact on such endpoints of the execution or&#xD;
      non-execution of tricuspid anuloplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to demonstrate the superiority of combined mitral and tricuspid&#xD;
      treatment (M &amp; T Repair) compared to isolated mitral repair (Mitral-Only Group) in the&#xD;
      enrolled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point is to demonstrate that, at 1 year of follow-up, the recurrence of TR≥3+&#xD;
      or the progression of TR of at least 2 degrees (compared to baseline) occurs in less than 1%&#xD;
      of the patients undergoing both mitral e tricuspid repair (M &amp; T Repair Group). The expected&#xD;
      rate for the Mitral-Only group is 15%. (Power = 80%, alpha = 0.05, Number of Patients per&#xD;
      group = 71).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are to demonstrate the superiority of the combined treatment (M &amp; T&#xD;
      Repair Group) compared to the single treatment (Mitral-Only Group) at 5 and 10 years after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
