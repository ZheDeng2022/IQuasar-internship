    <textblock>
      The present study examined the effect of Montmorency tart cherry juice and FATMAX (intensity&#xD;
      eliciting maximal fat oxidation) exercise on fat oxidation rates, body composition and&#xD;
      blood-based cardio-metabolic markers. Participants received both Montmorency tart cherry&#xD;
      juice and placebo in a random counterbalanced order for 20 days. Outcome variables were&#xD;
      measured immediately pre- and post-supplementation and 10 days after the onset of&#xD;
      supplementation. It was hypothesised that Montmorency tart cherry juice would increase fat&#xD;
      oxidation during exercise, reduce body fat percentage and improve cardio-metabolic markers.&#xD;

      Aims: (1) Examine whether tart cherry juice supplementation with cycling exercise augments&#xD;
      fat oxidation rate and therefore plays a role in weight management in healthy active human&#xD;
      participants. (2) To extrapolate findings from this study to future biomedical health and&#xD;
      disease research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Random counterbalanced, within-group, double-blind study design. Participants were&#xD;
      randomly allocated into consuming either cherry juice first or placebo. Eleven recreationally&#xD;
      active male and female participants were recruited. Participants consumed 30ml Montmorency&#xD;
      tart cherry juice concentrate mixed with 100ml water, twice daily for 20 days. Participants&#xD;
      underwent a 14 day washout period between trials. All participants were instructed to keep to&#xD;
      their habitual intake of polyphenols and anthocyanins. Twenty-four hours before each exercise&#xD;
      testing session, participants consumed similar meals at the same times. Diet adherence was&#xD;
      monitored through food diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants attended each testing session following an overnight fast, with the testing&#xD;
      being completed at the same time in the morning to avoid circadian variation. Preliminary&#xD;
      testing was conducted to ascertain VO2max and individual FATMAX, 4 days before the one hour&#xD;
      pre-supplementation exercise test. VO2max was re-assessed 4 days before the one hour&#xD;
      post-supplementation exercise test to determine if any changes in training status affected&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing will occur at baseline, 10 days after the onset of supplementation and after 20 days&#xD;
      supplementation. Exercise protocol consisted of 60min cycling at pre-determined individual&#xD;
      FATMAX. Continuous gas analysis and heart rate were monitored throughout. Substrate oxidation&#xD;
      rates and energy expenditure were calculated using stoichiometric equations (Jeukendrup and&#xD;
      Wallis, 2005). During each testing session blood pressure and body composition (impedance)&#xD;
      measurements were taken at baseline and pre-exercise during all testing sessions. Resting&#xD;
      metabolic rate (indirect calorimetry) was assessed at baseline and pre-exercise during all&#xD;
      testing sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum blood samples were obtained from participants at the following time points: baseline,&#xD;
      pre-exercise and post-exercise for one hour submaximal exercise tests, in both trials. The&#xD;
      following markers were analysed: Glucose, Lactate, Triglycerides, HDL, Total Cholesterol and&#xD;
      Total Antioxidant Status.&#xD;
