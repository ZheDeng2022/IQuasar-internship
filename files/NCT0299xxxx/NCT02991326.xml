      This study aim to contribute with the investigation of the therapeutic effect of osteopathic&#xD;
      manipulative treatment in pain intensity and Quality of Life in individuals diagnosed with&#xD;
      temporomandibular disorder who make use of occlusal splints.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known the multifactorial etiology of Temporomandibular Disorders(TMD) which raises the&#xD;
      need of a multidisciplinary approach for its treatment. Studies have presented good results&#xD;
      about the use of occlusal splints along with other therapies. The Osteopathic Manipulative&#xD;
      Treatment(OMT) has as characteristic the philosophy of global approach and precise functional&#xD;
      diagnosis. Based on a lack of randomized blind trials about this subject, This study aim to&#xD;
      contribute with the investigation of the therapeutic effect OMT in pain intensity and Quality&#xD;
      of Life in participants diagnosed with TMD making use of occlusal splints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized blind trial, with sample composed by 18 participants referred to&#xD;
      the occlusion clinic of Fluminense Federal University (UFF), diagnosed by the team of&#xD;
      dentists and interns of occlusion clinic through the Research Diagnostic Criteria for&#xD;
      Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD). The participants will complete the Short Form 36&#xD;
      Health Survey(SF-36) to measure the quality of life, and pain intensity diagram with Numeric&#xD;
      Rating Scale (NRS) to measure the pain intensity. The sample will be randomized into 2 groups&#xD;
      (9 individuals for each): Test Group (TG) - patients subject to Clinical Treatment with&#xD;
      splints (CT) offered at the Occlusion Clinic unit along with Osteopathic Manipulative&#xD;
      Treatment - OMT. Control Group (CG) - patients subject only to CT and will receive a sham&#xD;
      treatment that simulate the OMT to blind these participants. After the treatment, patients&#xD;
      will be re-evaluated in 8 weeks' time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SF-36 and the pain intensity and the most intense pain evaluation diagram with Numeric&#xD;
      Rating Scale (NRS) will be performed by the Wilcoxon's non parametric test.&#xD;
