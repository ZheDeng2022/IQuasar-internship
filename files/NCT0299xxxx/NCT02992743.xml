      This trial will evaluate safety and efficacy of Letetresgene autoleucel (GSK3377794) in&#xD;
      participants with advanced myxoid/round cell liposarcoma or high-grade myxoid liposarcoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New York esophageal antigen-1 (NY-ESO-1) and LAGE-1a antigens are tumor-associated proteins&#xD;
      that have been found in several tumor types. Clinical trials using adoptively transferred&#xD;
      T-cells directed against NY-ESO-1/LAGE-1a have shown objective responses. Letetresgene&#xD;
      autoleucel (GSK3377794) is the first generation of NY-ESO-1 specific T-cell receptor (TCR)&#xD;
      engineered T-cells. This protocol investigates Letetresgene autoleucel treatment in Human&#xD;
      Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-A*02+ participants with NY-ESO1+ advanced myxoid/round cell&#xD;
      liposarcoma or high-grade myxoid liposarcoma.&#xD;
