  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of fixed combination of ACEi+CCB (Fixed) has significantly increased&#xD;
      patients compliance and adherence to therapy. At the moment, however, there are no data&#xD;
      suggesting the better control of once-daily fixed (Fixed) over free doses in separate&#xD;
      administrations combination therapy in hypertensives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a population of 39 consecutive outpatient patients referred to the departmental&#xD;
      Hypertension clinic of the University Hospital of Salerno Medical School with the first&#xD;
      diagnosis of arterial hypertension, the investigators tested the hypothesis that the Fixed&#xD;
      achieve a better control of blood pressure than the Free combination. Patients were&#xD;
      randomized to either strategy and after 3 months patients underwent a clinical assessment to&#xD;
      evaluate the antihypertensive effect.&#xD;

      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study included 100 patients referred to the Hypertension Clinic of Salerno Medical School&#xD;
      Hospital in Salerno, with the first diagnosis of arterial hypertension and in the absence of&#xD;
      a previous treatment. At the time of enrollment visit, patients signed a consent to anonymous&#xD;
      participation, in compliance with the regulations of good clinical practice and privacy.&#xD;
      Study participants were 18-75 years old with essential hypertension (defined according to the&#xD;
      ESH / ESC 2013 guidelines). Patients were excluded if patients had secondary hypertension,&#xD;
      malignant hypertension, CRF (chronic renal failure), oncological conditions or cirrhosis.&#xD;
      Patients were also excluded if patients had medical and surgical disorders that alter&#xD;
      absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drug treatment. The study protocol was&#xD;
      approved by the competent University Hospital Ethical Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomized to either fixed dose or free dose combination therapy, with&#xD;
      Perindopril (5 or 10 mg) and Amlodipine (5 or 10 mg) with a 2:1 randomization design based on&#xD;
      a power analysis. Doses were decided according to anthropometric, clinical, biochemical and&#xD;
      instrumental doses by experienced medical staff. The Fixed group received one single tablet&#xD;
      containing Perindopril/Amlodipine at the appropriate dose. The Free group, received&#xD;
      Perindopril and Amlodipine in separate tablets at the appropriate dose. Groups were matched&#xD;
      for age, sex, BMI, systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). At baseline and at follow-up the&#xD;
      investigators evaluated clinical (weight, height, BMI, heart rate, BP) and biochemical&#xD;
      parameters (blood glucose, serum cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, blood urea nitrogen,&#xD;
      creatinine, creatinine clearance), as well as Electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with the ESH guidelines, BP assessment was carried out noting two measurements&#xD;
      in the supine, in sitting and in standing position, spaced apart from 1-2 minutes. For the&#xD;
      current study mean values in sitting position were considered. BP measurements were assessed&#xD;
      by trained personnel using a dedicated, upper arm, electronic machine (Afib screen,&#xD;
      Microlife, Italy) Anthropometric parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The weight classes were defined by BMI [weight (kg)/height (m)2]. In adults, overweight is&#xD;
      identified by a BMI of 25-29.9 kg/m2, and obesity by a BMI≥30 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, the following laboratory tests were evaluated: fasting glucose, total&#xD;
      cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine and&#xD;
      creatinine clearance (calculated with MDRD or Cockroft formula).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting blood glucose greater than 126 mg/dl was used for screening for diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up with computerized medical records&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population was included in a central database that uses Wincare software&#xD;
      (TSD-Projects, Milan, Italy), which contains separate electronic sheets for medical history,&#xD;
      physical examination, laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, cardiac ultrasounds, other imaging&#xD;
      tests and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The data was updated at each follow-up visit&#xD;
      with a revaluation deadline set at three months. The data of each patient are stored on the&#xD;
      hospital server and protected by a firewall system with password access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were subjected to one-dimensional echocardiography (M-mode), two-dimensional&#xD;
      (B-mode) and Doppler function via the 5-1MHz probe (E9, GE Healthcare).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical data are presented as percent while continuous data are indicated as means ±&#xD;
      standard error. The quantitative analysis was performed using T-test for unpaired data or&#xD;
      ANOVA as appropriate, while the qualitative analysis was performed using non-parametric tests&#xD;
      (χ2 test). A value of p-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data were&#xD;
      analyzed using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA).&#xD;
