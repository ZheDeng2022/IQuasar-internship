  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, longitudinal, prospective study for sample collection and&#xD;
      evaluation for future therapy or disease progression of chronic hepatitis B and C.&#xD;
      Participants will be seen on an annual basis with optional additional visits for up to 10&#xD;
      years and provide samples for research and evaluation of disease progression. In addition,&#xD;
      there is a longitudinal sub-study for treatment of hepatitis B that will involve 2 years of&#xD;
      treatment with tenofovir alafenamide and blood collections with optional liver biopsies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus chronically infects 350 million people worldwide and over one million&#xD;
      Americans and approximately 4.1 million individuals (1.6%) in the US population have been&#xD;
      infected with hepatitis C. These infections are the leading cause of end-stage liver disease,&#xD;
      cancer and indication for liver transplantation in the world. Both can be transmitted&#xD;
      sexually, perinatally and percutaneously. Coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
      accelerates the progression of liver disease, and due to shared modes of transmission,&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis B and C disproportionately affect people living with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to Identify people with viral hepatitis and providing&#xD;
      linkage to care and future therapy with evaluation of disease progression; as well as&#xD;
      characterizing those with hepatitis B and those treated for hepatitis C with directly acting&#xD;
      antivirals over the course of 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study, including a participant questionnaire and phlebotomy, will be administered on-site&#xD;
      at clinical facilities in the District of Columbia and Maryland, and at the Institute of&#xD;
      Human Virology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. The cohort will be designed to study&#xD;
      research questions with respect to liver disease, disease pathogenesis using genomics,&#xD;
      proteomics, and immunologic disease models. Secondary objectives include study of the&#xD;
      immunopathogenesis of hepatitis B and C disease progression. In addition, this is an&#xD;
      invaluable opportunity to evaluate the long term effects of hepatitis C clearance with direct&#xD;
      acting antivirals, along with biomarker profile(s) for diagnosis and outcome. Moreover, this&#xD;
      will serve as a catchment protocol to select appropriate participants for novel hepatitis B&#xD;
      and C therapeutic trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes a standard-of-care treatment sub-study for patients with hepatitis B. In&#xD;
      this sub-study, participants will receive an approved nucleos(t)ide analogue prospectively&#xD;
      observed on therapy for change in liver fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The integrated clinics will provide an optimal environment for the adherence and engagement&#xD;
      of medical care and education in decreasing transmission risks of infection. The study will&#xD;
      establish a blood and specimen repository for participants and include a research database&#xD;
      that will be used prospectively to test future hypotheses.&#xD;

    <description>Participants with chronic hepatitis C infection; includes both hepatitis C mono infected and hepatitis C-HIV coinfected.

    <description>Participants with chronic hepatitis B: includes patients with hepatitis B with and without hepatitis C and/or HIV. Participants will attend study visits for research blood draws (once a year with optional additional visits), and a one-time optional knowledge questionnaire. Participants who are already taking hepatitis B treatment are eligible.&#xD;
Hepatitis B treatment sub-study: In this treatment sub-study, participants with hepatitis B monoinfection will receive tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) pill once a day for 2 years with study visits every 3 months. Liver transient elastography will be reviewed or obtained. In addition, approximately 40 participants will be invited to undergo optional liver biopsies at the start, end of year 1 and end of year 2 of the sub-study.</description>
