      The purpose of this study is to assess whether two methods of breathing support in babies&#xD;
      called 'Humidified High-Flow Nasal Cannula' oxygen (HHFNC) and 'nasal Continuous Positive&#xD;
      Airways Pressure' (nCPAP) are compatible with breastfeeding. Many babies who are premature or&#xD;
      unwell after birth require help with their breathing. This is often achieved by blowing a&#xD;
      continuous flow of air through the nose and down into the lungs in order to reduce the amount&#xD;
      of effort the baby needs to inflate the lungs during breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently some centres allow babies to breastfeed whilst undergoing breathing support whilst&#xD;
      other centres do not in case there is an increased risk of choking or other harmful events.&#xD;
      In the latter case, babies are fed using a nasogastric tube (NGT) that runs from the baby's&#xD;
      nostrils into their stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this centre, babies are allowed to breastfeed whilst simultaneously on either HHFNC or&#xD;
      nCPAP. This is because the concerns over the choking risk are not evidence based. This study&#xD;
      aims to conclusively prove that thisfeeding protocol is safe and then to expand into other&#xD;
      areas of research to find out the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether breastfeeding during nCPAP or HHFNC leads to babies establishing full&#xD;
           breastfeeding sooner (and subsequently reduce the length of their stay in hospital)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What the effects of breastfeeding of nCPAP or HHFNC are on a baby's parents (e.g.&#xD;
           whether it enhances bonding)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If nCPAP and HHFNC have different effects on breastfeeding As part of this study the&#xD;
           investigators will observe stable babies on nCPAP or HHFNC during breastfeeding&#xD;
           episodes. The investigators will monitor the babies for signs of distress or instability&#xD;
           and whether they are more stable when breastfeeding is not occurring. This will be&#xD;
           compared to an episode where the same baby is fed by NGT to see which technique is&#xD;
           better.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Breastfeeding infants receiving respiratory support (nCPAP or HHFNC) is a&#xD;
      controversial topic. Expert consensus has been that feeding should be delayed until&#xD;
      respiratory support (including nCPAP or HHFNC) is no longer needed. Data from animal models&#xD;
      suggests that nasal CPAP can affect swallowing behaviour in infant animals but the magnitude&#xD;
      and clinical significance of any effect is unclear even in animals. Studies in adults are&#xD;
      also lacking but some have shown that swallowing can be impaired during CPAP therapy. There&#xD;
      is no research into whether HHFNC has similar effects in any of the above populations. There&#xD;
      is currently no published data on the safety or efficacy of breastfeeding infants receiving&#xD;
      respiratory support via nasal CPAP or HHFNC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      nCPAP is a key intervention in the current care of many babies as it is the preferred mode of&#xD;
      non-invasive respiratory support and compared to conventional mechanical ventilation it has&#xD;
      been shown to reduce the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia . HHFNC oxygen has emerged&#xD;
      as another method of respiratory support. It has been shown that it is non-inferior to nCPAP&#xD;
      following extubation although it is clear that the mechanics of flow delivery differ from&#xD;
      nCPAP. There is some evidence that HHFNC use is associated with a reduction in some adverse&#xD;
      effects when compared with nCPAP, such as nasal trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some infants, especially infants born very preterm, spend prolonged periods on nasal CPAP or&#xD;
      HHFNC. Normal oral feeding is often delayed in these children because respiratory support is&#xD;
      needed. It has been shown that premature infants can show breastfeeding cues from a very&#xD;
      early stage and if infants are given the opportunity breastfeeding can be well established.&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that early introduction of oral feeding in preterm neonates is not&#xD;
      associated with adverse outcomes and leads to earlier establishment of full oral feeding and&#xD;
      discharge home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY There is uncertainty surrounding the safety of breastfeeding&#xD;
      babies on nasal nCPAP or HHFNC. There is great disparity in clinical practice between&#xD;
      neonatal units. At our department babies on respiratory support have traditionally been&#xD;
      offered the chance to breastfeed. Local experience is that this is not associated with&#xD;
      adverse events. When compared to other units internationally (as part of the Vermont-Oxford&#xD;
      Network of neonatal units) our unit does not have an excess of complications due to this&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establishing the safety of breastfeeding whilst receiving nCPAP or HHFNC will provide&#xD;
      clinicians with the information necessary to decide when breastfeeding should be attempted in&#xD;
      infants needing ongoing respiratory support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition the study team want to use this opportunity to establish the feasibility of&#xD;
      future studies. If breastfeeding on nCPAP and HHFNC is safe the study team want to prepare&#xD;
      for further investigation in this field looking at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether infants being breastfed on nCPAP and HHFNC can show progression from immature to&#xD;
           mature feeding behaviours and if this ultimately leads to earlier establishment of full&#xD;
           oral feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What impact being breastfed on nCPAP or HHFNC has on the parents of these babies. If&#xD;
           breastfeeding on nCPAP and HHFNC help bonding this would be another important factor to&#xD;
           consider.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To prepare to compare HHFNC and nCPAP to see if the effects they have on breastfeeding&#xD;
           differ. If nCPAP or HHFNC is superior to the other this may affect clinician decision on&#xD;
           which to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clarity in this field will enable clinicians to make safe decisions about when infants&#xD;
      receiving respiratory support should be allowed to breastfeed aiding delivery of optimal&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this prospective observational study is to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that breastfeeding infants undergoing nCPAP or HHFNC is safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to test the feasibility of future studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the feasibility of testing the hypothesis that breastfeeding preterm&#xD;
           infants while treated with nCPAP or HHFNC leads to faster establishment of full enteral&#xD;
           feeds as this could allow patients to benefit from earlier discharge home. This study&#xD;
           will show whether the methods used are acceptable to parents and capture the outcome&#xD;
           data required. Data gathered will give information on the standard deviation of outcomes&#xD;
           to enable accurate sample size calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the feasibility of assessing parental perception of breastfeeding babies&#xD;
           receiving respiratory support and the effect it has on bonding. Questionnaire responses&#xD;
           and feedback from parents will be reviewed to investigate their feeidng issues and&#xD;
           concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the feasibility of comparing nCPAP and HHFNC to evaluate whether they&#xD;
           have different effects breastfeeding for infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN Prospective, observational, single centre safety study. Recruitment will occur&#xD;
      over a one-year period. Parents will initially be approached by members of the healthcare&#xD;
      team. With their consent they will then be contacted by a member of the BIRRST team and&#xD;
      informed about the details of the study. Written consent from the parents must be obtained in&#xD;
      order to include a patient. It will be explained to parents that it is common practise to&#xD;
      offer infants to be breast fed while still on respiratory support in this unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No change will be made to the management of babies enrolled in this study. Babies will be&#xD;
      observed during feeding episodes but the timing of these feeds, whether a baby will be fed by&#xD;
      breastfeeding or NGT and all details relating to how a feed is administered are decisions&#xD;
      that will be made by the nursing team looking after a baby (in conjunction with the baby's&#xD;
      parents). The study team will have no influence or say in these decisions and will just&#xD;
      observe standard practice for this unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 infants will be recruited, 25 infants treated with nCPAP and 25 infants treated with HHFNC&#xD;
      while breast feeding attempts are made. Each child is estimated to have between 4 and 6&#xD;
      observations. There will be no crossover between the respiratory support modalities. Infants&#xD;
      without any respiratory support will no longer be eligible or included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      130 paired observations of breastfeeding and NGT feeding during nCPAP treatment will be made.&#xD;
      In addition 130 paired observations of breastfeeding and NGT feeding while babies are on&#xD;
      HHFNC will be made. Each infant will serve as its own control as feeding episodes will be&#xD;
      paired so that a breastfeed and an NGT feed are both observed within a 12 hour period. This&#xD;
      will minimise variation caused by changes in the infants' condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unlikely that infants will be able to obtain sufficient volume of milk while learning&#xD;
      to breastfeed and so after each breastfeeding attempt the babies will be offered a top-up via&#xD;
      NGT to ensure they receive their required feed volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a baby is enrolled in the study feeding episodes will be regularly observed (as is&#xD;
      feasible with respect to staff availability and parental presence). If a baby is too unwell&#xD;
      to be observed this will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the observation the baby's stability during the preceding hour will be evaluated and&#xD;
      recorded. During a feeding episode all infants will be directly observed for a 30 minute&#xD;
      period during which they will either receive a breast feed with a subsequent NGT top up or&#xD;
      solely an NGT feed. Subsequently the baby's stability over the following hour will be&#xD;
      retrospectively assessed. All infants will receive continuous nCPAP or HHFNC throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a feeding episode heart rate and oxygen saturation will be continuously monitored&#xD;
      using pulse oximetry. Apnoea monitors will be used to assess episodes of apnoea. Axillary&#xD;
      temperature will be assessed at the beginning and end of the feeding episode. The oxygen&#xD;
      requirement will be measured from the CPAP/HHFNC machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stability of the neonate during each feeding episode will be compared with their&#xD;
      stability over the preceding hour by reviewing the documented incidence of desaturations,&#xD;
      bradycardias and apnoeas and the neonate's temperature on their observation chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of breastfeeding will be assessed using videos of breastfeeding episodes. These&#xD;
      videos will be reviewed by trained assessors (Speech and Language Therapists with an interest&#xD;
      in lactation from Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust) who will use the PIBBS tool to&#xD;
      assess the quality of feeding. They will look for feeding behaviours to assess the maturity&#xD;
      of feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial feeding episodes will be compared to assess whether there is a progression from more&#xD;
      immature to mature feeding as the babies have breastfeeding opportunities on CPAP or HHFNC.&#xD;
      This data will be used to assess whether future studies in this area to explore how feeding&#xD;
      behaviours progress would be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will also be recorded at what corrected gestational age/actual age these babies establish&#xD;
      oral feeding; how they are fed at discharge (breast or bottle) and what milk they are&#xD;
      discharged home on. This data will allow planning of future studies to assess whether early&#xD;
      attempts at breastfeeding whilst receiving CPAP or HHFNC help the establishment of full&#xD;
      breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parental perception of feeding with respiratory support will be assessed using a parental&#xD;
      questionnaire. This will use a visual analogue scale to assess whether parents feel that&#xD;
      breastfeeding during respiratory support is beneficial to their infants overall care and what&#xD;
      impact the feeding opportunities has had on their bonding with their baby. This data will be&#xD;
      used to assess the feasibility of further studies in this area by establishing the parental&#xD;
      tolerance of breastfeeding babies receiving respiratory support and developing a&#xD;
      questionnaire that will effectively explore the parental experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected for nCPAP and HHFNC separately will be used to establish the sample size&#xD;
      that will be required in future studies to compare the two modalities to see if there are&#xD;
      significant differences between the two (in terms of safety, efficacy and parental&#xD;
      tolerance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS Analysis of the pilot study data suggested that desaturation was&#xD;
      the most common adverse event associated with feeding during nCPAP or HHFNC treatment. The&#xD;
      sample size has been calculated to show a significant difference based on the results from&#xD;
      the pilot data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      128 feeding episodes are required to get 80% power at the 5% significance level to find a&#xD;
      difference in mean duration of desaturation episodes of 1.25 minutes, based on a standard&#xD;
      deviation for changes in this outcome of 5 (taken from pilot data). This is felt to be a&#xD;
      clinically significant increase in desaturation episodes over a 30 minute period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feeding episodes may come from around 25 babies. As each baby acts as its own control&#xD;
      (because each breastfeeding episode is paired with an episode of NGT feeding occurring within&#xD;
      24 hours) the sample size is dependent on the number of feeding episodes observed, not the&#xD;
      number of babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: paired t-test of mean duration of desaturation. McNemar's test to compared paired&#xD;
      proportions between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and all appropriate documentation will be stored for 5 years after the completion of the&#xD;
      study, including the follow-up period.&#xD;
