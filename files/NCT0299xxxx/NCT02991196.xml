  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is being performed in two parts: Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective for the Dose Escalation part is to determine the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability at different doses of DS-8273a administered in combination with nivolumab and to&#xD;
      identify the dose combination for the Dose Expansion cohort in subjects with mismatch repair&#xD;
      (MMR)-proficient advanced colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives for the Dose Expansion part are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To further evaluate the safety and tolerability of DS-8273a administered at the selected&#xD;
           dose in combination with nivolumab in subjects with MMR-proficient advanced colorectal&#xD;
           cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity of DS-8273a plus nivolumab administered at&#xD;
           the selected dose in subjects with MMR-proficient advanced colorectal cancer&#xD;

    <measure>Dose Escalation Part: Number of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the first treatment cycle (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT is defined as a study drug-related ≥ Grade 3 Adverse Event (AE) occurring during the first cycle (28 days) of treatment, with specific exceptions for hematologic events, elevations in hepatic function enzymes, and adverse events that are pre-identified as not being DLTs.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Parts: Number of Participants with Clinically Significant Safety Parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Safety parameters will include adverse events that are serious (SAEs), treatment emergent (TEAEs), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), physical examination findings (including Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] Performance Status), vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory parameters (serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), immune-related (ir) adverse events (irAEs), anti-drug antibody (ADA), and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dose Escalation Part: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD is defined as the highest dose of DS-8273a in combination with the tested dose of nivolumab that results in a DLT in less than one-third of the subjects enrolled at that dose level of at least 6 evaluable subjects. However, AEs that meet the definition of DLT appearing at later cycles will also be considered for the determination of MTD and selection of the Dose Expansion dose. If the MTD is not reached at 1200 mg of DS-8273a IV Q2W, this highest tested dose may be selected as the maximum administered dose (MAD).</description>
