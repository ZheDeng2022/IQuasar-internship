      Pain is the most common reason patients consult primary care providers. According to recent&#xD;
      surveys, One in six Americans live with chronic or recurrent pain and pay an estimated $120&#xD;
      billion a year in medical costs in the United States. Oral opioids are the common treatment&#xD;
      options for various chronic pains including joint pain, musculoskeletal pain, neuropathic&#xD;
      pain and migraines. This narcotic-based management of pain is often associated with&#xD;
      undesirable side effects with addictive and potential abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure proper usage of prescribed medications, physicians use drug screens to monitor&#xD;
      therapeutic levels and test for presence of illegal drugs or medications that may cause a&#xD;
      drug-drug interaction. Upon receiving quantitative or qualitative results from these drug&#xD;
      screens, the physician may change the treatment plan for patients to improve efficacy of&#xD;
      prescribed medications.&#xD;
