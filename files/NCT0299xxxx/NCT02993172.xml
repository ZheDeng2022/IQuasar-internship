      The Copenhagen City Heart Study is an ongoing cardiovascular population study initiated in&#xD;
      1976 which has examined approximately 25,000 individuals from the general population. The&#xD;
      initial sample has been re-invited up to four times and supplemented by younger individuals.&#xD;
      The study includes questionnaires, clinical assessment and biomarkers. The population have&#xD;
      been followed in a number of outcome registries and more than 900 scientific papers have been&#xD;
      published.&#xD;

      The Copenhagen City Heart Study, also known as &quot;Østerbroundersøgelsen&quot;, is a large&#xD;
      prospective cardio-vascular population study of 20,000 women and men that was launched in&#xD;
      1975 by Dr Peter Schnohr and Dr Gorm Jensen together with statistician Jørgen Nyboe and Prof.&#xD;
      A. Tybjærg Hansen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original purpose of the study was to focus on prevention of coronary heart disease and&#xD;
      stroke. During the years many other aspects have been added to the study: pulmonary diseases,&#xD;
      heart failure, arrhythmia, alcohol, arthrosis, eye diseases, allergy, epilepsia, dementia,&#xD;
      stress, vital exhaustion, social network, sleep-apnoe, ageing and genetics. In the fourth and&#xD;
      fifth wave of the examination echocardiography was included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Copenhagen City Heart Study has invited a random sample of the census population in an&#xD;
      area of central Copenhagen in five waves. The primary population was a random sample of&#xD;
      19,329 men and women 20-93 years old, drawn from a population of approximately 90,000&#xD;
      inhabitants aged 20 years or older living in a central part of Copenhagen (Østerbro). Using&#xD;
      the unique personal identification number (Central-Personal-Register-code), consisting of&#xD;
      date of birth and a registration number, the sample was age-stratified within 5-year age&#xD;
      groups, with the main emphasis on the age groups from 35 to 70 years. The total number of&#xD;
      participants invited to the first four examinations was: 19,329+500+3,000+1,062 = 23,891 men&#xD;
      and women. Of the original 14,223 examined at the first examination 3,092 (21.7%) have been&#xD;
      examined in all four examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of mortality and morbidity using the unique personal identification number is&#xD;
      performed by linkage to a number of nation-wide disease registries. Follow-up completion rate&#xD;
      is almost 100 percent (less than 0.1% have been lost to follow-up mainly through emigration),&#xD;
      which is very uncommon for large population studies.&#xD;
