    <textblock>
      In 2011, the premiers of all Canadian provinces and territories selected diabetes foot care&#xD;
      as one of three significant targets for pan-provincial action. The Diabetes Foot Care&#xD;
      Clinical Pathway Project (DFCCPP) aims to optimize methods of early detection and treatment&#xD;
      of foot ulcers in an effort to reduce lower limb amputation (LLA) by 50%. The DFCCPP key&#xD;
      deliverables apply consistency in assessment, care, treatment and process standards, early&#xD;
      intervention and complex wound care management, while optimizing health outcomes. To achieve&#xD;
      these deliverables, High Risk Foot Teams (HRFTs) will be implemented across the province&#xD;
      starting with three pilot sites (Slave Lake, Brooks, and outpatient clinics at the Peter&#xD;
      Lougheed Hospital). The pilot site facilities were selected on the basis of their employing&#xD;
      staff with expertise and knowledge in diabetic foot care. The HRFT will assess and treat&#xD;
      patients with moderate and high-risk findings, and this care pathway will then be rolled out&#xD;
      to all clinicians who perform diabetic foot assessments (Primary Care, Home Care, Diabetes&#xD;
      Centers, First Nations Reserves, etc.). In conjunction with the DFCCPP, we will evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of a technological device developed by Alberta-based small-medium enterprise (SME)&#xD;
      to improve diabetic foot outcomes by preventing future wounds in high-risk patients who have&#xD;
      recently been treated for active foot ulcers. This technology is the SurroSense Rx® smart&#xD;
      insole system (Orpyx Medical Technologies Inc., Calgary AB), a device that provides dynamic&#xD;
      offloading guidance to patients, in addition to enabling ongoing adherence tracking by the&#xD;
      HRFT. It is hypothesized that early wound detection and treatment will ultimately lead to&#xD;
      improvements in wound prevalence, chronic wound care, and reduce the need for surgical&#xD;
      intervention, including LLA.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Canadian Institute of Health Information estimates that foot wounds (with diabetes as the&#xD;
      leading cause) are present in 4% of all hospital inpatients, 7% of homecare clients and 10%&#xD;
      of long-term care (LTC) residents. Of 210,000 people with diabetes in Alberta, 5,250 will&#xD;
      seek treatment of a foot ulcer annually. In Alberta in 2014-15 there were 425 LLAs performed&#xD;
      on 309 diabetic patients representing an increase of 89 LLA over 2010-11. Moreover, there is&#xD;
      a tremendous reduction in quality of life of the patients and attendant negative effects on&#xD;
      their families. The 5-year mortality rate after a new-onset diabetic foot ulcer is 43-55%,&#xD;
      and is as high as 74% for patients undergoing LLA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous monitoring of the diabetic foot and preventative foot care is of utmost importance&#xD;
      for patients with diabetes. This is especially the case in high risk patients who have&#xD;
      previously had foot ulcers. Improving and standardizing diabetic foot screening, early wound&#xD;
      detection and treatment will ultimately lead to improvements in wound prevalence, chronic&#xD;
      wound care, and the need for surgical intervention, including amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective pressure offloading is a key tenet of diabetic ulcer prevention and care. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of offloading interventions is intimately linked to the skin reperfusion that&#xD;
      is seen when persistent external pressure is alleviated. Key modifiable parameters in&#xD;
      mitigating tissue damage to the neuropathic foot are pressure and time. Exposures from 15 min&#xD;
      to one hour at pressures greater than 240 mmHg, and from two hours or more at pressures&#xD;
      greater than 67 mmHg, were found to cause cell death in rat muscle tissue. Despite this,&#xD;
      there is limited information regarding the efficacy of interventions aimed at preventing&#xD;
      pressure ulcers; a comprehensive review of the literature did not find enough evidence to&#xD;
      recommend a repositioning frequency. A consensus document from an international review on&#xD;
      pressure ulcer prevention states &quot;patients confined to wheelchairs should be taught to&#xD;
      reposition every 15 minutes&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While established pressure offloading interventions are able to statically reduce pressure on&#xD;
      the active ulcer, they provide no dynamic relief of pressure. Since neuropathy is&#xD;
      characterized by a loss of protective sensation (LOPS), the patient is often unaware of&#xD;
      sustained pressure on a specific anatomic region over time. Even with static offloading&#xD;
      instruments, it is conceivable that critical pressure and time thresholds can be dynamically&#xD;
      exceeded without the patient's knowledge or ability to address the problem. Taken together,&#xD;
      the literature provides support for a system that monitors pressure over time at key&#xD;
      locations, and provides alert-based feedback to guide as-needed, patient-based offloading for&#xD;
      use in patients with active ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orpyx Medical Technologies Inc. (Orpyx), has developed a smart insole technology (the&#xD;
      &quot;SurroSense Rx®&quot;) that senses pressure points in the user'splantar foot. This is important&#xD;
      because pressure &quot;hot spots&quot; can lead to wound development that, if left untreated, can&#xD;
      progress to a foot ulcer and LLA. Individuals able to maintain lower in-shoe peak pressures&#xD;
      had 60% lower risk of foot ulcer recurrence. Unpublished studies with this device are&#xD;
      demonstrating an 83% relative risk reduction in plantar ulceration in active versus control&#xD;
      arms. This device provides dynamic offloading guidance to patients, in addition to enabling&#xD;
      ongoing adherence tracking. This device has been shown to be an effective treatment in the&#xD;
      management of diabetic foot patients at risk for ulcers, with respect to the care of active&#xD;
      ulcers, in addition to prevention of future recurrence. Wearers of the SurroSense Rx®&#xD;
      technology are provided with on demand cues for offloading, and should therefore have&#xD;
      enhanced responsiveness and self-control over their foot care, thereby leading to a reduction&#xD;
      in re-ulcerative events and thus, LLA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SurroSense Rx® system is a patent pending (US Publication 20120109013 and PCT&#xD;
      WO/2012/055029) footwear system intended to prevent first and recurrent plantar ulcers, and&#xD;
      to treat active ulcers in neuropathic patients. It comprises two pressure-sensing inserts and&#xD;
      a smartwatch display device. The device alerts the user when &quot;safe&quot; pressure and time&#xD;
      thresholds have been exceeded; the current thresholds are based on the results of a&#xD;
      comprehensive review of the literature, which indicates that a conservative threshold would&#xD;
      be &gt;30-50mmHg for &gt;15 minutes. As more plantar pressure and outcome data are collected over&#xD;
      time, these thresholds may be modified as need be. The device measures plantar pressures at&#xD;
      discrete points corresponding to bony prominences that would be considered to be at higher&#xD;
      risk for ulceration: the first metatarsal head (1), the lateral metatarsal heads (2), the&#xD;
      great toe (1), the lateral toes (1), the lateral foot (2), and the heel (1). These areas were&#xD;
      selected based on the inherent high risk of neuropathic ulceration at these anatomic&#xD;
      locations. This data is tracked, with analysis being performed on those that have been&#xD;
      collected over the last 15 minutes. If &gt; 95% of the measurements taken by a pressure sensor&#xD;
      over a 15-minute scanning window exceed 30-50 mmHg, an alert is sent to the user via the&#xD;
      smartwatch to guide them to appropriately offload that area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SurroSense Rx® device will be used as an adjunct in the treatment pathway following&#xD;
      closure of diabetic foot wounds. It is widely acknowledged that, following wound healing,&#xD;
      50-100% of diabetic foot ulcers recur over a five-year period. What is more, it is estimated&#xD;
      that after 18 months, 42% of ulcers recur, with half of those recurring in the first six&#xD;
      months. Thus, it is the first six months following wound healing that is the most sensitive&#xD;
      time for recurrence of ulceration. It is this critical patient population that will be fitted&#xD;
      with the SurroSense Rx® device for secondary prevention of ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, diabetes patients with foot wounds are at an elevated risk of infection and&#xD;
      LLA. Therefore, there is a need for an effective tool for the prevention and management of&#xD;
      the diabetic foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does improving and standardizing foot screening for diabetes patients through the DFCCP&#xD;
      concurrently with the use of the SurroSense Rx® smart insole system reduce the proportion of&#xD;
      foot ulcer recurrence compared to patients who are receiving standard care? The objective of&#xD;
      this proposal is to demonstrate that when combined with the DFCCP, the SurroSense Rx® smart&#xD;
      insole system device is an effective modality that is superior to the current standard of&#xD;
      care for preventing the recurrence of healed pressure ulcerations on the feet of subjects&#xD;
      with diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the lower extremities. It is hypothesized that the use&#xD;
      of the device will lead to a reduction in the risk of pressure ulcer recurrence in the&#xD;
      Intervention group and to improve those subjects' foot self-care, when compared to subjects&#xD;
      in the Control group. Over the longer term we anticipate that use of the technology in&#xD;
      concert with the DFCCP will result in better foot health for diabetic patients. The ability&#xD;
      to test the efficacy of the SurroSense Rx® device in parallel with the DFCCP implementation&#xD;
      will allow the evaluation in a real-world setting where patients also have access to HRFT for&#xD;
      prescription of the device. High Risk Foot Teams will be implemented across the province&#xD;
      starting with three pilot sites (Slave Lake, Brooks, and the Diabetic Foot and Limb&#xD;
      Preservation Centre at the Peter Lougheed Hospital), These pilot sites will be selected as&#xD;
      facilities have existing staff with expertise and knowledge in diabetic foot care. The HRFT&#xD;
      will assess and treat patients with moderate and high-risk findings. The AICE-funded project&#xD;
      is a sub-study. All patients are clinically assessed in a standardized manner using the&#xD;
      Alberta Foot Risk Assessment Form (AFRAF), which incorporates a standardized wound assessment&#xD;
      and treatment approach.ces, ongoing assessment and embedded evaluation.&#xD;
