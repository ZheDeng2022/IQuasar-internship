      The purpose of this study is to better understand how female sex hormones influence the food&#xD;
      intake in the gut system through the release of satiety hormones as well as through central&#xD;
      regulative mechanisms in the brain that subsequently contribute to the control of eating in&#xD;
      healthy women at different stages of the ovarian cycle.&#xD;

      Obesity and the associated severe consequences for health, i.e. cardiovascular diseases or&#xD;
      Diabetes Type 2 reach the world-wide level of an epidemic with excessive eating as major&#xD;
      cause of this development. Study results of veterinary physiology as well as in women let&#xD;
      assume that steroid hormones, such as estrogen or progesterone are highly involved in the&#xD;
      regulation of eating behavior and the female body weight. This connection is underpinned with&#xD;
      the fact that prevalence of adiposity is increased in women in comparison to men in the&#xD;
      United States, Switzerland and further countries. A better understanding of the underlying&#xD;
      regulatory mechanisms, which in turn influence the food intake in the gut system through the&#xD;
      release of satiety hormones as well as through central regulative mechanisms in the brain,&#xD;
      provides important foundation in long-term development of new prophylactic and therapeutic&#xD;
      options in reduction and prevention of obesity. This gets even more important, as current&#xD;
      therapeutic options - beside bariatric surgery - could only show limited success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satiety is a process in the brain that leads to a meal being ended, whereby the ingested food&#xD;
      causes a reflexive negative feedback mechanism. This mechanism is both fundamentally and&#xD;
      specifically in the acute situation strongly influenced through subjective parameters, e.g.&#xD;
      eating desires, socio-cultural factors, current social circumstances and individual relation&#xD;
      towards eating. Furthermore, food intake is also influenced by genetic factors, whereas e.g.&#xD;
      TaqIA1 allele is known to be associated with obesity. According to current knowledge,&#xD;
      regulation takes place on peripheral as well as on central level, whereas not only steroid&#xD;
      hormones but also satiety hormones - especially cholecystokinin (CCK) and glucagon-like&#xD;
      peptide-1 (GLP-1) - are involved on both levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims to examine the connection of steroid hormones, gastrointestinal&#xD;
      satiety hormones and neuronal activity in the brain through fMRI. Through the obtained data,&#xD;
      the interaction between defined hormone constellations, gastrointestinal satiety hormones and&#xD;
      the activation of specific brain areas in obese and normal-weight women should be evaluated.&#xD;
      The study design involves the comparison of subjective, hedonic evaluation of different&#xD;
      flavoured liquids with different caloric content each through a rating scale as well as&#xD;
      objective peripheral (release of CCK and GLP-1) and central (activation of involved brain&#xD;
      centres through fMRI) regulation processes in fasted and fed condition of each woman in the&#xD;
      two study groups (obese and normal-weighted) in late follicular compared with the luteal&#xD;
      phase of ovarian cycle.&#xD;
