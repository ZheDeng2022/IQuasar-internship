  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who have undergone breast cancer surgery may develop swelling of the arm on the side&#xD;
      the breast cancer occurred. If the swelling becomes chronic it is called lymphedema. This&#xD;
      study will examine the effect of a 12-week decongestive progressive resistance exercise with&#xD;
      advanced compression on breast cancer related lymphedema. Our objective is to determine if&#xD;
      breast cancer survivors are willing and able to wear advanced compression while exercising&#xD;
      and if the combination will help to reduce their lymphedema. Twenty-four breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors from Edmonton, Alberta will be enrolled in the one-year long study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema is a swelling in the arm, chest wall and breast on the side of the breast cancer.&#xD;
      Arm lymphedema develops as a result of breast cancer surgery and/ or radiation therapy.&#xD;
      Compression therapy and exercise are commonly prescribed treatment to help reduce the arm&#xD;
      swelling and to maintain the result. The exercise that is usually prescribed for lymphedema&#xD;
      is called decongestive remedial exercise. It involves active, non-resisted movements that&#xD;
      follow a specific order from proximal to distal and back proximally. The exercises start at&#xD;
      the neck, move to the chest wall and then down the arm, and back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two different types of compression garments have been proposed to help reduce swelling when&#xD;
      women are exercising. One compression garment is made with a stiffer, less elastic type of&#xD;
      material and is called a &quot;flat-knit&quot; garment. The other garment, the &quot;Adjustable Compression&#xD;
      Wrap&quot; is a garment with an adjustable elastic strapping system that helps to reinforce the&#xD;
      compression on the arm. Recent research suggests that these specialized garments enhance the&#xD;
      muscle pump effect on lymph flow; however, no research has been conducted to test whether&#xD;
      this actually results in improvements in arm lymphedema volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance exercise training helps to improve arm flexibility, strength, function, and&#xD;
      quality of life in breast cancer survivors. Recent evidence has shown that breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors with lymphedema, can safely perform resistance training (strength training),&#xD;
      however, there is no impact (better or worse) on arm lymphedema volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no studies have been performed combining all potential therapeutic approaches for&#xD;
      lymphedema management: resistance exercise, a therapeutic decongestive exercise sequence, and&#xD;
      compression therapy. Women in the experimental arms of this study will wear a compression&#xD;
      garment when performing progressive resistance exercise that follows the decongestive&#xD;
      sequence. We will examine the effect of the combined intervention on arm lymphedema volume,&#xD;
      function and quality of life.&#xD;
