    <textblock>
      Conventional vascular imaging techniques are often either contra-indicated in chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (CKD) patients due to their relative invasiveness, risks and cost. Computed&#xD;
      tomography angiography (CTA) requires radiation and nephrotoxic iodinated contrast which may&#xD;
      precipitate significant worsening of renal function and even prompt the need for institution&#xD;
      of dialysis. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) using gadolinium-based contrast agents has&#xD;
      been associated with the rare disease nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Alternative imaging&#xD;
      methods also have drawbacks: for example, this frail patient group has a higher risk of&#xD;
      complications from conventional invasive catheter-based angiography, non-contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      MRA allows visualization of smaller arteries but is less accurate for larger vascular&#xD;
      structures, and ultrasound is often not appropriate for evaluation of the deep vessels of the&#xD;
      abdomen and pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ferumoxytol is an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particle encapsulated by a&#xD;
      semisynthetic carbohydrate, which was initially developed as a magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) contrast agent in 2000. However, interest in ferumoxytol as a therapeutic agent for the&#xD;
      treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in the setting of CKD eclipsed its use as MRI contrast&#xD;
      agent. During the last decade, ferumoxytol has gained appeal as an MRI contrast agent in&#xD;
      patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates &lt;30mL/min and there are reports in the&#xD;
      literature for its safe use and utility in both adult and pediatric patients with CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be selected from those who have been referred for assessment prior to&#xD;
      kidney transplant or prior to vascular access creation for haemodialysis and will be divided&#xD;
      into three groups. The first group will include patients who will undergo a CTA of abdominal&#xD;
      and aortoiliac vasculature as part of their preparation for potential kidney transplantation.&#xD;
      The second and third groups will include patients who are having a fistula or a graft created&#xD;
      for dialysis, respectively. These patients are routinely having US vascular mapping to&#xD;
      visualise the blood vessels before a fistula or a graft is created. Additionally, patients&#xD;
      included in the second and third groups are routinely having surveillance scans of their&#xD;
      fistula or graft at 6 weeks following creation. Study participants undergoing standard&#xD;
      imaging tests as part of their clinical care will also have ferumoxytol-enhanced MRA (FeMRA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a comparative study in a cohort of patients with significant renal impairment. Study&#xD;
      participants undergoing standard imaging tests as part of their clinical care will also have&#xD;
      FeMRA. The investigators will compare outcomes of interest including quality of image and&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy in a head-to-head design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These hypotheses will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. FeMRA is superior to CTA for characterisation of abdominal and aortoiliac anatomy&#xD;
           (pre-transplant assessment) before implantation of a kidney graft as it can robustly&#xD;
           evaluate both arterial and venous anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. FeMRA is superior to Doppler US for characterisation of vascular anatomy (vascular&#xD;
           mapping) before vascular access creation as it can robustly assess central vein patency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. FeMRA is superior to Doppler US for characterisation of fistula (or graft) arm vascular&#xD;
           anatomy (surveillance) at 6 weeks after fistula creation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Integrated cardiac and vascular assessment using FeMRA before vascular access creation&#xD;
           can better predict outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be selected from those who have been referred for assessment prior to kidney&#xD;
      transplant or prior to vascular access creation for haemodialysis and will be divided into 3&#xD;
      different groups. The first group (group A) will include patients who are having CTA of&#xD;
      abdominal and aortoiliac vasculature performed for pre-transplant assessment. The other two&#xD;
      groups will include patients who are having US vascular mapping performed before&#xD;
      arteriovenous fistula (group B) or synthetic graft (group C) creation for haemodialysis.&#xD;
      These patients are routinely having US Doppler of their fistula arm at 6 weeks following&#xD;
      access creation for surveillance. FeMRA will be performed in addition to standard care, i.e.&#xD;
      patients in group A will have a single FeMRA at baseline while patients in groups B and C&#xD;
      will have a FeMRA at baseline and a second one at 6 weeks. All patients will undergo Cardiac&#xD;
      MR with Ferumoxytol at the same time. This is to assess whether cardiac parameters before&#xD;
      transplantation or access creation are associated with outcomes (baseline Cardiac MR). The&#xD;
      6-weeks Cardiac MR aims to assess cardiovascular functional parameters (blood flow, cardiac&#xD;
      output, systolic and diastolic function) after vascular access creation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging will be performed on a 3T Prisma (Siemens) MRI system. A total dose of 3mg of&#xD;
      Ferumoxytol/kg of patient weight will be delivered but not to exceed one vial (510mg). In all&#xD;
      cases Ferumoxytol will be diluted to a concentration no greater than 1 part Ferumoxytol to 4&#xD;
      parts 0.9% sodium chloride and will be administered with several spaced infusions of diluted&#xD;
      agent for the different imaging components. Ferumoxytol infusion is controlled by a&#xD;
      sophisticated MRI compatible infusion pump for precise control over infusion rate. This&#xD;
      procedure would take a minimum of 20 minutes before the full cumulative dose is administered&#xD;
      for a usual size patient and even longer for the maximum expected dose of 510 mg in a very&#xD;
      large patient. As such the investigators are anticipating that patients will be scheduled for&#xD;
      up to 45 minutes of imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small fractions of the dose will be administered initially as an infusion for myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion and first pass imaging with a dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) technique. After the&#xD;
      full dose is administered, steady state high-resolution imaging will be undertaken using an&#xD;
      ultrafast spoiled gradient echo sequences. Cardiac MR consisting of cardiac output, end&#xD;
      systolic volume, end diastolic volume, aortic distensibility and flow Cardiac MR will be&#xD;
      performed. Images will be obtained for left ventricular and right ventricular mass and&#xD;
      function plus flow quantification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRA will be reviewed by vascular radiology consultants (with between 6 and 20 years'&#xD;
      experience) and a standard clinical report issued on the findings. At the end of the study,&#xD;
      all imaging (US Doppler, CTA and investigatory MRA) will be jointly reviewed by the&#xD;
      radiologists and other investigators in the study team. An independent radiologist that is&#xD;
      not directly involved in the study will also review images. All discrepancies will be&#xD;
      resolved by mutual consensus between the radiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general analytical approach will be to estimate accuracy (95% CI), sensitivity (95% CI)&#xD;
      and specificity (95% CI) of FeMRA and standard imaging techniques. In addition, Cohen's κ&#xD;
      with 95% CI will be computed to quantify the agreement between the FeMRA and standard imaging&#xD;
      findings. A value of κ&gt;0.7 indicates a high level of agreement. Because multiple image&#xD;
      locations from each patient will be used for the statistical evaluation (at least 20 vascular&#xD;
      cross sections from each scan), the interdependence of each location for a given patient&#xD;
      examination will be assessed by use of a κ statistic. A value of κ&lt;0.4 indicates weak or no&#xD;
      interdependence. The investigators aim to recruit 20 patients in group A and 10 patients in&#xD;
      each of the other two groups. Assuming that FeMRA will identify 10% more clinically&#xD;
      significant vascular anatomic characteristics compared with CTA/US, then one would need to&#xD;
      study 180 vascular sections in total to show a significant difference between tests using&#xD;
      chi-squared test, assuming power of 80% and probability of type 1 error of 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate associations between anatomical predictor variables and outcomes, multiple linear&#xD;
      and logistic mixed-effects regression models will be used. Associations of fistula and graft&#xD;
      outcomes with predictors will be treated as uniform across all anatomical configurations&#xD;
      unless there is strong statistical or biological evidence to suggest otherwise. Based on data&#xD;
      from a retrospective study performed at the same centre, the investigators assume a fistula&#xD;
      failure rate of 30%.&#xD;
