  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the impact of listening to frequency-modulated music vs.&#xD;
      non-modulated music (both researcher-selected), and to test whether there are differential&#xD;
      effects on pain and stress perception. Further, these two conditions will be compared to a&#xD;
      third condition, in which participants will be exposed to self-selected non-modulated music.&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that both researcher-selected frequency-modulated music and self-selected&#xD;
      non-modulated music result in stronger decreases in stress and pain compared to&#xD;
      researcher-selected non-modulated music, while it is expected that there will be no&#xD;
      differences in researcher-selected frequency-modulated music and self-selected non-modulated&#xD;
      music. The intervention consists of ten sessions of music listening in the course of three&#xD;
      consecutive weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the impact of three different music listening interventions on&#xD;
      stress and pain parameters. Participants will be assigned randomly to one of the conditions.&#xD;
      In order to avoid expectancy-related effects, participants in both the researcher- and&#xD;
      self-selected condition are told that they were allocated randomly to frequency-modulated or&#xD;
      non-modulated music. Therefore, subjects are fully blinded with regards to&#xD;
      frequency-modulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline measurement: assessment of resting state biological parameters and&#xD;
           questionnaires, CPT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Music listening sessions: ten sessions in three consecutive weeks including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 60 minutes of music listening&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. CPT following music listening (sessions 1, 3, 6, 10 only)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Assessments: biological and subjective pain and stress parameters; music and mood&#xD;
                related parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post measurement: assessment of resting state biological parameters and questionnaires,&#xD;
           CPT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up measurement: 4 weeks after intervention, assessment of resting state&#xD;
           biological parameters and questionnaires, CPT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants respond to health-related questions (chronic stress, stress reactivity, sleep&#xD;
      quality, fatigue, menstrual cycle phase) as well as mood and music-related questions at&#xD;
      baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up which are assessed as potential outcome,&#xD;
      moderator, and/or control variables. In addition, pain and stress parameters (both biological&#xD;
      and subjective) are being assessed at baseline, post-intervention and follow-up as well as in&#xD;
      the course of the ten music listening sessions. Furthermore, participants respond to specific&#xD;
      music and mood related items following each music listening session (e.g. perceived valence,&#xD;
      arousal, familiarity, liking, induced emotions, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that listening to researcher-selected frequency-modulated music and&#xD;
      self-selected non-modulated music results in stronger increases in pain tolerance and&#xD;
      stronger decreases in pain intensity from baseline to post compared to listening to&#xD;
      researcher-selected non-modulated music. Furthermore, stronger decreases in stress parameters&#xD;
      (e.g. increases in HRV) from baseline to post are expected in the researcher-selected&#xD;
      frequency-modulated music and self-selected non-modulated music than in the&#xD;
      researcher-selected non-modulated music listening condition. Moreover, it is expected that&#xD;
      there will be no differences in researcher-selected frequency-modulated music and&#xD;
      self-selected non-modulated music with regards to pain and stress parameters. Additionally,&#xD;
      it will be tested whether changes in pain parameters are being mediated* by changes in&#xD;
      markers of stress-responsive systems (e.g. heart rate variability indices).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, process analysis over the course of the music listening sessions sessions will be&#xD;
      conducted with biological and subjective pain and stress indices as well as music and mood&#xD;
      related parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Although checking for spelling mistakes before submitting the first record, a mistake in&#xD;
      wording was discovered only after the release of the record and therefore corrected&#xD;
      corresponding to our original hypothesis.&#xD;
