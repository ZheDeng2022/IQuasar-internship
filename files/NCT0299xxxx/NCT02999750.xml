  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively validate treatment benefit of an individualized&#xD;
      treatment concept based on molecular profiling (MP) from paraffin-embedded tumor tissue&#xD;
      sections obtained before the start of treatment (real time biopsy).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment concept will be considered to be of clinical benefit for the individual patient&#xD;
      if a progression-free survival (PFS) ratio (PFS on MP-based therapy / best PFS achieved by&#xD;
      prior therapy) will be &gt; 1.0 thus generating a patient cohort with this very property.&#xD;
      Thereby, the null hypothesis (that â‰¤ 40 % of this patient population would have a PFS ratio&#xD;
      of &gt; 1.0) will be evaluated with each patient being his own control. For tumor types with&#xD;
      high numbers of patients per cohort, the overall response rate (ORR) will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Consenting patients of &gt;19 years with advanced cancer fulfilling the criteria of having:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  an advanced malignancy with metastatic spread refractory to conventional treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a life expectancy of &gt;4 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  the possibility to access and biopsy tumour material within 4 weeks before onset of&#xD;
             individualized treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a malignancy amenable to further treatment options with either cytotoxic drugs,&#xD;
             tyrosine kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies or related molecules with&#xD;
             anti-proliferative potential to cancer cells, as assessed by the ex vivo analysis and&#xD;
             a likelihood of treatment response according to the mathematical model (all outlined&#xD;
             in detail above),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  agreed to participate by their signature on an informed consent form are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of further treatment options, as defined by NCCN guidelines which are&#xD;
             available in Austria representing a possible further treatment-related response by&#xD;
             conventional therapies according to generally accepted medical evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No fresh and viable tumor material available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of therapeutic warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unresolved toxicity of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
             Adverse Events, version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0) Grade 2 or higher from previous&#xD;
             anti-cancer therapy, except alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of active gastrointestinal disease or other condition that will interfere&#xD;
             significantly with the absorption of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), or&#xD;
             Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of other malignancy. Subjects who have been disease-free for 5 years or those&#xD;
             with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer or successfully treated&#xD;
             in situ carcinoma are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled medical conditions (i.e, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, etc),&#xD;
             psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit&#xD;
             compliance with the protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures required in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pregnant or lactating females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse within 6 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
