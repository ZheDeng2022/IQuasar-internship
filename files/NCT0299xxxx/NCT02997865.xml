  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates stepped care for depression in patients with heart failure (HF). The&#xD;
      stepped care intervention consists of individualized cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Half&#xD;
      of the participants will receive stepped care and half will receive usual care for&#xD;
      depression; all participants will receive heart failure self-care education and support. The&#xD;
      primary aims are to determine whether stepped care is superior to usual care for depression,&#xD;
      and whether treating depression improves heart failure self-care outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is associated with poor heart failure self-care. Good self-care practices,&#xD;
      including following dietary recommendations, taking prescribed medications, monitoring&#xD;
      symptoms, and regular light exercise have been shown to improve quality of life and survival&#xD;
      in persons with heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both CBT and antidepressant medications have been used in previous studies to treat major&#xD;
      depression in patients with heart failure. Participants in the intervention arm in this trial&#xD;
      will start with CBT. Those who do not improve very much within the first 5-10 weeks of CBT&#xD;
      may also be referred to their own physician to discuss antidepressant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart failure self-care education and support will be provided after the first 8 weeks of the&#xD;
      depression intervention. The study will determine whether people with heart failure benefit&#xD;
      more from self-care education and support after their depression has been treated with a&#xD;
      stepped care intervention, as compared to usual care for depression as provided by primary&#xD;
      care providers.&#xD;
