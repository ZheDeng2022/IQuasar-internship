      Our goal is to temporarily implant the following groups for 180 +/- 30 days:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Five human partial hand amputees (amputated at the level of the hand) with 2 FAST-LIFE&#xD;
           electrodes, one inserted into the motor fascicle of the ulnar nerve and the other into&#xD;
           the sensory fascicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Five human hand and forearm amputees (amputated at the level of the forearm) with 2&#xD;
           FAST-LIFE electrodes in the ulnar nerve (one in the motor fascicle, one in the sensory&#xD;
           fascicle) and 2-5 FAST-LIFE electrodes in the median nerve (one in the motor fascicle,&#xD;
           one to four in the remaining sensory fascicles).&#xD;

      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be consented during a pre-operative visit in the Plastic Surgery Clinic and&#xD;
      screened for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject pre-operative task training&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will train subjects to complete the standardized task-based assessment&#xD;
      protocol using the patient's existing myoelectric hand prosthesis. These tests will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Orthotics and Prosthetics User Survey Upper Extremity Functional Status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trinity Amputation Prosthesis Experience Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Box and Blocks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening history and physical Potential human subjects will receive a full medical&#xD;
      assessment by the PI. The screening interview will focus on details of the patient's upper&#xD;
      extremity condition and comprehensive details of the patient's overall health status. The&#xD;
      screening examination will include general examination of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative imaging and diagnostic studies MRI, x-ray, EMG/Nerve conduction studies (NCS) -&#xD;
      Each subject who passes the screening H&amp;P will receive the following for their residual limb:&#xD;
      magnetic resonance neurogram (MRN), plain x-rays, and EMG/nerve conduction studies. Other&#xD;
      studies will be performed in accordance with the UT (University of Texas) Southwestern&#xD;
      pre-operative testing protocol, and will depend on the age/gender/medical history of the&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR neurogram will provide information regarding the location and health of amputated&#xD;
      peripheral nerve stumps in the residual limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plain x-rays will allow assessment of the bony anatomy of the amputation stump, and&#xD;
      suitability for nerve/muscle implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electromyogram/Nerve conduction studies will include motor and sensory nerve conduction of&#xD;
      the median and ulnar nerves, and needle exam (voluntary activation EMG) of the residual&#xD;
      forearm and hand muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other studies Based on UT Southwestern pre-operative testing protocol, other studies may be&#xD;
      required prior to surgery. CBC (complete blood count) with type and screen will be performed&#xD;
      , and HCG (pregnancy test) in females age 15-50. EKG will be performed in males &gt; 40, and&#xD;
      females &gt; 50. Chest x-ray will be performed in subjects with a prior history of smoking or&#xD;
      lung/chest injury. If surgery is scheduled for more than 90 days after this testing is&#xD;
      completed, another set of tests will be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient treatment, week of surgery Subjects who have passed all screening measures and who&#xD;
      have completed the consent process will be seen for a routine pre-operative H&amp;P up to 30 days&#xD;
      before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylaxis for Methicillin-Resistant Staph Aureus (MRSA) The subject will receive mupirocin&#xD;
      ointment to place intranasal, to both nares, twice a day for 5 days prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implantation surgery Surgery will be performed by Jonathan Cheng, MD, at Clements University&#xD;
      Hospital at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. General anesthesia will be provided by&#xD;
      the Department of Anesthesiology at UT Southwestern. Procedures will require placement of a&#xD;
      standard catheter for intravenous (IV) access and a urethral (Foley) catheter. Long-lasting&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockade will be avoided in the anesthetic regimen. Preoperative IV antibiotic&#xD;
      will be administered for infection prophylaxis. One 4-6 inch-long incision will be needed for&#xD;
      implantation of nerve (volar forearm) electrodes. In hand-level amputees, two 0.5-1.0cm long&#xD;
      dorsal hand incisions will be needed for placement of bipolar fine wire muscle electrodes&#xD;
      into the intrinsic hand muscles. In hand-level and forearm-level amputees, two 6-10cm long&#xD;
      forearm incisions will be used to place bipolar fine wire muscle electrodes into the residual&#xD;
      forearm muscles. The implant lead wires will be tunneled under the skin for a distance, and&#xD;
      then placed through the skin. In the forearm-level amputees the wire exit sites may be below&#xD;
      or above the elbow depending on the subject's prosthesis configuration. Small counter&#xD;
      incisions may be needed along the paths of the lead wires to facilitate placement. The point&#xD;
      where the lead wires exit the skin will be dressed with a sterile/antimicrobial dressing used&#xD;
      commonly for indwelling vascular access devices (VAD). The implants will be surgically placed&#xD;
      under tourniquet control in order to limit bleeding. Following implantation, incisions will&#xD;
      be infiltrated with bupivacaine for postoperative analgesia and closed with sutures and skin&#xD;
      glue. The hand and forearm will be placed in a protective splint for the first 3 weeks after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor and somatosensory evoked potentials Nerve dissection will be performed under the&#xD;
      operating microscope or surgical loupes. The motor and sensory fascicular groups of the ulnar&#xD;
      and median nerves will be identified microsurgically as needed for the planned electrode&#xD;
      implantations (ulnar only, or ulnar+median) based on their predictable intraneural&#xD;
      topography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nerve electrode implantation The ulnar and median nerves will be accessed as needed (ulnar&#xD;
      only, or ulnar+median) through a volar forearm incision (4-6 inches long). One FAST-LIFE&#xD;
      array will be inserted within each of the main motor and sensory fascicular groups of the&#xD;
      ulnar nerve. The median nerve will be microdissected to identify the thenar motor fascicle&#xD;
      and the 3-4 sensory fascicles that terminate in the hand. One FAST-LIFE array will be&#xD;
      inserted within the motor and one or more sensory fascicles of the median nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle electrode implantation The hand intrinsic muscles (hand-level amputations) will be&#xD;
      accessed through small dorsal hand incisions (0.5-1cm long). Up to 4 bipolar fine wire&#xD;
      electrodes will be placed into the intrinsic muscles and tunneled to a common exit point at&#xD;
      the forearm skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The forearm muscles (hand-level and forearm-level amputations) will be accessed through two&#xD;
      6-10cm long forearm incisions. Up to 15 bipolar fine wire electrodes will be placed into the&#xD;
      residual forearm muscles and tunneled to a common exit point at the forearm skin. In the&#xD;
      forearm-level amputees the wire exit sites may be below or above the elbow depending on the&#xD;
      subject's prosthesis configuration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative care in the hospital Immediately following surgery, subjects will receive&#xD;
      routine postoperative care. Overnight hospital stay for up to 2 nights will be optional&#xD;
      depending on the level of pain control in the PACU (Post-Anesthesia Care Unit) following&#xD;
      surgery. Analgesia will consist of acetaminophen and parenteral and oral narcotics, and&#xD;
      pregabalin or gabapentin and/or nortriptyline as needed for neuropathic pain. The operated&#xD;
      hand will be elevated at all times. The Foley catheter will be removed as soon as possible&#xD;
      following surgery. The IV fluids will be capped as soon as the patient demonstrates adequate&#xD;
      oral intake and normal fluid balance. The patient will wear sequential devices on the legs&#xD;
      and will walk on a scheduled basis for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Prophylactic&#xD;
      antibiotics will be administered during the hospital stay up to 24 hours after surgery.&#xD;
      Discharge criteria will be met when the patient demonstrates pain controlled adequately by&#xD;
      oral analgesics, independent ambulation, and tolerance of oral intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X-rays After implantation surgery, plain film x-rays will be obtained of the subject's&#xD;
      forearm in order to establish a baseline for the position of implanted electrodes and leads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient care The subject will be seen in clinic on a weekly basis following implantation&#xD;
      surgery for 3 weeks and then as needed until explantation if there is evidence of local&#xD;
      redness, inflammation, serous drainage or skin irritation near the incisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous leads The electrode leads will be inspected at each weekly visit, and the&#xD;
      dressings will be changed using sterile technique based on VAD protocols. If any dressing&#xD;
      ever becomes wet, soiled, or leaking, the subject will be instructed to change it. After the&#xD;
      first 3 clinic visits wire site dressing changes will be performed by research personnel who&#xD;
      have been trained by the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental data collection in implanted subjects (2 - 180 +/- 30 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing: Human physiology experiments will begin after 2 days following implantation, to allow&#xD;
      tissue-electrode interactions to stabilize.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location: Most of the human physiology experiments will take place at UT Southwestern. Some&#xD;
      participants may be asked to travel to the University of Minnesota Bioengineering Lab up to 3&#xD;
      times during the study participation period for the human physiology experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor assessment: We will ask subjects to attempt to perform hand movements and positions.&#xD;
      The movement trials will consist of simultaneous volitional movements and positioning of both&#xD;
      the uninjured/sound limb and the injured/amputated &quot;phantom&quot; limb. We will record nerve and&#xD;
      muscle electrode activity during all of the movement trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory assessment: We will also perform sensory detection and discrimination trials. Here,&#xD;
      the subject will be asked to report if he/she detects any sensation during microstimulation&#xD;
      via LIFE electrodes. If they do have a sensory perception, they will be asked to describe the&#xD;
      quality and strength of the perception, e.g. location, touch, vibration, temperature.&#xD;
      Subjects may also be asked to fill out standardized sensory/pain assessments during&#xD;
      microstimulation and after microstimulation is turned off. Other stimulation trials that may&#xD;
      be done will include single or multiple electrode stimulation to see if subjects can perceive&#xD;
      multiple sensory percepts simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory-motor integration: After determining the subject's sensory detection and&#xD;
      discrimination parameters, we will ask them to repeat the standardized assessments listed in&#xD;
      (4.1.3.2) using the existing myoelectric hand prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explantation surgery - Will be planned for 180 +/- 30 days after implantation. If&#xD;
      explantation surgery is scheduled for less than 90 days from the implantation pre-operative&#xD;
      testing then the pre-operative testing requirement will be waived. Surgery will be performed&#xD;
      by the PI. General anesthesia will be provided by the Department of Anesthesiology at UT&#xD;
      Southwestern. Procedures are estimated to last 2-3 hours, and will require placement of a&#xD;
      standard catheter for IV access. Preoperative IV antibiotic will be administered for&#xD;
      infection prophylaxis. The previous incisions used to place nerve and muscle electrodes will&#xD;
      be redeveloped for access to the implanted systems. The implants will be surgically removed&#xD;
      under tourniquet control in order to limit bleeding. Following explantation, incisions will&#xD;
      be infiltrated with bupivacaine for postoperative analgesia and closed with sutures and skin&#xD;
      glue. Postoperative analgesia will be performed as listed above. Jonathan Cheng, MD, will see&#xD;
      the subject in clinic once the week following surgery and then as needed. The dressing will&#xD;
      be removed and replaced at the first postoperative visit. The incisions will be visually&#xD;
      inspected at each visit. The subject will be instructed to contact the research team by phone&#xD;
      on week 2 and week 3 to determine if they need to come to the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-participation interview - Subjects may be asked to participate in a recorded video&#xD;
      interview conducted by the research team to record their subjective experiences with the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

        Criteria for Inclusion of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hand and forearm amputees:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female, age 18 and older, of any race or ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able and willing to sign Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Able and willing to participate in all study activities including implantation,&#xD;
             testing and explantation of the study device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Able to communicate effectively in English without an interpreter&#xD;
&#xD;
        After preliminary screening subjects will be assessed for the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has an existing myoelectric hand prosthesis and demonstrates proficiency&#xD;
             during daily use&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Overall and phantom pain are well-controlled and not incapacitating&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criteria for Exclusion of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. If MR neurogram and EMG/NCS study show nerve or muscle dysfunction/injury at a higher&#xD;
             level than anticipated based on the appearance of the physical amputation stump, the&#xD;
             subject may be excluded from the study due to adverse neuromuscular anatomy which&#xD;
             would preclude use of the proposed experimental electrode implants. The radiographs&#xD;
             will be used to confirm suitability of the amputation stump configuration. If the bony&#xD;
             anatomy of the amputation stump is found to be unsuitable, the patient may be excluded&#xD;
             from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects who have a history of cardiac arrhythmia will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
