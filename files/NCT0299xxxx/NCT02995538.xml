      The objective of this project is to develop a Neurogenetics patient database and bio&#xD;
      repository - which includes clinical information regarding history, physical examination,&#xD;
      laboratory testing including genetic testing (NextGen sequencing including whole exome and&#xD;
      whole genome sequencing, SNParray, etc.), neuroradiology studies, neurophysiology studies -&#xD;
      all ordered as clinically deemed appropriate, natural history from clinical longitudinal&#xD;
      follow-up and to use de-identified information from this registry/ repository, when&#xD;
      appropriate for clinical and translational research.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients seen in the neurogenetics clinic with a clinical phenotype or a pedigree supportive&#xD;
      of a genetic disease will be considered for the study. Autosomal recessive inheritance will&#xD;
      be suggested by at least two affected sibs with healthy parents who may also have other&#xD;
      unaffected children. Autosomal dominant inheritance will be suggested by multiple affected&#xD;
      family members in multiple generations. Lack of family history could be suggestive of&#xD;
      autosomal recessive inheritance or de novo autosomal dominant inheritance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be completed prior to any research procedures or genetic testing.&#xD;
      Patients seen in the neurogenetics clinic will be approached about participating in the&#xD;
      Neurogenetics study during their routine clinic visit. Parents of pediatric patients seen in&#xD;
      the clinic will be asked to provide their written informed consent. Following informed&#xD;
      consent, deidentified patient information will be entered in a database by a study team&#xD;
      member. If participation in the biorepository is also approved, then available stored&#xD;
      specimens will be deidentified and located in the specific laboratories or in a collaborators&#xD;
      laboratory&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of a known Neurogenetics patient who has died, the Legally Authorized&#xD;
      Representative (or next of kin) of a deceased patient may be approached to provide permission&#xD;
      for research data and stored specimens to be included in this study. Again, their protected&#xD;
      health information (including any samples that were clinically obtained from biopsies or at&#xD;
      autopsy) will be secured and de-identified for their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate family members will be studied (affected individual, affected and unaffected&#xD;
      siblings and parents) with the goal of studying at least a family in trio (mother, father,&#xD;
      affected child). In some cases, the family may have a deceased individual with banked DNA&#xD;
      available. If the family is interested in including these samples, written consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from the decedent's next-of-kin or the executors of the decedent' estate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family history suggestive of genetic disease which is undiagnosed with the available&#xD;
      diagnosis methods will be considered for the study after having an extensive genetic&#xD;
      evaluation. Affected individuals beside their affected and unaffected siblings and both their&#xD;
      parents will be considered for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research subjects will be seen by a member of the study team to discuss the research&#xD;
      protocol and obtain informed consent. They will also be seen in the clinic once we have the&#xD;
      final results of the research study for genetic counseling and to discuss the results. If&#xD;
      needed they will be seen in the clinic for other clinical reasons that are not related to the&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Goal 1: A neurogenetics clinic has been set up with 2 clinical child neurologists and a&#xD;
      genetic counselor, where undiagnosed patients with a potential neurogenetic disease will be&#xD;
      assessed and clinically appropriate testing will be ordered. Patients with diagnosed&#xD;
      neurogenetic disorders will also be followed for longitudinal care and reassessment as&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Goal 2: Informed consent will be obtained and pretesting genetic counseling will be&#xD;
      provided. Clinically appropriate testing will be ordered including blood draw, urine specimen&#xD;
      collection, buccal swab collection and if needed tissue biopsy samples. DNA sample from the&#xD;
      above testing that is left over after appropriate clinical testing will be used for storage&#xD;
      at the biorepository and for further appropriate research testing. Next generation&#xD;
      sequencing, if clinically appropriate will be ordered through available commercial labs as&#xD;
      approved by the patient's insurance company. If insurance coverage is denied research testing&#xD;
      will be ordered after informed consent and pretesting counseling, to be done through our&#xD;
      collaborative labs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Goal 3: A patient database with de-identified clinical information, laboratory analysis,&#xD;
      imaging studies and genetic studies will be maintained. A biorepository of blood and other&#xD;
      DNA/ tissue samples will be maintained in the appropriate clinical / collaborators&#xD;
      laboratory. The patient database will facilitate and identification and recruitment of&#xD;
      potential eligible subjects for the participation in patient specific translational research&#xD;
      studies to help better delineate the patients condition or to help with potential therapy&#xD;
      development in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collaborators have been identified in multiple different fields through the university of&#xD;
      Pittsburgh to help with offering research next generation testing, bioinformatics analysis,&#xD;
      basic science researchers to help with functional analysis of potential novel genes/ variants&#xD;
      of unknown significance. The vision of the initiative is to be able to take data from novel&#xD;
      new genetic testing on undiagnosed patients to the bench for functional characterization -&#xD;
      with the hope that this would pave the road to repurposing currently available drugs for&#xD;
      personalized care of these rare patients or help development of novel treatments in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood draw will be ordered as clinically indicated with an extra tube been drawn for research&#xD;
      purposes: Up to 20 mL of whole blood will be collected in EDTA tubes. DNA will be extracted&#xD;
      per standard lab protocols. For deceased individuals we will be using banked source of DNA if&#xD;
      available. Next of kin will sign proxy consent for deceased individuals. Whole Exome&#xD;
      Sequencing (exome amplification and sequencing) and/or Whole Genome Sequencing will be done&#xD;
      according to lab protocol and will be sent out to a commercial laboratory or a laboratory in&#xD;
      consultation with one of our collaborators/consultants on this protocol. Research whole exome&#xD;
      through a collaborators laboratory will be offered to patients, whose insurance providers&#xD;
      will not cover for clinical testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bioinformatics analysis provided by collaborators will be used to analyze the raw data&#xD;
      from NGS. Standard analysis will be used looking for variants in specific genes known to&#xD;
      cause genetic disorders. Any variants on whole exome or whole genome sequencing found will&#xD;
      then be compared to publicly available exomes/genomes from the dbSNP database, 1000 Genome&#xD;
      Project and NHLBI (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/) to exclude common variants and will be&#xD;
      compared to data available from ClinVar (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) as well as&#xD;
      ExAC (ExAC.broadinstitute.org). Variants pathogenic prediction using available software such&#xD;
      as PolyPhen and SIFT will be used in the analysis as well. Comparing variants found in an&#xD;
      affected individual to those found in each parent further reduces the number of candidate&#xD;
      variants. For autosomal dominant disorders, this strategy can discover de novo coding&#xD;
      variants, assuming neither parent is a non-expressing carrier of the disorder. In contrast,&#xD;
      in recessive disorders each parent should carry one of the disease-causing variants&#xD;
      identified in the affected children. For X- linked disorders, the mother should be carrier&#xD;
      for the disease unless it has occurred de novo in the proband. Conservation score such as&#xD;
      GERP score (Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling) will be noted as well. Alteration of a&#xD;
      highly conserved residue is more likely to be functionally significant. Genes with multiple&#xD;
      transcripts will require special consideration. In this situation, effect estimation will be&#xD;
      limited to those from canonical transcripts, variants in candidate genes will then be&#xD;
      confirmed by Sanger sequencing in a CLIA certified lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Physiologic Relevance: Based on published literature reports of similar&#xD;
      experiments, we anticipate that we will identify &lt;10 candidate genes and perhaps as few as&#xD;
      one. If more than one candidate gene is identified, we will assess likely physiologic&#xD;
      relevance a number of ways. First, amino acid changes will be assessed for conservation&#xD;
      across evolution. Alteration of a highly conserved residue is more likely to be functionally&#xD;
      significant. Next we will assess predicted tissue expression through examination of EST&#xD;
      databases and &quot;virtual northern blots&quot;. Amino acid changes predicted to significantly alter&#xD;
      protein structure will be assessed further by doing functional studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Frame and Subsequent Studies: The proposed sequencing studies can be completed&#xD;
      relatively expediently once sample is obtained. Additional time will be required for&#xD;
      bioinformatic analysis. Data obtained through this project will be used by the PI to prepare&#xD;
      grant applications to systematically characterize the underlying molecular defects in&#xD;
      patients with significant pedigree evidence of a genetic disorder, or in patients with&#xD;
      recognized genetic syndromes of unknown cause. Preliminary data obtained through this project&#xD;
      will also lead to additional grant applications to study the identified defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood draw will be done on the affected individuals, healthy parents and unaffected&#xD;
      siblings in the phlebotomy lab at Children's Hospital of UPMC or other UPMC facilities where&#xD;
      patients are seen by the lab personnel. The blood draw should take no more than 5-10 minutes.&#xD;
      Alternate arrangements may be made with individuals and their local phlebotomy lab to obtain&#xD;
      the specimens and ship them to the investigators.&#xD;
