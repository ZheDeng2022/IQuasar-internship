      The study's main purpose is to evaluate the safety and performance of the LeadExx LC System&#xD;
      and its ability to safely extract leads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 10 patients scheduled for CIED lead extraction. The decision upon lead&#xD;
      extraction will be based upon the applicable Heart Rhythm Society guidelines or European&#xD;
      Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of implantable cardiac devices has been exponentially increasing, and lead extraction&#xD;
      has become a necessary procedure. But lead extraction has potentially serious complications,&#xD;
      including venous or myocardial tear, cardiac tamponade, and even death. Powered sheaths, such&#xD;
      as Excimer laser or a radiofrequency system, have been used for extraction of ICD or&#xD;
      pacemaker leads. However, the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) has stated that &quot;possible predictors&#xD;
      of major complications were implant duration of the oldest lead, female gender, ICD lead&#xD;
      removal, and use of the laser extraction technique, multiple leads, and calcified leads&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reduce the risk of the lead extraction procedure and therefore reduce the number of&#xD;
      abandoned leads, LeadExx had developed its system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LC system is an active disposable system provided sterile for single use. The system is&#xD;
      comprised of the following two main parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Dilation Unit (DU) - (invasive, sterile) b. Control Unit- (CU) - (non-invasive, sterile&#xD;
      fluid path) The physical connection between the units is achieved by 3 Luer locks that&#xD;
      connect the CU Solenoids' output to 3 flexible tubes at the proximal end of the DU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dilation Unit (DU):&#xD;
&#xD;
           The dilation unit is an invasive sterile unit, comprised of a dilation tip and a&#xD;
           connecting shaft. The unit is activated using a hydraulic mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The dilation tip is threaded over the lead, inserted into the vessel together with its&#xD;
           connecting shaft and while advancing along the lead, dilates the surrounding tissue and&#xD;
           ultimately enables the lead removal from the vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control Unit (CU):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Control Unit is a non-invasive fluid path sterile unit, comprised of various off the&#xD;
      shelf modules . The unit is being filled with sterile Saline just prior to its operation and&#xD;
      by synchronizing the transfer of the Saline into the DU controls its advancement. I&#xD;
