  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature babies, born several weeks before their due date, are often very ill in the first&#xD;
      weeks and months of life, compared with those born at full term. Because babies' brains and&#xD;
      bodies are still developing at this time, early birth puts them at increased risk of later&#xD;
      problems with health and development. It is important to do everything possible to try to&#xD;
      improve the overall health of these children. Not only will this help children and families,&#xD;
      but it will also help to understand the correct amount and type of care they will need from&#xD;
      the NHS in the future. At present, England has three types of neonatal units: Neonatal&#xD;
      Intensive care units (NICUs) that can care for the most sick and most premature babies, Local&#xD;
      Neonatal Units (LNUs) that generally care for slightly less sick babies, and Special Care&#xD;
      baby units (SCBU) that care for larger premature babies who are generally well, but need time&#xD;
      to grow and develop before going home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those premature babies born between 27 and 31 weeks of pregnancy, there is no information&#xD;
      on whether they benefit from being looked after in one type of unit or another. At present&#xD;
      there is no guidance, so these babies may be looked after in either LNUs or NICUs. Babies who&#xD;
      are born at this stage of pregnancy cannot be looked after in a SCBU and sometimes need to be&#xD;
      moved after birth to either a NICU or LNU. There are 84 LNUs and 45 NICUs in England. In&#xD;
      2014, about half of these babies were cared for in a NICU and half in a LNU. There is the&#xD;
      need to know whether babies born between 27 and 31 weeks are best cared for in a NICU or LNU&#xD;
      or if it does not matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main things that control where a baby is born are where the mother has her antenatal&#xD;
      care, and where there is a cot available for the baby. A mother may have antenatal care in a&#xD;
      hospital that has a NICU, LNU or SCBU. Because it is difficult to predict which mother is&#xD;
      going to have her baby early, she cannot be directed, at the time of her choosing her&#xD;
      hospital for antenatal care, where to go to for care. There is uncertainty before birth which&#xD;
      baby is likely to require intensive care, but usually the less mature babies need more&#xD;
      intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study to find out where it is best to care for babies born at 27-31 weeks of&#xD;
      pregnancy, the study will look at which type of unit: a) leads to the best outcome for babies&#xD;
      born at each week of pregnancy in this range; b) is most cost-effective for families and the&#xD;
      NHS and c) best considers views and needs of parents and staff caring for babies.&#xD;

      Mixed methods, longitudinal study; 5 work streams, supported by a Parent Advisory Panel:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work stream 1:Clinical Outcomes Study Using routinely collected data from the National&#xD;
      Neonatal Research Database (NNRD) for babies born at 27-31 weeks of gestation, admitted to&#xD;
      neonatal units in England 01/01/14-31/12/17.Estimates of differences in mortality and&#xD;
      specified morbidities between babies cared for in LNUs and NICUs will be obtained Data will&#xD;
      be linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (morbidity) and ONS(mortality) up to 1 year of age&#xD;
      for longer term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work stream 2:Types of clinical care provided Using NNRD, data from a unit questionnaire&#xD;
      (01/01/017-31/12/2017), and review of guidelines from neonatal units, variation in clinical&#xD;
      practice in 6 areas will be examined: medical/nurse staffing; policies/practice re&#xD;
      respiratory support; infection control, feeding and developmental care, discharge and length&#xD;
      of stay. Where appropriate, outcomes (mortality, chronic lung disease, central line sepsis,&#xD;
      receipt of breastmilk on discharge and length of stay in hospital) by week of gestational&#xD;
      age, will be analysed between units with similar practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work stream 3:Economic analysis A cost-effectiveness study comparing costs and outcomes of&#xD;
      LNU versus NICU will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work stream 4:Ethnographic study with a representative group of parents and clinicians&#xD;
      Observations and interviews will be used to explore factors parents think should guide&#xD;
      decision making about place of care and how it happens in practice; clinicians'&#xD;
      perspectives/practices on decision making and place of care; impact on parents/families of&#xD;
      these decisions and subsequent change in care location; and how parents can best be supported&#xD;
      at this time. 40 cases from 2 networks [20 real-time, 20 retrospective] will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Workstream 5:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the results of the 4 work streams are analysed, and conclusions reached, a working group&#xD;
      will be set up in collaboration with BAPM to develop recommendations to be made available for&#xD;
      health service delivery planning.&#xD;
