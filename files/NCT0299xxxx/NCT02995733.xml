  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma imposes a significant burden in the US in terms of morbidity, costs to society,&#xD;
      individual suffering, loss of productivity and mortality. African Americans (AA) and&#xD;
      Hispanic/Latinos (H/L) bear a disproportionate share of that morbidity. Despite national&#xD;
      guidelines for asthma treatment, the gap between these groups and whites has been stable or&#xD;
      widening. The need for pragmatic research to address the continuing burden is widely&#xD;
      recognized. Patients use asthma reliever inhalers to provide immediate relief of symptoms.&#xD;
      Controller inhalers (inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)) are intended to be used regularly to&#xD;
      prevent symptoms and attacks. Guidelines suggest that they be used daily, on a fixed basis,&#xD;
      in all but the mildest asthma. However, adherence by patients and implementation of&#xD;
      evidence-based guideline recommendations by clinicians has been poor. Gap analysis suggests&#xD;
      that it is difficult to improve adherence to the current recommendations without complex and&#xD;
      resource-intensive interventions. Studies have examined symptom-activated use of ICS&#xD;
      triggered by use of a reliever medication. The Investigators call this approach PARTICS -&#xD;
      Patient Activated Reliever-Triggered Inhaled CorticoSteroid. Explanatory, non-real world&#xD;
      studies suggest that PARTICS can produce up to 50% reductions in asthma attacks compared with&#xD;
      usual care, while reducing ICS use by half or more. These studies have been performed in&#xD;
      pre-selected populations, which represent less than 5% of asthma patients. The previous&#xD;
      studies have been done with repeated education and adherence checks in both the intervention&#xD;
      and control arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have consulted with AA and H/L patients, health care providers, leaders of&#xD;
      professional societies, advocacy groups, health policy leaders, pharmacists, and&#xD;
      pharmaceutical manufacturers. All groups have indicated that asthma decision making would be&#xD;
      changed if we demonstrated that implementing PARTICS improves important asthma outcomes such&#xD;
      as reducing exacerbations. The Investigators have designed a study with the stakeholders to&#xD;
      determine whether PARTICS can improve outcomes that are important to patients when&#xD;
      superimposed on a background provider-educated standard of care through the Asthma IQ system.&#xD;
      The Investigators propose a study entitled PREPARE: Patient Empowered Strategy to Reduce&#xD;
      Asthma Morbidity in Highly Impacted Populations. The Investigators aim to determine whether&#xD;
      PARTICS can reduce asthma morbidity in AA and H/L.&#xD;

      Asthma imposes a significant burden on the US population in terms of morbidity, costs to&#xD;
      society, individual suffering, loss of productivity and mortality. African Americans (AA) and&#xD;
      Hispanic/Latinos (H/L) bear a disproportionate share of that morbidity. Despite introduction&#xD;
      of national guidelines for asthma treatment, the gap between these groups and whites has been&#xD;
      stable or widening. The need for pragmatic research to address the continuing burden is&#xD;
      widely recognized. Patients use asthma reliever inhalers to provide immediate relief of&#xD;

&#xD;
      Studies have examined symptom-activated use of ICS triggered by use of a reliever medication.&#xD;

      Explanatory, non-real world studies suggest that PARTICS can produce up to 50% reductions in&#xD;
      asthma attacks compared with usual care, while reducing ICS use by half or more. However,&#xD;
      these studies have been performed in pre- selected populations, which represent less than 5%&#xD;

&#xD;
      The investigators have consulted with AA and H/L patients, health care providers, leaders of&#xD;

      pharmaceutical manufacturers. All groups have indicated that asthma decision making would be&#xD;
      changed if it was demonstrated that implementing PARTICS improves important asthma outcomes&#xD;
      such as reducing rates of exacerbations. Together with our partners and stakeholders, the&#xD;
      investigators have designed a study to determine whether PARTICS can improve outcomes that&#xD;
      are important to patients when superimposed on a background provider-educated standard care&#xD;
      through the Asthma IQ system. The investigators therefore propose a study entitled PREPARE:&#xD;
      Patient Empowered Strategy to Reduce Asthma Morbidity in Highly Impacted Populations. The aim&#xD;
      is to determine whether a PARTICS strategy can reduce asthma morbidity in AA and H/L. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be asthma exacerbations which have been shown to be important to patient&#xD;
      and healthcare stakeholders. The secondary outcomes will include additional outcomes&#xD;
      important to patients (i.e. days lost from work or school, asthma control, &amp; asthma quality&#xD;
      of life). The investigators have broad input and involvement from multiple stakeholder groups&#xD;
      in study design, implementation, and commitments for dissemination. AA and H/L patients and&#xD;
      their advocates have been involved and will continue to play a central role in all phases of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
