  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2011, the premiers of all Canadian provinces and territories selected diabetes foot care&#xD;
      as 1 of 3 significant targets for pan-provincial action. Of 210,000 people with diabetes in&#xD;
      Alberta, 5,250 will seek treatment of a foot ulcer annually. In Alberta in 2014-15 there were&#xD;
      425 lower limb amputations (LLA). Moreover, there is a tremendous reduction in quality of&#xD;
      life of the patients and attendant negative effects on their families. The 5-year mortality&#xD;
      rate after new-onset diabetic foot ulcer is 43-55% and as high as 74% for patients undergoing&#xD;
      LLA (CIHI, 2013). The Diabetes Foot Care Clinical Pathway Project (DFCCPP) aims to optimize&#xD;
      methods of early detection and treatment of foot ulcers in an effort to reduce LLA by 50% by&#xD;
      implementing High Risk Foot Teams (HRFTs) across the province starting with 3 Pilot sites.&#xD;
      Existing staff with expertise and knowledge in diabetic foot care will assess and treat&#xD;
      patients with moderate and high-risk findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conjunction with the DFCCPP, the efficacy of a technological advancement developed by an&#xD;
      Alberta-based small-to-medium enterprise (SME) to improve diabetic foot outcomes will be&#xD;
      evaluated. Exsalt® SD7 Wound Dressings (Exciton Technologies, Edmonton, AB) have been&#xD;
      demonstrated in-vitro and in-vivo to provide rapid and effective antibacterial activity in an&#xD;
      easy-to-use format, thus creating an enhanced wound healing environment while supporting&#xD;
      patient quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the proposed work is twofold, namely 1) to quantify clinical efficacy of&#xD;
      exsalt® Wound Dressings on locally infected diabetic foot ulcers not progressing to healing&#xD;
      under the current standard of care: evaluating key indicators of infection, Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases Society of America (IDSA) wound classification, and wound size; identifying benefits&#xD;
      to foot ulcer healing and 2) to evaluate subjective patient outcomes: satisfaction, perceived&#xD;
      benefit, compliance. Evaluating the benefits of utilization of the Exciton exsalt® Wound&#xD;
      Dressings when combined with the DFCCP.&#xD;

      2 Background Information&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Device Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exsalt® Wound Dressings (Test Dressings) contain oxidized silver oxysalts deposited&#xD;
      throughout a non-woven polyester/High density polyethylene non-adherent dressing. Silver in&#xD;
      the exsalt® Wound Dressings inhibits microbial growth in the dressing. The concentration of&#xD;
      the silver and oxidized silver species on the dressing is 0.4 mg/cm2 (2.5% w/w). The exsalt®&#xD;
      dressings have been shown to be effective in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia&#xD;
      coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis. Exsalt® Wound Dressings maintain&#xD;
      their antibacterial activity for up to 7 days against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exsalt® Wound Dressings are indicated for the management of partial and full thickness&#xD;
      wounds, including decubitus ulcers, venous stasis ulcers, diabetic ulcers, first and second&#xD;
      degree burns, grafts and donor sites, or other acute or chronic wounds. The dressing may be&#xD;
      used over debrided and grafted wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Study History&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Canadian Institute of Health Information estimates that foot wounds (with diabetes as the&#xD;
      leading cause) are present in 4% of all hospital inpatients, 7% of homecare clients and 10%&#xD;
      of long-term care residents (CIHI, 2013). Ulcerations are a critical event in the loss of&#xD;
      limbs or amputation as they create an avenue for infection and may exacerbate necrotic tissue&#xD;
      and ischemia. Of 210,000 people with diabetes in Alberta, 5,250 will seek treatment of a foot&#xD;
      ulcer annually. In Alberta in 2014-15 there were 425 LLA performed on 309 diabetic patients&#xD;
      representing an increase of 89 LLA over 2010-11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 5-year mortality rate after new-onset diabetic foot ulcer is 43-55% and as high as 74%&#xD;
      for patients undergoing LLA (Ollendorf et al, 1998). Moreover, there is a tremendous&#xD;
      reduction in quality of life of the patients and negative effects on their families. The&#xD;
      Diabetes Foot Care Clinical Pathway Project (DFCCPP) aims to optimize methods of early&#xD;
      detection and treatment of foot ulcers in an effort to reduce LLA by 50% and improve&#xD;
      patient's quality of life. Therefore, there is a need for an effective tool for the&#xD;
      prevention and management of local infection in diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Device History&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exsalt® wound dressings have to date been formally evaluated (including clinical studies and&#xD;
      post-market surveillance) on over 125 patients throughout North America and Europe. In these&#xD;
      studies, many wound etiologies were investigated including: venous leg ulcers, diabetic&#xD;
      ulcers, diabetic neuropathic ulcers, post-surgical wounds, wounds resulting from trauma, skin&#xD;
      tears, pressure ulcers, burn wounds, and chronic non-healing ulcers. The formal clinical&#xD;
      evaluations investigated the safety and efficacy of the Exsalt® wound dressing as a device.&#xD;
      Data and feedback generated supported wound healing, with increased granulation tissue and&#xD;
      lessened pain, odor, and signs of infection (Thomason et al, 2016; Lemire et al, 2015). The&#xD;
      wound dressing was shown to support progression to wound closure or wound healing without&#xD;
      signs of toxicity or side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Risk Summary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precautions need to be taken when using exsalt® Wound Dressing as it should not be used on&#xD;
      patients with a known sensitivity to silver; is not compatible with oil-based products, such&#xD;
      as petrolatum; is not compatible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures; should be&#xD;
      removed prior to administering radiation therapy; and should not come in contact with&#xD;
      electrodes and conductive gels during electronic measurements (e.g. EEG, ECG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, frequent or prolonged use of Exsalt® wound dressings may result in permanent&#xD;
      discoloration of skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 Benefit Summary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of this product vs. other silver antimicrobials include rapid and sustained&#xD;
      bactericidal activity; broad spectrum of activity; minimized pain; reduced staining of skin;&#xD;
      non-toxicity to human tissue; decreased likelihood of resistance; cost-effectiveness as it&#xD;
      requires less silver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6 Good Clinical Practice and Regulatory Requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6.1 Regulatory Requirements: Exsalt® Wound Dressing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exsalt® Wound Dressings exsalt® SD7 and exsalt® T7 have been licensed in Canada by Health&#xD;
      Canada as of January 2011 and March 2012, respectively. Exsalt® wound dressing is &quot;indicated&#xD;
      for the management of partial and full thickens wounds such as decubitus ulcers, venous&#xD;
      stasis ulcers, diabetic ulcers, 1st and 2nd degree burns, grafts and donor sites' or other&#xD;
      acute or chronic wounds.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Study Objectives &amp; Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Exciton exsalt® Wound&#xD;
      Dressings when combined with the DFCCP in patients with locally infected diabetic foot&#xD;
      ulcers. The objective of the proposed work is twofold, namely 1) to quantify the&#xD;
      effectiveness of exsalt® Wound Dressings on locally infected diabetic foot ulcers not&#xD;
      progressing to healing under the current standard of care: evaluating IDSA wound&#xD;
      classification, pain, wound size, and signs and symptoms of infection through a one-arm&#xD;
      prospective repeated measures pilot study and 2) to compile subjective patient outcomes:&#xD;
      satisfaction, perceived benefit, compliance. Evaluating the benefits of utilization of the&#xD;
      Exciton exsalt® Wound Dressings when combined with the DFCCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the following work and objectives are proposed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A prospective, single-arm, repeated measures study to pilot the use of Exsalt® wound&#xD;
           dressing in chronic wounds within an outpatient clinical setting; evaluate the benefits&#xD;
           of utilization of exsalt® Wound Dressings within the DFCCPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Repeated measures evaluating and reporting wound infection classification (IDSA), pain&#xD;
           score, wound size, and key indicators of infection; pre and post-intervention.&#xD;
           Quantifying the impact of the intervention to diabetic foot ulcer local infection,&#xD;
           healing, and associated pain. Qualifying subjective patient outcomes including&#xD;
           satisfaction, benefit, and compliance. Incidence of safety and adverse events will be&#xD;
           reported within the scope of this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research proposed here is designed to address the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the impact (monitoring key indicators of infection, wound size, and wound&#xD;
           classification) of the application of the exsalt® Wound Dressing utilized as a primary&#xD;
           dressing for up to four weeks in outpatients with diabetic foot ulcers that have a mild&#xD;
           local infection and are non-responsive using standard-of-care.?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the clinical utility of the use of the Exsalt® wound dressing from the&#xD;
           perspective of clinical staff and patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What are the benefits of utilization of the Exciton exsalt® Wound Dressings when&#xD;
           combined with the DFCCP?&#xD;
&#xD;
