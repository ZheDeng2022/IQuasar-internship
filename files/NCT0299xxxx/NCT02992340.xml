  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study intends to evaluate the following objectives in patients with advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic biliary tract cancer who have not received systemic therapy for&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1B&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), as determined by dose-limiting toxicities&#xD;
           (DLTs), and to characterise the safety profile of Varlitinib in combination with&#xD;
           Gemcitabine and Cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2A&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To further evaluate the safety and tolerability of Varlitinib in combination with&#xD;
           Gemcitabine and Cisplatin at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide a preliminary assessment of the clinical activity of Varlitinib in&#xD;
           combination with Gemcitabine and Cisplatin at the RP2D as measured by Objective Response&#xD;
           Rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) (based on RECIST v1.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2B&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the efficacy of Varlitinib in combination with Gemcitabine and Cisplatin to&#xD;
           placebo in combination with Gemcitabine and Cisplatin as measured by progression-free&#xD;
           survival (based on RECIST v1.1).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In phase 1B part, patients will receive Varlitinib plus Gemcitabine and Cisplatin, and follow&#xD;
      a modified 3+3+3 study dose escalation scheme starting from Varlitinib 200 mg BID. The&#xD;
      primary objective of the phase 1B part is to determine the MTD of Varlitinib when given in&#xD;
      combination with Gemcitabine and Cisplatin, and to characterise the safety profile of the&#xD;
      study treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the determined MTD and clinical information obtained from phase 1B part of the&#xD;
      study, the DSMB will review the safety data and other clinical data, together with the&#xD;
      sponsor, determine the MTD as well as the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The sponsor will&#xD;
      make a decision when to proceed with the phase 2A part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 2A part of the study is designed as a single arm expansion, enrolling a further 20&#xD;
      patients at the RP2D. The purpose of the phase 2A expansion study is to confirm the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of the RP2D in a larger number of patients, and to provide preliminary&#xD;
      estimates of the clinical activity of Varlitinib in combination with Gemcitabine and&#xD;
      Cisplatin, prior to embarking on the larger, randomised phase 2B part of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase 2B part will be a two-arm, double-blinded, placebo controlled study. Patients will&#xD;
      be randomised into 2 arms to receive Varlitinib plus Gemcitabine and Cisplatin, or placebo&#xD;
      plus Gemcitabine and Cisplatin. The primary endpoint of the phase 2B part is progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS). The randomisation will be stratified by primary tumour location (gall bladder&#xD;
      or non-gall bladder).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient screening activities including informed consent and study eligibility verification&#xD;
      will be performed within 21 days prior to first dose of the study medication. Radiological&#xD;
      imaging to assess the disease status will be performed at baseline and every 6 weeks from&#xD;
      Cycle 1 Day 1. Blood samples will be taken during the screening phase, treatment period until&#xD;
      end of treatment. Patients will be required to complete safety follow-up within 28 days after&#xD;
      the last administration of study medication.&#xD;
