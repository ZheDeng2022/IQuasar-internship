    <textblock>
      Researchers now know that treating chronic kidney disease (CKD) in its early stages can&#xD;
      prevent dialysis and reduce heart problems that go along with kidney disease. Computerized&#xD;
      tools may help primary care doctors to diagnose the disease earlier and computer reminders&#xD;
      may help doctors to prescribe the best treatments. In this project the investigators will&#xD;
      test computer reminders in primary care clinics to see if they improve treatment of early&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease and to see if it can promote referral to nephrology.&#xD;

      The investigators are conducting a randomized trial to determine the effect of a health&#xD;
      information technology (HIT) application to calculate risk progression of end stage renal&#xD;
      disease (ESRD). The primary outcome is the completion of the necessary tests for the risk&#xD;
      prediction model (urine albumin to creatinine ratio, serum calcium, serum phosphate, serum&#xD;
      albumin, and serum bicarbonate) for CKD patients in primary care. Secondary outcomes will&#xD;
      include nephrology referrals, doubling of serum creatinine, initiation of hemodialysis, and&#xD;
      primary care provider (PCP) satisfaction. In the analysis, all patients over the age of 18&#xD;
      who have a visit with one of physicians involved in the trial during the intervention period&#xD;
      will be eligible and patients with stage 3-5 CKD will be included. Physicians are the&#xD;
      subjects in this study, as the intervention is a behavioral intervention for physicians. The&#xD;
      physicians' patients will not actively be recruited and will only indirectly be affected by&#xD;
      the study. The application creates blocks of patient appointments for each physician and&#xD;
      randomly assigns patients to intervention and control arms within these blocks.&#xD;
