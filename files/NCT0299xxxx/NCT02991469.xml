      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of sarilumab in patients aged 1-17 years with&#xD;
      Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA) in order to identify the dose and regimen for&#xD;
      adequate treatment of this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the pharmacodynamics (PD) profile, the efficacy, and the long term safety of&#xD;
      sarilumab in patients with sJIA.&#xD;
