      In this study the investigators aim to investigate the relationship between environmental&#xD;
      factors, lifestyle and symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Initially&#xD;
      the investigators intend to measure the relationship between nutritional quality, exercise&#xD;
      and sleep and ADHD symptoms. And then measure whether a change made in the diet can improve&#xD;
      the symptoms of ADHD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a neurobiological chronic disorder,&#xD;
      symptomatically evolutionary and of probable genetic transmission that affects between 5 and&#xD;
      10% of the child population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current opinion on the etiology of the disorder focuses on a failure in the development&#xD;
      of brain circuits in which inhibition and self-control, critical functions to perform any&#xD;
      task, gets supported. In addition, there is greater evidence of knowledge of the genetic&#xD;
      influence as a major part of the etiology of ADHD. Studies suggest that ADHD is familiar and&#xD;
      that genetic influences may contribute to its etiology from moderate to high phenotypic&#xD;
      expression. Current studies have identified significant associations with several candidate&#xD;
      genes for this disorder, including DAT1, DRD4, DRD5, 5HTT, HTR1B or SNAP25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meta-analytical studies are needed to develop a more personalized treatment for ADHD. Other&#xD;
      factors associated with ADHD are inadequate lifestyles by parents, especially during the&#xD;
      gestation period in the case of the mother. ADHD treatment includes the use of medication and&#xD;
      psychosocial and educational support&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOOD, NUTRITION AND ADHD: A NEW PARADIGM OF THERAPY?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the above, with the use of internet many hypotheses have emerged, not yet proven,&#xD;
      many in relation to food of patients with ADHD, in which a single focus is exposed as the&#xD;
      determinant factor: heavy metals; gluten and dairy; additives; or intake of certain&#xD;
      supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The truth is that, neuronal function is strongly influenced by substances in the diet, which&#xD;
      are very important for its functioning. Many micronutrients have been evaluated, including&#xD;
      mainly vitamins B6, B12, B9, D and E along with some minerals like magnesium, selenium and&#xD;
      zinc. Their actions are related to memory, neurotransmitter synthesis and neurological&#xD;
      protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies have found magnesium deficiency in patients with ADHD, as reported in&#xD;
      relation to other nutrients. What has also led to study specifically the use of&#xD;
      supplementation, in patients with ADHD, with zinc, magnesium, phytochemicals, omega-3&#xD;
      traditional herbs or mixtures of these elements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Rating, by analysis of results, environmental, nutritional and body composition&#xD;
                factors, which may affect the pathogenesis and symptoms of ADHD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific objectives (project sub-lines):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Heritage and programming: assessing the hereditary role, as the main factor for the&#xD;
                development of ADHD: genetics, nursing, toxic habits in parents and birth&#xD;
                characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diet and physical activity: assessing the role of specific nutrients, eating&#xD;
                patterns, exercise, sedentary lifestyle, leisure type and cognitive entertainment,&#xD;
                in the development of ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Body Composition: assessing body fat accumulation and muscle mass, aspects involved&#xD;
                in the metabolism of people with ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-sectional study of observational, descriptive and comparative cohort. It consists of&#xD;
      volunteer participants, divided into two study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. cases (ADHD) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. controls (healthy, with no ADHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the initial design and protocols main databases have been revised (Scielo, PubMed,&#xD;
      ENBASE...).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development: An observational retrospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidental sample: n = 70-100 (approximately 35-50 subjects per group, of the same age&#xD;
      range).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: both genders, ages 8-16 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention trial. A personalized diet for patients will be performed. After completion of&#xD;
      the diet, the effect of the intervention on ADHD symptomatology will be measured.&#xD;

It is a noninvasive, painless study based on the application of an electrical current through the body and the record of physical parameters that depend on body's water content. The investigators will use a M230 InBody bioimpedance, multi-frequency (20 to 100 Hz), tetra-pole or similar.</description>
