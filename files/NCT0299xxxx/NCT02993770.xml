  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients with epiphora or eye discharge that admitted to our ophthalmic plastic clinic in&#xD;
      Farabi hospital will be systemically evaluated. Those with confirmed diagnosis of primary&#xD;
      nasolacrimal duct obstruction (PANDO) that need DCR by one senior ophthalmic plastic&#xD;
      consultant, will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 treatment groups: Group 1 External DCR&#xD;
      and group 2 En-DCR. Diagnosis of PANDO will be based on the presence of positive&#xD;
      regurgitation test or irrigation test or dacryocystography (DCG) . All patients will undergo&#xD;
      comprehensive ophthalmology examinations including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA),&#xD;
      relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), slit lamp anterior segment evaluation, dilated&#xD;
      fundoscopy with 78 D lens. Past history and review os systems will be elicited for&#xD;
      medications, past or intercurrent dacryocystitis,trauma,past ocular and sinus surgeries,&#xD;
      epiphora, discharge, ocular diseases, sinus/nasal diseases, diabetes mellitus, organ&#xD;
      transplant, immunosuppressive drugs and immunodeficiency disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All operations will be performed under general or local anesthesia, based on patient and&#xD;
      surgeon preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All En-DCR surgeries will be performed by a single ophthalmic plastic surgeon expert in&#xD;
      endoscopic surgery (F.P.) with a modified powered endonasal endoscopic technique described by&#xD;
      Wormold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a 0 degree 4-mm endonasal endoscope nasal mucoperiosteum in the area of the lacrimal&#xD;
      sac will be incised and elevated. Then rhinostomy will be made using forceps, exposing&#xD;
      lacrimal sac. Lacrimal sac will be opened and a Crawford silicone tube will be passed through&#xD;
      puncta into nasal cavity and stabilized and will be kept for 2 months. After operation&#xD;
      patients will receive nasal beclomethasone twice daily for 2 weeks, nasal drop phenylephrine&#xD;
      0.25% four times daily and ophthalmic drop fluorometholone and Levofloxacin four times daily&#xD;
      for one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      External DCR will be performed in a conventional manner [2]via a nasal side straight skin&#xD;
      incision 1 cm medial to medial canthal area, 1 cm long, then orbicularis oculi muscle will be&#xD;
      separated using blunt dissection to expose the periosteum overlying and medial to the&#xD;
      anterior lacrimal crest. After incision of the periosteum, an osteotomy approximately 10 mm&#xD;
      in diameter will be prepared. The lacrimal sac and then nasal mucosa will be opened by an &quot;H&quot;&#xD;
      incision to form maximal anterior flaps. A Bodkin tube will be passed through puncta into&#xD;
      nasal cavity of stabilized by multiple square knots at the end. The small posterior flaps&#xD;
      will be cut and excised and anterior flaps will be sutured together with 2 or 3 6-0 vicryl&#xD;
      sutures. The periosteum, orbicularis oculi muscle, will be sutured by 6-0 vicryl sutures.&#xD;
      Skin will be sutured by Nylon 6-0 by interrupted style in the standard manner. Nasal packing&#xD;
      will not be placed. All Ext-DCR operations will be performed by one of the two expert&#xD;
      ophthalmic plastic surgeons (F.P and A.K.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of bleeding will be estimated and recorded by the subtracting the total suction&#xD;
      reservoir from the amount of irrigated fluid through syringe during operation. Time of&#xD;
      operation will be estimated and recorded from the time of anesthetics injection to removing&#xD;
      the drape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week after operation patients will be asked to report post-operative pain and discomfort&#xD;
      by visual analogue score scale (0-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      27 Seven days after operation skin sutures of patients in group 2 will be removed if skin is&#xD;
      healed, and complications, if any, will be detected and recorded in the special data sheets.&#xD;
      Nasal bleeding, medial canthal swelling and erythema, ocular surface fluorescein staining and&#xD;
      any complications will be detected and recorded. Dye disappearance test (DDT) will be checked&#xD;
      and recorded. Epiphora will be recorded according to modified Munk epiphora staging scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two months after operation, ocular surface will be checked by fluorescein for staining of&#xD;
      cornea and conjunctiva. Then silicone tube will be removed. epiphora will be recorded&#xD;
      according to our staging system. Dye disappearance test (DDT) and Fluorescein Dynamic Dye&#xD;
      test (FDDT) and irrigation test, epiphora and skin scar by visual analogue scale (VAS) visual&#xD;
      analogue scale will be checked in months 2, 6, 12, 18 and after operation. Satisfaction will&#xD;
      be checked 2 mo and 18 mo after operation by VAS. Any grade of daily epiphora or return of&#xD;
      fluid&gt;20% through opposite punctum in irrigation test or negative FDDT (absence of fluid&#xD;
      passage) will be regarded as functional or anatomic failure, respectively. Any complication&#xD;
      will be recorded in the specific forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pre-operative and post-op examinations will be performed by a masked senior ophthalmology&#xD;
      resident subjective data will be checked and recorded by a trained nurse&#xD;
