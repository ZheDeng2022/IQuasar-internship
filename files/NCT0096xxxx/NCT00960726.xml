    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if NOV-002 can help to restore bone&#xD;
      marrow and blood levels in patients who have MDS. The safety of this drug will also be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOV-002 is a type of blood cell production stimulating drug. NOV-002 is believed to stimulate&#xD;
      the bone marrow to increase production of mature cells in the bloodstream, including red and&#xD;
      white blood cells and platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signing this consent form does not mean that you will be able to take part in this study. You&#xD;
      will have &quot;screening tests&quot; to help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in&#xD;
      this study. The following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you have taken or may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs&#xD;
           (blood pressure, temperature, breathing rate, and heart rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 7 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check for HIV and&#xD;
           hepatitis B and C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have not had a bone marrow aspiration in the month before the screening tests,&#xD;
           one will be performed to check the status of the disease. To collect a bone marrow&#xD;
           aspirate, an area of the hip is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone&#xD;
           marrow is withdrawn through a large needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are able to become pregnant will have a pregnancy test as part of the routine&#xD;
           blood or urine collection. To take part in this study, the pregnancy test must be&#xD;
           negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor will discuss the screening test results with you. If the screening tests&#xD;
      show that you are not eligible to take part in the study, you will not be enrolled. Other&#xD;
      treatment options will be discussed with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive the study drug&#xD;
      NOV-002 through a needle under the skin 1 time each day while you are on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study staff will teach you and/or a caregiver how to inject the study drug. The study&#xD;
      staff will also give you written copy of instructions on how and when you should inject the&#xD;
      study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given diary cards to record when and where on your body you inject the study&#xD;
      drug, as well as any side effects that may occur. If you miss a dose of study drug, you&#xD;
      should note that on your diary card and take the study drug the next day as scheduled. You&#xD;
      should not take a double, &quot;make-up&quot; dose at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You must store the study drug in a refrigerator and out of the reach of children. You will be&#xD;
      asked to bring all leftover study drug to each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have study visits 1 time each week during Weeks 1-8 and 1 time each month&#xD;
           during Months 3-12. At these visits, the following tests and procedures will be&#xD;
           performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you have taken or may be taking and about any side&#xD;
           effects you may have experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 5 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam 1 time each month while you are on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration every 3 months while you are on study to check&#xD;
           the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take the study drug for up to 12 months. You will be taken off study if you have&#xD;
      intolerable side effects, if the disease gets worse, or if the doctor thinks it is in your&#xD;
      best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have finished taking the study drug for any reason, the following procedures will&#xD;
      be performed for about 12 months, but will be stopped if you start receiving a different&#xD;
      treatment or if the disease gets worse:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 5 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests 1 time each month. You will have a&#xD;
      bone marrow aspiration every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. NOV-002 is not FDA approved or commercially available. At&#xD;
      this time, it is only being used in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
