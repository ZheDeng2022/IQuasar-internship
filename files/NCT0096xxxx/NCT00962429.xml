      The purpose of the study is to examine if alpha lipoic acid is an effective treatment for&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a progressive disease leading to&#xD;
      paralysis. CIDP is an immune-mediated disorder resulting from a synergistic interaction of T&#xD;
      cell-mediated and B cell-mediated immune responses directed against peripheral nerve&#xD;
      antigens. These immune mediated responses in turn increase the production of reactive oxygen&#xD;
      intermediate and cause oxidative damage of the peripheral nerve system. Although&#xD;
      corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) reduce impairment&#xD;
      caused by CIDP at least temporarily and can be used as a first-line treatments, they are not&#xD;
      ideal for long-term treatment because of serious side effects and cost. Alpha lipoic acid&#xD;
      (LA) is an antioxidant that also possesses anti-immune activity. It is effective in treating&#xD;
      diabetic neuropathy. It is also promising in treating patients with multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
