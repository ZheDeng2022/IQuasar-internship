      Rationale: Due to advanced technologies in the last decade, increasingly more treatment&#xD;
      options are available for head and neck cancer (HNC). As a consequence decision-making with&#xD;
      regard to choosing the best available treatment option is becoming increasingly relevant.&#xD;
      Quality of life weights (utility scores) are an important outcome measure in this&#xD;
      decision-making process. Utility scores can be combined with life expectancy, resulting in&#xD;
      the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY). If in economic evaluation the outcomes are expressed&#xD;
      in QALYs gained, it is possible to compare the efficiency of different interventions for&#xD;
      different indications. However, limited evidence on utility scores after treatment for HNC is&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The investigators' main objective is to examine quality of life (QoL), both&#xD;
      utility scores and disease specific quality of life, for different treatment modalities in&#xD;
      HNC. Secondary objectives are to examine whether QoL differs across health states, and which&#xD;
      factors influence QoL. As extensive data are available on disease-specific quality of life,&#xD;
      another objective is to examine whether utility scores can be derived from a commonly used&#xD;
      disease-specific questionnaire, the EORTC QLQ-C30/QLQ-H&amp;N35. If this would be possible, this&#xD;
      would limit patient burden in future clinical trials. Finally, by means of measuring&#xD;
      patients' ability to perform their work, diet and dental consequences the investigators aim&#xD;
      to measure the impact of HNC and its treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The investigators' study design is a cross-sectional survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study population consists of patients with HNC who are treated at least&#xD;
      six months ago for curative radiotherapy and/or surgery with or without chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention/method: Patients are asked to fill out a single set of questionnaires&#xD;
      (once-only). The set of questionnaires consists of three validated questionnaires, concerning&#xD;
      health state utility (EuroQol-5D), disease-specific quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30/QLQ-H&amp;N35)&#xD;
      and productivity losses (PRODISQ). In addition, two questions inquiring about patients' diet&#xD;
      and three questions considering the dental status of these patients are added to the&#xD;
      questionnaires. To classify patients into certain health states, physicians are asked to&#xD;
      score adverse events in patients during follow-up visits (according to the RTOG&#xD;
      classification).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameter is QoL (both disease specific&#xD;
      quality of life and utility scores) in a certain health state. These utility scores can be&#xD;
      used in future cost-effectiveness studies to identify the best available treatment option.&#xD;
      Other important study parameters are the factors influencing QoL, and the relationship&#xD;
      between utility score and disease-specific quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: As the study involves a once only set of questionnaires, the burden is only&#xD;
      minimal. No risks are expected to be associated with participation. It is important to gain&#xD;
      insight into QoL, patients' ability to perform their work, diet and dental consequences in&#xD;
      long-term follow-up of HNC patients, to allow for evidence-based decision-making regarding&#xD;
      treatment options for HNC.&#xD;
