  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility study, using Xolair pretreatment for oral milk desensitization.&#xD;
      The major assessment will be safety, and the investigators will evaluate for any type of&#xD;
      reaction, including allergic reactions that occur during the course of the study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that pretreatment with anti-IgE mAb will greatly reduce the side effects&#xD;
      and allergic reactions that occur during oral desensitization to foods and will enhance the&#xD;
      development of oral tolerance in patients with severe milk allergy. Once desensitized to&#xD;
      milk, children will be able to tolerate milk in a Double Blind Placebo Controlled Food&#xD;
      Challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also evaluate whether Xolair provides a robust durability of tolerance once&#xD;
      administration of Xolair is terminated. We will examine the specific immunological mechanisms&#xD;
      that mediate oral tolerance in children undergoing oral milk desensitization&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted in three parts: (1) pre-treatment with Xolair for 8 weeks, (2)&#xD;
      oral desensitization to cow's milk from weeks 9-16 and continued treatment with Xolair for 8&#xD;
      weeks, and (3) double blind placebo controlled food challenge to milk.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate to severe pediatric cow's milk allergy-sensitive subjects between the ages of&#xD;
             4-18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total IgE &gt;30 kU/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sensitivity to cow's milk allergen will be documented by a positive skin prick test&#xD;
             result (see Appendix E for details) and RAST test to cow's milk, with 25 kU/L as a&#xD;
             lower limit of eligibility. Patients who do not meet the cow's milk RAST requirement&#xD;
             may be eligible for this study if they have a history of a moderate to severe&#xD;
             reaction, and if they have recently failed an oral food challenge with milk ordered by&#xD;
             their physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All female subjects of child-bearing potential will be required to provide a urine&#xD;
             sample for pregnancy testing that must be negative one week before being allowed to&#xD;
             participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be planning to remain in the study area during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects and/or their parents must be trained on the proper use of the Epi-Pen to be&#xD;
             allowed to enroll in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No absolute contraindications to allergen skin testing and/or oral ingestion of milk&#xD;
             are known. However, the risk of serious systemic anaphylactic reactions to milk&#xD;
             suggests a number of preexisting conditions that should be considered relative&#xD;
             contraindications. Among those conditions are acute infections, autoimmune disease,&#xD;
             severe cardiac disease, and treatment with beta-adrenergic antagonistic drugs&#xD;
             (beta-blockers).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects having a history of severe anaphylaxis to milk requiring intubation or&#xD;
             admission to an ICU, frequent allergic or non-allergic urticaria, or history&#xD;
             consistent with poorly controlled persistent asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total IgE &gt; 2000 IU/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with unstable angina, significant arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension,&#xD;
             chronic sinusitis, or other chronic or immunological diseases that in the mind of the&#xD;
             investigator might interfere with the evaluation or administration of the test drug or&#xD;
             pose additional risk to the subject e.g. gastrointestinal or gastroesophageal disease,&#xD;
             chronic infections, scleroderma, hepatic and gallbladder disease, chronic non-allergic&#xD;
             pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject with an FEV1 or PEF less than 80% predicted (moderate persistent asthma) with&#xD;
             or without controller medication (if able to perform the maneuver) at screening, the&#xD;
             oral desensitization visit, or food challenge visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received an experimental drug in the last 30 days prior to admission&#xD;
             into this study or who plan to use an experimental drug during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are current users of oral, intramuscular, or intravenous corticosteroids,&#xD;
             tricyclic antidepressants, or are taking a beta-blocker (oral or topical).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects routinely using medication that could induce adverse gastrointestinal&#xD;
             reactions during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects refusing to sign the EpiPen Training Form (see Appendix F).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast feeding females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of rice and soy allergy.&#xD;
