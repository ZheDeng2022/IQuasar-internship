  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal type of oil to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) is uncertain. In general,&#xD;
      unsaturated oils with higher content of cis-monounsaturated fatty acids (MONO) or&#xD;
      cis-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are preferable over those rich in saturated fatty&#xD;
      acids. However, unsaturated oils can vary in their relative contents of n-6 and n-3 fatty&#xD;
      acids (specifically alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)). Some investigators advocate that oils rich&#xD;
      in ALA are cardioprotective, while others suggest that optimal cardioprotective effects can&#xD;
      only be obtained when oils are lower in n-6 fatty acids (mainly linoleic acid) in addition to&#xD;
      being higher in ALA. It is hypothesized that increased ALA would result in beneficial effects&#xD;
      on inflammatory markers. The objective of this trial is to establish definitively the&#xD;
      biological effects of ALA with and without reductions in linoleic acid on inflammatory&#xD;
      markers linked to CVD.&#xD;

      This study is a dietary trial that examines the effects of increasing ALA by 2 gr or 4 gr per&#xD;
      day, with and without decreasing linoleic acid, on inflammatory markers linked to CVD. Trial&#xD;
      participants (n=136), approximately 50% women, 50% men) are age 50 and older and living in&#xD;
      the town of Montana, Bulgaria during the study. The study uses a double-blinded&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over design. Combinations of two oils that are&#xD;
      considered healthy (sunflower and olive) and an ALA supplement containing either 2 or 4 gr of&#xD;
      ALA (supplied as flaxseed oil) or placebo are consumed for 6 weeks each: sunflower-ALA (high&#xD;
      linoleic-low ALA), sunflower-placebo (high linoleic-low ALA), olive-ALA (low-linoleic-high&#xD;
      ALA) and olive-placebo (low linoleic-low ALA). The participants are indicated to keep their&#xD;
      usual diet and physical activity through-out the study. The primary endpoints are plasma&#xD;
      levels of inflammatory markers. Secondary endpoints include systolic and diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure, and plasma levels of LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of increasing ALA by 2 or 4 gr per day in the context of a diet that&#xD;
      that is high in linoleic acid (~13% energy) on inflammatory markers. The ALA effect will be&#xD;
      tested by comparing ALA supplement vs. placebo while using sunflower oil for cooking at home.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that ALA has favorable effects on inflammatory markers in the context of a&#xD;
      diet that is high in linoleic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of increasing ALA by 2 or 4 gr per day in the context of a diet that&#xD;
      that is low in linoleic acid (~6% energy) on inflammatory markers. The ALA effect will be&#xD;
      tested by comparing ALA supplement vs. placebo while using olive oil for cooking at home. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that ALA has favorable effects on inflammatory markers in the context of a diet&#xD;
      that is low in linoleic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of reducing linoleic acid from a high level (~13% energy) to a low&#xD;
      level (~6% energy) while keeping ALA at a high level (2 or 4 gr per day) on plasma levels of&#xD;
      inflammatory markers. The reduction in linoleic acid will be tested by comparing sunflower to&#xD;
      olive oil while taking the ALA supplement. We hypothesize that reducing linoleic acid does&#xD;
      not affect inflammatory markers when ALA intake is high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of reducing linoleic acid from a high level (~13% energy) to a low&#xD;
      level (~6% energy) while keeping ALA at a low level (placebo) on plasma levels of&#xD;
      inflammatory markers. The reduction in linoleic acid will be tested by comparing sunflower to&#xD;
      olive oil while taking the placebo. We hypothesize that reducing linoleic acid does not&#xD;
      affect inflammatory markers when ALA intake is low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether the intervention contrasts specified in the specific aims and secondary&#xD;
      aims 1 &amp; 2 affect plasma levels of LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides and&#xD;
      blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that ALA has favorable effects on plasma triglycerides and blood pressure&#xD;
      compared to placebo regardless of whether linoleic acid is high or low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that lowering linoleic acid has favorable effects on plasma HDL cholesterol&#xD;
      but unfavorable effects on LDL cholesterol,regardless of whether ALA is high or low.&#xD;
