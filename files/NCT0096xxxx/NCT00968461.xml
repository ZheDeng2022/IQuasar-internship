  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn the highest tolerable dose of phenethyl&#xD;
      isothiocyanate (PEITC) that can be given to patients who have a lymphoproliferative disorder&#xD;
      that has been treated with fludarabine. The safety of PEITC will also be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEITC is designed to cause build-up of specific molecules in cells, which may damage cancer&#xD;
      cells and cause the cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Dose Levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of PEITC based on when you joined this study. Up to 9 dose levels of PEITC will be&#xD;
      tested. Three (3) participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of&#xD;
      participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose&#xD;
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until&#xD;
      the highest tolerable dose of PEITC is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 28 days in this study is 1 &quot;cycle.&quot; You will take PEITC capsules by mouth, 4 times a&#xD;
      day, on Days 1-3 and 8-10 of each cycle. You should take each dose with a cup (8 ounces) of&#xD;
      water, either with or without food. The doses should be taken at the same times each day&#xD;
      (about 7:00 AM, 12 noon, 5:00 PM, and 10:00 PM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a week, blood (about 1 tablespoon each time) will be drawn for routine tests. These&#xD;
      weekly blood draws will occur on Days 1, 8, 15, and 21 of each cycle, +/- 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up After Completion of Cycle 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four (4) weeks after the start of the third cycle, the following tests and procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of vital signs (blood&#xD;
           pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration, fine-needle&#xD;
           aspiration (FNA), and/or biopsy in order to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK and PD Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves blood draws for pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) testing. PK&#xD;
      testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. PD testing is&#xD;
      used to look at how the level of study drug in your body may affect the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 1 tablespoon each time) will be drawn and used for both of these tests, on the&#xD;
      following schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1 of Cycle 1 (or possibly the day before Day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days 1, 2, and 3 of Cycle 1 (at 4 hours after that day's first dose of PEITC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 4 of Cycle 1 (at 12 hours after your last dose of PEITC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive up to 6 cycles (24 weeks) of the study drug. You will be taken off the study&#xD;
      drug early if the disease gets worse or you experience intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of your last study cycle, you will have a complete physical exam, including&#xD;
      measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, unless the disease has completely responded, the following tests and procedures&#xD;
      will be performed at the end-of-study visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy to check the status of the disease,&#xD;
           if the study doctor thinks it is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 to 6 months after the end of your last study cycle, you will have a bone marrow&#xD;
      aspiration and/or biopsy if the study doctor thinks it is necessary to check the status of&#xD;
      the disease in this way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 to 6 months after the end of your last study cycle, you will have a complete physical&#xD;
      exam, including measurement of vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the follow-up visit at 24 weeks after the end of your last study cycle, the schedule of&#xD;
      your follow-up physical exams will be every 3 to 6 months. These visits may include a blood&#xD;
      draw and bone marrow aspiration. Your study doctor will decide if these tests are needed. If&#xD;
      the disease returns during this time, however, you will be considered off-study. This means&#xD;
      you will also no longer have the follow-up bone marrow samples collected as part of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. PEITC is not commercially available or FDA approved. At&#xD;
      this time, it is only being used in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 54 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
