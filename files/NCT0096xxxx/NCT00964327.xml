  <official_title>A Phase IIa Open-label, Randomized Trial to Determine the Antiviral Activity in 60 HIV Positive Subjects With Multiple PI Resistant Strains, Receiving Either Control Treatment or a Daily Dose of 800, 1600, 2400 or 3600 mg TMC114 (Darunavir) for 13 Days Followed by a Single Dose on Day 14</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the antiviral activity, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      14 days of different doses of TMC114 to treat HIV-1 positive patients whose condition is&#xD;
      failing on a current treatment regimen that includes a protease inhibitor (PI) (a medication&#xD;
      used to reduce the amount of HIV virus in the blood).To be considered for the study, patients&#xD;
      must have a documented resistance to at least 2 of the current PIs. Pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of TMC114 will also be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase lla open-label (all people involved know the identity of the treatment),&#xD;
      randomized (study drug assigned by chance), controlled (the patients of the control group&#xD;
      continue the failing regimen), dose-finding study to determine the antiviral activity, safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of a 14-day treatment with TMC114 (a protease inhibitor) for treatment of&#xD;
      human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) positive patients who are considered resistant to&#xD;
      (failing to improve on) 2 or more protease inhibitors (PIs). Sixty HIV-1 positive patients,&#xD;
      who are resistant to multiple PIs as confirmed by specialized testing (virtual phenotyping)&#xD;
      and who are currently failing to improve on a treatment regimen that contains a PI, will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of 5 treatment groups. Those randomized to the control group will&#xD;
      continue their current therapy (consisting of PIs and Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase&#xD;
      Inhibitor(s) (NRTIs)). Those randomized to the TMC114 treatment groups will receive the study&#xD;
      drug as a substitute for all the PIs in the current failing treatment regimen at the&#xD;
      following dose levels: 400 or 800 mg twice a day, or 800 or 1200 mg three times a day for 13&#xD;
      days followed by a single dose on day 14. The dose of the NRTIs (NRTIs are drugs that&#xD;
      suppress replication of retroviruses) will remain unchanged until the end of the treatment&#xD;
      period. The trial will involve a screening period of maximum three weeks, a 7-day run-in&#xD;
      period (the period of time before study start when no treatment is given), a 14-day treatment&#xD;
      period, followed by a 6- week follow-up period. The maximal trial duration will thus be&#xD;
      twelve weeks. Primary objective is to determine the antiviral activity of TMC114 as well as&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed in the body, distributed within the body and&#xD;
      how it is removed from the body over time) and pharmacodynamics (the study of the action of&#xD;
      effects a drug has on the body) will also be assessed over the 2 week period.Safety will be&#xD;
      followed at regular intervals during treatment and follow-up period. Safety assessments&#xD;
      consist of regular lab assessments, ECG recording, vital signs, physical examination, body&#xD;
      weight and Body Mass Index. Observation of and interview for adverse events will be done&#xD;
      daily during the first week of treatment, every second day during the 2nd week of treatment,&#xD;
      and at week 1, 3 and 6 of the follow-up period. In addition an Independent Data Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee will evaluate the study data at regular intervals. Patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of 5 treatment groups: 400 or 800 mg twice a day for 13 days followed by a&#xD;
      single dose on day 14, or 800 or 1200 mg three times a day for 13 days followed by a single&#xD;
      dose on day 14. Patients randomized to the control group will continue their current therapy&#xD;
      consisting of protease inhibitors (PIs) and Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors&#xD;
      (NRTIs).&#xD;
