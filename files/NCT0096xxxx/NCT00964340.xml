    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      SRT2104 in healthy elderly subjects following single and 28 days dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To contrast changes in leg muscle function following repeat doses of SRT2104 or placebo:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Endurance exercise tolerance 31P MRS measures of mitochondrial oxidative capacity in the&#xD;
           gastrocnemius muscle&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test for a change in the ratio of visceral to subcutaneous body fat following repeat&#xD;
           doses of SRT2104 relative to placebo using MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To estimate any changes in insulin sensitivity (using mOGTT) following repeat doses of&#xD;
           SRT2104 or placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To test for dose-related effects on the exploratory pharmacodynamic measures above&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled study of healthy 60-80&#xD;
      year old community-dwelling male and female subjects. The study consists of 8 outpatient&#xD;
      clinic visits, 2 inpatient clinic visits and 8 telephone contacts (including the&#xD;
      pre-screening call to determine a subject's interest in participation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo a preliminary telephone pre-screening assessment to determine their&#xD;
      interest in participating in the study. Once interest has been confirmed, subjects will sign&#xD;
      an informed consent and undergo screening procedures. Subjects meeting the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study and randomized to receive either 0.5 g/day&#xD;
      of SRT2104, 2.0 g/day of SRT2104 or placebo once daily for up to 28 consecutive days. After&#xD;
      the completion of the screening assessments and confirmation of eligibility, subjects will&#xD;
      return to the site on Day -9 and will undergo a practice endurance testing session. In&#xD;
      addition, on Day -9 subjects will be given a pedometer which they will be asked to wear while&#xD;
      awake for 7 consecutive days from Day -8 and 7 consecutive days from Day 20 to estimate daily&#xD;
      physical mobility levels in the home environment. Subjects will return to the site on Days -1&#xD;
      and 27 for safety assessments, MRI/MRS assessments and exercise endurance tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1 and 28 subjects will be admitted overnight as inpatients. PK samples will be&#xD;
      collected through 24 hours post-dose on Days 2 and 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the dosing period safety visits will be performed on approximately Days 7, 14, and 21.&#xD;
      Additional telephone safety assessments will be made approximately on Days 3, 5, 10, 17, 20&#xD;
      and 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The End of Dosing Follow-up visit will be performed approximately 35 days following the first&#xD;
      dose of SRT2104 or placebo. An additional follow up safety telephone call will be made to&#xD;
      each subject 30 days following their final dose of SRT2104 and/or placebo. The end of the&#xD;
      study is defined as the last subject's last assessment (i.e. Day 58, the date of the last&#xD;
      subject communication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to self administer test material at home on study days 3-27. All&#xD;
      study visits are outpatient visits except for Day 1 and Day 28. Subjects will stay overnight&#xD;
      at the site the evening of Day 1 and Day 28. On Day 2 and Day 29 subjects will be discharged&#xD;
      home following the completion of study assessments and when considered clinically appropriate&#xD;
      by the study physician.&#xD;
