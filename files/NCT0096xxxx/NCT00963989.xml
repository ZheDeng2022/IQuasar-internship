      The primary objective of this clinical evaluation is to determine the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the Penumbra System in a stroke cohort who presents within 8 hours from&#xD;
      symptom and with a known core infarct volume at admission. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      determine if there is a correlation between infarct volume and functional outcome in treated&#xD;
      patients at 90 days post-procedure.&#xD;

      Study Title: The START Trial: Clinical Outcome in Acute Stroke Treatment after Imaging Guided&#xD;
      Patient Selection for Interventional Revascularization Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective: The objective of this clinical evaluation is to determine the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the Penumbra System in a stroke cohort who presents within 8 hours from&#xD;
      symptom onset and with a known core infarct volume at admission. The data will also be used&#xD;
      to determine if there is a correlation between infarct volume and functional outcome at 90&#xD;
      days post-procedure. Safety is defined by the procedural serious adverse events, and&#xD;
      effectiveness is defined by the rate of revascularization (TIMI 2-3/TICI 2a-3) and good&#xD;
      functional outcome. Good functional outcome is defined by a modified Rankin scale (mRS) score&#xD;
      of 2 or less at 90 days post-procedure. Core infarct volume at admission will be assessed by&#xD;
      computed tomography perfusion (CTP), computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic&#xD;
      resonance DWI scans. The core infarct volumes will be sub-grouped by &lt;50cc, 50-100cc and&#xD;
      &gt;100cc to determine the correlation with patient functional outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A prospective, single arm, multi-center trial. Up to 200 patients at up to 45&#xD;
      centers will be enrolled in the study. It is anticipated that up to 150 evaluable patients&#xD;
      will be needed for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population: Patients presenting with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke within 8 hours&#xD;
      from symptom onset and with a known imaging-defined infarct volume will be enrolled for&#xD;
      interventional treatment by the Penumbra System to achieve revascularization of the target&#xD;
      vessel territory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication: The Penumbra System is intended for use in the revascularization of patients with&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke secondary to intracranial large vessel occlusive disease (within the&#xD;
      internal carotid, middle cerebral - M1 and M2 segments, basilar, and vertebral arteries)&#xD;
      within 8 hours of symptom onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Justification: Up to 200 subjects will be enrolled in order to obtain up to 150&#xD;
      evaluable patients. Assuming a post-procedure angiographic success (TIMI 2-3/TICI 2a-3) rate&#xD;
      of 80% (120/150), the expected two-sided exact binomial 95% confidence interval is (72.7%,&#xD;
      86.1%). Assuming a 90-day mRS success (mRS 0-2) rate of 30%, the expected two-sided exact&#xD;
      binomial 95% confidence interval is (22.8%, 38.0%). Additionally, the study results will be&#xD;
      used for sample size estimates for a potential future randomized, concurrent controlled&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core Laboratory and Clinical Event Committee An independent Core Lab will review and score&#xD;
      all imaging scans for infarct volume, TIMI, TICI and ICH. A Clinical Event Committee will&#xD;
      adjudicate all Serious Adverse Events for severity and causality (disease-, procedure-,&#xD;
      drug-, or device-relatedness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale: Use of interventional revascularization techniques offer several potential&#xD;
      clinical benefits by improving cerebral perfusion to the target vascular territory in certain&#xD;
      patients. The validation of a simple, pragmatic, and executable image guided patient&#xD;
      selection paradigm may identify a cohort of acute stroke patients who will benefit from&#xD;
      interventional treatment by the Penumbra System and in whom revascularization as a treatment&#xD;
      for acute stroke will be indicated.&#xD;
