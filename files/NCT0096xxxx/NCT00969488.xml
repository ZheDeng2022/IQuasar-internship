    <textblock>
      Nearly 20% of women do not return to their pré-gestacional body weight. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate the effect of diet and socio-demographics factors during gestation&#xD;
      and postpartum period to body weight change after delivery. This is a clinical trial with 180&#xD;
      women interviewed at 1 (baseline), 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 months postpartum. The dietary data were&#xD;
      obtained by employing the Food Consumption Frequency Questionnaire with reference to the&#xD;
      first and sixth months of postpartum.&#xD;

      SUBJECTS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. STUDY DESIGN AND SUBJECTS This randomized clinical trial study examined the efficacy of&#xD;
           two weight loss diets with different intake of protein by kg of body weight in&#xD;
           postpartum women that had at Hospital Leonel de Moura Brizola do Município de Mesquita,&#xD;
           situated at Rio de Janeiro State. Inclusion criterion were women with body mass index&#xD;
           (BMI) ≥ 26 kg/m2, age between 18 and 45 years, without chronic illnesses (thyroid&#xD;
           disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. COLLECTION OF DATA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1- Collection: Maternity. The women with BMI ≥ 26 kg/m2 are invited to participate in the&#xD;
      study at the maternity until 3 days after child birth. The women that chose to participate&#xD;
      will be scheduled to come in for their first visit approximately one month after the birth of&#xD;
      their child. The visits will occur in the Hospital Municipal Leonel de Moura Brizola and the&#xD;
      evaluations of body composition by DXA will take place at the University of the Rio de&#xD;
      Janeiro State. The room at the University prepared for the visits will provide comfort for&#xD;
      the mothers and their babies. The place picked for the participants of this study is the&#xD;
      hospital at which the sponsor works and because it consists of low income women with high&#xD;
      risk of obesity post partum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this occasion, dietary intake, antropometrics and socio-demographic measures were been&#xD;
      taken. The women will answer their clinical history, foodnutrient intake of the last six&#xD;
      months prior to the birth of their child, breastfeeding, their social-demographics status,&#xD;
      and life style (education, civil state, age, work, living conditions, race, smoking, and&#xD;
      consumption of alcohol). The participant's race will be determined by skin color given by the&#xD;
      participants themselves as well as the interviewer. Body weight and composition and height&#xD;
      will be measured using an electronic scale (Tanita, Model BWB-627A) stadiometer (Holtain&#xD;
      Limited, Crymych, United Kingdom), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2- First month of postpartum: cohort baseline. At this moment, the women will receive&#xD;
      information about the study, the procedures that will take place, the objectives of the&#xD;
      study, and will sign the terms of consent. Only the women that show up to this visit will&#xD;
      form the cohort for the randomized diet. The participants of the study will be allocated&#xD;
      randomly into a control and experimental group. After the allocation, the women will receive&#xD;
      a program to lose weight as will be discussed in section 3- Intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body weight and body composition of the participants will be measured on the first&#xD;
      interview and all others waves of follow-up with an electronic scale (Tanita, Model BWB-627A)&#xD;
      that has a capacity 150kg and precision of 0.1kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the participants will receive nutritional guidance. The mothers will be guied to the&#xD;
      Mesquita's reference laboratorie to collect blood samples and diagnose any nutritional&#xD;
      deficiencies or physiological alterations of the reproductive period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dietary intake will be obtained by a 24-hour recall and a semiquantitave food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire (FFQ) previously validated by Sichieri e Everhart (1998), about the last month&#xD;
      diet. The is used in epidemiological studies and more specifically to evaluate post partum&#xD;
      mothers (Rodrigues &amp; Costa, 2001, Kesa &amp; Oldewagw-Theron, 2004, George et al., 2005). Studies&#xD;
      have shown that this instrument is valid and reproducible to measure nutrients intake&#xD;
      (Erkkola et al., 2001; Bunin et al., 2001). Questions about physical activity, breastfeeding&#xD;
      and perception of body composition will be done in this visit. The evaluation of physical&#xD;
      activity will be obtained through a questionnaire of leisure physical activities that has&#xD;
      been previously validated (Pardini et al., 2000). At this visit, the women will indicate in a&#xD;
      scale of body perception, which women model they perceive to be closest to their own body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3-Second Month post partum: second wave of follow-up. The women will be transported to UERJ&#xD;
      for their second visit. At this visit, the women's weight, body perimeters, and skin folds.&#xD;
      Body composition will be determined through bioimpedância (Biodynamics 450) and by the DXA&#xD;
      which scans the entire body transversely in sections of low and high energy X rays of 1cm. At&#xD;
      each section of the body that is scanned, the body's composition of body fat and lean mass&#xD;
      will be determined. This method has been termed as the most accurate and precise device for&#xD;
      measuring body composition (Lohman &amp; Chen, 2005). The DXA will quantify the lean mass, bone&#xD;
      mass, body fat, and abdominal fat. The total body fat will be expressed in terms relative to&#xD;
      body mass. The use of the DXA is conditioned to a negative pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DXA is an accurate non invasive method of low radiation (1/10 do Raio-X) (Ellis et al.,&#xD;
      1994; Tataranni &amp; Ravussin, 1995; Marques et al., 2000) that is widely used to evaluate the&#xD;
      density of bone minerals in adults (Paton et al., 2003), newborns (Jarjou et al., 2006),&#xD;
      lactating women (Richie et al, 1998; Laskey et al., 1998; Bezerra et al., 2004), and also in&#xD;
      the evaluation of body composition and percentage of body fat (Kim et al., 2002; Rech et al.,&#xD;
      2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this visit the women will answer breastfeeding, social and diet commitment questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4-Third month postpartum: third wave of follow-up. The participants will once again be&#xD;
      weighted and answer a 24-hour recall. Information about the mother's breast-feeding and&#xD;
      commitment to the diet will be obtained. A questionnaire tracking the mother's commitment to&#xD;
      the diet has been formulated based on the analysis of the variation of the diet quality of&#xD;
      the pregnant women. (Castro et al., 2006; Castro et al., no prelo). The nutrients responsible&#xD;
      for the difference in the density of the diet are: rice, beans, vegetables, fruits, cereals,&#xD;
      meats, poultry, milk, milk derivatives, sweets, coffee, wine, and beer. Since the study is&#xD;
      based on overweight women and in which the intervention is based on a high protein diet:&#xD;
      sardines, fish, eggs, sodas, and finger foods were inserted into the questionnaire. Some food&#xD;
      items grouped into cereals were placed separately on the questionnaire in order to analyze&#xD;
      the differences of carbohydrate consumption in the groups of: pasta, breads, cookies, cakes,&#xD;
      potatoes, yucca, and yams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this visit, the women will respond to a psychological questionnaire that will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate minor psychiatric disturbance prior to the reproductive cycle and the Edimburgo&#xD;
      scale to evaluate postpartum depression. The women will once again evaluate themselves on the&#xD;
      body perception scale and will be guied to collect the second blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5-Fourth month postpartum: fourth wave of follow-up. In the fourth month's visit, the&#xD;
      participants will be evaluated on their weight, body perimeters and the measurements of body&#xD;
      composition, breastfeeding and questionnaire of diet commitment. The 24- hour recall diet&#xD;
      will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-6- Fifth month postpartum: fifth wave of follow-up. The weight of the mothers and their&#xD;
      babies will be taken as well as an evaluation of their body's composition based on&#xD;
      bioimpedância measurements and body perimeters. Information of breast-feeding will be&#xD;
      collected along with another 24-hour food intake recall, FFQ, physical activity, and the body&#xD;
      perception scale. A final blood sample will be collected and compared with the initial&#xD;
      nutritional state. Information about the women's commitment to the diet and depression will&#xD;
      also be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-6- Sixth month postpartum: sixth wave of follow-up. The women will be transported to UERJ&#xD;
      for their sixth visit. The mother and child's weight will be evaluated in this occasion. Body&#xD;
      composition will be taken by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Antropometrics&#xD;
      measuraments (circumferences and skin folds) will be obtained as recommended by Lohman&#xD;
      (1988). In this visit the women will be evaluated on their waist and hip circumferences&#xD;
      measured by World Health Organization (1997) and will answer breastfeeding, social and diet&#xD;
      commitment questionnaires.&#xD;
