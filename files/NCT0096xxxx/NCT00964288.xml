  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to assess the effects of GSK1014802 and a positive control,&#xD;
      lidocaine, on tests of peripheral nerve excitability. This will be a double blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled, 4-period cross over study. Approximately 20 subjects will be randomised to one of&#xD;
      two doses of a GSK1014802, lidocaine and placebo with at least 2 weeks between sessions. A&#xD;
      follow-up will occur 7-15 days after the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment session 3 on the 6th October 2009, one subject had a pattern of AEs of&#xD;
      severe intensity, suggestive of brain stem toxicity / encephalopathy during the&#xD;
      lidocaine/saline infusion period. Although recognised in the literature when lidocaine was&#xD;
      used in patients for treatment of pain, these AEs were unusual in studies in healthy&#xD;
      subjects. The study was suspended to allow re-evaluation of the risk:benefit balance of&#xD;
      lidocaine/saline infusion in healthy subjects in this study. It was decided that continuation&#xD;
      of the use of lidocaine (positive control) would risk the safety of subjects. Continuation&#xD;
      without the positive control was not possible as it would compromise the scientific integrity&#xD;
      of the design.&#xD;
