    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if treatment with curcumin can help to&#xD;
      decrease the size of lesions and/or decrease itching in patients with MF or SS. The safety of&#xD;
      curcumin will also be studied.&#xD;

      Curcumin:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curcumin, a yellow substance taken from a plant, is commonly used in cooking as a spice&#xD;
      called turmeric. In this study, participants will receive much higher doses of curcumin than&#xD;
      can be received through food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curcumin may block proteins that help cells to divide. These proteins also may stop cancer&#xD;
      cells from dying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will swallow 2 sticks of&#xD;
      curcumin per day. You should take the 2 sticks each morning with food and enough water for&#xD;
      you to be able to swallow them. If you miss taking a dose of curcumin in the morning, you can&#xD;
      take it later that day (as soon as you remember). However, if you miss a dose all day, do not&#xD;
      take 2 doses the next day to make up for it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to return for study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At &quot;baseline&quot; (Day 1), the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to rate your itching on a scale of 0-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the 2 quality-of-life questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study staff will take photos of up to 6 selected skin lesion(s). These will be&#xD;
           close-up photos of the lesions and a small area of surrounding skin. &quot;Half-body&quot; photos&#xD;
           will also be taken. These will be front, back, and/or side views of the top and bottom&#xD;
           half of your body, depending on where the lesions are. For the half-body photos, your&#xD;
           private areas will be covered (as much as possible), and your face will not be included&#xD;
           in the photos unless there are lesions there.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete 2 &quot;quality-of-life&quot; questionnaires that ask how the symptoms of the&#xD;
           disease may be affecting your life. This should take about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including having skin lesions and affected areas of your&#xD;
           skin looked at by the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a skin biopsy performed. To&#xD;
           perform a skin biopsy, the area is numbed with anesthetic and a small amount of tissue&#xD;
           (about the size of a pencil eraser) is removed with a special tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests and procedures will be performed at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including having skin lesions and affected areas of your&#xD;
           skin looked at by the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the 2 quality-of-life questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your vital signs will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to rate your itching on a scale of 0-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Weeks 2, 4, and 12 only, the following additional test will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Just like at baseline, you will have skin lesion photos and half-body photos taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Weeks 4, 12, and 20 only, the following additional test will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor decides it is needed based on abnormal blood tests at screening, additional&#xD;
      blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check the status of the disease at Weeks 2, 4, 8,&#xD;
      and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at any time during the study the skin disease seems to have cleared, you will have a skin&#xD;
      biopsy performed in order to confirm the response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue receiving the study drug for up to 6 months, as long as you and the study&#xD;
      doctor think you are benefitting from taking curcumin. If the disease gets worse or&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur at any time during this study, you will be taken off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When you go off study for any reason, you will have an end-of-treatment visit. The following&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to rate your itching on a scale of 0-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor decides it is needed based on abnormal blood tests at screening,&#xD;
           additional blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A skin biopsy will be performed to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photos of the skin lesion(s) will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the 2 quality-of-life questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT and/or PET scan to check the size of the lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 months for 6 months after your last dose of the study drug, the study staff will&#xD;
      check the results of any routine tests that were performed at your regular follow-up visits&#xD;
      for MF or SS. If you do not visit the clinic during one or both of these two 3-month time&#xD;
      periods, you will be called at home at 3 months and/or 6 months after your last dose of the&#xD;
      study drug. The purpose of the phone calls is to ask how you are doing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Curcumin is not FDA approved or commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. For this purpose, it is being used in research&#xD;
      only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 20 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
