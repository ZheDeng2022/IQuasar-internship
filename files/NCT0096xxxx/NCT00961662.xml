    <textblock>
      This study is a six-month, prospective, randomized, multicenter, single- blind, controlled&#xD;
      clinical study to evaluate the effect of three low-doses of Naturlose (Tagatose) on glycemic&#xD;
      control and safety in subjects with Type 2 diabetes under diet control and exercise. The&#xD;
      subjects were randomized in one of the 3 arms receiving 2.5, 5 or 7.5 gm of Tagatose.&#xD;

      Screening (Visit 1) and Run-in Period&#xD;
&#xD;
      This period of the study was designed as an 8-week screening and stabilization period, during&#xD;
      which potentially eligible subjects participated in a weight-maintaining diet and a daily&#xD;
      exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who were eligible for screening were diabetic subjects treated solely with diet and&#xD;
      exercise and who had mildly elevated HbA1c levels but were otherwise in good health and were&#xD;
      not suffering from any serious complications of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the screening visit, potentially eligible study subjects were instructed to&#xD;
      follow a weight-maintaining diet and a daily exercise program. They were given a blank&#xD;
      subject diary and a nutritional diary, and were scheduled for the second visit (Visit 2)&#xD;
      after 8 weeks of stabilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Visit (Visit 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 2, prior to randomization, qualifying study subjects had the following baseline&#xD;
      procedures performed: a complete medical evaluation including a review of medical history&#xD;
      changes since Visit 1 and a physical examination, blood drawn for clinical laboratory&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was stratified by site and baseline HbA1c levels (&lt; 7.5% or ≥ 7.5%) to obtain a&#xD;
      balanced distribution of subjects across the three arms of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects received a sufficient supply of study medication to last until the next visit.&#xD;
      Additionally, the subject received a diary and diary completion instructions for recording&#xD;
      side effects, intercurrent illnesses/symptoms, and concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One and Two Month Maintenance Visits (Visit 3 and Visit 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each of these visits, subjects returned to the clinic for diary assessment, blood tests,&#xD;
      and study drug compliance assessment and dispensation of additional study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects had blood drawn for clinical laboratory testing including a hematology panel,&#xD;
      chemistry panel, creatinine clearance, insulin level, liver function tests, lipid profile,&#xD;
      HbA1c level, and urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six Month, End of Study Visit (Visit 5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this final visit, all assessments conducted at Visits 3 and 4 were repeated.&#xD;
      Additionally, a final physical examination was conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments Administered There were 3 minimal-dose D-tagatose treatment groups in this trial:&#xD;
      2.5 g tid, 5.0 g tid, and 7.5 g tid. The duration of treatment for all groups was 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing of Doses for Each Subject&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tid dosage regimen (i.e., dosing prior to each meal) was selected in order to standardize&#xD;
      the fasting status at the time of dose administration across each subjects. The treatment&#xD;
      duration of 6 months was determined to be sufficient to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      the three dosages for this Phase 2 trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures below were performed to assure the proper conduct of the trial and to assure&#xD;
      an accurate, consistent, complete, and reliable report on the data collected during the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before study initiation and periodically during the study, the monitor visited the&#xD;
      investigational sites. A study initiation meeting was held at each investigative site before&#xD;
      enrollment of the first subject to review study design, study procedures, data collection,&#xD;
      and investigator responsibilities. During interim field monitoring visits, the monitor&#xD;
      verified CRF entries against available source documents and ensured that appropriate data&#xD;
      were collected and documented. Frequent telephone contact with each study site was maintained&#xD;
      throughout the study, and copies of written correspondence between the investigators,&#xD;
      sponsor, and IRBs are on file with the sponsor and investigators. Data were collected from&#xD;
      the investigational center while respecting the anonymity of all subjects. Prior to data&#xD;
      entry, CRFs were checked for completeness and consistency by the monitor and verified against&#xD;
      source documentation that was maintained at each study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from CRF were entered into a relational database (Sequel) via optical character&#xD;
      recognition, and subsequently verified versus the CRF by two independent data entry clerks.&#xD;
      Any discrepancies in the interpretation of data from the hard copy CRF were referred to a&#xD;
      lead data manager who either resolved the discrepancy through review of the CRF or referred&#xD;
      the discrepancy to the study site for resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent to the above data verification processes, programmed validation runs were&#xD;
      conducted at regular intervals to check the logic, consistency, and validity of the verified&#xD;
      data. Inconsistencies in data logic were referred to the study centers for resolution via&#xD;
      data clarification forms (DCF), which required investigator signature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and quality assurance/control of electronically transmitted laboratory data&#xD;
      were handled according to the respective laboratory's standard procedures before transmission&#xD;
      to the CRO for analysis. Programmed validation runs of the central laboratory data versus&#xD;
      information from the CRF were performed and discrepancies were reconciled with the study site&#xD;
      and the central laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to data lock for the final analysis, the following quality control procedures were&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An audit of CRF and resolved queries versus analysis data was performed on 100% of the&#xD;
           subjects for the primary endpoint, demographics, end of study findings, and&#xD;
           randomization information. All errors found during the audit were reported to the lead&#xD;
           data manager and corrected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An audit of all remaining CRF data (other than primary endpoint, demographics, end of&#xD;
           study findings, and randomization information) was performed for a randomly selected 10%&#xD;
           of the subjects. If the error rate exceeded 0.5%, a systematic random sampling of an&#xD;
           additional 10% of subjects was repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final audit report and memo summarizing the audit findings was generated and given to the&#xD;
      lead data manager and is on file at the CRO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses were performed primarily with Statistical Analysis System (SAS®) software,&#xD;
      version 9.0 or higher. SAS analysis datasets were crosschecked against the locked database&#xD;
      and/or CRF. Data summary tables were crosschecked against SAS analysis datasets. All&#xD;
      identified inconsistencies were reported to the lead statistician and resolved prior to&#xD;
      production of this report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study report was checked for accuracy and consistency before sign-off. This&#xD;
      check consisted of a verification of the report text against the report synopsis, and a&#xD;
      crosscheck of textual information provided in the report and synopsis versus source summary&#xD;
      tables, data listings, and report appendices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical and Analytical Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRO prepared a statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the efficacy and safety data before&#xD;
      database lock. The SAP was finalized on December 6, 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Populations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three analysis populations defined in the SAP, along with their respective definitions&#xD;
      and intended use are provided below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main efficacy analysis was conducted using the ITT population. The ITT population&#xD;
      included all subjects who had signed the ICF, received the protocol-specified treatment, and&#xD;
      had a baseline and at least one post-baseline HbA1c value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Efficacy Evaluable (EE) population was used for supportive efficacy analyses. The EE&#xD;
      population consisted of all randomized subjects who completed the 6-month treatment period,&#xD;
      and had no major protocol violations or eligibility violations. All protocol violations were&#xD;
      identified prior to breaking the blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety population consisted of all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of&#xD;
      study medication and had at least one post-treatment visit for safety assessment. This&#xD;
      population was used for all safety summaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Method Details&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data summaries were prepared for each treatment group and the population as a whole (i.e.,&#xD;
      all treatment groups combined). The descriptive statistics provided in data summary tables&#xD;
      involving continuous data included the number of observations, mean, standard deviation,&#xD;
      median, and minimum and maximum values. The descriptive statistics provided in data summary&#xD;
      tables involving categorical data included frequency counts and percentages. Inferential&#xD;
      statistics were provided only for efficacy endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Exposure to Study Drug&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration (days) of study drug dosing was estimated and summarized descriptively for the&#xD;
      Safety Population by dose group and for all doses combined. Duration was based on entries in&#xD;
      the CRF and was calculated as last dose date minus first dose date plus one day [(last dose&#xD;
      date - first dose date) + 1 day]. If the medication stop date was missing or if the stop date&#xD;
      was specified as continuing, the end of study date, as recorded in the CRF, was used as the&#xD;
      stop date for duration determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percent compliance with study medication was calculated as [(total units of drug returned&#xD;
      minus the total units of drug dispensed) ÷ by the total dispensed] times 100%. Resulting data&#xD;
      were summarized descriptively for the Safety population by dose group and for all doses&#xD;
      combined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      All efficacy endpoints were summarized descriptively by dose group and for all doses combined&#xD;
      for the ITT and the EE populations. All statistical tests for comparisons of dose groups were&#xD;
      two-sided tests, with no p-value adjustment. The ITT and EE populations were used in the&#xD;
      analyses of efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Safety Population was used for all analyses of safety and tolerability. All safety&#xD;
      parameters were presented descriptively and as data listings. No inferential statistics were&#xD;
      planned or performed on safety data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number and percentage of subjects who reported AE were summarized descriptively by MedDRA&#xD;
      System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT), Version 10.0, and dose group. Adverse&#xD;
      events and SAEs occurring between randomization and the last study visit are summarized.&#xD;
      Unless otherwise specified, the incidences of unique events are provided in all AE&#xD;
      summarizations (i.e., a subject is counted only once for each unique event occurring in the&#xD;
      summary). For summaries of AEs by severity, if a subject had more than one event per MedDRA&#xD;
      SOC or PT, the worst severity was tabulated. Similarly, for summaries of AEs by causality, if&#xD;
      a subject had more than one event per MedDRA SOC or PT, the worst severity was tabulated.&#xD;
      Additionally, a summary of AEs leading to study drug discontinuation is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoglycemic Episodes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects experiencing one or more events that coded to the MedDRA PT of &quot;hypoglycemia&quot;&#xD;
      were included in the summaries of AEs (see above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal Side Effects: Categorical summaries of responses to each of the questions on&#xD;
      the GSRS were prepared based on time point and dose group. Additionally, all subjects&#xD;
      experiencing one or more events that coded to the MedDRA SOC of &quot;Gastrointestinal Disorders&quot;&#xD;
      were included in the summaries of AEs (see above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation was based on a reduction of at least 0.5% in HbA1c level after 6&#xD;
      months of the study treatment compared to baseline for each dose group, a standard deviation&#xD;
      of 1.0 for each treatment group, and an 80% statistical power with a two-sided analysis at a&#xD;
      Type I error rate of 0.05. The required number of evaluable subjects was about 102 (34 for&#xD;
      each D-tagatose dose group) based on nQuery Advisor, version 6.01. A total of 40 subjects per&#xD;
      treatment group (120 subjects for the study) were to be recruited, as it was expected to&#xD;
      observe a 15% drop out rate in this study population, and a total of 150 subjects (50 for per&#xD;
      treatment group) was screened based on the estimated screen failure rate of 20%.&#xD;
