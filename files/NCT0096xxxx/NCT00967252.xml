      Despite improvements in perioperative care, non-cardiac surgery remains associated with&#xD;
      significant and costly complications. Analysis of perioperative deaths in the United Kingdom&#xD;
      suggests that roughly 80% are directly attributable to infectious and cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications. The best available evidence suggests that medical optimization is the&#xD;
      preferred strategy to reduce cardiac risks but there has been no novel strategy to reduce&#xD;
      nosocomial infection rates in over 20 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging evidence in both the non-operative and operative setting suggest that statin drugs&#xD;
      may prevent both infectious and cardiac events. The mechanism(s) of action are not entirely&#xD;
      clear but appear to independent of lipid lowering effects and are often referred to as&#xD;
      pleiotropic effects. Two key elements of the pleiotropic effects of statins appear to be&#xD;
      their anti-inflammatory properties and improved endothelial vascular reactivity. The statin&#xD;
      dose required to maximize these effects is unknown. A large observational trial suggests a&#xD;
      contradictory dose effect with higher doses associated with reduced infectious complications&#xD;
      and lower doses associated with fewer cardiac complications. Doctors therefore still have&#xD;
      many unanswered questions about the use of statins in the perioperative setting. Should they&#xD;
      be routinely started on all or only certain surgical patients? What dose of statin should be&#xD;
      used? If a patient is already on a statin, should their dose be altered perioperatively? The&#xD;
      latter question is particularly relevant in light of the marked increase in statin use.&#xD;
      Recruitment logs for an ongoing trial demonstrate that over 70% of patients undergoing&#xD;
      high-risk surgery were taking a statin but at markedly variable doses. This population&#xD;
      presents an ideal opportunity to determine if there is a dose response relationship between&#xD;
      statins and pleiotropic effects. We therefore propose an observational study that will&#xD;
      determine anti-inflammatory and endothelial effects in high-risk surgical patients on varying&#xD;
      doses of a perioperative statin drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atorvastatin diminishes the rise in C-reactive protein (CRP), measured 48 hours after&#xD;
      elective vascular surgery, in a dose dependent fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atorvastatin reduces endothelial dysfunction after elective vascular surgery, as measured by&#xD;
      brachial artery ultrasound, in a dose dependent fashion.&#xD;

      It is estimated that approximately 1.7 million surgical procedures are performed each year in&#xD;
      Canada. Unfortunately, perioperative complications are not an uncommon occurrence and have&#xD;
      substantial morbidity, mortality and costs associated with them. To date, the best strategies&#xD;
      to reduce nosocomial infections are aseptic practices, timely prophylactic antibiotics and&#xD;
      good surgical technique. Despite these strategies, it is estimated that at least 1 in 5 major&#xD;
      vascular surgical patients will have some type of nosocomial infection within 30 days of&#xD;
      their procedure. The direct and indirect mortality of infections in this population is&#xD;
      difficult to estimate but nosocomial infections are estimated to contribute to at least 15%&#xD;
      of the mortality in hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary manner in which infections contribute to patient mortality is by progression to&#xD;
      sepsis. Sepsis is the tenth leading cause of death in Canadians and worldwide is increasing&#xD;
      in incidence and severity. The associated mortality of sepsis varies by population and&#xD;
      infection source but is usually between 30-60%. Despite significant improvements in the&#xD;
      management of sepsis in the last 5 years, there is still no generally effective preventive&#xD;
      medication or strategy. Although cardiovascular complications, including myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and heart failure, are less common at 15% of major vascular patients, they have a&#xD;
      staggering mortality of around 30-50%. Clearly, strategies or therapies to reduce these&#xD;
      complications could have profound benefits. The questions are therefore whether statin drugs&#xD;
      reduce sepsis, cardiovascular complications, or both and, if they do, how might they do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis and acute coronary syndromes in the&#xD;
      non-operative setting has led to tremendous advancements in the management. In sepsis, an&#xD;
      excessive, inappropriate and misguided response in the host defense response is likely&#xD;
      responsible. Massive cytokine release exacerbates endothelium dysfunction that then impacts&#xD;
      coagulation, thrombolysis, inflammation, tissue repair and tissue growth. If not corrected,&#xD;
      the endothelial cells either die directly or through the triggering of apoptosis. This then&#xD;
      leads to multiorgan dysfunction and ultimately death. How sepsis ultimately impairs and&#xD;
      damages endothelial cell function is likely multifactoral. Impairment of endothelial nitric&#xD;
      oxide synthetase occurs that causes impaired perfusion and inappropriate microvasculature&#xD;
      coagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a strikingly similar manner to sepsis, key elements to acute coronary syndromes again&#xD;
      appear to be inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Rupture of coronary plaques and&#xD;
      thrombosis are central. Although perioperative myocardial events are traditionally said to be&#xD;
      supply-demand problems, this theory is in dispute and evidence suggests that perioperative&#xD;
      problems are very similar to non-operative events. Elevated levels of various inflammatory&#xD;
      markers, particularly C-Reactive Protein, are associated with adverse cardiovascular events.&#xD;
      Similarly, the vascular endothelium is responsible for regulating vasomotor tone, thrombosis,&#xD;
      platelet and leukocyte interactions. Dysfunction of the endothelium is also believed to be a&#xD;
      central component of the development of coronary complications. Although endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction has not been extensively investigated in the perioperative setting,&#xD;
      pathophysiologic similarities make it probable that perioperative endothelial dysfunction&#xD;
      contributes to the occurrence of perioperative myocardial events. Thus, strategies designed&#xD;
      to control perioperative inflammation, as well as to improve endothelial function and&#xD;
      stabilize coronary plaque have the potential to reduce both perioperative coronary and&#xD;
      infectious events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although studies in both animals and humans strongly suggest that statins may both prevent&#xD;
      and treat sepsis, no prospective randomized trials in humans have been conducted to&#xD;
      demonstrate these effects. Although some statins have been demonstrated to directly attenuate&#xD;
      replication and infectivity of microorganisms, the evidence primarily suggests that if&#xD;
      statins are indeed protective it will likely be due to their anti-inflammatory and favorable&#xD;
      endothelial effects. Improvement of endothelial function by statins has been suggested to&#xD;
      prevent cardiac events by stabilizing coronary plaques and may even contribute to plaque&#xD;
      regression. Statins restore endothelial production of endogenous nitric oxide synthetase thus&#xD;
      improving organ perfusion and microvasculature thrombosis that is impaired in the setting of&#xD;
      sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of the proposed trial, STAR VaS II are therefore twofold: First, it will help&#xD;
      determine if statin blunts the adverse perioperative changes in inflammation and endothelial&#xD;
      function in a dose-dependent fashion. Second, it will determine if patients chronically on&#xD;
      lower than maximal statin dose should have their dose increased in the perioperative period.&#xD;
      We will evaluate the influence of varying doses of statins on perioperative inflammation, as&#xD;
      assessed by C-reactive protein, and endothelial function as assessed by brachial artery&#xD;
      ultrasound. If atorvastatin, chronically administered before surgery, improves inflammatory&#xD;
      changes or endothelial function in a dose dependent fashion, then it is plausible that&#xD;
      patients chronically on lower statin doses should have their dose increased in the&#xD;
      perioperative period. If however patients on lower doses experienced similar benefit, as&#xD;
      those on higher doses, then conceivably the recommended perioperative dose could be lower&#xD;
      thereby theoretically further improving the risk-benefit ratio for a statin drug. All&#xD;
      patients will be assessed for infections as defined by the CDC.&#xD;
