  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are currently verifying early data showing that the K3 Promoter prosthetic&#xD;
      foot affects walking efficiency or stability in transtibial, unilateral amputees when&#xD;
      compared to their current prostheses. Phase II funds are being used to address these metrics.&#xD;
      These studies are important basic research, however, while Tensegrity has the unique&#xD;
      opportunity to study amputee gait and movement in the CGMA's state-of-the-art facility the&#xD;
      investigators will expand these studies with BRDG-SPAN funding by studying the following&#xD;
      metrics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Four Square Step Test (FSST)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Amputee Mobility Predictor (AMP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Timed Up and Go Test (TUG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quality of life (QOL) index (SF-36)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Activity-specific Balance Confidence Questionnaire (ABC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 3D motion analysis&#xD;

      The tests will be unblinded randomized studies of the subject's current prosthetic foot and&#xD;
      the K3 Promoter on traumatic/congenital amputees and dysvascular/diabetic amputees.&#xD;
      Assessments will be made after a 30-day accommodation period with each foot prosthesis. In&#xD;
      order to randomize the treatment and factor out habituation to the testing site and the&#xD;
      protocol, two cohorts will be used. Half of the volunteers will be randomly assigned to be&#xD;
      fitted with the K3 Promoter by their regular prosthetist or will continue wearing their&#xD;
      current foot prothesis. Both cohorts will have a 30-day accommodation period. Subjects in&#xD;
      either cohort will then visit the CGMA to be tested. Volunteers will then use the other&#xD;
      prosthesis for 30 days. After that second 30-day period, height and weight will again be&#xD;
      recorded, and the tests will be repeated. Because of anticipated difficulty with scheduling,&#xD;
      volunteers will be given a +3 day grace period on the 30 day-accommodation time.&#xD;

         11. Have a socket with a good, trouble-free fit on their residual limb&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Significant ulcers or infections associated with a compromised circulation of the&#xD;
             other lower limb&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Intermittent Claudication or Critical Leg Ischemia in the non-amputated leg&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. K0, K1or K4 Classification&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Irreducible, pronounced knee or hip flexion contractures&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Bilateral amputations&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Use of a walker for ambulation&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Severe arthritis that would limit the ability to stand without pain or discomfort or&#xD;
             the subject's ability to ambulate is limited by symptoms other than the prothesis&#xD;
             (e.g., shortness of breath, fatigue, angina, arthritis, etc.). If, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator, the subject were to improve their ability to ambulate from the K3&#xD;
             Promoter to the extent that his or her walking would then be limited by a symptom&#xD;
             other than the prothesis, the subject will not be enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any other clinically significant medical or psychiatric condition that in the opinion&#xD;
             of the Investigator could impact the subject's ability to successfully complete this&#xD;
             trial&#xD;
&#xD;

         10. Severe congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, or obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
