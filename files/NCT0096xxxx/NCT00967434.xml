  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery frequently experience perioperative cardiac&#xD;
      complications that may be due to excess inflammatory reactions. Lipid lowering drugs called&#xD;
      HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or statins, have anti-inflammatory effects. Although favourable&#xD;
      evidence suggests these drugs could also prevent perioperative cardiac complications,&#xD;
      definitive evidence of anti-inflammatory effects and benefit is lacking. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study to measure the impact of a atorvastatin on patients undergoing surgery. It will attempt&#xD;
      to determine the speed of drug effect as measured by the impact the drug has on the levels of&#xD;
      the inflammatory mediator called C-reactive protein after surgery. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      the perioperative use of atorvastatin will safely reduce the postoperative rise in CRP levels&#xD;
      at 48 hours after elective vascular surgery. This effect, would then translate into a&#xD;
      reduction of adverse perioperative complications including reduction in postoperative&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia episodes (as measured through Holter monitoring).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite modern improvements in operative care, non-cardiac surgery is still associated with&#xD;
      significant and costly cardiac complications. The incidence of major perioperative cardiac&#xD;
      events varies, ranging from 1% in unselected populations to 15% or more in vascular surgical&#xD;
      patients. An estimated 2 million North Americans yearly experience a perioperative cardiac&#xD;
      event with an associated mortality of 30-50% and financial burden of over 20 billion dollars.&#xD;
      Best evidence suggests that medical optimization is the preferred strategy to reduce the&#xD;
      risks. There exists favorable physiologic evidence and promising clinical observations that&#xD;
      statin drugs may prevent perioperative complications. We propose a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to evaluate short-term atorvastatin versus placebo on inflammatory changes and&#xD;
      myocardial ischemia in patients undergoing high-risk non-cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional belief on the etiology of perioperative myocardial events has been that&#xD;
      supply-demand discrepancies due to hypotension or hypoxia compromise cardiac oxygen delivery&#xD;
      thus resulting in myocardial ischemia and infarction are in dispute. Therapies that target&#xD;
      supply-demand imbalance, including perioperative beta-blockers, have been disappointing.&#xD;
      Emerging evidence now suggests that most perioperative cardiac events are similar to&#xD;
      non-operative events where rupture of coronary plaques and thrombosis are central to the&#xD;
      development of acute coronary events. Key elements to plaque rupture are inflammation and&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction. Elevated inflammatory markers, particularly C-reactive protein is&#xD;
      associated with adverse cardiac events. Drugs known as statins offer benefits beyond their&#xD;
      traditional improvement of lipid levels. Statins have so-called pleiotropic effects that&#xD;
      include anti-inflammatory, endothelial function changes and plaque stabilization.&#xD;
      Atorvastatin, a statin with a good safety profile, is particularly effective at improving&#xD;
      inflammatory levels and decreasing cardiac events including death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperatively, elevated C-reactive protein levels after surgery are associated with&#xD;
      perioperative complications including cardiac events. Thus, strategies to control&#xD;
      perioperative inflammation may reduce complications. Retrospective studies and small&#xD;
      prospective studies suggest that statins would reduce perioperative complications but&#xD;
      definitive evidence is lacking. Questions regarding dose and timing of dosing is unclear.&#xD;
      Likewise, little is proven on the potential pathophysiology of atorvastatin on reducing&#xD;
      perioperative myocardial events. Our hypothesis is that atorvastatin use will reduce the&#xD;
      postoperative rise in CRP levels at 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible non-cardiac surgical patients will be randomized into 3 groups with 3 stages of&#xD;
      treatment; namely stage 1 (preoperative period up to 7 days), stage 2 (immediate&#xD;
      preoperative), and stage 3 (first 7 postoperative days). Group A will receive atorvastatin in&#xD;
      all 3 stages. Group B receives placebo in stage 1 but atorvastatin stages 2 and 3. Group C&#xD;
      receives placebo in all 3 stages. Atorvastatin dose in all cases will be 80 mg. C-reactive&#xD;
      protein and lipid levels assess statin effects. Safety is assessed by liver enzymes and CK&#xD;
      levels. Myocardial events assessed by troponin T, ECG and Holter monitoring. Follow-up at 6&#xD;
      months will be done.&#xD;
