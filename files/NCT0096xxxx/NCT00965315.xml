  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic patients have an excess risk of mortality due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD)&#xD;
      compared to non-diabetics. Cardiovascular disease mortality rate is reportedly on the rise in&#xD;
      several countries in the region, including urban China, Malaysia, Korea and Taiwan.&#xD;
      Cardiovascular diseases and stroke are always the number 2 and 3 killers for Taiwanese&#xD;
      population in recent years, and they really cost much from our medical resource. For treating&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, one of the major risk factor for CVD, statins have been well documented to&#xD;
      reduce CV deaths both for primary and secondary prevention in several large-scale trials. It&#xD;
      has been reported that the clinical benefits of treating dyslipidemia in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus should be at least equivalent to the benefits observed among those with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. A meta-analysis of seven trials of statins found that treatment for&#xD;
      about 5 years resulted in a 25% reduction in the combined outcome of coronary heart disease&#xD;
      death and non-fatal myocardial infarction. Fibrates are another group of hypolipidemic drugs&#xD;
      that regulate lipid metabolism and are used quite often in daily practice for diabetic&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, because of its beneficial effect to reduce high TG and increase low HDL-C,&#xD;
      which are the characteristic lipid abnormalities commonly seen in the patients with diabetes&#xD;
      or metabolic syndrome. However, in recently published FIELD study, fenofibrate did not&#xD;
      significantly reduce the risk of the primary outcome of coronary events in 9,795 participants&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The higher rate of starting statin therapy in patients&#xD;
      allocated placebo might have masked a moderately larger treatment benefit. Furthermore, all&#xD;
      the treatment trials to back up the lipid treatment guideline were conducted in Caucasians&#xD;
      and no data about the combination therapy with fibrate and statin was published before.&#xD;

             fibrate,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  unexplained creatine phosphokinase concentrations six or more times the upper limit of&#xD;
             normal,&#xD;

          -  treatment with immuno suppressive or other lipid lowering drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients previously treated with monotherapy with statins or fibrates will be&#xD;
             qualified if they have not already had titration to a dose higher than the equivalent&#xD;
             of 5 mg/d of rosuvastatin or 80 mg/d of SFC fenofibrate.&#xD;
