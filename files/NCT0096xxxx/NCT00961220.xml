    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of carmustine when given&#xD;
      together with O6-benzylguanine and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage&#xD;
      IA-IIA cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carmustine, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing. O6-benzylguanine may help carmustine work better by making cancer cells&#xD;
      more sensitive to the drug. Giving O6-benzylguanine with carmustine may kill more cancer&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL) response rate and safety of O6BG&#xD;
      (O6-benzylguanine) /BCNU (carmustine) when given biweekly as two consecutive daily doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the laboratory correlates of clinical response and drug efficacy based upon&#xD;
      O6-alkylguanine deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) alkyltransferase (AGT) activity in CTCL lesions&#xD;
      will be examined to determine the effects of consecutive day O6BG administration on the&#xD;
      extent and duration of AGT depletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the laboratory correlates of clinical response and drug efficacy based upon&#xD;
      degree of induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest will be examined in the malignant&#xD;
      T-cell population of lymphomatous tissue and in the constitutive cells of the skin to&#xD;
      determine drug efficacy and toxicity through immunohistochemical techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the laboratory correlates of clinical response and drug efficacy based upon&#xD;
      O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene mutations and changes in AGT expression&#xD;
      will be examined as potential mechanisms for O6BG resistance in non-responding patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of carmustine followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive O6-benzylguanine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and apply topical carmustine&#xD;
      to the total skin surface (excluding the lips, eyelids, and ulcerated lesions) 1 hour after&#xD;
      completing O6-benzylguanine infusion on days 1-2. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to&#xD;
      12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Based on changes in modified SWAT assessment, patient responses will be classified as complete clinical response (CCR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD). SWAT provides an accurate and reproducible assessment of cutaneous disease involvement based on body surface area of involvement and lesional thickness.&#xD;
CCR: No evidence of disease, 100% improvement for a duration of at least 4 weeks. PR: Greater than or equal to 50% decrease in SWAT score compared to baseline and improvement is maintained for at least 4 weeks. SD: Less than 50% decrease in SWAT score compared to baseline. PD: Increase of greater or equal to 25% of the SWAT score compared to baseline while the patient is actively taking the study drug</description>

O6-benzylguanine: Given IV. 120 mg/m2 over 1 hour&#xD;
carmustine: Applied topically. BCNU will begin at a starting dose of 20 mg on Day 1. Beyond this first dose level, for each of the subsequent four patients enrolled, the BCNU dose will be escalated up to a limit of 40 mg total (given on day 1 only).&#xD;
