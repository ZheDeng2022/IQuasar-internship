  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the significant complications associated with some patients with diabetes is the&#xD;
      inability for wounds to heal regardless of enrolling and participating in a traditional wound&#xD;
      healing program. There have been a number of anecdotal evidence presented by patients&#xD;
      receiving pulsatile intravenous insulin therapy for other complications with non healing&#xD;
      wounds lasting from several months to several years whose wounds healed while receiving&#xD;
      therapy. This study was designed to specifically monitor the progress of diabetic patients&#xD;
      who have failed traditional wound care therapy and monitor the progress of their wounds while&#xD;
      receiving pulsatile intravenous insulin therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetes can produce complications including the inability for wounds to heal despite&#xD;
      participating in a traditional wound care therapy program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At times of reduced tissue oxygen, such as when circulation is decreased, there is anecdotal&#xD;
      evidence that pulsed IV insulin (by enabling the production of energy from glucose) may&#xD;
      permit heart, skeletal muscle, skin, and other organs to function more normally and even to&#xD;
      repair damage and heal. By tracking the progress in diabetic patients that have failed&#xD;
      traditional wound care therapy who are monitored by their podiatrist or other health care&#xD;
      professional to objectively determine the effect of pulsatile IV therapy on the rate of&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent evaluation of the wound is provided including visual examination, pictures and&#xD;
      measurements on a weekly to bi-weekly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals breathe into a mask for 3-5 minutes after a rest period of 30 or more minutes.&#xD;
      The ratio of exhaled volume of CO2 to the inhaled volume of O2 is determined as the RQ. The&#xD;
      physiologic range is 0.7 to1.3. Individuals using fat as a primary fuel have a ratio of 0.7,&#xD;
      protein or mixed fuels is 0.8-0.9 and carbohydrate is 0.9-1.0. Those taking excessive&#xD;
      calories will have RQ's higher than 1.05. The RQ can be followed serially and this is done&#xD;
      before and after each pulsatile IV insulin treatment, during the 3 successive sessions on a&#xD;
      single treatment day. The amount of intravenous insulin and oral glucose given is determined&#xD;
      by the RQ changes during the previous session. Pulsatile IV insulin therapy encourages the&#xD;
      glucose metabolism in diabetics to normalize in multiple organs, especially muscle, retina,&#xD;
      liver, kidney and nerve endings. The process fundamentally requires the administration of&#xD;
      high dose insulin pulses similar to those found in non diabetic humans by their pancreas into&#xD;
      the surrounding portal circulation. Oral carbohydrates are given simultaneously to augment&#xD;
      the process and prevent hypoglycemia. The process is monitored by frequent glucose levels and&#xD;
      respiratory quotients (RQ). RQ is measured by a metabolic cart which determines the ratio&#xD;
      VCO2/ VO2. This ratio is specific for the fuel used at any one time by the body. The glucose&#xD;
      levels are monitored to keep glucose levels appropriate and the RQ determines the need to&#xD;
      readjust the infusion protocol in each patient for subsequent insulin infusion&#xD;
      sessions.Patient is evaluated post session and discharged when stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequent monitoring of RQ is necessary as these levels change rapidly, depending on the fuel&#xD;
      being utilized by the body. Pulsatile IV insulin therapy shifts metabolism from primarily&#xD;
      fatty acid metabolism to primarily glucose metabolism. This shift is reflected by the&#xD;
      increase in respiratory quotient. However during rest periods the RQ may fall back to lower&#xD;
      levels. Therefore RQ's are done at the beginning and at the end of each insulin infusion&#xD;
      session of 1 hour in order to appropriately monitor and adjust insulin and carbohydrate loads&#xD;
      to reach optimal activation in each session&#xD;
