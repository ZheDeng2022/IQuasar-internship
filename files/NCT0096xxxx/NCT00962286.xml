      Background: Obesity is associated with a high prevalence of chronic kidney disease. The&#xD;
      glomerular hyperfiltration associated with obesity may play a role in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      obesity associated chronic kidney disease. Attenuation of hyperfiltration by pharmacological&#xD;
      means may slow down the development and progression of chronic renal failure. The&#xD;
      investigators have previously shown that acetazolamide, a proximally acting diuretic that&#xD;
      activates TGF by increasing solute delivery to the macula densa, abates glomerular&#xD;
      hyperfiltration. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that this decrease in&#xD;
      hyperfiltration is specific to acetazolamide and not due to a non specific diuretic effect.&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of the administration of furosemide&#xD;
      p.o. to subjects with severe obesity on glomerular hemodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Ten obese subjects will participate in the study. They will undergo measurement of&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (inulin clearance) (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF) (p-aminohippuric&#xD;
      acid clearance), filtration fraction, fractional excretion of lithium (FE LI) and blood&#xD;
      pressure, before and after administration of oral furosemide 20 to 40 mg bid for 3 days. The&#xD;
      effects of furosemide on glomerular hemodynamics in obese subjects will be compared to the&#xD;
      previously studied effects of acetazolamide.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Almost half of the causes of death in the industrial world are due to cardio-vascular&#xD;
      disease. Two of the main risk factors for CV disease have become much more prevalent during&#xD;
      the last decades, reaching epidemic dimensions in the 21st century: hypertension and obesity.&#xD;
      In 2003-2004, 66% of the adult US population had a BMI over 25, while 32% had a BMI over 30&#xD;
      .Hypertension is more prevalent in obese than in lean subjects .The cause and effect&#xD;
      relationship between these two conditions is supported by the fact that weight loss is&#xD;
      associated with a decrease in blood pressure .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salt retention by the kidney is one of the important mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of hypertension in obesity. Studies in animal models and in humans showed that increased salt&#xD;
      reabsorption occurs in the tubules in obesity . Another renal functional abnormality&#xD;
      occurring in obesity is glomerular hyperfiltration, characterized by increased RPF and&#xD;
      increased GFR up to twice the normal level . The structural basis to these functional&#xD;
      abnormalities is renal hypertrophy and glomerular enlargement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These functional and structural abnormalities have deleterious consequences:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increased urinary albumin excretion. Microalbuminuria, an important risk factor for CV&#xD;
           disease, has a high prevalence in obese subjects .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increased risk for the development of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, the so-called&#xD;
           obesity related glomerulopathy. The incidence of this disease has multiplied 10 times&#xD;
           within 15 yrs in the USA .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Increased rate of progression of chronic renal insufficiency in kidney disease not&#xD;
           primarily caused by obesity. Following initial glomerular damage from any cause, the&#xD;
           number of remnant functioning glomeruli decreases. The consequent compensatory increase&#xD;
           in single nephron filtration rate of these remnant glomeruli leads to further glomerular&#xD;
           damage in kidney disease not related to obesity . In the obese with chronic renal&#xD;
           damage, the obesity related hyperfiltration amplifies the compensatory augmentation in&#xD;
           single nephron GFR of remnant nephrons, thus worsening glomerular damage, irrespective&#xD;
           of the cause of the primary insult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical relevance of these abnormalities is reflected in the sharp increase in the risk&#xD;
      of developing end stage renal disease in the obese. This relative risk, independently of&#xD;
      confounders as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia, is 3 to 5 depending on the&#xD;
      severity of obesity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the role of hyperfiltration in the pathogenesis of CKD in the obese, attenuation&#xD;
      of hyperfiltration by pharmacological means may slow down the development and progression of&#xD;
      chronic renal failure. One of the tools available is activating TGF. Tubuloglomerular&#xD;
      feedback (TGF) refers to the alterations in GFR that can be induced by changes in tubular&#xD;
      flow rate. An increase in the delivery of chloride to the macula densa results in a reduction&#xD;
      in GFR, resulting in a decrease in the tubular flow rate delivered to the macula densa . An&#xD;
      increase in chloride delivery to the macula densa can be obtained by administrating&#xD;
      acetazolamide, a diuretic acting on the proximal tubule. We have previously shown that&#xD;
      administration of acetazolamide to obese subjects results in attenuation of glomerular&#xD;
      hyperfiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to show that the effect of acetazolamide on GFR is specific&#xD;
      and not due to its diuretic effect. We will study the effects of furosemide, a diuretic which&#xD;
      does not activate TGF ,on GFR and RPF in obese subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 obese men (BMI&gt;30), aged 18 to 55, with glomerular hyperfiltration (creatinine&#xD;
      clearance&gt;130 ml/min) will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known allergy to furosemide, inulin or amino-hippurate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacologic treatment for hypertension, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment with corticosteroids or NSAID&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 24-hour urine collection will be performed during the week prior to the renal function test&#xD;
      studies for assessment of sodium intake. Subjects will receive 300 mg of lithium carbonate at&#xD;
      22.00 the day before the renal function tests. They will be instructed to drink 250 ml of&#xD;
      water at bedtime. Renal function tests will start at 08.00 a.m. after a 10-hour fast,&#xD;
      excepting a drink of 250 ml of water at 07.00 a.m. Intravenous catheters will be placed in&#xD;
      each upper limb for infusion of clearance markers and blood sampling. After blood sampling&#xD;
      for urea, creatinine, proteins, glucose, electrolytes, blood gases, insulin, renin,&#xD;
      aldosterone, Hba1c, CBC. A priming dose of inulin (50 mg/kg) and p-aminohippuric acid (8&#xD;
      mg/kg) will be administered. Thereafter, inulin and p-aminohippuric acid will be infused&#xD;
      continuously. A 200-300 ml water load will be given during the first 60-min prime. Four&#xD;
      accurately timed urine collections of 40-60 minutes will then be obtained by spontaneous&#xD;
      voiding. Peripheral venous blood will be drawn to bracket each urine collection. Arterial&#xD;
      pressure will be measured by a trained observer, after 30 minutes of rest in the supine&#xD;
      position, using an electronic oscillometric blood pressure measuring device (Datascope,&#xD;
      Accutorr). The cuff will be appropriately sized to the diameter of the arm and the arm&#xD;
      positioned at the heart level. At least 4 measurements will be performed during the study,&#xD;
      each measurement being the mean of 3 readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be started on furosemide 20 mg every 12 hours, starting on day 1 at 15.00 after&#xD;
      the renal function studies. Nine doses will be taken, the last dose on day 4 at 7 am.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case the blood pressure does not decrease following 20 mg bid furosemide administration,&#xD;
      the study will be repeated after 4 weeks using a dose of 40 mg bid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory procedures: Plasma and urinary concentrations of inulin and p-aminohippuric acid&#xD;
      will be analyzed by colorimetric methods (22,23). Lithium in serum and urine will be measured&#xD;
      using the ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer) method. Urine&#xD;
      microalbumin will be determined by competitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (Imulite,&#xD;
      DPC, Los Angeles, CA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculations: GFR will be determined from the average value for the timed inulin clearances,&#xD;
      and renal plasma flow (RPF) - from the average value for the timed p-aminohippurate&#xD;
      clearances. The fractional excretion of lithium (FE Li) will be calculated as lithium&#xD;
      clearance / GFR, using two timed urine collections. FE Li will be determined as the average&#xD;
      value for these two measurements Statistical Analysis: The significance of differences&#xD;
      between groups will be evaluated by paired and unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test. The&#xD;
      Student's t-test will be applied to non-normally distributed data (albumin excretion rate and&#xD;
      fractional lithium excretion) after log transformation. P&lt;0.05 will be considered as&#xD;
      significant. The response to treatment with furosemide will be compared to the previously&#xD;
      studied response to treatment with acetazolamide.&#xD;
