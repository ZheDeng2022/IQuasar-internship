      The purpose of this study is to investigate palonosetron versus ondansetron as rescue&#xD;
      medication in subjects that develop postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in the&#xD;
      Postanaesthesia Care Unit (PACU).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a frequent complication of surgery, which can&#xD;
      lead to subject discomfort and dissatisfaction as well as considerable subsequent medical and&#xD;
      economic consequences. In this multi-center, open-label, parallel, randomized, pilot study,&#xD;
      outpatient surgical patients who experience post-operative nausea or vomiting in the PACU&#xD;
      will be stratified by gender and randomly assigned to either palonosetron HCl 0.075 mg IV or&#xD;
      ondansetron 4 mg IV in a minimization random allocation. Male or female outpatients,&#xD;
      scheduled for elective laparoscopic abdominal or gynecological surgery under general&#xD;
      endotracheal anesthesia will be enrolled. All subjects will be asked to attend 2 visits to&#xD;
      the study center:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening (Days -14 to -1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment (Day 1, the day of the surgical procedure and randomization) Subjects treated&#xD;
           will receive a follow-up telephone call by the Study Coordinator on Study Day 4 or 5 to&#xD;
           review the subject diary for completion, to review adverse events, and concomitant&#xD;
           medications, prior to the subject returning the completed diary to the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Screening visit, subjects who provide their informed consent will undergo a clinical&#xD;
      assessment. Demographic and baseline characteristics, including entrance criteria&#xD;
      determination, medical history, history of PONV and/or currently prone to motion sickness,&#xD;
      smoking status, prior and concomitant medication, physical examination, and vital signs will&#xD;
      be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of surgery, all subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
      prophylactically treated prior to anesthesia with ondansetron 4 mg IV, as preoperative&#xD;
      antiemetic treatment. As clinically indicated for rescue therapy, subjects experiencing a&#xD;
      nausea severity score ≥4 on the 11-point NRS, vomiting, or indicating a subject request will&#xD;
      receive blinded study medication as their first line rescue therapy for PONV while in the&#xD;
      PACU and no more than 6 hours after PACU admission. Subjects requiring rescue medication need&#xD;
      to be dosed within 10 minutes of identifying the need for rescue medication. In an effort to&#xD;
      ensure that this timeline is not exceeded, the sites will be allowed to randomize the subject&#xD;
      prior to surgery, on the day of surgery. Subjects who are randomized but do not require&#xD;
      rescue therapy and therefore not dosed with study drug, will be considered 'Subjects&#xD;
      randomized but not treated'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject diaries will be used to record the date and time of study drug administration, the&#xD;
      reason for administering rescue medication, baseline emetic symptoms immediately prior to&#xD;
      administration of rescue medication, the occurrence of emetic episodes, the severity and&#xD;
      duration of nausea, and subject functioning evaluations for nausea and emesis assessed&#xD;
      according to the modified Osoba questionnaire (Martin et. al. 2003). The baseline assessment&#xD;
      that is performed just prior to administering the rescue medication must indicate that at&#xD;
      least one of the following conditions was met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the subject had a nausea severity score ≥4 on the 11-point (0-10) NRS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. subject request: subject request must be approved by site staff and must be based on&#xD;
           either nausea or emesis symptoms&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Complete Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 72 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Complete control was defined as participants with no emetic episode, no rescue medication, and no more than 3 on the nausea numeric rating scale (NRS) severity score. The 11-point NRS scale (ranging from 0-10), where 0 means no nausea, 2 or 3 was mild nausea, around 5 was moderate nausea, 7 and higher was severe nausea and 10 means the worst possible nausea. Higher scores were considered as worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Complete Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 72 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Complete response was defined as participants with no emetic episode and no use of rescue medication. An emetic episodic is defined as any number of retches (unproductive emesis) in a single 5-minute period; 1 or a sequence of vomits in a close succession not relieved by a period of relaxation of at least 2 minutes; or retching of less than (&lt;) 5 minutes duration combined with a single vomit.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 72 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of nausea was assessed at specific time points using an 11-point NRS scale (ranging from 0-10) for evaluation of nausea severity. On the 0-10 rating scale, 0 means no nausea, 2 or 3 was mild nausea, around 5 was moderate nausea, 7 and higher was severe nausea and 10 means the worst possible nausea. Higher scores were considered as worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Osoba Nausea and Emesis Module Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>24, 48 and 72 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Osoba nausea and emesis module questionnaire was used to assess the impact of nausea and emesis on functional interference at 24, 48 and 72 hours postdose. The modified Osoba questionnaire included specific questions regarding the interference of nausea and emesis in daily activities (appetite, sleep, physical activities, social life, and enjoyment of life) with respective choices. The raw score of the modified Osoba questionnaire was the arithmetic mean of the non-missing item scores, using 1 for the answer &quot;not at all&quot;, 2 for the answer &quot;a little&quot;, 3 for the answer &quot;quite a bit&quot;, and 4 for the answer &quot;very much&quot;. Raw score range from 5-20 and the total score was computed by linearly transformed the raw score to final score range as 0 to 100 by calculating ([RS-1]/range)*100, with RS being the raw score and range being 3 in this case of answers scored from 1 to 4. Lower scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Modified Osoba Nausea and Emesis Module Questionnaire Score</title>
        <description>Modified Osoba nausea and emesis module questionnaire was used to assess the impact of nausea and emesis on functional interference at 24, 48 and 72 hours postdose. The modified Osoba questionnaire included specific questions regarding the interference of nausea and emesis in daily activities (appetite, sleep, physical activities, social life, and enjoyment of life) with respective choices. The raw score of the modified Osoba questionnaire was the arithmetic mean of the non-missing item scores, using 1 for the answer &quot;not at all&quot;, 2 for the answer &quot;a little&quot;, 3 for the answer &quot;quite a bit&quot;, and 4 for the answer &quot;very much&quot;. Raw score range from 5-20 and the total score was computed by linearly transformed the raw score to final score range as 0 to 100 by calculating ([RS-1]/range)*100, with RS being the raw score and range being 3 in this case of answers scored from 1 to 4. Lower scores indicate better quality of life.</description>
