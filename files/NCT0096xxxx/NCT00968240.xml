  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high-grade malignant brain tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic&#xD;
      astrocytoma (AA), comprise the majority of all primary brain tumors in adults. This group of&#xD;
      tumors also exhibits the most aggressive behavior, resulting in median overall survival&#xD;
      durations of only 9-12 months for GBM, and 3-4 years for AA. Initial therapy consists of&#xD;
      either surgical resection, external beam radiation or both. All patients experience a&#xD;
      recurrence after first-line therapy, so improvements in both first-line and salvage therapy&#xD;
      are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging survival. It is unknown if currently&#xD;
      used intravenous (IV) therapies even cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). Superselective&#xD;
      Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion (SIACI) is a technique that can effectively increase the&#xD;
      concentration of drug delivered to the brain while sparing the body of systemic side effects.&#xD;
      One currently used drug called, Bevacizumab (Avastin) has been shown to be active in human&#xD;
      brain tumors but its actual CNS penetration is unknown. This phase I clinical research trial&#xD;
      will test the hypothesis that Bevacizumab can be safely used by direct intracranial&#xD;
      superselective intraarterial infusion up to a dose of 10mg/kg to ultimately enhance survival&#xD;
      of patients with relapsed/refractory GBM/AA. By achieving the aims of this study we will&#xD;
      determine the toxicity profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD of SIACI Bevacizumab. We&#xD;
      expect that this project will provide important information regarding the utility of SIACI&#xD;
      Bevacizumab therapy for malignant glioma, and may alter the way these drugs are delivered to&#xD;
      our patients in the near future.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for recurring GBM is for patients to receive Bevacizumab&#xD;
      (Avastin) intravenously (IV) at 10mg/kg with CPT-11 (Irinotecan) every two weeks until their&#xD;
      tumor grows more than 25%. At that point, these patients are deemed treatment failures and&#xD;
      are given another treatment. Because of the blood brain barrier (BBB) where IV drugs do not&#xD;
      penetrate the blood vessel walls well to get into the brain, no one knows for sure if these&#xD;
      IV drugs actually get into the brain after infusion. Previous studies have shown that if you&#xD;
      want to increase your penetration of drug to the brain, that intra-carotid artery&#xD;
      (intraarterial) delivery is superior to standard intravenous delivery. Previous techniques&#xD;
      using intra arterial (intracarotid) infusion still were non-selective as drug delivery still&#xD;
      went to all blood vessels in the brain, so patients still had significant adverse events,&#xD;
      such as blindness. Newer techniques in interventional neuroradiology have allowed for a more&#xD;
      selective delivery of catheters higher up into the arterial tree where agents such as&#xD;
      chemotherapies, can be delivered without the risk of adverse affects such as blindness. In&#xD;
      fact, studies here at Cornell and MSKCC have developed very new and exciting super selective&#xD;
      intraarterial delivery treatment for Pediatric Eye Tumors with little toxicity. Therefore,&#xD;
      this trial will ask one simple question: Is it safe to delivery a patient's first dose of&#xD;
      Avastin intraarterially using these super selective delivery techniques instead of the&#xD;
      standard intravenous route of administration? This should not only increase the amount of&#xD;
      drug that gets to the tumor but also spare the patient any adverse effects from a less&#xD;
      selective delivery. During that single dose of intraarterial Avastin, the patient will also&#xD;
      receive a dose of mannitol that opens up the blood brain barrier to improve delivery of the&#xD;
      agent to the brain. After that single dose of Mannitol and Avastin intraarterially, the&#xD;
      patient will be evaluated for 4 weeks to assess for toxicity. If no toxicity, then the&#xD;
      patient will go on and get the standard chemotherapy (Avastin and CPT-11) every two weeks as&#xD;
      is routine unless they fail. After this you are done with the &quot;experimental&quot; aspects of the&#xD;
      protocol. This is a Phase I trial that is designed to test the safety of the single dose&#xD;
      intraarterial delivery of Avastin and Mannitol, prior to starting standard IV Avastin and&#xD;
      CPT-11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current Standard of Care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 0: Intravenous Avastin (10mg/kg) and CPT-11 Day 14, 28 (and every two weeks thereafter):&#xD;
      Intravenous Avastin and CPT-11&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental portion of this proposal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 0: Intraarterial Avastin single dose (starting at 2mg/kg and up to 10mg/kg) after&#xD;
      Mannitol to open the blood brain barrier Day 28 (and every two weeks thereafter): Intravenous&#xD;
      Avastin and CPT-11&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects will first be treated with Mannitol prior to chemotherapy infusion (Mannitol&#xD;
           25%; 3-10 mL/s for 30seconds) in order to disrupt the blood brain barrier. This&#xD;
           technique has been used in several thousand patients in previous studies for the IA&#xD;
           delivery of chemotherapy for malignant glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To add a single intraarterial delivery (SIACI) of the Avastin prior to beginning the&#xD;
           standard IV Avastin and CPT-11 therapy for patients with recurring or relapsing high&#xD;
           grade glioma. After a one cycle observation period assess for toxicity from the IA&#xD;
           infusion, the subject will receive Intravenous (IV) bevacizumab 10 mg/kg and irinotecan&#xD;
           (CPT-11) 125mg/m2 every 14 days as is standard therapy for relapsing recurring GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation algorithm is as follows: We will use a single intracranial superselective&#xD;
      intraarterial infusion of Avastin, starting at a dose of 2mg/kg in the first three patients.&#xD;
      Assuming no dose limiting toxicity during the first 28 days after IA infusion, the patient&#xD;
      will then begin their standard chemotherapy regimen which is Avastin and CPT-11 every two&#xD;
      weeks. The doses will be escalated to 4,6,8 and finally 10mg/kg in this Phase I trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Include: Males or females, ≥18 years of age, with documented histologic&#xD;
      diagnosis of relapsed or refractory glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma&#xD;
      (AA) or anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AOA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity will be determined and scored according to the&#xD;
      NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). Monitoring will be conducted by post procedure CT&#xD;
      scan (at 6-12 hours post procedure), serial history, neurological and physical examinations&#xD;
      together with serial blood counts, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT)&#xD;
      and chemistries. MRI will be performed every two cycles or approximately every two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response will be evaluated after two cycles of chemotherapy via a MRI with the injection of&#xD;
      contrast. Subjects who show an objective response (reduction in tumor size) or stable disease&#xD;
      after 2 cycles of treatment will be able to continue on study. Progressive disease will&#xD;
      require that subjects be taken off the research protocol. The following will be evaluated&#xD;
      every cycle, and then during follow-up: neurological examination, physical examination,&#xD;
      performance status, laboratory parameters and review of adverse reactions. Contrast enhanced&#xD;
      MRI (MRI with gadolinium is the preferable imaging study except in case where MRI is&#xD;
      contraindicated i.e., in those with pacemakers or metallic implants. In these subjects, CT&#xD;
      with contrast is acceptable) will be performed every two-treatment cycles under this research&#xD;
      protocol. The following subjects will be taken off protocol: those with progressive disease;&#xD;
      those who experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Follow-up will continue until disease&#xD;
      progression or death. Survival will be measured from the time of the first dose of IA&#xD;
      Avastin® (given at the start of each treatment cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will not be responsible for any additional costs associated with enrollment in&#xD;
      the trial. All costs of the IA delivery will be submitted to the patient's insurance&#xD;
      provider. WCMC will not be named as a sponsor of the study nor will it cover the cost of the&#xD;
      experimental procedure.&#xD;
