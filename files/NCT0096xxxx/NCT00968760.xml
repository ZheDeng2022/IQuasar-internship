  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sometimes researchers change the DNA (genetic material in cells) of donated T cells (white&#xD;
      blood cells that support the immune system) using a process called &quot;gene transfer.&quot; Gene&#xD;
      transfer involves drawing blood from the patient, and then separating out the T-cells using a&#xD;
      machine. Researchers then perform a gene transfer to change the T-cells' DNA, and then inject&#xD;
      the changed T-cells into the body of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if an investigational type of gene&#xD;
      transfer can be given reliably and safely in patients with advanced B-cell lymphoma. B cells&#xD;
      are a type of white blood cell that fights infection and disease. Lymphoma is a type of&#xD;
      cancer that affects the immune system, including B cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gene transfer involves drawing blood, separating out T cells (white blood cells that&#xD;
      fight infection and disease), changing the T cells' DNA (genetic material) in a specific way,&#xD;
      and returning the changed T cells back to the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn the highest dose of the changed T cells that can be given safely.&#xD;
      Researchers also want to learn how long the changed T cells remain in the participant's body,&#xD;
      and if the changed T cells can reliably treat B-cell lymphoma. Finally, researchers want to&#xD;
      learn if interleukin-2 (IL-2) can help the changed T cells last longer in the body.&#xD;

      Study Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has 3 steps: chemotherapy, a stem cell transplant, and gene transfer. If the&#xD;
      disease relapses (returns) during the study, you may receive the T-cell infusion without&#xD;
      having a stem cell transplant. Your study doctor will decide if you will receive the stem&#xD;
      cell transplant or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chemotherapy combination in this study (carmustine [BiCNU®], cytarabine [Cytosar-U®],&#xD;
      etoposide [Vepesid®], and melphalan [Alkeran®] is given to try to destroy any remaining tumor&#xD;
      cells and prepare the body for the stem cell transplant and/or T-cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you receive the T cells without transplant, you may receive additional chemotherapy before&#xD;
      the T cell infusion, if your doctor thinks it is needed. Your treating doctor will discuss&#xD;
      these chemotherapy drugs with you, and you may sign an additional consent for those&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs as standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stem cell transplant is designed to help the body attack the cancer cells that may remain&#xD;
      after chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gene transfer involves drawing blood, separating out T cells, changing the cells' DNA in&#xD;
      the laboratory, and returning the genetically changed cells back to the body. T cells are a&#xD;
      type of white blood cell that fight infection. The type of gene transfer being used in this&#xD;
      study is designed to help your T cells better fight B-cell lymphoma. These genetically&#xD;
      changed T cells are designed to fight B-cell lymphoma by targeting CD19 (a chemical &quot;marker&quot;&#xD;
      that is found on certain B-cell lymphoma cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL-2 (Proleukin®) is designed to help T cells grow. In this study, researchers want to learn&#xD;
      if it can help the genetically changed T cells grow and last longer in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of T cells, with or without IL-2, based on when you joined this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose of T cells. Each new group will&#xD;
      receive a higher dose of T cells than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects&#xD;
      were seen. Up to 4 dose combinations of T cells will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests Before Leukapheresis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each of the 2 leukapheresis procedures (described below), the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn and used for routine tests and to look for&#xD;
           diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To check your lung function, you will have breathing tests. A chest X-ray will be&#xD;
           performed to check for infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leukapheresis #1 or Standard Blood Draw (For Collecting T Cells) You will visit the Apheresis&#xD;
      Clinic at MD Anderson to have leukapheresis performed. Leukapheresis is a procedure for&#xD;
      removing blood from the body in order to collect specific blood cells. The remaining blood is&#xD;
      then returned to the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn through a needle in a vein in one arm, then passed through a machine, and&#xD;
      then the remaining blood will be returned back to you through a needle in a vein in your&#xD;
      other arm. The machine will remove a sample of your white blood cells. This process will take&#xD;
      about 3 hours to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood may also be collected through a standard blood draw. Blood (less than 7 tablespoons)&#xD;
      containing circulating T cells will be drawn over 1-2 days using one or more needle sticks in&#xD;
      your arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your white blood cell sample will be sent to a lab at MD Anderson so the genetically modified&#xD;
      T cell product can be made. The modified T cells will be grown in the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will take about 7 weeks to modify and grow the necessary number of genetically modified T&#xD;
      cells. If researchers are unable to create a high enough dose of T cells for you in the lab,&#xD;
      you will be taken off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placement of Central Venous Catheter:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the second leukapheresis, you will receive a central venous catheter. This is a&#xD;
      sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein in your upper chest, while you&#xD;
      are under local anesthesia. The study investigator will explain this procedure to you in more&#xD;
      detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When possible, all drugs that need to be given by vein will be given using the catheter. You&#xD;
      will also receive the T cell product through the catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leukapheresis #2 (For Collecting Stem Cells) only in patients receiving a stem cell&#xD;
      transplant:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About a month after your first leukapheresis, you will return to have the procedure repeated&#xD;
      a second time. This time, the blood cells collected will be a sample of blood-forming stem&#xD;
      cells. The stem cells will be given back to you after your chemotherapy. If a high enough&#xD;
      number of stem cells cannot be collected, however, you will be taken off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stem cell transplant is part of this study's treatment plan, but in some cases,&#xD;
      participants in this study will have their stem cells collected as part of another research&#xD;
      study or for routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy and Stem Cell Transplant:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your stem cells have been successfully collected, you will be admitted to the hospital&#xD;
      to receive chemotherapy. You will stay in the hospital for about 3-4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 1, you will receive carmustine by vein over 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every 12 hours on Days 2-5, you will receive cytarabine by vein over 1 hour and&#xD;
           etoposide by vein over 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 6, you will receive melphalan by vein over 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 7, the stem cells that were collected earlier will be given back to you&#xD;
           (&quot;transplanted&quot;) by vein over 30-45 minutes. Day 7 is also called Day 0, since it is the&#xD;
           day of the transplant. The days after the transplant are called Days +1, +2, and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the stem cell transplant, the study investigator will decide if you are still eligible&#xD;
      to receive the T cell infusion (and IL-2, if you are assigned to receive it). If you have any&#xD;
      infections or intolerable side effects, or if you are taking certain types of steroids by&#xD;
      mouth or injection, you will be taken off study. If you do not receive the T cell infusions,&#xD;
      you would not need to return for the follow-up described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have had prior involvement of disease in your brain/spine area, your physician may&#xD;
      give you a different chemotherapy regimen consisting of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 1, you will receive carmustine by vein over 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every 12 hours on Days 2-3, you will receive thiotepa by vein over 1 hour&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 7, the stem cells that were collected earlier will be given back to you&#xD;
           (&quot;transplanted&quot;) by vein over 30-45 minutes. Day 7 is also called Day 0, since it is the&#xD;
           day of the transplant. The days after the transplant are called Days +1, +2, and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T Cell Infusion (Gene Transfer):&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive the T cell infusion sometime between Day +2 through Day +7. (The exact day&#xD;
      will be as soon as you are eligible.) The T cell infusion will be given by vein over 15-30&#xD;
      minutes. The infusion may be divided into two parts at least 24 hours apart. The first part&#xD;
      of the infusion will be a much smaller part to ensure that you have no immediate side&#xD;
      effects. During the infusion, your vital signs will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatively, your doctor may decide that it is better for you to receive the infusion on&#xD;
      one day by vein over 15-30 minutes. During the infusion, your vital signs will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the T cell infusion, you will receive drugs to lower your risk of allergic reaction to&#xD;
      the T cells. Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) will be given by mouth, and diphenhydramine (Benadryl®)&#xD;
      will be given by vein over a few minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL-2 Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in Group 2 or 4, IL-2 will be injected under the skin, once a day for up to 14&#xD;
      days. The first dose will be on the day of your T cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each IL-2 injection, you will receive drugs to lower your risk of allergic reaction to&#xD;
      the IL-2. Acetaminophen will be given by mouth. Diphenhydramine will be given by mouth or by&#xD;
      vein over a few minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every day while you are in the hospital, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the T-cell infusion, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks after the T cell infusion, the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months (+/-5 days), blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn&#xD;
      for research to look for the modified T cells and to measure the number of B cells and other&#xD;
      (non-modified) T cells. Like T cells, B cells are part of your immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At about 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after the stem cell transplant, you will return for&#xD;
      follow-up visits. At each visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for research to look&#xD;
           for the modified T cells and to measure the number of B cells and other T cells. Part of&#xD;
           the blood sample at 12 months will be tested for HAMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other tests to check your health may also be performed if needed, such as CT scans,&#xD;
           PET/CT scans, and/or bone marrow aspirations and biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease comes back or a side effect occurs during the 12 months after the stem cell&#xD;
      transplant, you may be asked to return for additional follow-up visits as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have any infections or intolerable side effects, you will be taken off study early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you complete the study as planned, you will be off-study after your last follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Request for Autopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of death due to any cause, an autopsy will be requested from your family if it&#xD;
      is possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For safety reasons, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires patients receiving&#xD;
      gene transfer to have long-term follow-up for at least 15 years after receiving the gene&#xD;
      transfer. You will be asked to sign a separate consent form for long-term follow up. That&#xD;
      study is known as Protocol 2006-0676, and the follow-up will begin 1 year after the gene&#xD;
      transfer study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The chemotherapy and stem cell transplant in this study are&#xD;
      commercially available and FDA approved. The gene transfer is not commercially available or&#xD;
      FDA approved. At this time, gene transfer is only being used in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 60 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
