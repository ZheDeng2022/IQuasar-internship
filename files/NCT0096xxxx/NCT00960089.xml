  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a major clinical need for an inexpensive topically-applied product that can inhibit&#xD;
      the growth of the dermatophytes that cause nail fungus. Chesson Labs has developed LIQUICURE&#xD;
      with a longer drying/curing time that will allow better nail penetration or adsorption.&#xD;
      Though the product may have inherent antimicrobial activity, the product does not contain a&#xD;
      drug or antimicrobial agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consistent use of LIQUICURE as described will clear fungal nail infection. Clearing of nail&#xD;
      fungal infection is defined by negative dermatophyte culture and visual improvement in nail&#xD;
      characteristics within six months, with few, if any product-related adverse events.&#xD;
