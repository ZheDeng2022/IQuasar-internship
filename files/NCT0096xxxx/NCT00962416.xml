      Stent study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction with drug eluting stents (DES) is&#xD;
      effective but there remain concerns regarding the long-term safety and adverse effects on the&#xD;
      adjacent arterial wall. The biolimus-eluting Biomatrix stent addresses the issues by&#xD;
      incorporating modifications as a biodegradable polymer and a drug application solely to the&#xD;
      abluminal stent surface. While clinical data about the biolimus-eluting stent show a&#xD;
      favorable safety and efficacy profile, they require confirmation in a dedicated randomised&#xD;
      trial in the subset of patients with STEMI. Therefore, the study is designed to compare the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of biolimus-eluting Biomatrix stent as compared to a bare metal stent of&#xD;
      otherwise identical design in a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled superiority&#xD;
      trial in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stent and Plaque Imaging Substudy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a substudy of the above mentioned stent trial, the investigators will perform a&#xD;
      prospective, multicenter, longitudinal cohort study of 100 consecutive STEMI patients&#xD;
      undergoing urgent coronary angiography and will employ high-resolution Optical Coherence&#xD;
      Tomography (OCT) imaging technology and intra-vascular ultrasound and virtual histology&#xD;
      (IVUS-VH) of the culprit STEMI lesions pre- and postprocedural as well as at a 13 months&#xD;
      follow up. Assessment of vascular wall responses, including volumetric measurements of&#xD;
      vessel, stent, lumen, peri-stent plaque, and intimal hyperplasia, indices of remodeling,&#xD;
      stent expansion, and stent-vessel wall apposition in response to biolimus-eluting and&#xD;
      bare-metal stent implantation will be performed. Moreover, IVUS, IVUS-VH and OCT will be&#xD;
      performed in all three epicardial vessels in order to quantify and map the number, frequency&#xD;
      and distribution of ruptured plaques at baseline and follow-up and quantify the morphological&#xD;
      changes of ruptured and vulnerable plaques at baseline and follow-up and quantify the&#xD;
      morphological changes over time in response to standard medical treatment. Therefore, new&#xD;
      insight regarding the frequency, distribution, composition and evolution of coronary artery&#xD;
      plaques and their prognostic impact on patients clinical outcome can be expected from the&#xD;
      present study. Since patients suffer from a recurrent ischemic event rate of 5-10% during the&#xD;
      first year, these findings may have important therapeutic implications for the medical&#xD;
      treatment of affected patients to further reduce the risk of recurrence and improve&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stent Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A routine invasive strategy using percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been shown to&#xD;
      improve survival and freedom from recurrent myocardial infarction compared to a thrombolysis&#xD;
      in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In addition to standard&#xD;
      medical treatment, PCI with the use of coronary artery stents not only eliminate the&#xD;
      underlying stenotic lesion, but afford a mechanical mean of plaque stabilization, normalize&#xD;
      coronary blood flow, reduce shear stress, and local intracoronary thrombosis.&#xD;
      Notwithstanding, the implantation of coronary artery stents is associated with arterial&#xD;
      injury initiating a vasculo-proliferative cascade and as a result provoke structural changes&#xD;
      of the vessel wall. The implantation of bare-metal stents (BMS) during primary percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary interventions (P-PCI) in STEMI patients resulted in restenosis in up to 20% of&#xD;
      patients and has not been shown to reduce the rate of mortality and reinfarction. Randomised&#xD;
      trials and meta-analyses showed that the use of drug-eluting stents (DES) compared with BMS&#xD;
      in patients with STEMI significantly reduces the rate of target lesion revascularization&#xD;
      (TLR) without negative impact on the rate of death and myocardial infarction up to one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there remain important caveats surrounding the safety of DES in patients with STEMI&#xD;
      and evidence of harm may only arise during longer term follow up. DES implantation into&#xD;
      culprit lesions of patients with acute coronary syndromes has been identified as independent&#xD;
      predictor of late stent thrombosis. DES as opposed to BMS implanted into a pro-thrombotic,&#xD;
      inflammatory milieu of ruptured plaques in STEMI patients may lead to aneurysmal changes of&#xD;
      the adjacent vessel wall. First generation DES implanted into STEMI lesions were found to be&#xD;
      associated with substantial delay in healing compared to BMS. Moreover, DES implanted into&#xD;
      STEMI lesions have been associated with a higher frequency of incompletely apposed struts and&#xD;
      uncovered struts as assessed by OCT compared with DES implanted into stable lesions. These&#xD;
      data suggest a significantly increased risk of late thrombotic complications related to DES.&#xD;
      The phenomenon of aneurysmal change of the vessel wall may lead to incomplete stent&#xD;
      apposition, which in turn may predispose to late complications such as stent thrombosis,&#xD;
      recurrent myocardial infarction, and death. In conclusion, although coronary artery stents&#xD;
      constitute a routine medical intervention to improve the acute and long-term result in STEMI&#xD;
      patients, only very limited information exists as to the long-term clinical outcome and&#xD;
      structural changes of the adjacent vessel wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First generation DES with controlled release of sirolimus or paclitaxel from durable polymers&#xD;
      have reduced angiographic and clinical measures of restenosis in patients with STEMI. Limus&#xD;
      analogues are more effective as site-specific agents than paclitaxel to reduce neointimal&#xD;
      growth and repeat revascularisation procedures. However, late stent thrombosis is more&#xD;
      germane to first-generation drug-eluting stents than to bare-metal stents owing to delayed&#xD;
      healing and re-endothelialization. Furthermore, hypersensitivity reactions from the polymers&#xD;
      may further increase the risk of stent thrombosis. These effects may be particularly&#xD;
      pronounced in ruptured plaques of STEMI patients due to the direct contact with the necrotic&#xD;
      core.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biolimus-eluting stent to be studied in the present proposal has several features, which&#xD;
      attenuate the above mentioned adverse effects. First, the polymer-drug combination is applied&#xD;
      solely to the abluminal stent strut surface (rather than circumferential), thus maximizing&#xD;
      the exposure to the vessel wall while minimizing release into the circulation. Second, the&#xD;
      drug (biolimus A9) is released from a biodegradable polymer, which completely degrades into&#xD;
      carbondioxide and water during a 6-9 months period, rendering the stent more closely to a&#xD;
      BMS. Recently, the safety and efficacy of the biolimus-eluting stent using a biodegradable&#xD;
      polymer was demonstrated in a large trial of 1,707 patients undergoing PCI. While the overall&#xD;
      results showed non-inferiority for all safety and efficacy endpoints as compared with the&#xD;
      sirolimus-eluting stent, the biolimus-eluting stent showed improved outcome in terms of MACE,&#xD;
      stent thrombosis and TLR in the pre-specified subgroup of STEMI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While clinical data as described above show a favorable safety and efficacy profile, the&#xD;
      promising results ot the subgroup analysis require confirmation in a dedicated randomized&#xD;
      trial in the subset of patients with STEMI. The present study is therefore designed to&#xD;
      compare the safety and efficacy of the biolimus-eluting Biomatrix stent with a bare-metal&#xD;
      stent of otherwise identical design in a prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled&#xD;
      trial in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. To address the issue of late&#xD;
      acquired stent apposition and stent strut coverage, an imaging substudy using grayscale IVUS&#xD;
      and OCT will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging Substudy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Stent Imaging Substudy The implantation of drug eluting stents into a pro-thrombotic,&#xD;
      inflammatory milieu of ruptured plaque in STEMI patients may lead to aneurysmal changes of&#xD;
      the adjacent vessel wall possibly leading to incomplete stent apposition, which in turn may&#xD;
      constitute a risk factor for late complications with adverse outcome. Delayed and incomplete&#xD;
      stent strut coverage and endothelialization is another vessel wall reaction and possibly&#xD;
      related to adverse late outcome by increasing the risk of late stent thrombosis. OCT provides&#xD;
      a valuable modality for the assessment of stent strut coverage with 10x higher resolution&#xD;
      than IVUS. Recently, biolimus-eluting stents have been shown to result in more complete stent&#xD;
      strut coverage after 9 months as compared to sirolimus-eluting stents in the OCT substudy of&#xD;
      the LEADERS trial. To compare the biological behaviour of a newer generation DES with&#xD;
      biodegradable polymer as compared to a bare-metal stent, an imaging substudy using IVUS and&#xD;
      OCT for detailed analyses of the post-procedural and follow-up vessel wall behaviour will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B)Plaque Imaging Substudy Although the short-term outcome of patients with ACS and STEMI has&#xD;
      improved in recent years, clinical outcome at one year remains complicated by recurrent&#xD;
      myocardial infarction and death in 10-15% of patients. Previous studies using angioscopy&#xD;
      suggest delayed plaque healing, persistent thrombus, and recurrent plaque rupture as&#xD;
      principal mechanisms for lesion progression and its clinical complications. However, these&#xD;
      studies are limited by a small sample size, omission of follow-up imaging, lack of&#xD;
      correlation with easily accessible serum markers, and unavailability of high resolution&#xD;
      imaging technology such as OCT. Moreover, it is estimated that patients with ACS have more&#xD;
      than one ruptured plaque in &gt;40-80% of cases, which frequently are left untreated and&#xD;
      therefore may contribute to long-term adverse clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency, distribution, composition (TCFA versus non TCFA), and time-related changes of&#xD;
      plaques of the entire coronary tree in patients with STEMI have not been documented so far,&#xD;
      mainly due to technical limitations of the OCT imaging method. New-generation OCT systems&#xD;
      available for the present study will allow the systematic assessment of long coronary&#xD;
      segments. The combination of IVUS-VH and OCT will substantially improve the accuracy for&#xD;
      detection of plaques and especially of TCFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, new insights regarding the frequency, distribution, composition and evolution of&#xD;
      coronary artery plaques and their prognostic impact on patients clinical outcome can be&#xD;
      expected from the present study. Since patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial&#xD;
      infarction suffer from a recurrent ischemic event rate of 5-10% during the first year, these&#xD;
      findings may have important therapeutic implications for the medical treatment of affected&#xD;
      patients to further reduce the risk of recurrence and improve prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish superiority of the biolimus-eluting (Biomatrix) stent compared with an otherwise&#xD;
      identical bare-metal stent (Gazelle) in terms of the composite endpoint of death,&#xD;
      target-vessel related myocardial infarction at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging Substudy To compare neointimal thickness and strut coverage between both stent types&#xD;
      in lesions of STEMI patients at 13 months and assessment of frequency, distribution and time&#xD;
      related changes of culprit versus non culprit lesions of patients with acute ST-segment&#xD;
      elevation myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stent study&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, assessor-blind, trial to be conducted at&#xD;
      several swiss and european interventional cardiology sites. A total of 1100 patients will be&#xD;
      randomized on a 1:1 basis to either the biolimus-eluting stent with biodegradable polymer or&#xD;
      a bare-metal stent. The number of stents is not limited per patient, but it must be&#xD;
      consistently implanted according to the assigned treatment allocation. All patients will be&#xD;
      followed clinically for up to 5 years after stent implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging substudy&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 of 1100 randomized patients fulfilling the specific inclusion criteria (see above) will&#xD;
      undergo IVUS-VH and OCT of the culprit lesions prior to and after stent implantation as well&#xD;
      as during follow up. Moreover, IVUS-VH/OCT will be performed in all three major epicardial&#xD;
      vessels at baseline and follow up. The imaging study will be performed at the University&#xD;
      Hospital Bern, Geneva, Lausanne and Cardiocentro Lugano, all Switzerland.&#xD;
