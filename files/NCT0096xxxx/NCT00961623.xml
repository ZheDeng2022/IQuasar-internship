  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis and monitoring of clinically-significant pathologies of the knee remains&#xD;
      challenging, and it is unknown why only some injuries become painful or respond to surgical&#xD;
      intervention. The limitations of diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging result in arthroscopy&#xD;
      that is not always beneficial. Elucidation of biochemical pathways underlying pain in this&#xD;
      condition may aid patient selection for surgery and provide pharmacotherapeutic targets.&#xD;
      Cytokines or a novel yet uncharacterized protein may be involved in pain following meniscus&#xD;
      injury and diagnostic cytokine assay may help physicians differentiate patients that may&#xD;
      benefit from arthroscopy from those that may not. Additionally, evaluating post-operative&#xD;
      biochemical profiles may provide a method of monitoring surgical outcome and understanding&#xD;
      post-operative continuation or remission of pain.&#xD;

      Lavage of the operative and contralateral knee for comparison are performed under anesthesia&#xD;
      prior to arthroscopy by the infusion of 10cc sterile saline into the knee joint followed by&#xD;
      the immediate withdrawal into the syringe, and storage at -80°C in a tube containing a&#xD;
      protease inhibitor. At 12wk post-operative a 10cc lavage is performed on the knee that&#xD;
      underwent surgery. Clinical findings for each sample are quantified using gold-standard&#xD;
      symptom severity questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specimens will be analyzed for 31 potential biomarkers using a multiplexed immunoassay&#xD;
      panel, the results of which will be compared with pre- and post-operative clinical findings&#xD;
      and radiographic imaging. Plans do not currently include microarray analysis, but this may be&#xD;
      later included.&#xD;

        Our study population includes adult males and females presenting to a single orthopaedic&#xD;
        surgeon for arthroscopic management of acute or chronic knee pain due to a mechanical&#xD;
        derangement discernable by MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are selected using a probability sampling scheme, such that every knee arthroscopy&#xD;
        patient that presents, without exclusionary criteria described above, is offered enrollment&#xD;
        in the study. To date, approximately 85% of patients consent to enrollment, with no&#xD;
        apparent sampling bias. Additionally, we are using repeated measures (matched random&#xD;
        sampling) to evaluate the role of mediators of knee pain, and to assess the potential of&#xD;
        utilizing expression profiles to monitor surgical outcome. For example, clinical indicators&#xD;
        and biomarker expression profiles taken peri-operatively are compared to those obtained 12&#xD;
        weeks post-operatively in the same subject.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        •Adult patients with knee pain (acute or chronic) who had failed conservative treatment and&#xD;
        elected for arthroscopic management. Indications for surgery included the presence of&#xD;
        mechanical symptoms on history, a physical examination positive for McMurray's maneuver or&#xD;
        joint line tenderness or both, absence of severe joint space narrowing on plain&#xD;
        radiography, and the presence of grade III signal changes on MRI in an anatomic location&#xD;
        consistent with the history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Less than 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent (within three months) intra-articular corticosteroid injection and past or&#xD;
             current medical history of autoimmune disease (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In addition, no patients involved in a worker's compensation claim or personal injury&#xD;
             litigation were enrolled in the study.&#xD;
