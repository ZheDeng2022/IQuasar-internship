      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      rosuvastatin that can be given in combination with standard erlotinib treatment in patients&#xD;
      with advanced incurable squamous cell cancer and NSCLC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the mainstay of anti-cancer medical treatment for the vast&#xD;
      majority of patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous cell cancers. However,&#xD;
      curative success remains low and most patients eventually succumb to the disease or its&#xD;
      complications. Moreover, cytotoxic chemotherapy is frequently associated with severe unwanted&#xD;
      side effects. Therefore, in this patient population the unmet therapeutic need is high and&#xD;
      new treatment is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins are drugs which inhibit the cellular mevalonate pathway and are conventionally used&#xD;
      in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in cardiovascular disorders. Increasing evidence&#xD;
      suggests that statins might be used for cancer prevention/treatment through their&#xD;
      interactions with essential cellular functions, such as cell proliferation and&#xD;
      differentiation. Recent in vitro data indicate that statins induce growth arrest and&#xD;
      apoptosis, inhibit secretion of proteolytic enzymes, reduce invasiveness and inhibit&#xD;
      angiogenesis. These effects contribute to the reduction of tumor growth and metastases in&#xD;
      preclinical in vivo models of a variety of tumors suggesting that statins may be useful in&#xD;
      anticancer therapy. Studies previously performed by our group demonstrated that targeting the&#xD;
      mevalonate pathway can induce tumor specific cytotoxicity in a number of tumor types that&#xD;
      included squamous cell carcinomas, myeloid leukemia and a variety of pediatric cancers.&#xD;
      Additionally, several clinical trials have also assessed the antitumor activity of statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-clinically, we have demonstrated additive cytotoxic effects when combining lovastatin&#xD;
      with tyrosine kinase inhibitors of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) in HNSCC cells&#xD;
      (AG1478) and in 8 squamous cell carcinomas (gefitinib). Mechanistically, lovastatin treatment&#xD;
      inhibited EGF induced EGFR autophosphorylation by 24hrs and showed co-operative targeting of&#xD;
      the EGFR in combination with gefitinib. Taken together, these results demonstrate that&#xD;
      targeting the mevalonate pathway can inhibit EGFR function and suggest the potential utility&#xD;
      of combining these classes of drugs (i.e. an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and a statin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of lovastatin is not optimal due to greatly enhanced toxicity with drugs such as&#xD;
      gefitinib and erlotinib that are simultaneously metabolized by the same enzyme (cytP450A4).&#xD;
      In contrast, rosuvastatin a relatively novel potent mevalonate pathway inhibitor is not&#xD;
      metabolized significantly by cytP450A4. Due to the enhanced clinical activity of erlotinib in&#xD;
      comparison to other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the combination of erlotinib and&#xD;
      rosuvastatin appears ideal.&#xD;
