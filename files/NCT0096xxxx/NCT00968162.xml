  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most bone marrow transplants for children with sickle cell disease are performed using high&#xD;
      doses of two chemotherapy agents: busulfan and cyclophosphamide for the pre-transplant&#xD;
      conditioning. This approach produces cure in most cases (approximately 95%). It, however, has&#xD;
      serious side effects, including seizures and infertility. The primary goal of this study is&#xD;
      to determine how much we can lower the dosages of busulfan and cyclophosphamide by&#xD;
      incorporating fludarabine, a safer chemotherapy agent, into conditioning. The secondary goal&#xD;
      is to develop a better understanding of how bone marrow transplants cause neurologic problems&#xD;
      like seizures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many children with sickle cell disease are severely affected by acute complications,&#xD;
      especially stroke, recurrent and debilitating pain, or recurrent acute chest syndrome. As&#xD;
      they become adolescents and young adults, patients with sickle cell disease often develop&#xD;
      chronic problems, including renal disease, chronic lung disease and pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
      For children who have an HLA matched related donor, a hematopoietic stem cell transplant&#xD;
      (HSCT), using bone marrow or cord blood is an effective cure; using the standard approach,&#xD;
      which relies on high doses of busulfan (BU) and cyclophosphamide (CY) as well as&#xD;
      anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) for pre-transplant conditioning, the probability of event free&#xD;
      survival is now approximately 95%. The standard approach, however, is frequently complicated&#xD;
      by acute and often severe neurological events, such as seizure and encephalopathy, as well as&#xD;
      hypogonadism. Circumstantial evidence suggests that sickle cell patients are predisposed to&#xD;
      transplant related neurological toxicities by disease related cerebrovascular injury, and&#xD;
      that the transplant process aggravates this injury, causing cerebral ischemia and, in turn,&#xD;
      neurological toxicity. The high dose chemotherapy, which has been shown to induce endothelial&#xD;
      injury, appears to be an important contributing factor. The role of high dose chemotherapy in&#xD;
      transplant related neurotoxicity needs to be more firmly established. The role of high dose&#xD;
      alkylating agents in gonadal injury has been well established. Fludarabine, a&#xD;
      non-vasculopathic, non-gonadotoxic agent, amplifies the engraftment promoting effects of Cy;&#xD;
      in an effort to lessen the incidence of transplant related neurotoxicity and gonadotoxicity,&#xD;
      we will conduct a pilot study in which fludarabine is added to BuCyATG for conditioning, and&#xD;
      the dose of Bu and Cy are reduced using a stepwise de-escalation schema. This study will&#xD;
      serve as a forerunner to larger trial designed to test the safety and efficacy of a reduced&#xD;
      toxicity BuFluCyATG regimen. Central Hypothesis: A safer approach to hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HSCT) can be developed for children with sickle cell disease without&#xD;
      compromising efficacy. Specific Aims: 1) To begin to develop a reduced dose busulfan and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide based conditioning regimen for children with sickle cell disease that still&#xD;
      achieves sustained engraftment at least 90% of the time, by conducting a pilot trial, in&#xD;
      which the standard busulfan, cyclophosphamide and anti-thymocyte globulin conditioning&#xD;
      regimen is modified by adding fludarabine, a non-vasculopathic and non-gonadotoxic, yet&#xD;
      highly immunosuppressive agent, in order to determine the feasibility of reducing the total&#xD;
      dose of cyclophosphamide from its present standard of 200 mg/kg to 90 mg/kg and the busulfan&#xD;
      from its present standard of 12.8 mg/kg (IV) to 6.4 mg/kg, using a four step dose&#xD;
      de-escalation schema.. 2) a) To begin to assess the vascular, and more specifically, the&#xD;
      cerebrovascular effects of pre-transplant, high-dose busulfan and cyclophosphamide in&#xD;
      children with sickle cell disease by obtaining preliminary estimates of longitudinal changes&#xD;
      in the blood levels biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation (endothelin-1, von&#xD;
      Willebrand factor antigen, C-reactive protein, Il-8 thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes)&#xD;
      and in the changes in two MRI biomarkers-cortical thickness measurement and diffusion tensor&#xD;
      imaging.. b) To begin to assess the long-term effects of replacing sickle erythrocytes with&#xD;
      normal erythrocytes (by HSCT) on the vasculature and cerebrovasculature, using the same&#xD;
      tests. These estimates will help us to calculate a sample size and refine our testing for the&#xD;
      second study.&#xD;
