      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Estrogen can stimulate&#xD;
      the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using letrozole may fight breast cancer by&#xD;
      reducing the production of estrogen. It is not yet known whether giving more than one drug&#xD;
      (combination chemotherapy) or giving letrozole before surgery is more effective in treating&#xD;
      women with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving combination chemotherapy before&#xD;
      surgery to see how well it works compared with letrozole given before surgery in treating&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with breast cancer that can be removed by surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the efficacy and tolerability of cytotoxic chemotherapy versus aromatase&#xD;
           inhibition for the down-staging of strongly ER+ primary breast cancer in postmenopausal&#xD;
           women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify biological predictors of response to these two treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter pilot, feasibility study followed by a randomized study. In&#xD;
      the pilot study, a record of all patients screened and invited to participate in the study is&#xD;
      compiled. Reasons for failure to recruit will be recorded. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive fluorouracil IV, epirubicin IV, and cyclophosphamide IV on day&#xD;
           1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
           or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who do not achieve at least partial response after 3&#xD;
           courses receive docetaxel IV on day 1 of 3-week courses for an additional 3 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral letrozole daily for 18-23 weeks until day of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both arms undergo surgery at week 18-23. Most patients then receive adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, periodically during study treatment, and then during&#xD;
      follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood is collected pre-treatment, at mid-treatment, and before surgery. Blood is then&#xD;
      collected every 6 months for 2 years. Blood samples and preserved tumor samples are used for&#xD;
      correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of surgery, patients are followed up at least annually for 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients for the pilot study and 716 patients for the phase&#xD;
      III study will be accrued.&#xD;
