             dose finding study and the investigator or subinvestigator has confirmed the&#xD;
             tolerability and has judged as appropriate to participate continuously in further 28&#xD;
             weeks treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is withdrawn from the dose finding study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has less than 75% compliance with the investigational product in the dose finding&#xD;
             study at given the informed consent for the long-term extension study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a prostate cancer at giving informed consent for participating in the long-term&#xD;
             extension study; or is suspected to have a prostate cancer in palpation, ultrasound&#xD;
             imaging, biopsy, etc. at giving informed consent for participating in the long-term&#xD;
             extension study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has the post void residual volume &gt; 250 ml at starting the long-term extension study.&#xD;
             (as measured by suprapubic ultrasound).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has chronic bacterial prostatitis or chronic urinary tract infections during the dose&#xD;
             finding study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has acute urinary retention in the dose finding study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of drug or alcohol abuse during the dose finding&#xD;
             study&#xD;

             investigator/sub-investigator, is difficult to evaluate efficacy of GI198745 in this&#xD;
             study and that might poses additional risk to the patient.&#xD;
