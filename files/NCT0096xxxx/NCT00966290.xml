    <textblock>
      Background: Whether the management of vitamin K antagonists (VKA) therapy by general&#xD;
      practitioners with the collaboration of anticoagulation clinics (ACC) provides better&#xD;
      clinical outcomes than that accomplished by general practitioners alone (usual care [UC]&#xD;
      management) is not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To compare ACC-based shared-care management with UC management of VKA therapy&#xD;
      with respect to clinical events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients/Methods: Open, randomized, multicenter study in patients starting VKA therapy for at&#xD;
      least three months. The primary study outcome is a composite of confirmed symptomatic&#xD;
      thromboembolic or major bleeding events. All-cause mortality is a secondary outcome. All&#xD;
      outcomes are reviewed by a central, independent adjudication committee.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COMPARE (Comparison of Oral anticoagulation Monitoring Practice: A Randomized Evaluation)&#xD;
      study is an open, centrally randomized, multicenter, prospective, controlled study comparing&#xD;
      two models of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy management. Written informed consent is&#xD;
      obtained from each patient and general practitioner before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study concerned patients referred to the anticoagulation clinic (ACC) of various&#xD;
      University Hospitals in France. Eligible patients are consecutive patients who were starting&#xD;
      a course of VKA therapy scheduled to last for at least three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible patients are evaluated by a physician specialized in vascular medicine or&#xD;
      hematology. After their demographic characteristics and medical history had been recorded,&#xD;
      they are randomized to one of the models of VKA therapy management, either UC management or&#xD;
      ACC-based shared-care management. Randomization is stratified by center; the list of&#xD;
      randomization is computer-generated according to a permuted block design with a block size of&#xD;
      four, six or eight. General practitioners are informed of the outcome of randomization by a&#xD;
      standardized letter. In patients randomized to the UC management group, the monitoring of VKA&#xD;
      therapy is left to the general practitioner's discretion according to his/her preferences and&#xD;
      habits. Patients randomized to the ACC-based shared-care management group receive a&#xD;
      standardized educational package; moreover, each biological laboratory measuring INR values&#xD;
      for the patients of this group is contacted to explain the importance of rapid restitution of&#xD;
      the results. A computer-generated dose proposal is also given, both by telephone and by fax,&#xD;
      to the general practitioners who follow up patients randomized to the ACC-based shared-care&#xD;
      management group; however, they were free to accept or ignore this proposal. All patients&#xD;
      receive a logbook in which to record their INR results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study outcome is a composite of symptomatic and objectively confirmed&#xD;
      thromboembolic or major bleeding events at 18 months. Thromboembolic events are acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial occlusion, deep-vein thrombosis or&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism. Major bleeding events are fatal bleeding, or any bleeding leading to&#xD;
      functional impairment or requiring hospitalization. All-cause mortality is a secondary&#xD;
      outcome measure. All outcomes are reviewed by a central, independent adjudication committee,&#xD;
      the members of which were unaware of the patients' study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of anticoagulation control is evaluated in all randomized patients with at least&#xD;
      two INR measurements. This parameter is assessed by determining (1) the percentage of INR&#xD;
      within the target range, (2) the percentage of time during which the INR was within the&#xD;
      target range in relation to the total length of the observation period, according to the&#xD;
      linear interpolation method, and (3) the variability index (Ïƒ2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a superiority study in which we hypothesize that ACC-based shared-care management&#xD;
      would reduce the cumulative incidence of the primary study outcome by 50% compared with UC&#xD;
      management. On the basis of previous non-controlled studies, we assumed that the cumulative&#xD;
      incidence of the primary study outcome would be 10% in patients assigned to the UC management&#xD;
      group. Given these assumptions, we calculated that the recruitment of 600 patients per group&#xD;
      would allow confirmation of the statistical hypothesis with 90% power and a two-sided, type I&#xD;
      error of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analyses will be performed on all randomized patients on an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat basis.&#xD;
