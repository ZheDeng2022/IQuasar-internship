      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue, blood, and urine from patients with cancer in the&#xD;
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify&#xD;
      biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors find better ways to treat the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tissue, blood, and urine samples from patients&#xD;
      with advanced prostate cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study molecular pathology and mechanisms of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop novel treatment strategies for patients with advanced prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate novel markers and treatment and epidemiological approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Program I (Molecular Signaling in Advanced Prostate Cancer): Researchers from Newcastle,&#xD;
           York, and Bristol analyze androgen receptor (AR) (i.e., AR regulated genes and AR&#xD;
           co-activators and co-repressors) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling and&#xD;
           examine the cross-talk between these two systems and the insulin-like growth factor&#xD;
           (IGF) axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Program II (Mechanisms of Skeletal Metastases): Researchers from Newcastle, Sheffield,&#xD;
           Bristol, and Manchester analyze mechanisms of skeletal metastases and candidate factors&#xD;
           responsible for skeletal metastases (e.g., BMP-6, TGF-Î²1, IL-6, and IL-6 receptor). The&#xD;
           balance between proteases and their inhibitors is also analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Program III (Prostate Targeting, Models, and Novel Approaches to Therapy): Researchers&#xD;
           from Newcastle, Sheffield, York, and Manchester analyze and develop reagents and methods&#xD;
           that will facilitate novel gene-based approaches to therapy, including prostate tissue&#xD;
           specific gene expression, model systems of gene function and therapeutic studies,&#xD;
           translational gene-based therapies, and effectors for potential gene therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Program IV (Developmental Therapeutics): Researchers from Newcastle, York, and&#xD;
           Manchester analyze novel proteins identified during the study to synthesize novel&#xD;
           reagents aimed at disrupting pathways and signaling molecules that have been shown to be&#xD;
           of critical importance to prostate cancer (e.g., AR and FGF signaling).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Program V (Biorepository and Database): Tissue, DNA, blood, serum, and urine samples&#xD;
           from Newcastle, Sheffield, and Manchester biorepositories are stored and used for&#xD;
           analysis in programs I-IV. Support for tissue and data collection as well as database&#xD;
           management is provided to enable these resources to be made available to the wider&#xD;
           research community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Program VI (Clinical Trials and Health Services Research): Researchers from Newcastle,&#xD;
           Sheffield, Manchester, and Bristol participate in phase I trials using dendritic cells&#xD;
           and gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT) approaches to analyze environmental&#xD;
           interactions with the genotype and evaluate prevention strategies (e.g., diet) that may&#xD;
           underlie variations in the incidence of prostate cancer.&#xD;
