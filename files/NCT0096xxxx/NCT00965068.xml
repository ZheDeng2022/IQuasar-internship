      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are developmental disabilities characterized by impaired&#xD;
      social interaction and repetitive and/or stereotypical behaviors. Research studies suggest&#xD;
      that some individuals with ASD have very low blood cholesterol levels. This low cholesterol&#xD;
      level and other abnormal sterol levels may be important markers for&#xD;
&#xD;
      subtypes of ASD. Providing additional cholesterol to the diets of children with ASD may help&#xD;
      improve behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - These findings will guide the medical community in identifying individuals who should be&#xD;
      tested for sterol disorders. This study will also help researchers learn whether adding extra&#xD;
      cholesterol to the diet will improve behavioral and other autism spectrum characteristics&#xD;
      seen in individuals with ASD and low cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine cholesterol levels in children with autism spectrum disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare behavioral and other characteristics among children who have autism spectrum&#xD;
           disorders and high, low, or normal cholesterol levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether adding cholesterol to the diet will improve behavioral and other&#xD;
           characteristics in individuals with ASD and low cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children between the ages of 4 and 12 who have been diagnosed with an autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial screening study will involve a collection of blood samples (for study purposes&#xD;
           and cholesterol testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children who have low cholesterol levels will take part in a study in which they will&#xD;
           receive either cholesterol supplementation or a placebo, and will have detailed physical&#xD;
           and psychological examinations to measure possible improvement in behavioral or other&#xD;
           characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children who have high or normal cholesterol levels will have further blood samples&#xD;
           taken, and will undergo an additional set of examinations for comparison purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers may request blood or DNA samples from other family members (parents or&#xD;
           siblings), which will be collected through blood draws and cheek swabs.&#xD;

      Pilot work suggests that some individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have very low&#xD;
      blood cholesterol levels. This low cholesterol level and other abnormal sterol levels may be&#xD;
      important markers for subtypes of ASD. The proposed trial aims to characterize any clinical&#xD;
      differences between low-cholesterol ASD and normal-or-high-cholesterol ASD and to test the&#xD;
      response of individuals with ASD and low cholesterol to increased cholesterol in the diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence for the role of low cholesterol in causing ASD in a subgroup of individuals comes&#xD;
      from five sources. First, half of individuals with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) meet the&#xD;
      behavioral criteria for autistic disorder (Tierney et al, 2001), and three quarters have some&#xD;
      type of ASD (Sikora et al, 2006). Second, in individuals with SLOS, the lower the cholesterol&#xD;
      was in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, the more severe were the autism and IQ and adaptive&#xD;
      function deficits. Third, in SLOS, improvement was found in social and communication&#xD;
      abilities with added dietary cholesterol. Fourth, cholesterol was low in a pilot study of 100&#xD;
      children with autism of unknown cause (Tierney et al, 2006). Fifth, it is becoming&#xD;
      increasingly clear that cholesterol plays a pivotal role in several aspects of brain&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal is designed to 1) determine the prevalence of hypocholesterolemia in ASD&#xD;
      individuals (ASD+Hypo); 2) determine the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia (in ASD&#xD;
      individuals (ASD+Hyper); 3) determine the rate of SLOS in the ASD subjects; 4) determine the&#xD;
      phenotype (physical, behavioral, and developmental) at less than the 5th centile (ASD+Hypo)&#xD;
      and greater than the 95th centile (ASD+Hyper) individuals and normal cholesterol (ASD+Normal)&#xD;
      in the ASD subjects; 5) test the efficacy of dietary cholesterol supplementation in ASD&#xD;
      individuals with hypocholesterolemia; 6) determine whether a raised dose of cholesterol&#xD;
      supplementation is more effective than a lower dose; and 7) create a repository of&#xD;
      biomaterial samples from individuals with ASD and their biological family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three sites (Kennedy Krieger Institute [KKI], Ohio State University [OSU], and the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health [NIH]) will collaborate to accomplish the objectives of this study. In&#xD;
      addition to defining the frequency of altered cholesterol homeostasis in ASD, 60 youths (20&#xD;
      at each site) with ASD plus hypocholesterolemia will enter a 12-week, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial immediately followed by a 12-week open-label cholesterol trial to&#xD;
      test the efficacy of dietary cholesterol supplementation. Outcome measures will include&#xD;
      standard tests of behavior, communication, and other autism features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings will guide the medical community in identifying individuals who should be&#xD;
      tested for sterol disorders. This study will also help researchers learn whether adding extra&#xD;
      cholesterol to the diet will improve behavioral and other autism spectrum characteristics&#xD;
      seen in individuals with ASD and low cholesterol. The results of this study may help&#xD;
      individuals with hypocholesterolemic ASD by the knowledge of the therapeutic value and safety&#xD;
      of the use of cholesterol supplementation both biochemically and behaviorally. If improvement&#xD;
      is demonstrated, it opens a new window to understanding the neurologic mechanisms of ASD.&#xD;
      This knowledge may also be helpful for hypocholesterolemic individuals with ASD in that this&#xD;
      newly identified population will benefit from such supplementation. Even if cholesterol&#xD;
      supplementation is found to not be effective, important behavioral phenotype and&#xD;
      developmental information will be obtained that might be useful in identifying subjects with&#xD;
      ASD plus cholesterol abnormalities.&#xD;
