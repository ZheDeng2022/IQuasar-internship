      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety of the drug Etanercept (Enbrel)&#xD;
      and to determine if this drug can help in the treatment of early bone marrow failure in&#xD;
      patients with Fanconi anemia.&#xD;

      Patients with FA are treated with blood products (transfusions), injections to stimulate&#xD;
      white blood cell production, and/or androgen therapy once they reach advanced stages of bone&#xD;
      marrow failure. Although these therapies lead to temporary improvement in the blood counts,&#xD;
      they are associated with potential serious side effects. Currently, the only known potential&#xD;
      cure for bone marrow failure in Fanconi Anemia is a stem cell transplant, which is usually&#xD;
      done at the late stages of bone marrow failure and is again associated with significant&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies show that patients with FA are very sensitive to and produce unusually high levels of&#xD;
      a protein called tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) that causes bone marrow cells to die. We&#xD;
      will study whether a drug called Etanercept that reduces levels of TNF-α will delay or&#xD;
      prevent the progressive bone marrow failure associated with FA. Etanercept has been&#xD;
      successfully used in children with arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess toxicity of Etanercept (Enbrel) in children with Fanconi Anemia (FA) and early&#xD;
           marrow failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess efficacy of Etanercept (Enbrel) in improving hematopoiesis (i.e. peripheral&#xD;
           counts) in patients with FA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Correlation of biological studies to measure the impact of Etanercept (Enbrel) on Tumor&#xD;
      Necrosis Factor - α (TNF-α) production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive bone&#xD;
      marrow failure, variable congenital abnormalities and a predisposition to malignancy,&#xD;
      particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 1. Cells from FA patients exhibit hypersensitivity&#xD;
      to alkylating agents such as mitomycin C and diepoxybutane (DEB). Currently, FA is diagnosed&#xD;
      by testing for chromosome breakage after lymphocyte stimulation and exposure to mitomycin C&#xD;
      (MMC) or diepoxybutane (DEB) 2. Chromosome fragility, defined by an increased percentage of&#xD;
      chromosome breaks, is diagnostic for FA3. Although it is the most common form of&#xD;
      constitutional aplastic anemia it is very uncommon and the true incidence of FA is not known.&#xD;
      A total of 754 patients from North America with the DEB confirmed diagnoses of FA were&#xD;
      registered into the International Fanconi Anemia registry (IFAR) by 2001. The major cause of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality for children with FA is bone marrow failure that occurs in the&#xD;
      majority of children in the first and second decades of life. Attempts to culture bone marrow&#xD;
      progenitors in vitro from FA patients demonstrate decreased numbers of myeloid and erythroid&#xD;
      colonies, which is consistent with clinical bone marrow failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment for FA relies upon hematological support in the form of transfusions once&#xD;
      advanced marrow failure occurs. Patients with FA do not respond to anti-thymocyte globulin or&#xD;
      cyclosporine (typical treatments for acquired aplastic anemia), but 50% improve with androgen&#xD;
      preparations, with a median prolongation of life of 2 years in responders (from 16 years to&#xD;
      18 years of age at death) although relapses are inevitable. Androgen therapy causes&#xD;
      significant liver toxicity, virilization and risk of hepatic adenoma or carcinoma. Patients&#xD;
      who do not respond to these modalities are treated with stem cell transplantation, with its&#xD;
      associated toxicities from the transplant conditioning regimens, graft-versus-host disease&#xD;
      and increased risk of post transplant malignancy compared to patients without FA. Five-year&#xD;
      survival after a matched sibling transplant is approximately 65%. After an unrelated donor&#xD;
      transplant, five-year survival is about 30%. The natural history of this disease is one of&#xD;
      eventual death by age 10 to 20 years from progressive marrow failure or from conversion to&#xD;
      AML (in approximately 10% of patients). Thus there is clearly a need for an effective and&#xD;
      early therapy with better toxicity profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in both animals and human subjects indicate that high levels of systemic TNF-α and&#xD;
      increased sensitivity of hematopoietic progenitors to TNF-α plays a key role in pathogenesis&#xD;
      of bone marrow failure in patients with FA. This suggests a possible benefit in supporting&#xD;
      hematopoiesis with anti-TNF-α receptor Fc fusion protein (Etanercept; Enbrel) in children&#xD;
      with FA. This study proposes to treat patients with FA and early marrow failure with&#xD;
      Etanercept (Enbrel), a medication used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. The results of the&#xD;
      proposed project will use important preclinical data (see below) to support the development&#xD;
      of a novel therapeutic approach for treatment of marrow failure in FA. Etanercept (Enbrel)&#xD;
      will prevent the progressive marrow failure and associated complications without the need for&#xD;
      transplant and if found to be effective, this treatment can be included in standard clinical&#xD;
      care of FA patients, potentially for many years.&#xD;
