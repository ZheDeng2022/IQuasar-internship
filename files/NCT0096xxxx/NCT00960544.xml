  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out how gene expression (as well as how&#xD;
      often this expression occurs) in patients with breast cancer affects how XelodaÂ®&#xD;
      (capecitabine) is cleared (passed through the urine) from the body. The safety of&#xD;
      capecitabine will also be studied.&#xD;

      Capecitabine, PK Testing, and DNA Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capecitabine is designed to interfere with the growth of cancer cells, which may cause the&#xD;
      cells to die. It is cleared from the body by certain proteins (which are made from DNA--the&#xD;
      gene material of cells). Some patients have changes in these proteins that increase or&#xD;
      decrease the rate that capecitabine is cleared from the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will use pharmacokinetic (PK) testing and DNA analysis to learn how capecitabine&#xD;
      is cleared from your body. PK testing measures the amount of drug in the body at different&#xD;
      time points. Information learned in this study may help researchers decide the best doses of&#xD;
      capecitabine for future patients with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have about 2 teaspoons of blood drawn&#xD;
      for routine tests and to make sure that you are able to receive chemotherapy. This screening&#xD;
      blood test will help the study doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capecitabine Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be given capecitabine by&#xD;
      mouth on the day you choose to start this therapy. Your treating doctor will prescribe&#xD;
      capecitabine at a dose that is appropriate to treat the cancer. You can choose the start&#xD;
      date, excluding weekends, but will need to begin therapy in the morning of the day you&#xD;
      choose. You will have treatment with capecitabine even if you do not participate on this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK Testing and DNA Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have blood drawn (about 2 teaspoons each time) for PK testing and DNA analysis of&#xD;
      capecitabine at certain times throughout this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For PK testing, blood will be drawn before your first dose of capecitabine, at 30, 60,&#xD;
           and 90 minutes after the first dose, and then at 2, 6, 8, and 10 hours after the first&#xD;
           dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For DNA analysis, blood will only be drawn before you receive the first dose of&#xD;
           capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your dose changes, these PK blood tests may need to be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will remain on this study for up to 6 months, unless the disease gets worse, you&#xD;
      experience any intolerable side effects, or you decide to stop treatment with capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 100 patients will take part in this study. All will&#xD;
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
