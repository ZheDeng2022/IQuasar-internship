  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will describe the perceptions of support and distress outcomes of single/lone&#xD;
      parents of a child with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents and families of children with chronic illnesses have stressors, including&#xD;
           financial stress, role strains, separations, and interruptions in daily routines and&#xD;
           plans for the future. All of these experiences may lead directly and indirectly to&#xD;
           parental stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of families headed by single or lone parents is increasing. Little work has&#xD;
           been done to better understand if the needs of parents who are providing care for a&#xD;
           child on their own differ from parents who do not classify themselves as lone.&#xD;
           Identifying parents who may need additional support within a pediatric oncology setting&#xD;
           is very important so that appropriate support is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To better understand the social, emotional, and practical effects of lone parents on&#xD;
      children with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All parents whose child has been diagnosed with cancer between 6 and 18 months before&#xD;
           enrolling on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be able to speak and read English&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents will be asked to complete a questionnaire during one of their child s clinic or&#xD;
           hospital visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The questionnaire will ask about the parenting experience since the child was diagnosed&#xD;
           with cancer. It will ask about the support the parent has received from family and&#xD;
           friends since the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The questionnaire will take approximately 20 minutes to complete.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research examining the potential impact of childhood chronic illness on parents and&#xD;
           families has delineated a myriad of stressors that parents may experience, including&#xD;
           financial stress, role strains, separations, interruptions in daily routines and plans&#xD;
           for the future, and general uncertainty regarding the child s prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All of these possible experiences may lead directly and indirectly to anxiety,&#xD;
           depression, posttraumatic-stress, hopelessness, and feelings of loss of control in&#xD;
           parents and families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of families headed by single, or lone parents has increased significantly,&#xD;
           with 3 in 10 children now living in single parent homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is not known whether distress is greater for parents who are lone parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lone-parent families earn on average only 55% of what married-parent families earn, and&#xD;
           are four times more likely to live in poverty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is unclear how lone parents trying to navigate the complex needs of maintaining a&#xD;
           home, family, and a chronically ill child adapt to these challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is also unclear how many parents who check single on a standardized forced choice&#xD;
           questionnaire format consider themselves to be lone when it comes to the experience of&#xD;
           caring for their child with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1: To define and characterize lone parents&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2: To describe perceptions of social support and how they relate to lone and&#xD;
           non-lone parenting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3: To identify distress outcomes in parents of children with cancer who identify&#xD;
           themselves as being lone when it comes to the experience of caring for a child with&#xD;
           cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      English and Spanish speaking parents of a child (1through 17 years) with a malignancy,&#xD;
      diagnosed 6-18 months before recruitment will be invited to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -This is a pilot, exploratory study designed to describe the perceptions of support and&#xD;
      distress outcomes of single/lone parents of a child with cancer. Participants will be&#xD;
      administered a Lone Parent Support Questionnaire designed for this study. The study will be&#xD;
      completed in one visit (&lt;30mins).&#xD;
