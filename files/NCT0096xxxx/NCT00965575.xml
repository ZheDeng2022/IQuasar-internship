  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of epilepsy is 1% in the USA. About 30% of epilepsy patients eventually become&#xD;
      refractory to medical treatment. Co morbid conditions are becoming as important as seizure&#xD;
      control as these affect overall wellbeing. Sleep related complaints are frequent in them&#xD;
      including, frequent arousals, difficulty falling asleep and excessive daytime sleepiness.&#xD;
      Polysomnography shows increased arousal index, sleep onset latency, and stage shifts and&#xD;
      fragmented REM sleep. Poor sleep efficiency causes daytime fatigue, poor cognition and&#xD;
      behavior and can worsen seizure control. Stabilizing sleep may improve seizure control.&#xD;
      Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone in the body involved in the regulation of&#xD;
      circadian rhythm and exogenously given, has been shown to decrease sleep onset latency,&#xD;
      arousals, and there-by increase sleep efficiency in healthy pediatric patients. Similar data&#xD;
      does not exist in the patients with epilepsy. As sleep has important impact on epilepsy and&#xD;
      overall functioning, it is important to study effect of melatonin in children with epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial with a cross-over design. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that, for patients with epilepsy, administration of melatonin 30 minutes before&#xD;
      bedtime for four weeks may:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve the quality of sleep;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve daytime functioning in terms of cognition, behavior and quality of life;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease epileptic potential. We will use polysomnography, electroencephalogram,&#xD;
           psychomotor vigilance task, seizure diary, and questionnaires to assess the effect of&#xD;
           melatonin on these domains. This study may help to improve the care of children with&#xD;
           epilepsy.&#xD;

      Hypothesis 1: Melatonin treatment improves the quality of sleep in patients with epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various studies evaluating sleep problems in patients with epilepsy using questionnaires have&#xD;
      shown that 34-45% patients have sleep related problems [1-3]. Cortesi et al reported that&#xD;
      children with seizures had higher sleep difficulties than their siblings and controls[4].&#xD;
      Bedtime difficulties, sleep fragmentation, daytime sleepiness, snoring and parasomnia were&#xD;
      reported as sleep problems in this population [2, 4]. Patients with refractory seizures and&#xD;
      using multiple antiepileptic drugs(AED) showed worse problems[5]. On polysomnography (PSG)&#xD;
      these patients show increased arousal index, increased sleep onset latency, fragmented or&#xD;
      reduced REM sleep, increased stage shifts and increased Stage 1 sleep and decreased stage 2&#xD;
      and slow wave sleep. [6-9] Melatonin has been shown to decrease sleep onset latency and&#xD;
      increase total sleep time and subjectively improve sleep in healthy individuals.[10-15].&#xD;
      Various studies using fast release and sustained release formulations have suggested&#xD;
      improvement in sleep efficiency and decreased arousals as well.[16-18] In a randomized&#xD;
      placebo controlled study by Gupta et al[19], Melatonin was shown to subjectively improve&#xD;
      sleep in patients with epilepsy. Studies in children with neurodevelopmental delay and autism&#xD;
      along with epilepsy have also reported similar findings.[17, 20-23] Rationale: There are&#xD;
      significant sleep disturbances in children with epilepsy. Melatonin has been shown to improve&#xD;
      sleep in this group of patients. However, all these studies report improvement based on&#xD;
      parent report and only one study is placebo-controlled. Our study will assess this in&#xD;
      randomized placebo controlled fashion and will provide both subjective and objective&#xD;
      improvement in sleep with the primary outcome being improved sleep efficiency on PSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Melatonin improves daytime functioning in terms of cognition, behavior and&#xD;
      quality of life in the patients with epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poor sleep and epilepsy both have detrimental effect on cognition.[24-27] Melatonin by&#xD;
      improving sleep may improve cognitive functioning in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients with epilepsy have poor behavior and psychiatric function.[28-30] Severity of&#xD;
      these problems are related to the worsening of the sleep problems.[2, 4] Melatonin by&#xD;
      improving sleep may improve the behavior in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epilepsy has negative effect on various aspects of the patients' life including social,&#xD;
      behavioral, and academic [31, 32]. Questionnaires have been developed to assess the impact on&#xD;
      overall quality of life of the patients [33, 34]. These tools are helpful to quickly and&#xD;
      subjectively assess quality of life. Based on these studies, it has been shown that patients&#xD;
      with refractory seizures have poor quality of life [33-37] and an improvement is seen if the&#xD;
      seizure frequency is decreased.[38-41] There has been only one study reporting quality of&#xD;
      life (QOL) after use of melatonin in patients with epilepsy. In this randomized placebo&#xD;
      controlled study, significant improvement was seen in the cognitive, anxiety and behavior&#xD;
      subscales of the QOLCE after use of melatonin.[42] To date, there are no studies reporting on&#xD;
      the effect of melatonin on cognition or behavior in epilepsy patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Poor behavior, cognition and quality of life have been reported in children with&#xD;
      epilepsy and sleep disturbances. By improving the quality of sleep, melatonin will improve&#xD;
      all these domains. QOLCE has been validated and used in epilepsy patients and will assess the&#xD;
      QOL in these patients. Vigilance is the component of cognition that is most consistently and&#xD;
      drastically affected by sleep deprivation. PVT measures &quot;vigilant attention&quot; and has been&#xD;
      used widely in adult patients to assess the effect of sleep deprivation on cognition. It has&#xD;
      been described as a very sensitive measure to see both acute and chronic effects of sleep&#xD;
      deprivation. BASC-PRS has been used to assess behavior in children and is found equally&#xD;
      useful in epilepsy patients as child behavior check list (CBCL). It is a sensitive tool to&#xD;
      compare changes over shorter time span.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Melatonin treatment decreases epileptic potential. Sleep deprivation has been&#xD;
      known to induce seizures and epileptic discharges on EEG[43]. Seizures are also known to&#xD;
      occur with change in the depth or rhythmicity of sleep.[43] Patients with epilepsy report&#xD;
      sleep deprivation as a significant seizure precipitating factor [44, 45]. In a recent study,&#xD;
      Haut et al reported that one hour of additional sleep on the preceding night decreased&#xD;
      relative odds of a seizure on the subsequent day to 0.91[46]. In a study Oliveira reported&#xD;
      that treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) decreased interictal epileptiform&#xD;
      discharges.[47] The belief that fewer epileptiform discharges represent better seizure&#xD;
      control is controversial. But a study suggested that decreasing epileptiform discharges on&#xD;
      EEG improves behavior.[48] Studies investigating obstructive sleep apnea in patients with&#xD;
      epilepsy have reported improvement in seizure control with treatment of OSA [49-54]. These&#xD;
      suggest that stabilizing sleep has a beneficial effect on seizure control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies that evaluated melatonin in epilepsy patients report overall improvement in&#xD;
      seizure control[17, 21], while others report no worsening of seizure control after the use of&#xD;
      melatonin[20, 22, 23]. Coppola et al reported inconclusive results with regards to seizure&#xD;
      control after melatonin use[55]. However, these studies are not powered to account for&#xD;
      variability in seizure occurrence reported with epilepsy patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: There are no randomized controlled studies available to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      melatonin on seizure control in the children with epilepsy. This study will identify the&#xD;
      effect of short term use of melatonin compared with placebo and will provide pilot data to&#xD;
      evaluate this effect in a larger trial in future.&#xD;
