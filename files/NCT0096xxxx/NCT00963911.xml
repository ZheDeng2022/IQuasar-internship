      RATIONALE: A screening questionnaire may help doctors plan better treatment for older&#xD;
      patients with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying a questionnaire in screening older patients with&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validate a new screening tool (G8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validate the French version of the screening tool &quot;Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13)&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the merits of the screening tools (G8 and VES-13).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the screening tool in specific populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the number and type of interventions proposed after thorough geriatric&#xD;
           assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the two new tools (G8 vs VES-13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first consultation, patients have an initial clinical evaluation questionnaire&#xD;
      comprising the G8. They also complete the self-questionnaire VES-13. Within 30 days, patients&#xD;
      have a thorough geriatric assessment, including quality of life and physical function, by a&#xD;
      physician without access to the G8 or VES-13 questionnaires. A blood specimen is also&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on health status and quality of life is collected from medical records or from&#xD;
      the doctor after 1 and 5 years.&#xD;

    <time_frame>at inclusion (at completion of the G8 questionnaire)</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity of the G8 questionnaire measured as Percentage of Participants with a Positive G8 among patients with a positive MGA. The G8 consists of eight items: patient age (&gt;85, 80-85, &lt;80), and seven items from the original 18-item MNA (Mini Nutritional Assessment: appetite changes, weight loss, mobility, neuropsychological problems, body mass index, medication, and self-rated health). The total score ranges from 0 to 17, with lower scores indicating a higher risk of impairments. The cut-off value for an 'impaired' reference test score was &lt;=14.&#xD;
Multidimensional geriatric assessment (MGA): Patients underwent a geriatric evaluation in the month following the completion of VES-13. The nurse completed six instruments of the MGA (MNA, Timed Get up and Go, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Instrumental ADL, Mini Mental State Examination, and Geriatric Depression Scale, and the geriatrician rated comorbidity on the Cumulative Illnes Rating Scale.</description>

    <time_frame>at inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity of the VES-13 questionnaire measured as percentage of participants with a positive VES-13 test among patients with a positive MGA. VES-13 is a self-administered questionnaire that was completed during the first visit after enrollment. For 3 pre-identified centers, patients filled in the questionnaire at the following geriatric visit. VES-13 consisted of 4 groups of questions: age, self-perceived health, difficulties to perform 6 specific activities, and difficulties to perform daily living tasks due to health concerns. The score ranged from 0 to 10 and a score &gt;=3 was considered to show impairment.&#xD;

    <measure>Reproducibility of the G8 Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>at inclusion (at completion of the G8 questionnaire)</time_frame>
    <description>Reproducibility of G8 was assessed by comparing the score on the actual G8 with the scores extracted from the corresponding seven questions of MNA completed during the MGA for all patients. The G8 consists of eight items: patient age (&gt;85, 80-85, &lt;80), and seven items from the original 18-item MNA (Mini Nutritional Assessment: appetite changes, weight loss, mobility, neuropsychological problems, body mass index, medication, and self-rated health). The total score ranges from 0 to 17, with lower scores indicating a higher risk of impairments. The cut-off value for an 'impaired' reference test score was &lt;=14.</description>

    <description>Reproducibility of VES-13 was assessed based on a subgroup of patients included in three pre-identified centers who completed the questionnaire on two occasions. VES-13 is a self-administered questionnaire that was completed during the first visit after enrollment. For 3 pre-identified centers, patients filled in the questionnaire at the following geriatric visit.

    <description>Patients underwent a geriatric evaluation in the month following the completion of G8 and VES-13 (+/- seven days) before treatment began. The nurse completed six of the seven instruments of the MGA (MNA, Timed Get up and Go (TUG), Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Instrumental ADL (IADL), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15)), and the geriatrician rated comorbidity on the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS-G), recorded the time required for the consultation, identified patients who needed personalized geriatric interventions, and, if necessary, proposed further geriatric evaluation (outside of the scope of this study).</description>

        <description>Sensitivity of the G8 questionnaire measured as Percentage of Participants with a Positive G8 among patients with a positive MGA. The G8 consists of eight items: patient age (&gt;85, 80-85, &lt;80), and seven items from the original 18-item MNA (Mini Nutritional Assessment: appetite changes, weight loss, mobility, neuropsychological problems, body mass index, medication, and self-rated health). The total score ranges from 0 to 17, with lower scores indicating a higher risk of impairments. The cut-off value for an 'impaired' reference test score was &lt;=14.&#xD;
Multidimensional geriatric assessment (MGA): Patients underwent a geriatric evaluation in the month following the completion of VES-13. The nurse completed six instruments of the MGA (MNA, Timed Get up and Go, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Instrumental ADL, Mini Mental State Examination, and Geriatric Depression Scale, and the geriatrician rated comorbidity on the Cumulative Illnes Rating Scale.</description>

The G-8 consists of eight items: patient age (&gt;85, 80-85, &lt;80), and seven items from the original 18-item MNA (Mini Nutritional Assessment: appetite changes, weight loss, mobility, neuropsychological problems, body mass index, medication, and selfrated health). The total score ranges from 0 to 17, with lower scores indicating a higher risk of impairments. The cut-off value for an 'impaired' reference test score was &lt;=14.&#xD;
VES-13 is a self-administered questionnaire that was completed during the first visit after enrollment. For three pre-identified centers, patients also filled in the questionnaire at the following geriatric visit. VES-13 consisted of four groups of questions: age, self-perceived health, difficulties to perform six specific activities, and difficulties to perform daily living tasks due to health concerns. The score ranged from 0 to 10 and a score &gt;=3 was considered to show impairment.&#xD;
Multidimensional geriatric assessment: Patients underwent a geriatric evaluation in the month following the completion of G8 and VES-13 (+/- seven days) before treatment began. The nurse completed six of the seven instruments of the MGA (MNA, Timed Get up and Go (TUG), Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Instrumental ADL (IADL), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15)), and the geriatrician rated comorbidity on the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS-G).</description>
