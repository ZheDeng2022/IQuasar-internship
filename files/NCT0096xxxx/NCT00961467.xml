  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After the discovery of melphalan and prednisone (MP), many clinical trials evaluated the&#xD;
      efficacy of combination chemotherapy, such as VMCP, VBAP, MOCCA in multiple myeloma (MM)&#xD;
      patients, without significant clinical benefit. After 40 years, the combination of MP with&#xD;
      thalidomide (MPT) or lenalidomide (MPR) or bortezomib (MPV) have finally and consistently&#xD;
      shown additive or synergistic effects.In advanced MM, the combination of melphalan,&#xD;
      prednisone and thalidomide induced 12% very good partial response (VGPR) rate, while the&#xD;
      combination of melphalan and bortezomib showed 15% near complete remission (nCR) rate. In&#xD;
      relapsed patients, the combination of bortezomib with MPT (VMPT) induced 43% VGPR rate.&#xD;
      Preliminary results indicate that VMPT may induce a CR rate of around 50% in newly diagnosed&#xD;
      patients (unpublished results).In preclinical studies thalidomide showed more&#xD;
      anti-angiogenesis activity, while lenalidomide showed more immunomodulatory effects, thus&#xD;
      suggesting a combined clinical approach for these two drugs. The toxicity profile of&#xD;
      lenalidomide is completely different from that of thalidomide and no cumulative toxicities&#xD;
      are expected, again suggesting a combination approach. This study will evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of combining Lenalidomide, Melphalan, Prednisone and Thalidomide (R-MPT) as&#xD;
      salvage treatment for relapsed/refractory myeloma patients. This association might further&#xD;
      increase the response rate achieved by the standard oral MPT or MPR regimens.&#xD;
