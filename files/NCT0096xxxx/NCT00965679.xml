      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computed tomography (CT) creates three-dimensional images based on X-ray imaging. CT is&#xD;
           useful for determining treatment approaches for certain diseases, such as calcific&#xD;
           aortic stenosis (narrowing of the aorta because of calcium deposits).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparing the data received from CT scans with the data received from heart&#xD;
           catheterization (which assesses the heart's condition and function) can be used to&#xD;
           improve treatment in patients with certain heart conditions. Researchers are interested&#xD;
           in looking at the effectiveness of both procedures in assessing possible surgical&#xD;
           treatments for patients with calcific aortic stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To analyze cardiac CT scans in conjunction with existing heart scan results to improve&#xD;
      treatments for future minimally invasive aortic valve replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with aortic valve stenosis that&#xD;
      may be treated surgically, and who will undergo or have recently undergone heart&#xD;
      catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a CT scan within 90 days of the medically necessary heart&#xD;
           catheterization, but before any other surgical or catheter treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the CT scan, patients will be asked to hold their breath intermittently for about&#xD;
           5 to 20 seconds. Patients will be inside the scanner for less than 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be asked to return in 3 to 7 days for a blood test to check kidney&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will analyze the results of the CT scan in conjunction with the previous&#xD;
           results from the catheterization to determine possible improved treatment options.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will collect cardiac computed tomography (CT) data from patients with aortic valve&#xD;
      stenosis being considered for surgical or catheter treatment. These data will be analyzed&#xD;
      along with medically-necessary fluoroscopy from cardiac catheterization to learn whether they&#xD;
      can be combined to enhance future minimally invasive valve treatments.&#xD;
