      This pilot study may yield important research findings on how to adapt exercise treatment for&#xD;
      depression among adolescents. Potential public health benefits from this study include a&#xD;
      reduction of adolescent depression and problems associated with untreated depression in young&#xD;
      adults including suicide, substance abuse, cigarette smoking, teen pregnancy, impaired&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning and school failure. In addition, because this study prescribes&#xD;
      physical activity as a treatment for depression, additional public health benefits may&#xD;
      include a reduction in chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease, all of&#xD;
      which are associated with sedentary behavior.&#xD;

      Adolescent depression is a major public health problem in the United States and throughout&#xD;
      the world. Major depressive disorder (MDD) in adolescence is common with point prevalence&#xD;
      rates of 3% to 9%. In the U.S., it is estimated that by the time adolescents reach the age of&#xD;
      17, 14% will have experienced at least one episode of major depressive disorder. Effective&#xD;
      treatments of adolescent depression are clearly needed despite the fact that in the past&#xD;
      10-15 years, there has been a dramatic increase in studies of the efficacy of medications,&#xD;
      primarily the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and of cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy (CBT). Medications and CBT rarely result in complete and lasting remission of&#xD;
      symptoms, and residual symptoms are associated with a high rate of relapse. In most studies,&#xD;
      a positive response is defined as a 30-50% improvement in symptoms and/or a global rating&#xD;
      that the subject is much or very much improved. In adults, exercise has been used as a&#xD;
      mono-therapy and as an augmentation therapy with antidepressant medication. Our recently&#xD;
      completed randomized trial of exercise treatment in adults found response and remission rates&#xD;
      of 46% and 42%, in those randomized to a public health dose of exercise. In adolescents, data&#xD;
      on the use of exercise to treat MDD is relatively sparse. A 2006 Cochrane review of exercise&#xD;
      to prevent and treat depression in adolescents found a small effect size in support of&#xD;
      exercise, but the conclusion is based on evidence from a small number of randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials of low methodological quality. In this exploratory R34, the specific aims of this&#xD;
      application are to: 1) Develop a detailed Manual of Procedures (MOP) to conduct an&#xD;
      acute-phase randomized trial of exercise to treat adolescent depression; 2) Develop estimates&#xD;
      of recruitment yield from tests of various recruitment strategies; and, 3) Pilot test trial&#xD;
      methodologies in (n=40) adolescents diagnosed with depression to ascertain estimates of&#xD;
      treatment effect sizes, adherence and drop-out rates. To achieve these aims, the project is&#xD;
      organized into 3 phases. Phase I will be the development of the first draft MOP that will&#xD;
      adapt procedures developed from a previous trial examining two doses of exercise in treatment&#xD;
      of adult MDD. Phase II will test specific recruitment methodologies to determine recruitment&#xD;
      yields for each strategy and will pilot test screening procedures developed in Phase I. Phase&#xD;
      III will be a pilot test of the intervention and will include development of baseline and&#xD;
      outcome measures of exercise and depression; development and implementation of the&#xD;
      experimental exercise treatment; and determination of the effects of exercise on depressive&#xD;
      symptoms. Following the pilot study, we will finalize all procedures for the MOP and obtain&#xD;
      estimates of effect sizes, adherence and drop out rates. These data will allow us to specify&#xD;
      all study procedures necessary to meet standards of high methodological quality for a future,&#xD;
      larger-scale, controlled study of exercise in depressed youth and will provide us with needed&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
