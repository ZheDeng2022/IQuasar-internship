    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this study to better understand the role of the central nervous&#xD;
      system in processing painful stimuli in patients with fibromyalgia. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators would like to know whether the central nervous system processing of painful&#xD;
      stimuli changes with time and with talk therapy. In addition, the investigators are&#xD;
      investigating how changes in your fibromyalgia symptoms may affect certain markers or&#xD;
      proteins in your blood.&#xD;

      Overall Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female patients with FM will be enrolled in this 12-week prospective cohort study. To effect&#xD;
      change in patient's symptoms, subjects (n=30) will be randomized to receive six sessions of&#xD;
      phone-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or to 'usual' care. CBT will be provided from&#xD;
      week 1 (baseline) to week 6. Outcome assessments (i.e., self-report symptom questionnaires,&#xD;
      plasma neuropeptide levels and NFR) will be performed at baseline, week 6 and week 12.&#xD;
      Subjects who not complete all three testing phases of the study will be reported as&#xD;
      withdraws, and will be replaced as needed until a total of 30 volunteers have completed this&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be asked to visit the Fibromyalgia Clinical Research Center on 3 different&#xD;
      occasions: baseline (Screening), week 6, and week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first visit subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Similar to&#xD;
      flipping a coin, you have a 50% chance of being assigned to either one of two groups: a)&#xD;
      telephone-based educational instruction group or b) usual care group. Subjects who are&#xD;
      randomly assigned to educational instruction group will receive one phone call per week for&#xD;
      the first six weeks of the study. During the phone conversation, you will receive&#xD;
      instructions in managing your pain. If subjects are assigned to the educational instruction&#xD;
      group, subjects must agree to allow us to audiotape the telephone conversation. Audio-taping&#xD;
      the telephone conversations will help us give you the highest quality of instruction. On the&#xD;
      other hand, subjects assigned to the usual care group will receive no telephone calls from&#xD;
      the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each visit subjects will be asked to do the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete a comprehensive questionnaire (computer-based or the traditional paper and pen&#xD;
           format) in regard to how fibromyalgia affects your daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Risks: You may feel uncomfortable or care not to answer a particular question. To&#xD;
           minimize these risks, you can tell the researcher that you feel uncomfortable or do not&#xD;
           wish to answer the question.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Provide a blood sample (10 ml).The purpose or this blood test is to examine changes in&#xD;
           certain blood markers in relation to your changes in your symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
           Risks: The physical risks associated with participation in this study are with the blood&#xD;
           draw. The process of drawing blood may cause bleeding, bruising, pain, lightheadedness,&#xD;
           and some minor swelling around the area of the needle stick. Occasionally an infection&#xD;
           or bleeding may develop where the needle was placed in the vein. To minimize these&#xD;
           risks, the blood specimen will be obtained by experienced technicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Undergo nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) testing. This test examines how your body&#xD;
           responds to painful stimuli. To begin each testing session, electrodes used to measure&#xD;
           the nociceptive flexion reflex will be attached to your left leg. To measure the reflex,&#xD;
           we will administer a series of electrical stimuli to the ankle of your left foot. After&#xD;
           each stimulus you will be asked to rate the stimulus intensity using a scale with&#xD;
           anchors of 0 (no sensation), 50 (pain threshold), and 100 (maximum tolerable). This&#xD;
           procedure is used to determine the intensity of stimulus required to elicit a&#xD;
           nociceptive flexion reflex response from your left hamstring muscle. This reflex is so&#xD;
           small that you may not even notice any activity in your leg muscles. The intensity of&#xD;
           electrical stimuli will be increased slowly until a reflex response is shown, but the&#xD;
           intensity will NEVER exceed that which you rate as a &quot;100&quot; (maximum tolerable). At the&#xD;
           higher intensities, the electrical stimulus is described by others as feeling like a&#xD;
           &quot;brief pinprick&quot; or &quot;carpet shock&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use the same procedure to assess your pain tolerance threshold for electrical&#xD;
      stimulation to your ankle. Stimulus intensity will be increased slowly and you will be asked&#xD;
      to rate each stimulus on the 0-100 scale. The procedure will end as soon as you provide a&#xD;
      stimulus intensity rating of &quot;100&quot; (maximum tolerable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks: The nociceptive flexion reflex procedure is likely to elicit temporary discomfort,&#xD;
      increases in heart rate and blood pressure as well as sensations of discomfort or pain.&#xD;
      Further, preparation of the skin required to apply electrodes may be mildly irritating or&#xD;
      uncomfortable, and may leave behind some redness of the skin that could require a few days to&#xD;
      heal. To minimize these risks, only well trained technicians will conduct this test. It is&#xD;
      important to note that this test is similar to an EMG (electromyogram) study - a test&#xD;
      commonly done in routine medical care.&#xD;
