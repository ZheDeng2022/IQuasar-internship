      The purpose of this study is to see how the body reacts to different strengths of the H1N1&#xD;
      flu shot when it is given with or without an &quot;adjuvant.&quot; An adjuvant is a substance that may&#xD;
      cause the body to produce more antibodies when it is given with a vaccine. This study will&#xD;
      also compare how age affects the body's response to the H1N1 flu shot. In this study, 3&#xD;
      strengths of the H1N1 flu shot will be tested combined with an adjuvant. In addition, 2&#xD;
      strengths of the H1N1 flu shot will be tested without adjuvant. Two H1N1 flu shots of the&#xD;
      same strength, with or without adjuvant, will be given about 3 weeks apart. Participants will&#xD;
      include up to 800 healthy adults, approximately 500 individuals ages 18-64 and 250&#xD;
      individuals greater than or equal to age 65. Study procedures include: physical exam, blood&#xD;
      samples, completing a memory aid to record vaccine side effects, medications and daily oral&#xD;
      temperature. Participants will be involved in study related procedures for up to 13 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recently, a novel swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus was identified as a significant cause&#xD;
      of febrile respiratory illnesses in Mexico and the United States. It rapidly spread prompting&#xD;
      the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic. Data from several cohorts in different&#xD;
      age groups that received licensed trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines suggest that these&#xD;
      vaccines are unlikely to provide protection against the new virus. These data indicate the&#xD;
      need to develop vaccines against the new H1N1 strain and suggest that different vaccine&#xD;
      strategies (e.g., number of doses, need for adjuvant) may be appropriate for persons in&#xD;
      different age groups. Based on clinical data from the clinical trials with vaccines&#xD;
      containing novel influenza A antigens, a higher dosage, or multiple doses of a novel antigen&#xD;
      may be necessary to generate potentially protective antibody responses. Alternatively,&#xD;
      inactivated influenza H1N1 vaccines administered with adjuvants, such as AS03, may confer&#xD;
      protection to a maximal number of vaccine recipients. This protocol will explore antibody&#xD;
      responses following vaccination with an inactivated influenza H1N1 virus vaccine at 3&#xD;
      different dose levels combined with AS03 adjuvant and at 2 different dose levels administered&#xD;
      without adjuvant. This study will assess the immune response following a single dose of&#xD;
      vaccine with or without AS03 adjuvant, to assess whether individuals have any pre-existing&#xD;
      'prime' immunity, such that the initial H1N1 vaccination serves as a boost, thus conferring a&#xD;
      more rapid time to protection with the need for fewer doses. Antibody responses will be&#xD;
      assessed 8 days after each dose to evaluate the development of an anamnestic response. In&#xD;
      addition, antibody responses will be assessed 21 days after each dose. The primary objectives&#xD;
      are: safety, to assess the safety of inactivated H1N1 vaccine when administered at 3.75, 7.5&#xD;
      or 15 mcg combined with AS03 adjuvant and at 7.5 or 15 mcg administered without adjuvant; and&#xD;
      immunogenicity, to assess the antibody response at Day 21 following a single dose of&#xD;
      inactivated H1N1 vaccine when administered at 3.75, 7.5 or 15 mcg combined with AS03 adjuvant&#xD;
      and at 7.5 or 15 mcg administered without adjuvant, stratified by age of recipient. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is immunogenicity, to assess the antibody response following 2 doses of&#xD;
      inactivated H1N1 vaccine when administered at 3.75, 7.5 or 15 mcg combined with AS03 adjuvant&#xD;
      and at 7.5 or 15 mcg administered without adjuvant, stratified by age of recipient.&#xD;
      Participants will include up to 800 healthy adults who have no history of novel influenza&#xD;
      H1N1 2009 infection or novel influenza H1N1 2009 vaccination. This is a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blinded, Phase II study. Subjects will be randomized into 5 groups, stratified by age&#xD;
      (150 subjects per dose group with 100 subjects in the 18-64 years of age stratum and 50&#xD;
      subjects in the greater than or equal to 65 years of age stratum), to receive intramuscular&#xD;
      inactivated influenza H1N1 vaccine at 3.75, 7.5 or 15 mcg combined with AS03 adjuvant (Groups&#xD;
      1, 2, and 3, respectively) or at 7.5 or 15 mcg without adjuvant (Groups 4 and 5,&#xD;
      respectively). The vaccine, with and without adjuvant, will be administered at Days 0 and 21.&#xD;
      Following immunization, safety will be measured by assessment of adverse events (AEs) through&#xD;
      21 days following the last vaccination (Day 42 for those receiving both doses and Day 21 for&#xD;
      those who do not receive the second dose), serious adverse events (SAEs) and new-onset&#xD;
      chronic medical conditions through 12 months post final vaccination (Day 365 after second&#xD;
      vaccination), and reactogenicity to the vaccine for 8 days following each vaccination (Day&#xD;
      0-7). Immunogenicity testing will include hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) and&#xD;
      neutralizing antibody testing on serum obtained prior to each vaccination, 8-10 days after&#xD;
      each vaccination, 21 days (Day 42), 6 months (Day 201) and 12 months (Day 386) following the&#xD;
      second vaccination.&#xD;
