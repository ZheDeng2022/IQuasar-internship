      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of neurofeedback (NFB) to improve&#xD;
      attention, memory and processing speed in children treated for a Brain Tumour (BT). In the&#xD;
      Netherlands every year approximately 100 children are diagnosed with a BT. Nowadays over 65%&#xD;
      of these children have a 5-year survival. Treatment for a BT consists of neurosurgery and /&#xD;
      or local or craniospinal radiation and / or adjuvant chemotherapy. Neurotoxicity caused by&#xD;
      radiotherapy and / or chemotherapy (especially methotrexate) is a major cause of&#xD;
      neurocognitive decline in Childhood Brain Tumour Survivors (CBTS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that NFB has the capacity to improve the brain systems mediating selective&#xD;
      attention and response inhibition in children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactive Disorder&#xD;
      (ADHD). The effectiveness is reported as comparable to methylphenidate (Ritalin) without side&#xD;
      effects of medication. CBTS exhibit symptoms comparable to those of children with ADHD and&#xD;
      positive response to methylphenidate has been found in CBTS. However, NFB has not been used&#xD;
      as an intervention in CBTS yet. The effectiveness of NFB in children treated for a BT will be&#xD;
      investigated in a randomized controlled trial. The intervention group of 30 patients will&#xD;
      receive approximately 30 sessions of NFB; the control group will receive 30 session of&#xD;
      placebo neurofeedback. Neuropsychological tests will be used to evaluate pre- and post-NFB&#xD;
      intervention as well as at a 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If NFB proofs to be effective for CBTS this will be a great improvement for their (neuro-)&#xD;
      psychological functioning and quality of life, without the disadvantage of the side effects&#xD;
      of medication. The implementation of this intervention might increase cognitive and social&#xD;
      functioning and thus facilitate integration of these children in society during childhood and&#xD;
      school carrier as well as in adult life.&#xD;
