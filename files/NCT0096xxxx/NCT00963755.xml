  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that realization of guided biopsies by multimodal&#xD;
      imaging with 18F-fluorocholine PET / CT and MR Imaging/spectroscopy would allow to increase&#xD;
      the rate of detection prostate cancer compared with the current approach and give an&#xD;
      information about location and tumoral volume before surgery.:&#xD;

      1. To evaluate the utility of F-18-FCH-PET/CT and MR imaging with 3-D MR spectroscopy in&#xD;
           detecting, localizing, and estimating the volume of initial primary prostate cancer as&#xD;
           compared to the current standard work-up using TRUS-guided biopsy. All imaging findings&#xD;
           will be correlated with &quot;gold standard&quot; step slice histological examination. The&#xD;
           hypothesis is that the combination of noninvasive imaging will improve the preoperative&#xD;
           work-up as compared to the current approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate FCH-PET for the restaging of prostate cancer after biochemical relapse in a&#xD;
           large patient cohort. This will run in parallel to the work-up of primary prostate&#xD;
           cancer, as the FCH radiopharmaceutical will be available during the time of study at&#xD;
           absolutely no cost to patients or CHUV. A number of studies have demonstrated the&#xD;
           benefits of F-18-FCH-PET/CT for these patients and this indication is currently not&#xD;
           reimbursed by Swiss obligatory health insurance providers.&#xD;
