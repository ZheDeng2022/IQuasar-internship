      The aim of this trial was to verify the efficiency of a new surgical device (the LigaSure&#xD;
      vessels sealing system) in esophagogastric decongestion and splenectomy in patients with&#xD;
      portal hypertension.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bleeding from esophageal and gastric cardia varices is the major life threatening&#xD;
      complication in patients with portal hypertension. Patients with portal hypertension have a&#xD;
      mortality rate of 30%-50% at the first episode of esophagogastric variceal rupture. The&#xD;
      associated 1-year mortality rate is reported to be 75%. The ideal treatment for gastric&#xD;
      varices should effectively control bleeding and improve the liver function to optimum levels.&#xD;
      Although endoscopic treatments have showed great promise for esophageal varices, there is&#xD;
      still controversy regarding the treatment of gastric varices. Hepatic encephalopathy remain a&#xD;
      dominant problems after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement (TIPS) and&#xD;
      surgical shunts. A meta-analysis has shown that the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy and&#xD;
      mortality was increased significantly either in nonselective or selective shunt operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophagogastric decongestion and splenectomy with or without esophageal transaction were the&#xD;
      fundamental operation performed in our department for patients with portal hypertension.&#xD;
      Patients under the azygoportal devascularization methods revealed reduction of the&#xD;
      encephalopathy as well as diminished rebleeding rates. The crucial point of the procedure is&#xD;
      prevention of the brisk bleeding from the dilated vessels like enlarged azygoportal&#xD;
      collaterals. Conventional hand-tied ligatures can become dislodged and represent a foreign&#xD;
      body, and more important, it is tedious and time-consuming. The LigaSure vessel sealing&#xD;
      system (Valleylab, Boulder, Colorado) is a bipolar electrosurgical device, sealing vessels up&#xD;
      to 7 mm in diameter, by denaturing collagen and elastin within vessel wall and surrounding&#xD;
      connective tissue. This device was tested, with excellent results, in different fields of&#xD;
      surgery (gastrointestinal, hepatopancreatobiliary, urologic, gynecologic, laparoscopic, etc),&#xD;
      as demonstrated by several recently published studies. Shamiyeh et al confirmed the&#xD;
      reliability of LigaSure for the closure of the veins in laparoscopic azygoportal&#xD;
      disconnection procedure on the portal hypertension porcine model in 2005, there was no intra-&#xD;
      or post-operative bleeding and no conversion to open surgery, and when more than 2 mm far&#xD;
      from the thermal energy source, no collateral damage of the solid tissue such as stomach&#xD;
      could be detected.&#xD;
