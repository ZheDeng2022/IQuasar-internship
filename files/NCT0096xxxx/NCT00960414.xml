      The purpose of this study is to compare two approaches to a diet and exercise-based weight&#xD;
      loss program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The high prevalence of obesity and its medical consequences make it one of the most important&#xD;
      public health issues in the United States today. Few interventions have been consistently&#xD;
      successful at reducing obesity. This trial will test an intervention program that lasts 22&#xD;
      weeks, with 16 evening sessions and one weekend day. Participants will be randomized to one&#xD;
      of two arms. Both arms will receive diet and exercise intervention elements. The study aims&#xD;
      for gradual weight loss, with a calorie target that will maintain ideal body weight, rather&#xD;
      than a more calorie restricted diet. The exercise component is based around increasing&#xD;
      walking. The arms will compare methods for producing long-lasting behavior change.&#xD;
