  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading malignancies in Taiwan. Surgery and&#xD;
      local ablative therapy remain the treatment of choice for curative purpose. Transarterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization has been the mainstay of intrahepatic control for patients not being&#xD;
      candidates for local modalities of treatment. Sorafenib is recently integrated into the&#xD;
      treatment options, mainly for intrahepatic or extrahepatic wide spread disease&#xD;
      contraindicated for the other modalities. External radiotherapy (RT) has been selectively&#xD;
      used for patients with the localized hepatic tumor(s) refractory to the above treatment&#xD;
      options. The data from the retrospective studies were biased by the patient selection and&#xD;
      uncontrolled comparison with patients not receiving RT. The obstacles for RT to HCC remain&#xD;
      unanswered with heterogeneity in dose of radiation and lower tolerance of liver to RT in&#xD;
      viral hepatitis carriers. Such a sublethal dose might be associated with unsatisfactory tumor&#xD;
      control, intra-/extra-hepatic metastasis, and radiation-induced liver disease in a&#xD;
      significant proportion of HCC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this phase I study are primarily to determine the maximally tolerated dose of&#xD;
      RT, and secondarily to evaluate the tumor control, to assess patterns of failure and&#xD;
      survival, to analyze the characteristics of radiation-induced liver disease, as well as to&#xD;
      collect blood samples for translational research. HCC patients who are hepatitis B virus&#xD;
      carriers and graded as Child-Pugh A cirrhosis are enrolled. This dose escalation trial is&#xD;
      conducted with the 7-Gy increase in 2 fractions (3.5 Gy per fraction) for a total of four&#xD;
      levels, from 42 Gy up to 63 Gy. Conformal RT with three-dimensional design, intensity&#xD;
      modulated RT, or volumetric modulated arc therapy is used with the defined dose-volume&#xD;
      threshold for normal liver and the other structures. Five patients are treated for each dose&#xD;
      level, with dose limiting toxicity in less than 2 patients judged to be acceptable. A minimum&#xD;
      of 15 patients are required for the starting dose level of 49 Gy if the treated tumor&#xD;
      diameter is less than 10 cm. Imaging modalities are used for estimating treatment response&#xD;
      and detecting metastasis. Serum analyses are done for evaluating hepatic function, viral&#xD;
      load, hematological toxicity, and translational research for angiogenic and inflammatory&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

      Synopsis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled patients will receive 3.5 Gy per fraction (five fractions per week) at the&#xD;
      following levels;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation by 7 Gy in 2 fractions to maximum of 63 Gy, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Level I: 3.5 Gy for 12 fractions (42 Gy total) Dose Level II*: 3.5 Gy for 14 fractions&#xD;
      (49 Gy total) Dose Level III: 3.5 Gy for 16 fractions (56 Gy total) Dose Level VI: 3.5 Gy for&#xD;
      18 fractions (63 Gy total) *Protocol treatment begins at level 2 for patients with the sum of&#xD;
      the diameters of irradiated tumor(s) less than 10 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatocellular carcinoma based on the diagnostic criteria of European Association for the&#xD;
      Study of the Liver (EASL), either confirmed cyto-histologically or confirmed non-invasively&#xD;
      (restricted to cirrhotic patients) by radiological criteria (two coincident imaging&#xD;
      techniques and focal lesion &gt;2 cm with arterial hypervascularization) or combined criteria&#xD;
      (one imaging technique associated with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), focal lesion &gt;2 cm with&#xD;
      arterial hypervascularization, and AFP levels &gt;400 ng/ml); Hepatitis B virus carrier&#xD;
      serologically; Child-Pugh grade A for cirrhosis; The patients should be considered not&#xD;
      suitable for surgery, ablation therapy, or trans-arterial chemoembolization judged by the&#xD;
      caring physician. In addition, no systemic anti-cancer therapy with high priority is&#xD;
      available judged by the caring physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Required sample size: Minimum of 15 (if starting from level II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary To identify the maximally tolerated dose (from 42 Gy up to 63 Gy in 3.5 Gy per&#xD;
      fraction), conformal radiation therapy in patients with HBV-related Child-Pugh grade A&#xD;
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are not eligible for other conventional&#xD;
      treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary To evaluate the local tumor control rate within the irradiated fields. To assess&#xD;
      patterns of failure and survival of patients treated with conformal liver radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the dose volume characteristics that influence whether radiation-induced liver&#xD;
      disease (RILD), HBV reactivation, or other toxicities occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect blood samples for translational research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RADIATION THERAPY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation therapy must start within 4 weeks of patient registration. Intensity modulated&#xD;
      radiation therapy or volumetric modulated arc therapy is acceptable. Helical tomotherapy or&#xD;
      cyberknife is not allowed in this study. H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors will be&#xD;
      required in an attempt to reduce the risk of late gastrointestinal bleeding. Oral anti-viral&#xD;
      agents are allowed at the discretion of the treating physician to prevent the reactivation of&#xD;
      HBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose specification&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target dose is determined based on the study dose level and the volume of normal liver&#xD;
      excluded from radiation, using the liver dose-volume histogram (DVH). Treatment at the&#xD;
      allocated dose level is only permitted if the normal tissue criteria are maintained. If the&#xD;
      normal tissue criteria are not met at that dose, treatment at a lower dose level is&#xD;
      permitted, as long as the normal tissue constraints are met at the lower dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose per fraction to the planning target volume (PTV) is 3.5 Gy. Dose will start at dose&#xD;
      level 2 (49 Gy), but may vary from 42 Gy to 63 Gy, in 12 to 18 fractions, Monday through&#xD;
      Friday, in 2-fraction increments. The starting level will be Level 2, 49 Gy in 14 fraction&#xD;
      for patients with the sum of the diameters of irradiated tumor(s) less than 10 cm and&#xD;
      Child-Pugh grade A of liver cirrhosis, and level 1, 42 Gy in 12 fraction for patients&#xD;
      otherwise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doses will be prescribed to a peripheral covering isodose covering the PTV. Assuming dose is&#xD;
      normalized to this isodose at 100%, the maximal dose can be 120% and the minimum PTV dose&#xD;
      90%. Any dose &gt; 110% must be within the PTV (except for adjacent tumors, in which the maximum&#xD;
      dose outside the PTV must be &lt; 115%). Minor variation is defined as minimum PTV dose falling&#xD;
      between 85 and 90% (of the required 100% isodose prescription). Major variation&#xD;
      (unacceptable) is defined as minimum PTV dose &lt; 85 % (for the required 100% isodose&#xD;
      prescription). The acceptable exception is the underdose of PTV adjacent to small bowels to&#xD;
      keep less than any 3cc of small bowels or stomach with the dose more than 42 Gy. This part of&#xD;
      PTV should be specified and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum doses are defined at 1 cc of volume. Minimum dose to the PTV is defined as minimum&#xD;
      dose to 99.0% of the PTV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Protocol treatment begins at level 2 for patients with the sum of the diameters of&#xD;
      irradiated tumor(s) less than 10 cm and Child-Pugh grade A of liver cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimum, maximum, and mean dose to the PTV is to be recorded for each gross tumor volume&#xD;
      (GTV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical factors&#xD;
&#xD;
      External beam equipment: Treatment will be delivered with 6 - 25 MV photons, with selection&#xD;
      of appropriate energies to optimize the radiotherapy dose distribution within the target&#xD;
      volume and minimize the dose to non-target tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Localization, simulation and immobilization Patient positioning will be based on clinical&#xD;
      judgment to best achieve the ideal dose distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target volume will be identified on an IV contrast CT scan and/or MRI that is registered&#xD;
      to the planning CT dataset. The planning CT and all subsequent CT studies will be obtained&#xD;
      using the identical immobilization technique used for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An immobilization frame may be used, but is not required. A variety of immobilization methods&#xD;
      may be utilized for planning and treatment, including active breathing control (ABC),&#xD;
      voluntary breath hold, gating, shallow breathing, or abdominal compression. For free&#xD;
      breathing, 4D-CT can be used to aid in PTV definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment planning/volume definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT-based 3D treatment planning shall be used for all patients. Intensity modulated radiation&#xD;
      therapy (IMRT) can be used for selected patients with breathing control device during IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GTV will be defined by IV contrast CT or MRI. The clinical target volume (CTV) will be&#xD;
      the GTV + 5 mm, within the liver. The PTV will be determined by the immobilization device&#xD;
      used and/or the individual patient breathing motion. The minimal and maximal PTV margins&#xD;
      permitted are 4 mm and 30 mm, respectively, dependent on the immobilization method used and&#xD;
      breathing motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DVH shall be calculated for the liver (liver minus the GTVs), both kidneys, the spinal cord,&#xD;
      small bowels and stomach as well as the target lesions (GTVs. CTVs, and PTVs). The maximum,&#xD;
      minimum, and mean dose and dose per fraction must be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critical structures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal liver: The normal liver is defined as the normal liver volume minus GTV. In all&#xD;
      patients, it is required that there is at least 700 cc of normal liver. No more than 30% of&#xD;
      the normal liver may receive more than 27 Gy, and no more than 50% of normal liver may&#xD;
      receive over 24 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kidney: No more than 50% of the combined renal volume may receive 20 Gy or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal cord: Maximal permitted dose to spinal cord is 37 Gy. Small bowel: Maximal permitted&#xD;
      dose to small bowel is 42 Gy for any 3 cc volume. The underdose of PTV adjacent to small&#xD;
      bowels or stomach is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stomach: Maximal permitted dose to stomach is 42 Gy for any 3 cc of volume. All doses are&#xD;
      physical doses (not biologically corrected). Note that 42 Gy is biologically equivalent to&#xD;
      56.8 Gy in 2 Gy/fraction using an α/β of 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver: Radiation therapy should be held at any point in the protocol for CTCAE v3.0 hepatic&#xD;
      adverse event Grade 4. It is expected that a proportion of patients will have transient&#xD;
      elevation of liver enzymes following treatment (possibly up to Grade 3 CTCAE levels). If&#xD;
      elevation of liver enzymes is observed up to Grade 3 levels, more frequent measurements (at&#xD;
      least once a week) of the liver enzymes are recommended until the enzymes stabilize or return&#xD;
      to baseline levels. Repeat of all Grade 4 blood work is required at least 5 days following&#xD;
      the first abnormal lab value to determine if the Grade 4 levels are transient (defined here&#xD;
      as &lt; 5 days) or persistent. Patients will be evaluated at 1-month and 3-month follow-up&#xD;
      visits for symptoms and signs of radiation induced liver disease (RILD). In patients who have&#xD;
      elevation of liver enzymes near Grade 4 levels and/or in patients with early non-specific&#xD;
      signs or symptoms of liver injury, close follow-up is recommended with repeat blood work. If&#xD;
      no tumor progression is documented in these patients, liver injury will be presumed to be&#xD;
      treatment related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBV-related hepatitis: HBV-related hepatitis flare is defined as a greater than 3-fold&#xD;
      increase of pre-treatment baseline serum ALT level and more than 100 IU/L. The HBV-related&#xD;
      hepatitis flare (HBV reactivation) should be accompanied with the preceding or simultaneous&#xD;
      greater than 10-fold increase, compared with previous nadir levels, of HBV DNA or by the&#xD;
      reappearance of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in the serum of patients whose baseline HBeAg&#xD;
      is negative. Oral anti-viral agent should be initiated in patients without prophylactic use&#xD;
      of oral antiviral agents after HBV reactivation is confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal: The dose constraints required for the normal stomach and small intestine&#xD;
      should limit the GI toxicity observed and it is not expected that GI toxicity will be dose&#xD;
      limiting. However, if a portion of the stomach or small intestine is treated (&gt; 30 Gy), H2&#xD;
      blockers or proton pump inhibitors will be required to attempt to decrease the chance of late&#xD;
      GI bleeding. Patients will be followed for GI toxicity at each follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other: The occurrence of Grade 4 adverse events, related to protocol treatment, in any organ&#xD;
      system will prompt discontinuance of protocol therapy while appropriate physical examination,&#xD;
      laboratory, and imaging assessments are undertaken. Protocol treatment will not be resumed in&#xD;
      the absence of recovery from adverse events of this magnitude. Once recovery to grade 1 has&#xD;
      occurred, treatment may continue at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of partial and complete response will be based on the 3-month follow-up CT scan.&#xD;
      Only very gross increase in tumor size seen in less than that time will be scored as&#xD;
      progressive disease. Response to radiation may continue up to 12 months follow-up and time of&#xD;
      maximal response will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of Response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed by the&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee. The sum of the longest&#xD;
      diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD.&#xD;
      The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by which to characterize the objective tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response Criteria: Evaluation of target lesions Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all&#xD;
      target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have&#xD;
      reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions,&#xD;
      taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions,&#xD;
      taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the&#xD;
      smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also&#xD;
      demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new&#xD;
      lesions is also considered progression). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to&#xD;
      qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest&#xD;
      sum diameters while on study&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-field local control: For this study, local control is defined as the lack of progressive&#xD;
      disease in the treated fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cause of death: The treating physician will evaluate whether the cause of death was hepatic&#xD;
      or non-hepatic, and/or due to tumor or due to toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIMEN COLLECTION FOR TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral Blood Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected in 5 occasions along the protocol treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. baseline (within 1 week before the first radiotherapy fraction);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 5-10 days after the last radiotherapy fraction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 4 weeks after the last radiotherapy fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of Plasma and Buffy coat:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collect 5-10 mL of anticoagulated blood (EDTA). Invert tube several times to assure&#xD;
           blood is mixed thoroughly with anticoagulant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Using three (3) 1mL cryovials, label them patient's case number, procedure date, and&#xD;
           clearly mark cryovials &quot;plasma&quot;. Similarly, label three (3) 1mL cryovials and mark as&#xD;
           &quot;buffy coat&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Centrifuge specimens within one hour of collection. EDTA (purple top) tubes should be&#xD;
           centrifuged in a standard clinical centrifuge at ~2500 RPM at 4° Celsius for 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the interval between specimen collection and processing is anticipated to be greater&#xD;
           than one hour, keep specimen on ice until centrifuging is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Remove plasma close to the buffy coat taking cared not to disturb the white cell layer.&#xD;
           Aliquot plasma into three 1mL cryovials labeled with the RTOG study and case numbers,&#xD;
           procedure date, and clearly mark as &quot;plasma&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Remove the buffy coat cells carefully and place into the 1 mL cryovials labeled &quot;buffy&#xD;
           coat&quot; (it is okay if a few packed red cells below the buffy coat layer are inadvertently&#xD;
           collected in the process)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Place cryovials into biohazard bag.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Store plasma and buffy coat specimens frozen. Buffy coat samples must be shipped to the&#xD;
           tissue bank within one (1) week of collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of Serum:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collect one 5-10 mL red-topped tube. Allow 30 minutes for clotting at room temperature&#xD;
           before processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Using four (4) 1ml cryovials, label them with the study number, and patient's case&#xD;
           number, procedure date, and clearly mark cryovials as &quot;serum&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Allow one 5ml red top tube to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Spin red-topped tube in a standard clinical centrifuge at ~2500 RPM at 4°Celsius for 10&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Aliquot serum into the four 1mL cryovials labeled with the RTOG study and case numbers,&#xD;
           procedure date, and marked &quot;serum&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Store serum frozen (at -80° Celsius) until ready to ship&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of Blood Samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum or plasma samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soluble cytokines and growth factors related to inflammation and angiogenesis will be&#xD;
      analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for serum samples and plasma samples.&#xD;
      Inflammatory factors, such as IL-6, TNF-alpha, CRP, MMP-2, MMP-9, VEGF, IL-8, pro-angiogenic&#xD;
      factors, such as VEGF, basic-FGF, PDGF, PIGF, and TNF, and anti-angiogenic factors, such as&#xD;
      thrombospontin-1 (TSP-1), will be included. Serum HBV DNA level will also be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNA samples from blood mononuclear cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tumor-associated gene expression in peripheral blood reflects the presence of&#xD;
           circulating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and might be associated with aggressive&#xD;
           features of HCC. We will assess the prognostic significance of AFP and human telomerase&#xD;
           reverse transcriptase protein (hTERT) mRNA expression in the peripheral blood of HCC&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Circulating endothelial cells and their progenitors have been shown as surrogate markers&#xD;
           of angiogenic activity. Several cellular markers, including VEGFR2, Tie-2, and CD133,&#xD;
           have been shown to be specifically expressed in activated endothelial cells or&#xD;
           endothelial progenitor cells. The expression of these markers will be detected by&#xD;
           real-time quantitative PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA samples from blood mononuclear cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The polymorphic inheritance of human drug-metabolizing enzymes, such as those encoded by the&#xD;
      glutathione-S-transferase (GST), microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEPHX), and CYP systems, have&#xD;
      been implicated in both cancer risk and prognosis. DNA samples from blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
      will be used for the analysis of GST, mEPHX, CYP, and p53 polymorphism by PCR and sequencing&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluation of soluble factors related to inflammation or angiogenesis and the surrogate&#xD;
           quantification of circulating endothelial cells or progenitors (the B-2 section) will be&#xD;
           conducted according to standard procedures by personnel who have no access to the&#xD;
           clinical outcomes of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The clinical outcomes of the patients will be included for further correlation study&#xD;
           include clinical responses (responders vs. non-responders), other patterns of failure&#xD;
           (intrahepatic recurrence outside radiation field vs. no intrahepatic recurrence;&#xD;
           extrahepatic metastasis vs. no metastasis), radiation induced liver disease (RILD vs. no&#xD;
           RILD), and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The correlation of clinical outcomes with the surrogate markers evaluated from the&#xD;
           after-mentioned markers will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the maximally tolerated&#xD;
      dose of highly conformal radiation therapy in patients with HCC. The secondary endpoints are&#xD;
      to evaluate local control rate within the irradiated fields,to assess patterns of failure and&#xD;
      survival, and to analyze the dose volume characteristics that influence whether RILD, HBV&#xD;
      reactivation, or other toxicities occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be graded according to the CTCAE v. 3.0 criteria. Dose limiting toxicity&#xD;
      (DLT) is defined as any of the following occurring within 90 days from the start of&#xD;
      treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) grade 4 or 5 hepatic b) grade 4 or 5 gastrointestinal c) grade 4 or 5 thrombocytopenia d)&#xD;
      Radiation Induced Liver Disease (RILD) requiring treatment (including diuretics). RILD will&#xD;
      be defined using the following adverse events: i) grade 3 or higher alkaline phosphatase&#xD;
      (ALP) in the presence of ascites occurring in the absence of disease progression ii) grade 4&#xD;
      hepatic liver enzyme elevations persisting for ≥ 5 days e) any adverse event requiring&#xD;
      interruption of therapy by ≥ 2 weeks (14 calendar days). This does not include patient desire&#xD;
      to discontinue therapy. It does include failure for thrombocytopenia to improve to a level of&#xD;
      80 requiring interruption of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      f) Any grade 5 adverse event The goal of this study is to determine the maximally tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) for patients with HCC, such that the rate of DLT is less than 35%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Escalation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following are the four possible dose levels for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Level I: 3.5 Gy for 12 fractions (42 Gy total) Dose Level II: 3.5 Gy for 14 fractions&#xD;
      (49 Gy total) Dose Level III: 3.5 Gy for 16 fractions (56 Gy total) Dose Level VI: 3.5 Gy for&#xD;
      18 fractions (63 Gy total)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive highly conformal radiotherapy starting at Dose Level II. Dose levels&#xD;
      will be escalated by 7 Gy in 2 fractions per level up to 21 Gy in 6 fractions and a total&#xD;
      dose of 63 Gy. Evaluable patients will be defined as any eligible patient that begins&#xD;
      treatment. After 5 evaluable patients have been followed for a minimum of 90 days from the&#xD;
      start of treatment, if there are 0 or 1 DLT, the dose level will be judged to be acceptable.&#xD;
      If this occurs, then patients will begin to be accrued at the next higher dose level. If ≥ 3&#xD;
      of 5 patients have DLT, the preceding dose level will be declared to be the MTD. If 2 of 5&#xD;
      patients have DLT, the addition of 5 more patients to the same level will be done. If ≥ 4 of&#xD;
      10 patients have DLT, the preceding dose level will be declared to be the MTD. If 2 or 3 of&#xD;
      the 10 patients have DLT, patients will begin to be accrued at the next higher dose level. If&#xD;
      there are 3 or more DLT at the starting dose level (Dose Level II), then the dose will be&#xD;
      de-escalated to Dose Level I. If this occurs, then after 5 evaluable patients have been&#xD;
      followed for a minimum of 90 days from the start of treatment at Dose Level I, if there are 0&#xD;
      or 1 DLT, the 3.5 Gy per fraction for a total of 42 Gy will be declared to be the MTD. If at&#xD;
      any time a grade 5 treatment-related adverse event is observed, the study chairs will review&#xD;
      the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of evaluable patients that will be needed depends on the number of times the dose&#xD;
      is escalated or possibly de-escalated. If the escalation continues up through Dose Level IV,&#xD;
      15 evaluable patients will be required. If the dose is de-escalated after Dose Level II, then&#xD;
      10 evaluable patients will be required.&#xD;
