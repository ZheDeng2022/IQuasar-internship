    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is the most common chronic medical condition that affects&#xD;
      Americans between 18-44 years of age. While significant advances have been made in the&#xD;
      understanding of the molecular pathogenesis underlying many subtypes of CRS, this has not&#xD;
      translated into widespread changes in how physicians manage adult or pediatric CRS. The focus&#xD;
      of this study is intended to develop testing methods to improve the objectivity and&#xD;
      specificity of diagnosis and allow for individualized therapy with less invasive, customized&#xD;
      treatments instead of the traditional, empiric based, and radically exenterative therapies&#xD;
      commonly employed in clinical practice. Specifically, it is now known that many patients with&#xD;
      CRS have a greater concentration of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) in the&#xD;
      bacterial biofilms located within their sinus cavities compared to healthy patients. The&#xD;
      specific hypothesis behind the proposed research is that the presence of NTHI biofilms, which&#xD;
      are known to be highly recalcitrant, are positively correlated with the development of CRS&#xD;
      and that unique lipooligosaccharides and inflammatory byproducts obtained from nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      lavage fluids and/or swabs of sinus secretions may be used as a non-invasive biomarker for&#xD;
      CRS. As a result, patients with symptoms of CRS specifically associated with NTHI biofilms&#xD;
      could possibly obtain a non-invasive test in the physician's office that would allow the&#xD;
      clinician to make a more accurate diagnosis and objectively follow each patient's&#xD;
      responsiveness to customized therapy.&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that a high throughput proteomics-based assay of&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal lavage fluids and/or swabs of human sinus drainage material will be able to&#xD;
      identify, with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity, patients with CRS specifically&#xD;
      due to the presence of NTHI biofilms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that a priori assay for increased presence of&#xD;
      phosphorylcholine-rich lipooligosaccharides in nasopharyngeal lavage fluids from chinchillas&#xD;
      co-infected with adenovirus and biofilm forming NTHI will successfully predict, with a high&#xD;
      degree of sensitivity and specificity, the development of CRS in this in vivo model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this project may: enable the design and conduct of a clinical trial to&#xD;
      preoperatively identify patients with CRS earlier in their disease course (possibly prior to&#xD;
      the initiation of long courses of empiric antibiotic therapy); aid in the development of&#xD;
      non-surgical therapies to eradicate bacterial biofilms with the sinus cavities; result in the&#xD;
      identification of an objective biomarker to monitor success with therapies; and ultimately&#xD;
      lead to less morbidity and risk for complications compared to conventional surgical therapy.&#xD;
      In addition, transforming this paradigm would make progress towards achieving the goals of&#xD;
      the U.S. Department Health and Human Services Healthy People 2010 objective 14-19, which is&#xD;
      &quot;reducing the number of courses of antibiotics prescribed for the sole diagnosis of the&#xD;
      common cold.&quot;&#xD;
