  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study hypothesize that radius subjecting to mechanical loading may affect excitability&#xD;
      of alpha motor neuron innervating muscle, based on its bone mineral density. If this&#xD;
      hypothesis is valid, it can be firstly suggested that the relationship between bone mineral&#xD;
      density and muscle strength is bidirectional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 80 voluntaries are planned to include in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After forearm vibration is applied, bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC)&#xD;
      will be measured in all cases. Alpha motor neuron excitability (H/M ratio, recruitment),&#xD;
      background muscle activity will be evaluated by electromyography at pre-treatment,&#xD;
      post-treatment and, during treatment in cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forearm vibration will be applied by forearm vibration device (FAV). FAV with mechanical&#xD;
      loading will apply forearm. Cases will sit on armchair. Two intervals of FAV will be applied&#xD;
      at a frequency of 45 Hz. Each interval will consist of 60 second of FAV followed by rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The right radius BMD and BMC will be evaluated by bone densitometer (GE-LUNAR DPX PRO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor unite potentials at rest, Hoffman reflex, F response, M response will be measured by&#xD;
      electromyography at right flexor carpi radialis. Medtronic Keypoint Portable 2 channel&#xD;
      electromyography and Neurotrac ETS device will be used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is usually reported that there is a parallelism between changes in the bone structure and&#xD;
      function and the muscle structure and function. Sarcopenia is frequently observed in&#xD;
      osteoporotic patients. Bone formation increases or bone resorption decreases with exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the effect of bone on the muscle activity is not investigated. One of the most&#xD;
      important functions of bone bear mechanical loads include body weight. Bone must be strong&#xD;
      enough to resist the mechanical loading. Mechanisms need to protect bone when bone is subject&#xD;
      to excessive mechanical loading. These mechanisms may mainly focus on strengthening the bone&#xD;
      and/or changing vectorial properties of mechanical loading applied bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vectorial properties of mechanical loading applied bone may be controlled by muscle&#xD;
      contractions. Bone contains wide mechanoreceptor net constructed by osteocytes.&#xD;
      So,distribution of the mechanical loading on bone cross-sectional area is possible to&#xD;
      perceive. It may be also possible that inappropriate distribution of mechanical loading on&#xD;
      bone crosssectional area is optimized by muscle contractions. To get this regulation, there&#xD;
      should be a mechanism that muscle activity is controlled by central nervous system based on&#xD;
      mechanical loading distribution on bone cross-sectional area. We previously showed that bone&#xD;
      can regulate muscle activity, based on its bone mineral density. According to this study&#xD;
      result, it can be suggested there may exist a mechanism that bone sensing mechanical stimuli&#xD;
      can send the signals to central nervous system and neuronally regulate muscle activity (bone&#xD;
      myo-regulation reflex). (It is also well known that load-induced adaptive bone formation is&#xD;
      neuronally regulated. Taken together, a general mechanism, bone reflex, may be defined that&#xD;
      bone subjected to loading can neuronally regulate bone formation and muscle activity)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study hypothesize that radius subjecting to mechanical loading may affect excitability&#xD;
      of alpha motor neuron innervating muscle, based on its bone mineral density.&#xD;
