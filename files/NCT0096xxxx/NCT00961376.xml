  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunologic effects of autologous&#xD;
      tumor vaccination administered with human granulocyte-macrophage colony-simulating factor&#xD;
      (hGM-CSF), and subsequent boosting vaccinations in patients made lymphopenic by treatment&#xD;
      with chemotherapy and infused with autologous PBMC (Cohort A) or CD25 depleted PBMC (Cohort&#xD;
      B). Clinical observations and laboratory measurements will be monitored to evaluate safety,&#xD;
      toxicity, immune responses, and anti-tumor effects. Additionally, the effects of treatment on&#xD;
      tumor response will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, outpatient Phase II, prospective, randomized, single-center, clinical&#xD;
      trial. Up to 14 patients with a diagnosis of unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo leukapheresis to collect PBMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive Cyclophosphamide 350 mg/m2 dl-3 and Fludarabine 20 mg/m2 dl-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following chemotherapy to induce lymphopenia, patients will be re-infused with PDMC as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autologous PBMC re-infusion (Cohort A) Autologous, CD25-depleted PBMC re-infusion (Cohort B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following PBMC re-infusion, all patients will receive subcutaneous GM-CSF Infusion (50&#xD;
      micrograms/24 hrs) continuously for 6 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will then receive 4 booster vaccinations as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intradermal injection of autologous tumor cells in the lower abdomen to deliver a total dose&#xD;
      of at least 2x107 cells administered week 3, week 5, week 9 and week 13. Subcutaneous GM-CSF&#xD;
      Infusion (50 micrograms/24 hrs) adjacent to the vaccine site begins at time of vaccination&#xD;
      (week 3, 5, 9 and 13) and continues for 6 days.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant melanoma that&#xD;
             is unresectable stage III or stage IV. Measurable disease is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have failed, refused, or not been eligible to receive at least one&#xD;
             standard therapy regimen for metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Easily harvested metastatic tumor cells e.g., skin or lymph node metastases or a&#xD;
             planned surgery to remove tumor. Patients undergoing resection of a solitary brain&#xD;
             metastasis are eligible if their resected lesion contains an adequate number of tumor&#xD;
             cells. A minimum 2 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm lesion will be required for study eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sufficient viable tumor cells harvested to generate the vaccine. The tumor collected&#xD;
             must contain greater than 1.6 x 108 viable tumor cells or a cell line generated from&#xD;
             autologous tumor must provide greater than 1.6 x 108 viable tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received prior chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. Prior radiation&#xD;
             therapy is acceptable but previously radiated sites may not be used for tumor&#xD;
             collection for vaccine preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than or = 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%; see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function at the time of enrollment as&#xD;
             defined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be seronegative for HIV, Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis C&#xD;
             antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If patients have had recent surgery, they must have recovered from the effects of that&#xD;
             surgery in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or&#xD;
             mitomycin C).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation therapy within 2 weeks. Prior radiation must have been to less 30% of the&#xD;
             bone marrow and patient has recovered from all side effects, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Steroid therapy, other than replacement steroids and inhaled steroids. Patients who&#xD;
             might require systemic corticosteroids other than replacement steroids during the next&#xD;
             three months are not eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases unless treated with radiation therapy and/or&#xD;
             surgery and shown to be stable &gt; 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Autoimmune disease requiring treatment, with the exception of controlled autoimmune&#xD;
             thyroiditis or vitiligo.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women are excluded from this study because fludarabine and&#xD;
             cyclophosphamide have potential teratogenic effects. It is not known whether&#xD;
             fludarabine is excreted in breast milk but the package insert cautions that it might&#xD;
             and recommends against breastfeeding if the mother is treated with fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness which, in the opinion of the investigator, may&#xD;
             increase the risks associated with study participation or interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of the results..&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other medical illness or psychiatric condition/social situations that in the&#xD;
             opinion of the principal investigator would compromise the patients ability to&#xD;
             tolerate this treatment or would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
