  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the relationship of a protein called pAKT to survival of breast&#xD;
      cancer patients with one or more positive axillary lymph nodes. Akt plays a role in cell&#xD;
      survival, tumor formation, and the development of drug resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use tumor tissue obtained from 2,000 patients enrolled in a National Surgical&#xD;
      Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project study that is evaluating whether adding the drug paclitaxel&#xD;
      (Taxol (Registered Trademark)) to a treatment regimen of doxorubicin (Adriamycin (Registered&#xD;
      Trademark)) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan (Registered Trademark)) improves disease-free&#xD;
      survival and overall survival in patients with node-positive breast cancer. The current study&#xD;
      will measure levels of pAkt in the tissues and correlate the results with clinical outcome to&#xD;
      see if pAkt levels are associated with improved patient survival.&#xD;

      Taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) have emerged as the most powerful chemotherapeutics in&#xD;
      breast cancer over the past decades. The B-28 clinical trial from the National Surgical&#xD;
      Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) assesses the efficacy of adding paclitaxel to the&#xD;
      doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide regimen in the treatment of patients with axillary node positive&#xD;
      breast cancer. The primary aim of B-28 is to determine whether four cycles of paclitaxel&#xD;
      (Taxol (Registered Trademark)) (T) following four cycles of postoperative Doxorubicin&#xD;
      (adriamycin (Registered Trademark) (A) and cyclophosphamide (C) will more effectively prolong&#xD;
      disease-free survival (DFS) and survival (S) than four cycles of AC alone in patients with&#xD;
      operable breast cancer who have one or more histologically positive axillary lymph nodes. The&#xD;
      B-28 clinical trial tissue microarray consists of specimens from 2,000 cases enrolled. The&#xD;
      tissue microarray set is an ideal platform for evaluating predictive markers of doxorubicin&#xD;
      and/or paclitaxel response or resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Akt, a serine/threonine protein kinase regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),&#xD;
      is of importance in cell survival, tumorigenesis, and recently shown, chemoresistance. It&#xD;
      confers survival advantage to cells by transducing signals from growth factor receptors that&#xD;
      activate PI3K. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether the levels of&#xD;
      phosphorylated AKT are associated with disease-free and overall survival in patients with&#xD;
      node-positive breast cancer treated with AC and/or AC followed by paclitaxel.&#xD;
