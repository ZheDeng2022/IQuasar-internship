  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose an open label, non-blinded, single center randomized controlled&#xD;
      feasibility study to find the optimal initial HFNC flow rate in children less than 12 months&#xD;
      old with clinically diagnosed moderate to severe bronchiolitis. This feasibility study is&#xD;
      projected to take 6 months over the Winter/Spring of 2020-2021. The study is consisted of 3&#xD;
      arms, comparing HFNC therapy at 1 L/kg/min, 1.5 L/kg/min, and 2 L/kg/min (20 L/min max).&#xD;
      Moderate to severe bronchiolitis is defined by RDAI of 6 or more.15&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is treatment response to HFNC therapy defined by RDAI/Respiratory&#xD;
      Assessment Change Score (RACS) ≥ 4 at 4 hours of therapy. Secondary outcome measures comprise&#xD;
      of treatment failure requiring an escalation of care during the first 24 hours of HFNC&#xD;
      therapy, duration of HFNC and simple nasal cannula therapy, duration of simple nasal cannula&#xD;
      therapy, hospital and PICU length of stay (LOS), time to treatment failure, and adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is treatment response to HFNC therapy defined by Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument (RDAI)/Respiratory Assessment Change Score (RACS) ≥ 4. RDAI and RACS are scoring tools used to measure bronchiolitis severity and assess treatment response in clinical trials. The RDAI score (0-17) assigns a score based on RR and the extent of wheezing and retractions. A higher score is associated with more severe bronchiolitis. RACS was developed along with RDAI to assess the change from one point in time to another.</description>

    <description>The infant that is randomized to the HFNC therapy arm 1 will be placed on high flow at 1 L/kg/min (up to a maximum of 20 L/min) on fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 21 %. They will remain on FiO2 of 21% for a minimum of 10 minutes while monitoring SpO2. If SpO2 is &lt;90%, FiO2 will be slowly increased to maintain SpO2 ≥ 90 %, with maximum FiO2 of 50%. If FiO2 requirement exceeds 50%, the patient will be excluded from the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients less than 12 months of age with: (1) clinical signs of bronchiolitis defined&#xD;
             by AAP and (2) respiratory distress defined by RDAI score 6 or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infants who required immediate need for respiratory support such as non-invasive&#xD;
             positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or invasive ventilation, or with congenital&#xD;
             heart disease, immunocompromise, upper airway obstruction, chronic lung disease,&#xD;
             bronchopulmonary dysplasia, infants on home oxygen therapy basilar skull fracture,&#xD;
             facial traumas, craniofacial malformations, and infants admitted to the neonatal or&#xD;
             cardiac ICUs. Patients who have received bronchodilator or steroid treatments are not&#xD;
             excluded as previous studies have not shown these treatments to be effective in&#xD;
             bronchiolitis management.&#xD;
