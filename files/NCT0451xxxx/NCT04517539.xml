  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)&#xD;
      combined with recombined human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor(rhGM-CSF) and&#xD;
      Peginterferon alfa-2b is safe, effective in the treatment of patients with metastatic thymic&#xD;
      epithelial tumors.&#xD;

    <description>Metastasis lesion will be treated with a SBRT of 30Gy/5F from day 1 to day 5 . Injection of Immunological Agenthuman recombined granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (125ug/m² per day) will be executed from day 1 to day 14 in this cycle.Subcutaneous injection of Peginterferon alfa-b2(90ug) will be executed in day8. Another metastasis lesion will be treated likewise concurrently with rhGM-CSF in a consecutive cycle. Injection of Peginterferon alfa-b2(90ug) will be executed in day8 of this cycle.</description>

If there are two measurable lesions totally, One lesion received radiotherapy for 30 Gy in 5 fractions and rested for one week; If there are three measurable lesions totally, two lesion received radiotherapy for 30 Gy in 5 fractions separately.&#xD;
drug: Patients were injected subcutaneously rhGM-CSF 125mg/m2 per day from day1 to day 14, every three weeks, concurrent with radiotherapy. Peginterferon alfa-b2 90 ug in d8 in each cycle.&#xD;
And the 1 month after the end of all radiotherapy courses, 4 weeks as a course of treatment, once per course of treatment, each dose is 90μg until desease progress.</description>
