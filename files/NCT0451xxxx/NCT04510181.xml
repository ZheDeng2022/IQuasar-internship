  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of the amino acid-based blend on growth&#xD;
      hormone levels (measured by IGF-1) and clinical symptoms in individuals with&#xD;
      treatment-resistant FM and low-normal hGH.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low hGH levels have been observed in approximately 1/3 of individuals with FM. Low hGH levels&#xD;
      are hypothesized to contribute to inadequate treatment outcomes in many individuals with FM&#xD;
      and several studies have demonstrated symptom improvement in individuals with FM and low hGH&#xD;
      who received rhGH therapy. The amino acid-based blend represents a novel mechanism for&#xD;
      increasing endogenous hGH production. It has been shown to produce an increase in endogenous&#xD;
      hGH levels in healthy individuals by attenuating the inhibitory effect of somatostatin on hGH&#xD;
      release. The amino acid-based blend may be a safe and effective treatment for FM in&#xD;
      individuals with poorly controlled FM and low-normal hGH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the effect of taking the amino acid blend on IGF-1 levels (a&#xD;
      surrogate marker of the body's growth hormone levels), fibromyalgia symptoms, stress&#xD;
      symptoms, body weight, and other cardiometabolic biomarkers in individuals with&#xD;
      treatment-resistant FM and low-normal hGH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all eligible participants giving&#xD;
      written informed consent will administer the amino acid-based blend daily. Standard care for&#xD;
      fibromyalgia will continue.&#xD;
