      Many people seek psychotherapy to alleviate symptoms related to trauma and stressful&#xD;
      conflicts, and many psychotherapy approaches aim to help people process trauma and conflicts&#xD;
      through eliciting client disclosure of these experiences and activating related emotions.&#xD;
      However, many therapists avoid implementing such approaches because they are emotionally&#xD;
      challenging for both the client and the therapist, and because therapists lack direct&#xD;
      training in specific skills related to eliciting client disclosure and working with emotions.&#xD;
      This suggests that providing therapists with a training experience that is experiential,&#xD;
      includes direct supervision and feedback, and addresses therapists' reservations and&#xD;
      anxieties may be an important approach to increase therapist skills in disclosure elicitation&#xD;
      and emotional activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized trial that will test two methods of training (experiential vs. standard)&#xD;
      of master's level psychotherapy students in specific therapeutic skills aimed at increasing&#xD;
      trainees' emotional awareness and self-regulation and reducing trainee anxiety and avoidance&#xD;
      of eliciting disclosure and working with emotions in psychotherapy. In the standard training&#xD;
      condition, the trainee will receive a lecture about the skills including rationale and&#xD;
      research background, examples, and opportunities to ask questions. In the experiential&#xD;
      training condition, the trainees will receive information about the skills with examples and&#xD;
      will have opportunity to practice using short video clips of actors portraying clients. The&#xD;
      trainees will be asked to respond to the short clips using the skills they learned, and a&#xD;
      trainer will process the trainees' reactions after they respond to each practice video clip&#xD;
      and will provide feedback to the trainees about their performance on the practice. Findings&#xD;
      from this study will provide information about the feasibility of training in specific&#xD;
      disclosure elicitation and emotional activation therapy skills, and will provide information&#xD;
      about whether or not live supervision will lead to greater improvement in the targeted skills&#xD;
      compared to entirely standard training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Experiences of trauma and stressful conflicts are common, with most adults in the United&#xD;
      States reporting experiences of at least one traumatic event in their lifetimes. Experiences&#xD;
      of stressful events vary, and may include war-related trauma, physical, emotional, and sexual&#xD;
      abuse, witnessing violence or substance use in the household, and emotional and physical&#xD;
      neglect. Exposure to traumatic and stressful events has been linked to adverse physical and&#xD;
      psychological health outcomes, impaired functioning, and substantial reductions in quality of&#xD;
      life. In addition to trauma exposure, many individuals experience interpersonal and&#xD;
      intrapersonal conflicts such as experiences of social rejection, struggles with intimacy or&#xD;
      autonomy in relationships, shameful secrets, and perfectionism. Such conflicts are also&#xD;
      associated with poor psychological and physical health outcomes. Experiences of trauma and&#xD;
      stressful conflicts often underlie many psychological problems that lead individuals to seek&#xD;
      psychotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many psychotherapy approaches aim to help people disclose and process difficult experiences&#xD;
      and activate and experience their emotions, and research suggests that such psychotherapies&#xD;
      improve psychological and physical health. For example, written emotional disclosure (or&#xD;
      expressive writing) is a therapeutic approach in which a person is asked to write repeatedly&#xD;
      about private stressful experiences and avoided emotions. Another psychotherapy approach,&#xD;
      Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE), is designed to help clients approach feared and avoided&#xD;
      trauma-related material including memories, thoughts, emotions, and real-life situations.&#xD;
      Short-Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (STPP) is an approach that helps clients acknowledge&#xD;
      and engage with avoided emotions and psychological conflicts and express blocked emotions.&#xD;
      One variant of STPP has been used to specifically treat affect phobia, a phobia of&#xD;
      experiencing or expressing certain emotions. Emotional Awareness and Expression Therapy&#xD;
      (EAET) borrows from STPP, exposure therapy, expressive writing, and other emotion-focused&#xD;
      approaches and aims to help people disclose stressful experiences and emotional conflicts and&#xD;
      experience and express their emotions related to stressful situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aforementioned psychotherapy approaches have shown benefits for a range of populations&#xD;
      and psychological and physical health outcomes; however, this therapeutic work can be&#xD;
      challenging, and therapists may often avoid implementing such approaches and skills.&#xD;
      Eliciting client disclosure and emotional activation can be especially challenging for novel&#xD;
      therapists who may avoid directly inquiring about clients' traumas and conflicts and may&#xD;
      experience difficulty tuning into and working with clients' emotions. These barriers are&#xD;
      often observed in the implementation of exposure-based approaches, which are underutilized in&#xD;
      day-to-day clinical practice. Barriers to therapist implementation of exposure-based&#xD;
      techniques include lack of adequate training, the belief that exposure is likely to lead to&#xD;
      an increase in symptoms or problems in therapy, and lack confidence in one's ability to&#xD;
      handle a range of client emotional reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive training experiences are needed to address therapist-centric barriers to&#xD;
      utilization of disclosure elicitation and emotional activation skills and to increase&#xD;
      therapist self-efficacy related to such skills. Research suggests that entirely didactic&#xD;
      training methods, such as reading manuals or watching lectures and training videos, are&#xD;
      insufficient to lead to therapist behavior change. Several studies have highlighted the&#xD;
      importance of supervision and supervisor feedback in increasing therapist knowledge,&#xD;
      proficiency, and retention of therapeutic skills. Additionally, some researchers have&#xD;
      highlighted the importance of key components of skill acquisition, such as repetitive or&#xD;
      deliberate practice of specific skills through role plays and simulations, personalized&#xD;
      performance feedback, and experiential/reflective training approaches. Therapist&#xD;
      self-reflection and self-regulation practices have also been highlighted as an important&#xD;
      component of skill training, as such practices can help therapists tune into and regulate&#xD;
      their own in-session reactions and emotions. Several studies have also aimed to address,&#xD;
      through training, therapists' anxiety, affect phobia (fear of intense emotional experiences),&#xD;
      and the desire to avoid emotionally challenging therapeutic moments. These studies have&#xD;
      highlighted the importance of increasing trainees' emotional awareness, helping trainees&#xD;
      manage their reactions to client disclosure and emotional expression, and targeting and&#xD;
      challenging clinician anxieties and concerns during psychotherapy skill training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, research suggests that efforts to improve therapist utilization of disclosure&#xD;
      elicitation and emotional activation skills must not only provide &quot;how to&quot; training, but also&#xD;
      directly address therapists' reservations, fears, and concerns related to disclosure and&#xD;
      emotions. This suggests that providing therapists with a training experience that is&#xD;
      experiential, includes practice, direct supervision and feedback, and addresses therapists'&#xD;
      reservations and anxieties may be an important approach to increase therapist skills in&#xD;
      disclosure elicitation and emotional activation. The current study aims to test the effects&#xD;
      of an experiential, supervised training approach on therapy trainees' disclosure elicitation&#xD;
      and emotional activation skills, and trainees' self-efficacy and affect phobia (fear of&#xD;
      emotions), compared to a standard, didactic training approach. It is hypothesized that the&#xD;
      experiential training condition will result in greater improvement in performance of the&#xD;
      targeted skills and in higher participant ratings of satisfaction with the training compared&#xD;
      to the standard training condition. It is also hypothesized that the experiential training&#xD;
      condition will result in a greater increase in trainees' self-efficacy and greater decrease&#xD;
      in trainees' affect phobia compared to the standard training condition.&#xD;
