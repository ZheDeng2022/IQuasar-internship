    <textblock>
      The acute subjective effects of serotonin (5-HT)2A receptor stimulation with lysergic acid&#xD;
      diethylamide (LSD) in humans are mostly positive. However, negative effects such as anxiety,&#xD;
      paranoid thinking or loss of trust towards other people are common effects, depending on the&#xD;
      dose administered, the personality traits of the person consuming it (set), or the&#xD;
      environment in which LSD is taken (setting). Negative psychedelic effects may cause acute&#xD;
      distress to the subject and acute anxiety has been linked to less favourable long-term&#xD;
      outcomes in patients experimentally treated with LSD or similar substances for the treatment&#xD;
      of depression. The 5-HT and oxytocin releaser 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)&#xD;
      reliably induces positive mood up to euphoria, comfort, empathy, and feelings of trust. If&#xD;
      administered in combination with LSD, MDMA may increase positive subjective drug effects&#xD;
      including positive mood, empathy, and trust and reduce negative emotions and anxiety&#xD;
      associated with LSD and overall produce a more positive over negative experience. The present&#xD;
      study will assess subjective and autonomic effects of LSD alone and in combination with MDMA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LSD is a so-called &quot;classic&quot; or serotonergic hallucinogen or psychedelic. Its psychedelic&#xD;
      effects are mainly attributed to its potent partial serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT2A receptor agonism.&#xD;
      The effects of LSD have been frequently investigated in the past in both healthy participants&#xD;
      and patients. Several of these studies described robust and sustained effects of LSD in&#xD;
      patients suffering from addiction, anxiety and depression. The acute subjective effects&#xD;
      elicited by LSD are mostly positive in humans. However, psychedelic substances like LSD may&#xD;
      also cause unpleasant subjective effects like negative thoughts, rumination, anxiety, panic,&#xD;
      paranoia, loss of trust towards other people and perceived loss of control, depending on the&#xD;
      dose of LSD used, the personality traits of the person consuming it (i.e. 'set'), the&#xD;
      environment in which it is consumed (i.e. 'setting'), and other factors yet to be determined.&#xD;
      Acute negative psychological effects are considered the main risk of psychedelic substance&#xD;
      use in humans. Inducing an overall positive acute response to the psychedelic is critical&#xD;
      because several studies showed that a more positive experience is predictive of a greater&#xD;
      therapeutic long-term effect of the psychedelic. Therefore, there is a need for methods which&#xD;
      are capable of reducing bad drug effects while enhancing good drug effects to optimize a&#xD;
      psychedelic experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study uses 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as a pharmacological tool to&#xD;
      optimize LSD's effects profile by inducing positive mood. MDMA is an amphetamine derivative&#xD;
      which, unlike prototypical amphetamines, predominantly enhances serotonergic&#xD;
      neurotransmission via release of 5-HT through the serotonin transporter (SERT). Furthermore,&#xD;
      MDMA is known to trigger oxytocin release which may contribute to its effects to increase&#xD;
      trust, prosociality, and enhanced empathy. The state of well-being induced by MDMA including&#xD;
      increased activation and emotional excitation is known to be associated with a better&#xD;
      response to psychedelics. Due to its psychological profile, MDMA could be a reliable&#xD;
      pharmacological tool to serve as an optimizer of a psychedelic experience by inducing&#xD;
      positive emotions.&#xD;
