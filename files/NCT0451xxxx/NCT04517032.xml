      Observational study to assess barriers for colorectal cancer treatment compliance in India,&#xD;
      including quantitative assessment of catastrophic expenditure incidence and qualitative&#xD;
      assessment of financial and non-financial barriers.&#xD;

      Objective: To identify a vulnerable group of colorectal cancer patients in India who cannot&#xD;
      afford or are unable to comply with a treatment plan for colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify the proportion of CRC patients suffering catastrophic expenditure due to&#xD;
           out-of-pocket payments for cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the proportion of patients who are unable to comply with the treatment plan&#xD;
           for CRC, at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify barriers and solutions to CRC treatment compliance. Design: A mixed-methods&#xD;
           study comprising quantitative pilot data from 3 tertiary cancer centres and qualitative&#xD;
           work from interviews with patients and healthcare professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Patients diagnosed with primary colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Incidence of catastrophic expenditure due to out-of-pocket payments for cancer care at 3&#xD;
      timepoints: 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after CRC diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compliance to the initial treatment plan at three timepoints: 6 weeks, 3 months and 6&#xD;
           months after CRC diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients and healthcare professionals perspectives on patient compliance to CRC&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the 5 main drivers (items charged to the patient) of CRC treatment cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colorectal cancer stage at the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
