  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Skin tears (ST) or &quot;laceration injuries&quot; or &quot;flap wounds&quot; are injuries that are&#xD;
      often found in residents of residential care facilities (RCFs). STs were first defined by&#xD;
      Payne and Martin in 1993 as traumatic wounds, located mainly in the upper limbs, caused by&#xD;
      &quot;shearing, friction or mechanisms combined with the consequent separation of layers of skin.&#xD;
      Skin Tears can cause psychological problems for the patient and represent an economic problem&#xD;
      with important repercussions on both the patient and the community. The etiology suggests&#xD;
      that the physiological changes of the skin related to old age, together with comorbidity, are&#xD;
      among the main risk factors for their onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The precise data on the phenomenon are not many, but it is estimated that STs are much more&#xD;
      frequent than the same pressure ulcers, observing prevalence rates in RCFs around 40%&#xD;
      Therefore, there are several risk factors hypothesized so far. Much evidence has correlated,&#xD;
      in various physiological or pathological conditions, the role of estrogens with the functions&#xD;
      and aging of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The project will develop on the analysis of populations of residents from RCFs&#xD;
      belonging to the national territory. Two populations of residents cared in the RCF will be&#xD;
      recruited. A group of subjects suffering from skin tears (group A) and a control group of&#xD;
      subjects without skin tears (group B). The inclusion of patients in both groups will take&#xD;
      place through a simple randomization procedure. Group A patients will be staged according to&#xD;
      the STAR classification for skin tears. For each group a peripheral venous blood sample will&#xD;
      be taken (to measure the levels of estrone and estradiol) and a skin biopsy will be performed&#xD;
      in order to measure estrogen receptors (ERs) expression. A data collection sheet with&#xD;
      angraphic and anamnestic data will be developed to correlate the demographic and comorbidity&#xD;
      data with the clinical conditions of the patients and with the laboratory findings from the&#xD;
      sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The primary endpoint will be the correlation between serum estrogen levels,&#xD;
      receptor expression and the presence of skin tears. The secondary endopoint will be&#xD;
      Correlation between receptor structure and clinical staging of skin tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future prospectives: We believe that our study may open new frontiers in the prevention and&#xD;
      in the management of these skin lesions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND Skin tears were firstly defined by Payne RL and Martin ML, and thereafter by more&#xD;
      recent studies, as traumatic wounds occurring principally on the upper limbs, as a result of&#xD;
      friction alone or shearing and friction forces, which separate the epidermis from the dermis&#xD;
      (partial thickness wounds) or which separate both the epidermis and the dermis from&#xD;
      underlying structures (full thickness wounds). Skin tears are reported to be a common wound&#xD;
      especially on fragile exposed skin, which can be often encountered among older adult,&#xD;
      disabled populations and neonates. Skin tears can be found on all areas of the body and are&#xD;
      particularly common on the extremities. Skin tears may be also very common in public hospital&#xD;
      (PH) inpatients and residents of residential care facilities (RCF) with prevalence up to 41%&#xD;
      in these settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin Tears can cause psychological problems for the patient and represent an economic problem&#xD;
      with important effects on both the patient and the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk factors hitherto hypothesized are many and include: advanced age, spasticity or&#xD;
      rigidity, enticement, cognitive decline, long-term drug therapies, inadequate nutritional&#xD;
      intake, etc but none of them, individually and independently, was found to be strongly&#xD;
      correlated onset of skin tears, in such a way as to be able to effectively associate it with&#xD;
      their onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many evidences have correlated, in various physiological or pathological conditions, the role&#xD;
      of estrogens with functions and skin aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The serum level of estrogens, and in particular estrone and estradiol, and the peripheral&#xD;
      expression, in the tissues, of the related estrogenic receptors, estrogen α receptors,&#xD;
      estrogen β receptors (ER- α, ER-β) and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER) may be&#xD;
      related to skin tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM The aim of the project is to study the correlation between serum estrogen levels and the&#xD;
      expression of the related receptors, with the development of skin tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY The project will develop on the analysis of populations of residents coming from&#xD;
      ACF belonging to the national territory between a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 30. Each RCF&#xD;
      will have to provide a number of subjects between 10 and 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total patient sample will therefore be between a minimum of 100 and a maximum of 1200&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, two populations of guests assisted in the RCF will be recruited. A group of&#xD;
      subjects affected by skin tears (group A) and a control group of subjects without skin tears&#xD;
      (group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included in both groups via a simple randomization procedure. The informed&#xD;
      consent of the patient is required. A group of peripheral venous blood will be made to both&#xD;
      groups to measure the levels of estrone and estradiol and a skin biopsy on the intact skin&#xD;
      area near the lesion in group A and on a thin layer of healthy skin (Shave Biopsy) in the&#xD;
      area of the arm in the control group (group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint will be the correlation between serum&#xD;
      estrogen levels, receptor expression and skin tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint. Correlation between receptorial structure and clinical staging of skin&#xD;
      tears.&#xD;
