  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      110 individuals with stage 4-5 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) will be randomized to 1-year of&#xD;
      blinded Evolocumab or placebo. Subjects will undergo evaluation of circulating lipids at&#xD;
      baseline and end of study. A substudy including 50 subjects will assess myocardial rest and&#xD;
      stress positron emission tomography (PET) at baseline and at 1-year.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of evolocumab (Repatha®)-a Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA)-approved biological drug that has been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol&#xD;
      (bad cholesterol) Early data show that the beneftis of evolocumab may be increased as kidney&#xD;
      function declines. This trial is therefore designed to provide additional evidence regarding&#xD;
      the safety and cholesterol-lowering effects of evolocumab compared with placebo, a pill that&#xD;
      has no therapeutic effect, in advanced CKD patients.&#xD;
