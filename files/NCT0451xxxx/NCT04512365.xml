  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying the rewarding,&#xD;
      reinforcing properties of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive&#xD;
      ingredient in cannabis, among healthy young adults.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Half of the participants will receive placebo during the first laboratory visit and THC during the second laboratory visit.

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>THC or placebo will be prescribed to participants by a licensed psychiatrist, and dispensed by the University of Illinois at Chicago's Investigational Drug Service (IDS). Staff at the Clinical Research Center will give the drug or placebo to participants with the PI or a physician designate, present on-site and/or available by pager.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neural reward response- Reward Positivity (RewP) event-related potential</measure>
    <time_frame>First and second laboratory visits, around 90 minutes to 2 hours after drug administration. Outcome measure is change from placebo session RewP to THC session RewP.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the Doors task during electroencephalogram (EEG) capturing the RewP, with higher values indicating greater neural response to reward</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neural reward response- blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response</measure>
    <time_frame>First and second laboratory visits, around 90 minutes to 2 hours after drug administration. Outcome measure is change from placebo session BOLD response to THC session BOLD response.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the Doors task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) capturing BOLD response, with higher values indicating greater BOLD activation to reward</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective drug response- Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI)- Morphine Benzedrine Group (MBG) subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>First and second laboratory visit, at baseline (Time 0) and at peak drug response (90-120 minutes) after drug administration. Outcome measure is change in peak score during placebo (peak minus baseline) compared to change in peak score during THC</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the ARCI-MBG self-report scale, with higher values reflecting more drug-induced euphoria</description>
