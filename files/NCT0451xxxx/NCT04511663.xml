  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assertive community treatment (ACT) is a community-based, patient-centered, and&#xD;
      rehabilitation-oriented model based on multidisciplinary service teams. It has been proved to&#xD;
      be suitable for the management of patients with severe mental disorder in the community. In&#xD;
      this study, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of ACT in an urban district of Shanghai&#xD;
      with a larger sample size and a 24-month duration of follow up. We hypothesized that patients&#xD;
      assigned into ACT would show better improvement in psychiatric symptoms and social function.&#xD;

      Assertive community treatment (ACT) is a community-based, patient-centered, and&#xD;
      rehabilitation-oriented model based on multidisciplinary service teams. It has been proved to&#xD;
      be suitable for the management of patients with severe mental disorder in the community. In&#xD;
      this study, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of ACT in an urban district of Shanghai&#xD;
      with a larger sample size and a 24-month duration of follow up. We hypothesized that patients&#xD;
      assigned into ACT would show better improvement in psychiatric symptoms and social&#xD;
      function.The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board in Shanghai Mental&#xD;
      Health Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study: 1.1 To explore the effectiveness of assertive community treatment in&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia. 1.2 The patients were followed up for 24 months to explore the&#xD;
      duration of ACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction of the study: Patients who previously diagnosed as schizophrenia according to&#xD;
      International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) in the psychiatric hospitals&#xD;
      would receive basic public health service in the community. The selected schizophrenic&#xD;
      patients were randomly assigned into intervention group and control group by a computer&#xD;
      randomization algorithm. During the following 2 years, the control group received basic&#xD;
      public health services in the community while the intervention group received ACT. Clinical&#xD;
      assessments were conducted at baseline and every 6 months till the end of the 2-year study. A&#xD;
      single-blind method was used, in which all the assessments were independently completed by&#xD;
      trained psychiatrists who didn't know the grouping.The Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale&#xD;
      (PANSS) and the Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) were measured at baseline and&#xD;
      every 6 months during the study.&#xD;

    <description>PANSS（Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale） is a relatively mature assessment tool commonly used in clinical research to assess the severity of schizophrenia symptoms. It consists of a positive symptom subscale (7 items), a negative symptom subscale (7 items) and a general psychopathological symptom subscale (16 items), a total of 30 items.Each item has specific definitions and operational grading criteria. It is divided into 7 grades according to the level of psychopathology (1~7 points). The higher the score, the heavier the symptoms. The total score of PANSS is 30- 210 points, the positive symptom subscale and the negative symptom subscale are 7-49 points, and the general psychopathological symptoms subscale is 16 to 112 points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PSP</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PSP (The Personal and Social Performance Scale) uses a 100-point rating scale to assesses social functioning. A score of 71-100 indicates mild difficulties in social functioning; 31-70 indicates varying degrees of impairment and disability; and 0-30 indicates poor functioning that requires intensive support or supervision. Chinese version of the PSP demonstrated good psychometric characteristics</description>
