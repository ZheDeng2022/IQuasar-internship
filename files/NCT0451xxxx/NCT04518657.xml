  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose a highly-informed, well-designed randomized controlled trial (RCT) that is&#xD;
      critical for providing Class I evidence regarding an Internet-delivered physical activity&#xD;
      (PA) intervention as a behavioral approach for managing slowed cognitive processing speed&#xD;
      (CPS; the most common and perhaps most burdensome MS-related cognitive impairment) and its&#xD;
      second learning and memory, symptomatic, and quality of life (QOL) correlates among&#xD;
      fully-ambulatory persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) who present with CPS impairment. Such&#xD;
      an approach will involve a single-blind, RCT that examines the effects of a&#xD;
      remotely-delivered, Internet-based PA intervention compared with an active control condition&#xD;
      for yielding immediate and sustained improvements in CPS, learning and memory, symptomatic,&#xD;
      and QOL outcomes among persons with mild MS-related ambulatory impairment who demonstrate&#xD;
      impaired CPS. The primary outcome is the raw (unadjusted), oral Symbol Digit Modalities Test&#xD;
      (SDMT) score as a neuropsychological measure of CPS, and this will be collected remotely via&#xD;
      screen-sharing technology. The secondary outcomes include an objective neuropsychological&#xD;
      measure of learning and memory (California Verbal Learning Test-II) collected remotely via&#xD;
      screen-sharing technology, self-report measures of fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale),&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), pain (Short-Form,&#xD;
      McGill Pain Questionnaire) and QOL (Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29) that will be captured&#xD;
      remotely using Qualtrics. The tertiary outcome is accelerometry as an objective, device-based&#xD;
      measure of steps/day that will be delivered and returned via pre-paid, pre-addressed&#xD;
      envelopes through the United States Postal Service for generating a minimal clinically&#xD;
      important difference value that guides the prescription of free-living PA for managing CPS&#xD;
      impairment in clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is prevalent, disabling, and poorly-managed among the 1 million&#xD;
      Americans living with multiple sclerosis (MS). Indeed, 67% of adults with MS have cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, particularly slowed cognitive processing speed (CPS), and this is associated with&#xD;
      impaired learning and memory and worse fatigue, depression, anxiety, pain, and quality of&#xD;
      life (QOL). This underscores the importance of identifying efficacious approaches for&#xD;
      managing CPS impairment and its consequences among those with MS. There is merit in a&#xD;
      remotely-delivered physical activity (PA) intervention for managing MS-related CPS&#xD;
      dysfunction in MS. We have provided evidence from a pilot, randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      that an Internet-delivered PA intervention resulted in a clinically meaningful improvement in&#xD;
      CPS among those with mild MS-related ambulatory disability; there were additional&#xD;
      improvements in fatigue, depression, anxiety, pain, and QOL. The pilot RCT did not a priori&#xD;
      recruit persons with MS who had objective CPS impairment nor examine sustainability of CPS&#xD;
      changes over time, and it involved a waitlist control that did not account for the effects of&#xD;
      attention and social contact. We leverage our experiences and preliminary results, and&#xD;
      propose an appropriately-powered, Phase-II, RCT of a highly-developed and refined&#xD;
      Internet-delivered PA intervention focusing on walking during ambulatory activities of daily&#xD;
      living (steps/day) for yielding immediate and sustained improvements in remotely-assessed CPS&#xD;
      among persons with mild MS-related ambulatory disability who demonstrate impaired CPS. The&#xD;
      proposed study, if successful, will provide Class I evidence regarding the efficacy of a&#xD;
      6-month, Internet-delivered, PA intervention compared with an active control condition for&#xD;
      improving important outcomes in 300 adults with MS who present with both mild MS ambulatory&#xD;
      disability and impaired CPS. The primary outcome is the remotely-delivered Symbol Digit&#xD;
      Modalities Test as a measure of CPS; the secondary outcomes include a remotely-delivered,&#xD;
      objective measure of learning and memory and self-reports of fatigue, depression, anxiety,&#xD;
      pain, and QOL; the tertiary outcome is accelerometry as an objective, device-based measure of&#xD;
      PA. The conditions will be delivered by persons who are uninvolved in screening, recruitment,&#xD;
      random assignment, and outcome assessment. We will collect outcomes on 3 occasions over a&#xD;
      12-month period (i.e., pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up). The outcomes will be collected using a blinded assessor. Data analyses will&#xD;
      involve intent-to-treat principles, and mixed-effects models and logistic regression. The&#xD;
      proposed research may yield &quot;real-world&quot; guidelines for free-living PA change that can be&#xD;
      implemented for the treatment of CPS impairment in MS. Such an opportunity for rehabilitation&#xD;
      of cognitive function using an approach with broad reach and scalability is paramount&#xD;
      considering the prevalent, disabling, and poorly-managed nature of CPS impairment in MS and&#xD;
      limited resources for its treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The current behavioral intervention consists of two primary components; an internet website and oneonone video chats with a behavioral coach.The internet website involves content delivered through interactive video courses.The interactive video courses are based on elements of social cognitive theory.Each course consists of an introduction,the primary content,and a take home message.The interactive courses include embedded,supplementary options such as videos on content and worksheets related to the topic.A pedometer is provided for tracking steps,and these steps will be entered into the website so progress can be monitored.The chats support adherence to the intervention,discussion of website material,supportive accountability,and reporting of adverse events/injuries.The chats are conducted facetoface through an online videoconferencing platform.The chats occur 7 times during the first 2 months,4 times during the second 2 months,and twice during the final 2 months of the intervention.</description>
