  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates how stereotactic radiosurgery affects brain functions while&#xD;
      treating patients with small cell lung cancer that has spread to the brain (brain&#xD;
      metastasis). Standard of care treatment consists of whole brain radiation therapy, which&#xD;
      targets the entire brain, and may result in side effects affecting the nervous system.&#xD;
      Stereotactic radiosurgery only targets areas of the brain that are suspected to be affected&#xD;
      by the disease. The purpose of this trial is to learn if and how patients' brain functions&#xD;
      are affected by the use of stereotactic radiosurgery rather than whole brain radiation&#xD;
      therapy in managing brain metastasis caused by small cell lung cancer. Stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery may help patients avoid nervous system side effects caused by whole brain&#xD;
      radiation therapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the cognitive decline rate at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine cognitive decline rate on each individual cognitive test at each time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine cognitive decline rates using reliable change index methodology. III. To&#xD;
      report the overall survival of patients (death due to any cause) of patients receiving&#xD;
      stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To report rates of local tumor control (of the treated lesions) in the brain&#xD;
      post-treatment, as dictated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance schedule above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To report distant tumor control in the brain (of non-treated lesions) post-treatment, as&#xD;
      dictated by MRI surveillance schedule above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To report time elapsed from SRS to whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). VII. To report&#xD;
      rate of intracranial toxicity of SRS in the setting of prior WBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To report rates of intracranial toxicity of concurrent atezolizumab with SRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To determine rates of systemic and intracranial disease control (time to progression) in&#xD;
      those who are treated concurrently with atezolizumab and SRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. To determine the rates of SCLC-specific survival. XI. To assess the pre-treatment factors&#xD;
      and baseline characteristics in the predictive determination of local control, intracranial&#xD;
      control, systemic control, and neurocognitive outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XII. To assess the correlation between number of lesions and total volume of intracranial&#xD;
      disease and neurocognitive outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XIII. To document post-treatment intracranial toxicity profile in patients after SRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo SRS in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      whose disease progresses may be treated with additional courses of SRS per physician&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24,&#xD;
      30, and 36 months after SRS.&#xD;
