    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of two different airtime incentive timings on interactive&#xD;
      voice response (IVR) survey cooperation, response, refusal and contact rates, as compared to&#xD;
      a control group, in Bangladesh and Uganda.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using random digit dialing sampling techniques, the study randomized RDD participants to one&#xD;
      of three airtime incentive timings, some of all of that incentive being contingent on their&#xD;
      completing the noncommunicable disease risk factor survey. This mobile phone survey was sent&#xD;
      as an interactive voice response (IVR). In IVR surveys, participants use their touch tone key&#xD;
      pad to answer pre-recorded questions. (i.e. If you are male, press 1; if you are female,&#xD;
      press 2). This study was conducted in both Bangladesh and Uganda.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants were randomized to one of three airtime incentive timings: 1) no incentive; 2) 0.1X incentive received before the IVR noncommunicable disease risk factor survey is sent, followed by 1X incentive upon completing the survey; or 3) 1X incentive received upon completing the survey.</intervention_model_description>
