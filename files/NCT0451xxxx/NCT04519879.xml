  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well white button mushroom supplement works in reducing&#xD;
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in patients with prostate cancer that has come back&#xD;
      (recurrent) or has favorable risk and has not undergone any therapy (therapy naive). PSA is a&#xD;
      blood marker of prostate growth. White button mushroom supplement may affect PSA level,&#xD;
      various parameters of immune system and levels of hormones that may have a role in prostate&#xD;
      cancer growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the proportion of patients with any prostate specific antigen (PSA) reduction at&#xD;
      12 weeks (~3 months) in observation + white button mushroom (WBM) supplement arm and&#xD;
      observation only arm (control arm). (Cohort 1) II. To assess relative change in PSA at 48&#xD;
      weeks (~12 months) from baseline with or without WBM treatment. (Cohort 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate, adverse events, PSA-response rate and time to PSA progression. (Cohort 1) II.&#xD;
      To evaluate adverse events, time to initiation of additional therapy and progression. (Cohort&#xD;
      2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the immunomodulatory effects of WBM supplement in serial blood samples.&#xD;
      (Cohort 1) II. To assess the effect of therapy with WBM on sexual function. (Cohort 1) III.&#xD;
      To assess the effect of WBM on Gleason grade in prostate cancer subjects on active&#xD;
      surveillance. (Cohort 2) IV. To characterize the immunomodulatory effects of WBM supplement&#xD;
      in serial blood samples and in tumor tissue. (Cohort 2) V. To characterize changes in cancer&#xD;
      signaling pathways in tumor tissue after intake of WBM supplement. (Cohort 2) VI. To assess&#xD;
      the effect of WBM supplement on sexual function. (Cohort 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Biochemically recurrent prostate cancer patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM IA: Patients receive white button mushroom extract orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on day&#xD;
      1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for cycles 1-3 then every 12 weeks for cycles 4-6 (36&#xD;
      weeks) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM IB: Patients undergo clinical observation for 12 weeks. If PSA continues to increase,&#xD;
      patients have the option to receive the white button mushroom extract as in arm IA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Therapy naive favorable risk prostate cancer patients are randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM IIA: Patients receive white mushroom extract PO BID on day 1. Treatment repeats every 12&#xD;
      weeks for 4 cycles (48 weeks) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM IIB: Patients undergo active surveillance for 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;
