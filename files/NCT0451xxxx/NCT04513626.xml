  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the maintenance of HIV viral suppression,&#xD;
      the optimal condition to prevent disease progression, to optimize immune restoration, to&#xD;
      prevent the development of viral resistance and to reduce viral transmission. Antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy has to be maintained long life over decades in the absence of strategies for HIV&#xD;
      cure. This is why the long-term cumulative toxicity of ARV drugs is a major issue. Indeed as&#xD;
      a consequence of potent ART strategies, in 2011 over 88% of patients on ART in the French&#xD;
      Hospital database (ANRS CO4 FHDH) achieved viral suppression with HIV-RNA plasma viral load &lt;&#xD;
      50 copies/mL and nearly 60% had CD4 &gt; 500/mm3. As a consequence of massive reduction of&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity related to HIV, infected patients are aging with 40% of patients over&#xD;
      50 years of age in the ANRS CO4 FHDH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard-of-care for antiretroviral therapy consists in a triple drug combination&#xD;
      with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus either a non-nucleoside&#xD;
      reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), a protease inhibitor (PI), or an integrase inhibitor&#xD;
      (INSTI). NRTIs and PIs have been associated to cumulative long-term toxicity such as bone and&#xD;
      renal disorders related to tenofovir and increased cardio-vascular risk with PIs. In general&#xD;
      population, aging is associated with well-known comorbidities such as bone demineralization,&#xD;
      increased incidence of cardio or cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, renal dysfunction. HIV&#xD;
      infected patients are at a greater risk for such abnormalities. Another crucial concern is&#xD;
      the high probability of drug-drug interactions in HIV-infected patients, between ART and&#xD;
      comedications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative strategies are needed, which must address the following questions: how to&#xD;
      maintain the control of HIV viral replication while minimizing the occurrence of long-term&#xD;
      clinical and metabolic complications, and minimizing the risk of drug-drug interactions?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open label, randomized, switch study over 96 weeks in which virally&#xD;
      suppressed patients on a stable combined ART regimen will be randomized (2:1) to an immediate&#xD;
      switch to doravirine/raltegravir (immediate switch group) or to the maintaining of their&#xD;
      current ART followed by a switch to doravirine/raltegravir at W48 (delayed switch group).&#xD;
      Patients will be followed during 96 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recent years have highlighted the cumulative toxicities of long-term exposure to&#xD;
      antiretroviral drugs. Cardiovascular disease is one of the most common comorbidities in the&#xD;
      aging HIV-infected population. Coronary artery disease (CAD) results from a combination of&#xD;
      increasing age, traditional risk factor such as smoking, toxicity from long-term ART, and&#xD;
      potentially related to HIV immune activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of boosted PIs and the NNRTI [efavirenz] are associated to an increase in triglycerides&#xD;
      and total cholesterol plasma levels. In the ANRS CO8 APROCO COPILOTE cohort about 30% of&#xD;
      patients developed hypertriglyceridemia. Prevalence of lipodystrophy and metabolic&#xD;
      alterations and these alterations appear as early as 12 months after the initiation of PI&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in HIV-infected individuals is higher in&#xD;
      HIV-infected compared with HIV-negative individuals ranging, from 23 to 65% for osteopenia&#xD;
      and from 3 to 22% for osteoporosis according to the studies [13-16] with, as consequence, a&#xD;
      higher prevalence of patients with fracture (p &lt; 0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tenofovir is currently the most widely used antiretroviral drug. Globally, clinical trials&#xD;
      have suggested that renal toxicity related to tenofovir is low (approximately 1%) in selected&#xD;
      populations from clinical studies. However, observational cohort studies have suggested that&#xD;
      this risk was higher with rates varying from approximately 2%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a systematic review and meta-analysis whereas over time with longer exposure to&#xD;
      antiretroviral drugs the overall relative risk of renal disease was 3.87 (95% CI: 2.85-6.85)&#xD;
      in HIV-infected patients compared to HIV-uninfected in ART treated patients. 0.54 (95% CI:&#xD;
      0.29-0.99) compared to naïve patients and 1.56 (95% CI: 0.83-2.93) in patients treated with&#xD;
      tenofovir compared to patients without tenofovir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the DAD study not only tenofovir but also abacavir, lopinavir/ritonavir and&#xD;
      atazanavir/ritonavir were associated to high risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of strategies that could minimize renal toxicity has to be investigated particularly&#xD;
      in senior HIV infected population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased risk for drug-drug interactions: a cause of concern in the elderly. Aging increases&#xD;
      polypharmacy prescriptions for treatment and prevention of comorbidities such as&#xD;
      cardio-vascular disease, hypertension or diabetes. One major issue is the risk for drug-drug&#xD;
      interactions in elderly ART treated HIV infected patients due to the common CYP450 cytochrome&#xD;
      pathway, shared by ARV drug and drug for comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring concentration of these drugs is not easy in routine practice. Given these&#xD;
      drug-drug interactions with potential severe clinical consequences, it is key to investigate&#xD;
      alternative ART strategies with different metabolization pathways, such as raltegravir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raltegravir and Doravirine: benefits and advantages in terms of toxicity. Overall, literature&#xD;
      data showed that raltegravir and doravirine are two drugs with high antiretroviral potency,&#xD;
      including in experienced HIV-treated patients, with very good tolerance profile and without&#xD;
      expected drug-drug interaction between the two drugs. A new dual therapy strategy combining&#xD;
      doravirine + raltegravir given once daily has to be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the setting of dual therapies, and as background the excellent results in terms of&#xD;
      efficacy of doravirine plus raltegravir (&lt;2% of virological failure (95% confidence interval&#xD;
      0.3 to 5.0) at week 96 of 165 participants in the ETRAL), we postulate that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The association of raltegravir 1200 mg QD and doravirine 100 mg QD (DOR/RAL) will&#xD;
           maintain viral suppression in HIV-1-infected patients with suppressed viremia on ART,&#xD;
           with a virological failure rate of &lt;12% in a population of 100 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DOR/RAL will be associated to a robust viral suppression with limited amount of blips&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DOR/RAL will be well tolerated over the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acquired resistance to doravirine or raltegravir will be limited in case of virological&#xD;
           failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DOR/RAL will present a benefit for patients on metabolic parameters and general symptoms&#xD;
