      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of antiretroviral (ARV) and&#xD;
      anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs administered during pregnancy and postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is comprised of five components which in turn are comprised of arms specific to&#xD;
      each drug or drug combination being evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Component 1 (Arms 1.1, 1.2. 1.3. 1.4. and 1.5): Pregnant women living with HIV (WLHIV)&#xD;
           receiving oral ARVs and no TB drugs, and their infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Component 2 (Arm 2.1): Pregnant WLHIV and HIV-uninfected women who received&#xD;
           long-acting/extended release ARVs during pregnancy, and their infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Component 3 (Arms 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3): Pregnant WLHIV receiving ARVs and first-line TB&#xD;
           treatment, and their infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Component 4 (Arm 4.1): Pregnant WLHIV and HIV-uninfected women receiving second-line TB&#xD;
           treatment, and their infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Component 5 (Arms 5.1, 5.2. and 5.3): Postpartum WLHIV breastfeeding while receiving&#xD;
           oral ARVs, and their infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each arm will open to accrual independently and will accrue independently over approximately&#xD;
      36 months from the first enrollment in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No ARVs or TB treatment drugs are supplied as part of this study. All drugs under study are&#xD;
      provided by non-study sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Component 1 will be followed up to 12 weeks after delivery for mothers and up&#xD;
      to 24 weeks after birth for infants. Participants in Component 2 will be followed up to 5&#xD;
      weeks after delivery for mothers and infants. Participants in Components 3, 4, and 5 will be&#xD;
      followed up to 24 weeks after delivery for mothers and infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Component 1: Maternal clinical and laboratory evaluations and PK sampling at second&#xD;
           trimester (2T), third trimester (3T), delivery, and 6-12 weeks post-partum (PP). Infant&#xD;
           clinical evaluations and washout PK sampling at birth and 5-9 days after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Component 2: Maternal clinical and laboratory evaluations and PK sampling at delivery.&#xD;
           Infant clinical evaluations and washout PK sampling at birth, 5-9 days, and 12-16 days&#xD;
           after birth. Maternal and infant breast milk transfer PK sampling at 5-9 days, 12-16&#xD;
           days, and 3-5 weeks after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Component 3: Maternal clinical and laboratory evaluations and PK sampling at second&#xD;
           trimester (2T), third trimester (3T), delivery, and 2-8 weeks post-partum (PP). Infant&#xD;
           clinical evaluations and washout PK sampling at birth and 5-9 days after birth. Maternal&#xD;
           and infant breast milk transfer PK sampling at 5-9 days, 2-8 weeks, and 16-24 weeks&#xD;
           after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Component 4: Maternal clinical and laboratory evaluations and PK sampling at second&#xD;
           trimester (2T), third trimester (3T), delivery, and 2-8 weeks post-partum (PP). Infant&#xD;
           clinical evaluations and washout PK sampling at birth and 5-9 days after birth. Maternal&#xD;
           and infant breast milk transfer PK sampling at 5-9 days, 2-8 weeks, and 16-24 weeks&#xD;
           after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Component 5: Maternal and infant clinical evaluations and breast milk transfer PK&#xD;
           sampling at 5-9 days, 2-12 weeks, and 16-24 weeks after delivery.&#xD;
