  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the effects of induced pneumoperitoneum during surgery on ventilatory&#xD;
      parameters including peak inspiratory pressure, lung compliance, end-tidal CO2 at specific&#xD;
      time-points: after induction of anaesthesia, after induction of surgery, one-hour and&#xD;
      two-hours during surgery, end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of pneumoperitoneum are compared between two groups of patients: patients&#xD;
      undergoing laparoscopic surgery and patients undergoing robotic-assisted surgery. No&#xD;
      intervention was performed in this study and the decision for type of surgery performed was&#xD;
      made by the attending surgeon prior to study inclusion&#xD;

        consecutive patients undergoing video-assisted surgery in a university hospital after&#xD;
        inclusion and exclusion criteria have been met. Video-assisted surgery is defined by either&#xD;
        classic laparoscopic surgery or robotic assisted surgery and the medical decision between&#xD;
        the two types of surgery was performed by the attending surgeon prior to patient inclusion&#xD;
        (unrelated to the study).&#xD;
