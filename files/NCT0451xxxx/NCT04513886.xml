      This study evaluated the outcomes in the early healing of palatal wounds after harvesting a&#xD;
      subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) using the single incision technique with&#xD;
      placement of a collagen haemostatic sponge (CHS) without suturing the palate. The primary&#xD;
      outcome of this study was to evaluate the early wound healing index (EHI).&#xD;

      The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes in the early wound healing after harvesting&#xD;
      a subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) using the single incision technique and&#xD;
      collagen haemostatic sponge (CHS) placement, with and without suturing the palate. 36&#xD;
      subjects were randomized to receive (n=18, Suture group-SG) or not a suture (n=18, no Suture&#xD;
      group-nSG). Outcomes variables were: Early healing index (EHI) at 7, 14 and 30 days,&#xD;
      self-reported pain using a visual analogue scale (VAS) at 7 and 14 days, immediate (iB) and&#xD;
      delayed bleeding (dB). Data obtained were compared by Fisher's exact test, T test for&#xD;
      independent sample, Mann-Whitney test (U test) and Wilcoxon sign test as appropriate. The&#xD;
      level of significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed with Infostat&#xD;
      version 2015.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of participants with immediate bleeding</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately postsurgery</time_frame>
    <description>An embedded gauze with saline was pressed on the palate wound for 5 minutes in both groups. Positive iB was recorded if once the gauze was removed, bleeding persisted. Compression was repeated as many times as necessary until bleeding was arrested. If this maneuver was not enough, additional actions should be performed to stop bleeding and the patient would be excluded from the study.</description>

    <description>Pain level / discomfort experienced at the surgical site of the palate, was self-reported by the subject and registered with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). It was required to the subject to graduate their sensitivity using a scale of 10 cm marked in mm between 0 and 100, labelled numerically from 0 to 10. Zero corresponds to &quot;no discomfort&quot; and 10 &quot;unbearable pain&quot;. All other possible adverse effects were also recorded.</description>

    <intervention_name>Subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) using the single incision technique, with and without suturing the palate</intervention_name>
    <description>A SCTG was harvested using the single incision technique described by Hürzeler &amp; Weng. The palatal incisions were standardized to extend between the area between mesial of the canine and mesial of the first molar.In the Suture Group sites a cross- mattress suture and interrupted single sutures were performed using nylon 5-0 when appropriate. In the no Suture Group sites, no suture was performed. In both groups, a CHS was placed after removing the graft to achieve the haemostasis of the palate and subsequent compressed with gauze soaked in saline for 5 minutes.</description>
