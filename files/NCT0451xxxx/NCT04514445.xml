  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart anomaly in the general&#xD;
      population (1-2% of all individuals). In affected people, the aortic valve (the structure&#xD;
      ensuring one way blood flow between the heart's left pumping chamber, the left ventricle and&#xD;
      the main body artery, the aorta) consists of 2 rather than 3 leaflets. This arrangement can&#xD;
      cause the affected valve to have restricted opening or cause it to leak. Both situations put&#xD;
      strain on the heart and patients with BAV across the age range may require surgery to replace&#xD;
      the affected valve. BAV is therefore a condition associated with significant ill health and&#xD;
      early mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BAV is known to cluster in families and is likely to have a genetic cause. We don't fully&#xD;
      understand the inheritance of BAV or the specific genes involved in its development. Learning&#xD;
      more about this is the basis of the BRAVE study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will ask patients with BAV and their relatives (who may or may not have BAV) to take part&#xD;
      in the study. Blood samples obtained from the participants will be used for analyses of their&#xD;
      genetic composition. This information, linked with the clinical data concerning who does and&#xD;
      does not have BAV, will potentially enable the identification of the gene changes responsible&#xD;
      for the disease. This, we hope, will give us a much better understanding of the mechanisms&#xD;
      leading to this serious and common condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bicuspid aortic valve is the most common congenital valvular heart anomaly in the general&#xD;
      population, with a prevalence estimated between 0.5 - 2%. It is more common in males than&#xD;
      females with ratios reported between 2:1 and 3:1. The prevalence of BAV shows significant&#xD;
      differences amongst different ethnic groups. BAV sometimes associates with other,&#xD;
      non-valvular cardiovascular phenotypes, e.g. aortic coarctation, left dominant coronary&#xD;
      artery system and intracranial aneurysms. Presence of BAV is strongly associated with&#xD;
      dilatation of the ascending aorta irrespective of valve function. BAV related dilatation of&#xD;
      the ascending aorta has been reported in 56% of those aged 30 years old and 88% of those aged&#xD;
      80 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence of BAV can be associated with serious cardiovascular complications. In a long term&#xD;
      observational study, the overall survival of BAV patients was equal to age and sex matched&#xD;
      subjects from the general population, but BAV was associated with the need for surgical&#xD;
      intervention in 27% of subjects. Additionally, cardiovascular medical events (heart failure,&#xD;
      infective endocarditis and stroke) occurred in 33% of all subjects with BAV over that period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BAV shows strong familial clustering, indicating that it has a strong genetic basis. In an&#xD;
      echocardiographic survey of first degree relatives of patients with BAV 36.7% of families had&#xD;
      at least 2 members with this anomaly. In a study of 309 subjects from 48 extended families&#xD;
      heritability of BAV was calculated at 89%.A whole genome linkage scan performed in 38&#xD;
      extended families (324 individuals), showed evidence for linkage with 5 chromosomal loci -&#xD;
      18q22, 5q21, 13q34, 9q34, 17q24. When analysed separately, the majority of families&#xD;
      contributed only to a single locus suggesting heterogenic genetic origin of BAV. Based on&#xD;
      these observation an oligogenic model of autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced&#xD;
      penetrance has been suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite strong familial clustering, only few genetic loci have been associated with BAV so&#xD;
      far. The strongest evidence exist for association of BAV with NOTCH1 gene (translocation&#xD;
      associated protein) - the product of which is an important element in developmental control&#xD;
      of cell fate decisions. Other candidate loci include TGFBR2 (transforming growth factor beta&#xD;
      receptor 2 gene), GATA5 (GATA-binding protein gene) and eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide&#xD;
      synthase gene). However, the identified loci explain only small proportion of BAV&#xD;
      heritability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modern DNA analysis, notably next generation sequencing, allows variants associated with&#xD;
      disease to be identified more rapidly and with increased precision. The objective of this&#xD;
      project is to use such technology to identify genetic variants and genes predisposing to BAV&#xD;
      using a combination of case-control and family-based approaches. A better understanding of&#xD;
      the genetic underpinnings of BAV could in the future help to improve the management of this&#xD;
      valvular heart condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This BRAVE study will recruit patients with antecedent or new diagnosis of BAV. As many&#xD;
      relatives of the index patient as possible will be recruited to the study (family based&#xD;
      analysis). They will be screened with echocardiography for the presence of BAV. Additional&#xD;
      group of unrelated healthy individuals with three leaflet valves will be recruited for the&#xD;
      purpose of case control analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical data from all participants will be collected using purposefully&#xD;
      designed questionnaires and by accessing their medical records. Data on imaging&#xD;
      investigations will be obtained from the medical records or from the echocardiogram performed&#xD;
      for the purpose of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be used for the purpose of isolation of genetic material and subsequent&#xD;
      genetic analysis. Additional laboratory tests may be performed on the blood samples to&#xD;
      provide supporting evidence to the results of genetic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main analyses will consist of identifying and cataloguing genetic variants for each&#xD;
      individual from the DNA sequencing and then seeing whether any particular variant or sets of&#xD;
      variants are more commonly present in BAV subjects versus those without BAV (case-control&#xD;
      design) or present in subjects with BAV but not in unaffected family members (family-based&#xD;
      approach).&#xD;
