      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of different cold application times with&#xD;
      cold gel pads after rhinoplasty on eyelid edema, eye ecchymosis and pain. A total of 60&#xD;
      patients undergoing rhinoplasty were divided into two groups by simple randomization method.&#xD;
      Cold application applied to short term group for 4 hours and to long term group for 48 hours.&#xD;
      Cold application was applied around both eyes with cold gel pads for 20 minutes per hour.&#xD;
      Pain was evaluated with the Visuel Analog Scale, ecchymosis with eyelid ecchymosis score, and&#xD;
      edema with eye-edema score. Edema and ecchymosis were evaluated on the 1st and 4th hours and&#xD;
      2nd day. Pain conditions were evaluated before and after analgesics for 1, 4 hours and 2&#xD;
      times daily.&#xD;

      The research was carried out between January 2015 and March 2017 in an education and research&#xD;
      hospital with a capacity of 26 beds. The research was suspended between July 2015 and January&#xD;
      2016. Patients who underwent rhinoplasty / septorhinoplasty operation between January 2015&#xD;
      and March 2017 with open or closed technique were included in the study. The study included&#xD;
      patients who were 18 years of age or older who underwent a rhinoplasty / septorhinoplasty&#xD;
      operation voluntarily. Patients who had cold allergy, refused to participate, applied outside&#xD;
      of the research protocol and required re-operation in the early postoperative period due to&#xD;
      complications were excluded from the study. All patients were provided with training and&#xD;
      brochures for preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative periods. The cold application&#xD;
      was done with gel pads of the same size and weight (13 cm x 13 cm-approximately 100 g) for 20&#xD;
      minutes per hour. Cold application was performed by the researcher in both groups for the&#xD;
      first 4 hours. The patients in the short-term cold application group were given cold&#xD;
      application by the researcher for 4 hours and 20 minutes per hour and the cold application&#xD;
      was terminated. In the long-term application group, the first 4 hours of cold application&#xD;
      were done by the researcher. Cold application after 4 hours; jel pads was applied at home by&#xD;
      the patient's relative in accordance with the training given on the cold application&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
