  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab&#xD;
      combined with or without radiotherapy for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic esophageal&#xD;
      cancer that has progressed after chemotherapy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In China, the incidence of esophageal cancer has declined in recent years, but the mortality&#xD;
      rate has been ranked fourth. Morbidity and mortality were ranked sixth and fourth in all&#xD;
      malignancies, respectively. Therefore, esophageal cancer has always been a major malignant&#xD;
      tumor that threatens the health of our residents. We designed a multi-center, randomized&#xD;
      controlled, phase II clinical study of camrelizumab with or without radiotherapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of recurrent or metastatic esophageal cancer that has progressed after&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      camrelizumab with or without radiotherapy for advanced esophageal cancer.&#xD;
