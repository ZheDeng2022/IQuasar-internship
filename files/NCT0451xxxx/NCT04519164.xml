      This study will evaluate whether the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eplerenone, when&#xD;
      compared to chlorthalidone plus potassium chloride, can improve cardiac MRI-derived&#xD;
      myocardial perfusion reserve and fibrosis, independent of blood pressure, and proportionately&#xD;
      to the severity of autonomous aldosterone production.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a dominant risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The&#xD;
      public health relevance of this relationship is underscored by the fact that 40% (93 million)&#xD;
      of adult Americans are obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is a major mechanism implicated in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of obesity-associated CVD. MR activation causes vascular stiffness,&#xD;
      inflammation, and fibrosis, and MR antagonists improve clinical outcomes in heart failure&#xD;
      with reduced ejection fraction, especially in obesity. However, even in the absence of heart&#xD;
      failure, multiple mechanisms of CVD in obesity are mediated by excessive activation of the&#xD;
      MR. These mechanisms include: autonomous aldosterone production, increased cortisol action,&#xD;
      high sympathetic nervous system activity, increased leptin, inflammation, and oxidative&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autonomous aldosterone production is a highly prevalent and poorly recognized disorder that&#xD;
      causes CVD independent of blood pressure (BP). Autonomous aldosterone production manifests&#xD;
      across a wide severity spectrum, ranging from mild/subclinical (rarely recognized) to overt&#xD;
      (primary aldosteronism). The investigators' work has characterized autonomous aldosterone&#xD;
      production as a phenotype of non-physiologic, non-suppressible, and renin-independent&#xD;
      aldosterone production that is highly prevalent in the general population of the U.S.A..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autonomous aldosterone production and MR activation are especially enriched in obesity,&#xD;
      particularly among obese/overweight individuals with hypertension and/or metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
      Current treatment guidelines do not recommend the early use of MR antagonists in obesity or&#xD;
      hypertension, thereby delaying or omitting a targeted therapy that may specifically mitigate&#xD;
      the mechanism of CVD in this high-risk population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have validated cardiac MRI methods to measure coronary microvascular&#xD;
      function and myocardial fibrosis, both strong surrogates for CVD that correlate with&#xD;
      aldosterone production and that improve with MR antagonist therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective studies to investigate the early mechanistic contribution of aldosterone-MR&#xD;
      activation in the pathogenesis of CVD in obesity, and whether MR antagonists can prevent&#xD;
      this, are lacking. Mechanistic studies, using innovative and robust intermediate phenotypes&#xD;
      of clinical CVD outcomes in a cost-effective manner, could have a major public health impact&#xD;
      by implicating a targeted medical therapy (MR antagonists) to prevent CVD in high-risk&#xD;
      obesity (overweight/obese individuals with hypertension and/or metabolic syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: MR antagonists in high-risk obesity improve cardiac MRI-derived myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion reserve and fibrosis, independent of BP, and proportionately to the severity of&#xD;
      autonomous aldosterone production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: This mechanistic study will investigate whether MR antagonist therapy in&#xD;
      high-risk overweight or obese participants can be a targeted strategy to prevent CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      80 participants with overweight/obesity, untreated hypertension, and/or at least one other&#xD;
      feature of the metabolic syndrome, will be enrolled. Participants will undergo a&#xD;
      deep-phenotyping protocol to characterize aldosterone and cortisol physiology before&#xD;
      randomization to eplerenone (25-100 mg/d) or chlorthalidone (6.25-25 mg/d + KCl 20 mEq/d) for&#xD;
      one year. BP will be maintained in a target range to ensure outcomes are independent of BP&#xD;
      control. Cardiac MRI-derived outcomes will be measured at baseline and after one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: To investigate whether eplerenone therapy in high-risk obese/overweight participants,&#xD;
      when compared to chlorthalidone + KCl, can improve coronary microvascular function&#xD;
      independent of BP, as measured via stress cardiac MRI-derived myocardial perfusion reserve (a&#xD;
      strong predictor for incident cardiovascular events and death that has been shown to improve&#xD;
      with MR antagonist therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: To investigate whether eplerenone therapy in high-risk obese/overweight participants,&#xD;
      when compared to chlorthalidone + KCl, can decrease myocardial fibrosis independent of BP, as&#xD;
      measured via extracellular volume fraction on T1 mapping cardiac MRI (an established&#xD;
      surrogate for myocardial fibrosis and inflammation that is also strongly associated with&#xD;
      autonomous aldosterone production and mortality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aims: To investigate whether the severity of autonomous aldosterone production is&#xD;
      associated with cardiac MRI-derived outcomes and predicts the response to eplerenone therapy;&#xD;
      and, to investigate whether eplerenone therapy can improve measures of cardiac fat content,&#xD;
      arterial stiffness (via pulse-wave velocity), and inflammation (via inflammatory markers and&#xD;
      adipocytokines), when compared to chlorthalidone + KCl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPACT: Obesity/overweight status is enriched with autonomous aldosterone production and MR&#xD;
      activation, mechanisms known to cause CVD. This study will investigate targeted mechanisms&#xD;
      for the prevention of MR-mediated CVD in high-risk obesity using innovative physiologic&#xD;
      phenotyping and surrogate imaging outcomes. This study will establish a mechanistic&#xD;
      foundation for future outcome studies in obesity with incident CVD events.&#xD;
