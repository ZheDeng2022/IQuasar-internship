    <textblock>
      This study will deliver a 12-week exercise-based upper limb virtual reality, non-immersive,&#xD;
      rehabilitation programme for stroke survivors. The aims are to:1. to assess the acceptability&#xD;
      and usability of the VirtualRehab platform for delivery of stroke rehabilitation at home:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. to find if stroke survivors adhere to 'prescribed' use of the VirtualRehab platform over a&#xD;
      12-week period; 3. to assess the viability of using randomised length of baselines and&#xD;
      repeated measures during the intervention period to inform subsequent study to find the&#xD;
      optimum therapeutic dose 4. to estimate how a 12-week period of using the VirtualRehab&#xD;
      platform could change motor impairment and functional capacity.&#xD;

      Background and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is driven by the hypothesis that provision of task-orientated training via a&#xD;
      non-immersive virtual reality platform enhances upper limb motor and neural function more&#xD;
      than current routine physical therapy for people with stroke. Before this hypothesis can be&#xD;
      tested in a randomised controlled clinical trial. If evidence of concept is found, then the&#xD;
      next step is identification of the optimum therapeutic dose of exercised-based therapy&#xD;
      delivered via the Virtualrehab Platform as a precursor to a clinical efficacy trial. The&#xD;
      specific objectives of the study reported here were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to assess the acceptability and usability of the VirtualRehab platform for delivery of&#xD;
           stroke rehabilitation at home:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to find if stroke survivors adhere to 'prescribed' use of the VirtualRehab platform over&#xD;
           a 12-week period;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to assess the viability of using randomised length of baselines and repeated measures&#xD;
           during the intervention period to inform subsequent study to find the optimum&#xD;
           therapeutic dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to estimate how a 12-week period of&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of replicated single case studies with an AB design (2.1). During the A, control,&#xD;
      phase participants will not receive the experimental intervention. Participants will receive&#xD;
      the experimental intervention during the B phase. At the beginning of the control phase,&#xD;
      participants will complete the measurement battery. These will be the baseline-one measures.&#xD;
      The measurement battery will be repeated at the end of the baseline phase (baseline-two) and&#xD;
      at the end of the intervention phase (outcome). Progress measures will be made at the end of&#xD;
      every week of the intervention (B) phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both sets of baselines and the outcome measures will be taken in the Movement and Exercise&#xD;
      Laboratory (MovExLab) at the University of East Anglia (UEA). Progress measures will be made&#xD;
      in participants' homes. The control phase will last for a randomised period of between one&#xD;
      and four weeks. The time period for the control phase will be decided for each participant by&#xD;
      a randomised sequence generated before the study begins, by a researcher independent of the&#xD;
      research team for this study. The intervention phase will last for 12 weeks. During the&#xD;
      intervention phase, each participant will undertake weekly progress measures in their home.&#xD;
      These will be administered by the researchers prescribing and monitoring training. At the end&#xD;
      of the control and the intervention phase, all participants will participate in a 1:1&#xD;
      semi-structured interview with the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of adults without any reported neurological damage undertook the measurement battery&#xD;
      to provide reference values. The measurement battery and progress measures are described&#xD;
      below.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention group will carry out a 12-week exercise-based intervention delivered via the VirtualRehab platform. The exercise-games have been designed from conventional physiotherapy exercises for stroke rehabilitation. A personalised training programme will be created for individual participants by a qualified physiotherapist member of the research team. Each participant will be asked to undertake their set exercise-based training programme for one hour a day, six days a week for 12 weeks.</description>
