  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP)was not clear, but previous studies&#xD;
      have shown that in some patients, some pathogen could be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage&#xD;
      fluid (BALF), and may be one of the causes of COP. This study aimed to screen the pathogenic&#xD;
      microorganisms in BALF and lung puncture fluid of the patients with COP through the&#xD;
      next-generation sequencing to further clarify the correlation between the incidence of COP&#xD;
      and pathogenic microorganisms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cause of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) was unknown, but studies had shown that&#xD;
      certain bacteria, viruses, or specific pathogens could be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage&#xD;
      fluid (BALF) in some patients, and these pathogenic microorganisms may be the cause of COP.&#xD;
      Specimens were obtained by conventional methods (sputum, blood, BALF or lung puncture fluid)&#xD;
      for microbiological detection. Due to the influence of the quality of acquired specimens,&#xD;
      specimen preservation and transportation which were influenced by external factors, many&#xD;
      patients did not get good test results, which affected the diagnosis and subsequent treatment&#xD;
      of patients. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) which could determine hundreds of thousands to&#xD;
      millions of DNA molecules in parallel at one time, and efficiently sequence or fragment of&#xD;
      pathogenic microorganisms. NGS had greatly improved the detection rate of pathogenic&#xD;
      microorganisms. This study aimed to screen pathogenic microorganisms in BALF and lung&#xD;
      puncture fluid of COP patients by NGS, and further clarify the correlation between occurrence&#xD;
      of COP and pathogenic microorganisms.&#xD;
