    <textblock>
      This is an acceptability study (including gastrointestinal tolerance, compliance and&#xD;
      palatability) of a high energy peptide based paediatric oral nutritional supplement for&#xD;
      children over 12 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acceptability data from a minimum of 15 participants will be collected in order to submit&#xD;
      an application to the Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances (ACBS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifteen (15) participants, aged 12 months and over, requiring a high energy peptide based&#xD;
      oral nutritional supplement drink for the dietary management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ACBS requirement for evaluable data on 15 participants has informed the trial's&#xD;
      recruitment target; however, we may need to exceed this target if any patients give their&#xD;
      consent to join the study but then decide not to participate in the study. Participants who&#xD;
      join the study and begin using the product would count towards the recruitment total and&#xD;
      their data would be included in a submission to the ACBS whether they complete the 7-day&#xD;
      study period or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each potential participant must meet all of the inclusion criteria and not meet any of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;
