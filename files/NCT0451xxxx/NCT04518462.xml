        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy adult male or female volunteers ages 18 or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1, 2, or 3&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Able to provide informed consent, adhere to the study schedule, and complete all study&#xD;
             assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥18 and ≤40 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Allergy, hypersensitivity, intolerance, or contraindication to any of the study&#xD;
             medications for which an alternative is not named in the protocol (e.g., amide-type&#xD;
             local anesthetics, opioids, bupivacaine HCl, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
             [NSAIDs])&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Concurrent painful physical condition that may require analgesic treatment (such as&#xD;
             long-term, consistent use of opioids) in the post dosing period for pain and which, in&#xD;
             the investigator's opinion, may confound the post dosing assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of, suspected, or known addiction to or abuse of illicit drug(s), prescription&#xD;
             medicine(s), or alcohol within the past 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Administration of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 elimination half-lives&#xD;
             of such investigational drug, whichever is longer, prior to study drug administration,&#xD;
             or planned administration of another investigational product or procedure during the&#xD;
             subject's participation in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Previous participation in an EXPAREL study&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Uncontrolled anxiety, schizophrenia, or other psychiatric disorder that, in the&#xD;

          7. Currently pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Clinically significant medical disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would&#xD;
             make participation in a clinical study inappropriate. This includes diabetic&#xD;
             neuropathy, coagulation or bleeding disorders, severe peripheral vascular disease,&#xD;
             renal insufficiency, hepatic dysfunction or other conditions that would constitute a&#xD;
             contraindication to participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Currently on a neuromodulating agent neuroleptic agent (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin&#xD;
             [Lyrica], duloxetine [Cymbalta], etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Inadequate sensory function on the foot (monofilament test)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Chronic opioid use within 30 days prior to randomization (average ≥30 oral morphine&#xD;
             equivalents/day)&#xD;
