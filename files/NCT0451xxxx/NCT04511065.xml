  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve motivation for reading by implementing a&#xD;
      computer-based newsletter and examine the effects on the literacy engagement and reading&#xD;
      achievement of middle school-aged students. Research questions to be answered: 1. Does the&#xD;
      provision of a computer-based newsletter intervention improve literacy engagement on middle&#xD;
      school students in comparison to their pretest scores? 2. Does the provision of&#xD;
      computer-based newsletter intervention improve the reading achievement of middle school&#xD;
      students in comparison to their pretest scores?&#xD;

    <measure>Reading Skills of Middle-School Aged Children</measure>
    <time_frame>These assessments will be administered at the start of the study and at the end of the study. Total timeframe from Time 1 to Time 2 is 7 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Reading skills will be assessed using the Gray Oral Reading Test 5 (GORT 5) and the Test of Orthographic Competency (TOC). The Gray Oral Reading Test 5 assesses oral reading skills of individuals ages 6-23 years old, in the areas of rate, accuracy, fluency, and comprehension. The Test of Orthographic Competence assesses reading skills of children ages 6-17 years old, looking at proficiency with letters, spelling, punctuation, abbreviations and special symbols.</description>

    <measure>Literacy Engagement of Middle-School Aged Children</measure>
    <time_frame>This assessment will be administered at the start of the study and at the end of the study. Total timeframe from Time 1 to Time 2 is 7 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The researchers will also administer the modified Inventory of Reading Occupations (modified-IRO), a literacy engagement scale created by the investigators using the two standardized assessments, Inventory of Reading Occupations Pediatric version, and Inventory of Reading Occupations Adult version.</description>

    <description>The intervention group will be provided with a survey to determine areas of interest to guide the 7-week literacy intervention plan of completing a newsletter. Students will complete the newsletter virtually using secure Zoom meetings 2x per week for 30 minutes per session. The results of the GORT 5 and TOC will be used to determine the baseline reading skills of the students and each researcher will use the results of the assessments to guide the intervention with the newsletter topic that is chosen by the student. For example, if the GORT 5 notes deficiency with reading accuracy, the focus of the intervention will be ensuring that reading accuracy is a focus of the summary that is crafted by the student for the newsletter.</description>

    <description>The control group will not participate in the newsletter creation for the 7-week study period. These students will engage in the after-school programs at the Center, some of which may be literacy-based, but not the prescriptive model that is being followed by the researchers.</description>
