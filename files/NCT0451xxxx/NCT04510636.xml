  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 open-label study to test the safety and effectiveness of combining&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and bendamustine in patients with relapsed (cancer that has come back or&#xD;
      started getting worse) or refractory (cancer that is not responding or has stopped responding&#xD;
      to treatment) Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pembrolizumab and bendamustine will be explored as a safe and effective treatment for these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although current treatment options are available for patients in the relapsed state, once&#xD;
      these therapies fail or are not tolerated, treatment options are quite limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab and bendamustine have both shown activity when used as a single agent as&#xD;
      treatment for Hodgkin Lymphoma. Their side effect profiles also do not overlap, which makes&#xD;
      them ideal to combine, with an intent to increase the amount and duration of complete&#xD;
      responses while limiting the toxicities experienced by patients.&#xD;
