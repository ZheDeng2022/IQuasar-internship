      Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer. Most patients diagnosed in early&#xD;
      stages because cancer causes remarkable symptoms such as postmenopausal or abnormal bleeding.&#xD;
      Mostly, it does not spread, detects no metastasis. Endometrial carcinoma is surgically&#xD;
      staged. Laparotomy or minimally invasive surgery can be performed for treatment and staging.&#xD;
      Patients have been operated for staging surgery, have a larger surgical incision, longer&#xD;
      operation period, more complications, more intensive care units need. Nowadays, researchers&#xD;
      show us that there is no difference in overall survival and prognosis between surgery with or&#xD;
      without lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer. With all these improvements in gynecologic&#xD;
      oncology leads us to minimally invasive surgery. Patients undergo sentinel lymph node&#xD;
      detection by using fluorescence imaging with an indocyanine green solution. Two different&#xD;
      ways used to assess SLND. The first group who the cervix is injected superficially with 1 mL&#xD;
      of ICG ( indocyanine green) at 4 and 8 o'clock quadrans. The second group who ICG has&#xD;
      injected the uterine cavity during hysteroscopy. The investigator's aim is to assess and&#xD;
      compare the performance of two approaches for sentinel lymph node ( SLND) biopsy.&#xD;
