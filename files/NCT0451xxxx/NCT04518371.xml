    <textblock>
      In patients with endodontically treated teeth, will the Indirect Milled composite Endo-crown&#xD;
      restorations have a better clinical performance and more wear resistance than the Direct&#xD;
      Bulk-Fill resin composite restorations over one year?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To evaluate clinical performance of different Techniques of Composite&#xD;
      Restorations (Indirect restorations using a CAD/CAM grinding process, BRILLIANT Crios,&#xD;
      Coltène/Whaledent AG, Switzerland or Direct a light-cured, bulk-fill nanocomposite&#xD;
      restorative material, Filtek™ One Bulk Fill Restorative, 3M ESPE Dental Products, USA) in&#xD;
      Endodontically treated posterior teeth.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted in Conservative Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo&#xD;
      University; The operator in charge will be Esraa Esmeail Hussien.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null-hypothesis: There are no differences in the clinical performance of indirect CAD/CAM&#xD;
      milled composite when compared to direct bulk-fil composite endocrowns when in the posterior&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: This clinical trial will be conducted to assess the clinical performance of using&#xD;
      indirect Milled composite or direct bulk-fill resin composite Endo-crowns for restoring the&#xD;
      endo-treated teeth, as well to measure the amount of wear on the occlusal tables of both&#xD;
      restorations using Digital Scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be selected from the outpatient clinic of the department Conservative Dentistry&#xD;
      Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A tapered stone with rounded end in a high-speed handpiece with air /water coolant will&#xD;
           be used to properly prepare the cavity walls to receive the indirect restoration and any&#xD;
           remaining carious dentin will be excavated and removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cuspal tipping will be done by a wheel stone about 1.5-2mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The entrance to the pulpal canal will be opened. Gutta percha will be removed to a depth&#xD;
           not exceeding 2 mm to take advantage of the saddle-like anatomy of the cavity floor.&#xD;
           This should be done with a nonabrasive instrument to maintain the integrity of the&#xD;
           canal's entrance. No drilling into the dentin will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any remaining undercuts will be blocked with conventional resin composite.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The impression will be taken, and the final restoration will be fabricated either direct&#xD;
           or indirect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The final restoration should be checked intraorally for proximal contacts, occlusion and&#xD;
           marginal fit before cementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isolation of operatory field using rubber dam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selective enamel etching technique will be applied for bonding of tooth structure,&#xD;
           35-40% phosphoric acid gel will be applied to the enamel margins only for 15 seconds,&#xD;
           rinsed for 15 seconds and gently dried by cotton pellet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adhesive will be used according to the manufacturers' instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adhesive resin cement will be applied into the preparation. The restoration will be&#xD;
           placed in the cavity and checked for complete seating. The cement will be light cured&#xD;
           for only 2 seconds to facilitate removal of the excess. Then light curing will be done&#xD;
           from all directions each for 40 seconds for achieving the final set.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proximal contacts will be checked with dental floss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The occlusion will be adjusted using articulating paper.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finishing and Polishing using finishing stones and polishing rubber points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To evaluate clinical performance of different Techniques of Composite&#xD;
      Restorations (Indirect restorations using a CAD/CAM grinding process, BRILLIANT Crios,&#xD;
      Coltène/Whaledent AG, Switzerland or Direct a light-cured, bulk-fill nanocomposite&#xD;
