  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty syndrome (i.e. frailty) is a geriatric syndrome which relies on the reduction of&#xD;
      multisystem reserve capacity. Frail people have a lower potential to respond to external&#xD;
      stressors and various life incidents as well as they present a weak prognosis particularly in&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases. Yet, frailty is not only a set of physical deficits, but it also&#xD;
      concerns psychological and social dimensions of human functioning. Hence, an approach to&#xD;
      frailty should be multidimensional because such a concept more adequately reflects a&#xD;
      functional degradation in the elderly. Frailty is usually associated with the impaired&#xD;
      condition of circulatory system, and therefore, an identification of subclinical&#xD;
      cardiovascular abnormalities is paramount in the frailty prevention and treatment. Another&#xD;
      potential mechanism which may predispose to frailty is a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system. This system plays a crucial role in the response to internal or external stressors&#xD;
      such as diseases and activities of daily living. An impairment of the autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system function may maintain or accelerate the frailty process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this scientific project, a comprehensive echocardiography will investigate cardiac&#xD;
      function with a particular attention to features which typically change with age, like flow&#xD;
      parameters and chambers sizes. The activity of the autonomic nervous system will be explored&#xD;
      with the analysis of heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory signals. The study&#xD;
      participants will also undergo routine medical examination and a number of additional tests,&#xD;
      including: assessment of cognitive function, psychological condition, nutrition status,&#xD;
      activities of daily living, and risk of falls. The study group will comprise community&#xD;
      dwelling elderly individuals over the age of 65 years who get around by themselves. After 2&#xD;
      years, the participants will be re-examined for their frailty and independence status, as&#xD;
      well as their survival will be checked with the National Health Found electronic system. The&#xD;
      aim of this project is to seek for factors determining frailty and to explore the frailty&#xD;
      impact on the elderly people survival. Particular attention will be paid to the&#xD;
      multidimensional frailty which is a new concept of the functional decline in the elderly. In&#xD;
      addition, the prevalence of different modes of frailty in Polish community will be&#xD;
      investigated. The results of this research should help to establish preventative and&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies against frailty.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Frailty is a geriatric syndrome which relies on the reduction of multisystem reserve&#xD;
      capacity, whereas pre-frailty is a condition predisposing and preceding the frailty state.&#xD;
      Frail people have a lower potential to respond to external stressors and various life&#xD;
      incidents as well as they present a weak prognosis particularly in cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
      However, frailty is not only a set of physical deficits, but it also concerns psychological&#xD;
      and social dimensions of human functioning. Hence, an approach to frailty should be&#xD;
      multidimensional because such a concept more adequately reflects a functional degradation in&#xD;
      the elderly. Frailty is usually associated with the impaired condition of circulatory system,&#xD;
      and therefore, an identification of subclinical cardiovascular abnormalities which are&#xD;
      associated with frailty is paramount in a context of frailty prevention and treatment. In&#xD;
      this study, a comprehensive echocardiography will investigate cardiac function with a&#xD;
      particular attention to features which typically change with age, like flow and diastolic&#xD;
      parameters, as well as chambers sizes. Specifically, the impact of the impaired diastolic&#xD;
      filling pattern on the frailty development will be thoroughly investigated. Another potential&#xD;
      mechanism which may predispose to frailty is a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      (ANS) - especially, its cardiac branch. ANS plays a crucial role in the response to internal&#xD;
      or external stressors such as diseases and activities of daily living, and it plays a pivotal&#xD;
      role in the homeostasis. Since frail people present a progressive homeostatic dysregulation,&#xD;
      it is possible that the impairment in the cardiac ANS may maintain or accelerate the frailty&#xD;
      process. In the present study, both tonic and reflex activities of the cardiac ANS will be&#xD;
      explored with Finapres device (Finapres Medical Systems B.V., Amsterdam, the Netherlands)&#xD;
      which is a gold standard for non-invasive continuous blood pressure monitoring and also&#xD;
      allows ECG and respiratory signals recording. The study participants will also undergo&#xD;
      routine medical examination, standard 12-lead electrocardiography, and measurements of body&#xD;
      mass index and ankle-brachial index - the latter will reflect the degree of lower extremity&#xD;
      arterial disease. A cognitive function and a psychological condition will be evaluated with&#xD;
      the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Geriatric Depression Scale, respectively. A&#xD;
      nutrition status will be checked with the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). The Activities&#xD;
      of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) will be assessed&#xD;
      with dedicated scales. A risk of fall will be judged with the questionnaire concerning the&#xD;
      falls history and by examining a postural stability on a force plate (AccuSway, AMTI,&#xD;
      Watertown, MA, USA). The study group will comprise community dwelling elderly individuals&#xD;
      over the age of 65 years who get around by themselves. The exclusion criteria include:&#xD;
      institutionalization, inability to move around, and terminal diseases with an anticipated&#xD;
      survival of less than 1 year. After 2 and 5 years, the participants will be re-examined for&#xD;
      their frailty and independence status, and in addition, their life status will be checked&#xD;
      with national identification numbers by using the National Health Found registration system.&#xD;
      Sample size calculation indicates that the minimum sample size to investigate frailty&#xD;
      development should equal 994 subjects (1% margin of error and 95% confidence interval),&#xD;
      however, assuming 10% loss in follow-up, the final sample size is 1093 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints of this study are: (i) to identify risk factors associated with&#xD;
      multidimensional and physical frailty and pre-frailty in community dwelling elderly people&#xD;
      over the age of 65 years; (ii) to find determinants for the development of different types of&#xD;
      frailty in a prospective observation. The secondary endpoints are: (i) to explore the impact&#xD;
      of various modes of frailty and other clinical factors on the elderly people mortality; (ii)&#xD;
      to identify predictors for frailty development, disability or mortality as a composite&#xD;
      endpoint; (iii) to explore the rate and determinants of a frailty status transition to a more&#xD;
      robust status; (iv) to establish the prevalence of multidimensional frailty, and physical&#xD;
      frailty and pre-frailty in elderly people in Polish community; (v) to determine a&#xD;
      concordance/discordance between physical and multidimensional frailty.&#xD;
