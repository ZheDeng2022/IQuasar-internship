  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients with B-ALL or DLBCL (or subtypes thereof) who have relapsed or refractory disease&#xD;
        will be eligible. Refractory disease is defined by failure to achieve at least a partial&#xD;
        response or disease progression within 6 months of the last therapy. Patients who initially&#xD;
        respond but subsequently demonstrate disease progression are considered to have relapsed&#xD;
        disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - To be eligible for leukapheresis, patients must have a CD19+ B-cell malignancy with&#xD;
        relapsed or refractory disease, defined below. To be eligible for 131-I apamistamab&#xD;
        conditioning and treatment with 19-28z CAR T-cells, patients must additionally have&#xD;
        detectable evidence of residual malignancy at the time of assessment prior to CAR T-cell&#xD;
        infusion (as defined below), regardless of therapy administered following leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        a. Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (de novo or DLBCL transformed from an&#xD;
        indolent lymphoma (follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia [Richter syndrome]) or&#xD;
        high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL): (&quot;DLBCL patients&quot;) i. Defined as relapsed or refractory&#xD;
        DLBCL or high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) following 2 or more prior chemoimmunotherapy&#xD;
        regimens (with at least one course including an anthracycline and CD20-directed therapy)&#xD;
        following diagnosis of de novo DLBCL/HGBL or DLBCL arising from indolent lymphoma, and&#xD;
        requiring further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii. Patients must have at least one FDG-avid (PET-avid) measurable lesion iii. Biopsy&#xD;
        confirmation of relapsed of refractory DLBCL is required iv. For patients who have received&#xD;
        treatment for confirmed relapsed or refractory disease otherwise meeting criteria&#xD;
        a.i.-a.iii. as above, within 6 weeks of study enrollment, active disease does not need to&#xD;
        be re-confirmed or present immediately prior to Screening A for the patient to be eligible&#xD;
        for leukapheresis. However, detectable evidence of residual malignancy must be present at&#xD;
        Screening B in order for the patient to be eligible for 131-I apamistamab and CAR T-cell&#xD;
        therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        b. Patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or B lymphoblastic lymphoma (ALL) or&#xD;
        chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in lymphoid blast crisis: (&quot;B-ALL patients&quot;) i. Patients&#xD;
        with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell ALL must have been refractory to at least 1&#xD;
        line of multi-agent chemotherapy or relapsed following at least 1 prior multiagent systemic&#xD;
        chemotherapy regimen that included induction and consolidation therapy ii. Patients with&#xD;
        Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL or CML in lymphoid blast crisis must have exhibited&#xD;
        persistent disease following therapy with a second- or third-generation tyrosine kinase&#xD;
        inhibitor iii. Patients must have ≥5% bone marrow involvement and/or at least one FDG-avid&#xD;
        (PET-avid) measurable extramedullary lesion iv. For patients who have received treatment&#xD;
        for confirmed relapsed or refractory disease otherwise meeting criteria b.i.-b.iii. as&#xD;
        above, within 6 weeks of study enrollment, active disease does not need to be re-confirmed&#xD;
        or present immediately prior to Screening A for the patient to be eligible for&#xD;
        leukapheresis. However, detectable evidence of residual malignancy must be present at&#xD;
        Screening B in order for the patient to be eligible for 131-I apamistamab and CAR T-cell&#xD;
        therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  While prior CD19-targeted therapies, including CAR T-cell therapy, do not exclude&#xD;
             participation, CD19 expression by immunohistochemical staining or flow cytometry must&#xD;
             be confirmed prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;

             requiring blood product or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor support in the past 7&#xD;

             investigator:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥0.5k/µL,&#xD;
