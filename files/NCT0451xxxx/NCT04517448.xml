  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to evaluate the quality of life of patients over 75 years of age&#xD;
      undergoing palliative chemotherapy for digestive cancer. It is a non-interventional study&#xD;
      that evaluates the quality of life before and after a cycle of chemotherapy with a composite&#xD;
      criterion including: a standardized questionnaire &quot;Cancer specific quality of Life&#xD;
      questionnaire&quot; (QLQC30), an assessment of autonomy by &quot;Activity of daily living&quot;&#xD;
      questionnaire (ADL), and the number of days of hospitalization.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of patients undergoing chemotherapy continues to increase as well as the age of&#xD;
      cancer patients, it is estimated that in 2050 one cancer out of two will be discovered in a&#xD;
      person over 75 years of age. Digestive cancers account for the majority of these patients,&#xD;
      the goals of these palliative chemotherapies are to improve survival and maintain or improve&#xD;
      quality of life. Since the 2009 cancer plan, a specific geriatric onco-geriatrics&#xD;
      organization has been set up with the creation of geriatric onco-coordination units. One of&#xD;
      the objectives of this plan is to achieve a 5% inclusion rate of patients over 75 years of&#xD;
      age in clinical trials. However, there are relatively few studies in patients over 75 years&#xD;
      of age concerning quality of life, as they are often excluded from trials and survival is&#xD;
      preferred as the primary outcome. This observational study evaluates the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients at the time of the first chemotherapy treatment and then at the end of the first&#xD;
      cycle of chemotherapy at 3 months by a standardized questionnaire, an evaluation of autonomy&#xD;
      and the number of days of hospitalization.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is a composite criterion comparing the response scores to the standardized questionnaire Quality of life in cancer patient . These data will be collected during the first inpatient chemotherapy course in hospitalization and during the last chemotherapy before evaluation. A higher score would mean a worsening of the situation</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Activity of daily living score</measure>
    <time_frame>Before first chemotherapy and at Month 3 of chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome in to compare the Activity of daily living score at first chemotherapy and at the end of the first cycle at 3 months. We will collect the patient's place of residence in order to look for possible institutionalization, which is an important marker of quality of life. A higher score would mean a worsening of the situation.</description>
