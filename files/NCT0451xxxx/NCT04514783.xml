      Chronic wounds are common and carry out an important and often neglected burden not only to&#xD;
      the individual, the family but also to the society as a whole. The therapeutic approach to&#xD;
      the management of chronic wounds include wound bed preparation or wound dressing management.&#xD;
      Wound bed preparation is a concept emphasizing a holistic and systematic approach to evaluate&#xD;
      and remove barriers to the healing process to allow the wound healing process to progress&#xD;
      normally. Debridement is an integrated part of wound bed preparation, achieving certain goals&#xD;
      and, thus, creating a healthy wound bed, margins and peri-wound skin with the objective to&#xD;
      promote and accelerate healing. Debridement is defined as the removal of foreign material and&#xD;
      necrotic tissue from a wound and it can also help to stimulate wound healing. However, not&#xD;
      all methods of debridement are the same. Each method has advantages and disadvantages that&#xD;
      must be clearly understood. In the present clinical practice, there are several methods of&#xD;
      wound debridement: autolytic, enzymatic, mechanical, surgical (sharp) and biologic. The most&#xD;
      common method is the mechanical debridement. Currently a micro-water jet technique was&#xD;
      introduced into clinical practice. The micro-water jet technique Debritom+ is an effective&#xD;
      alternative to traditional instrument interventions performed with the scalpel and/or&#xD;
      curette. A sterile liquid is expelled from a nozzle at a selected intensity and accurately&#xD;
      sprayed onto the wound surface. The desired effect is the generation of targeted&#xD;
      micro-bleedings to stimulate regeneration and healing processes while preserving the&#xD;
      underlying healthy tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, there is no clinical evidence quantitatively comparing one debridement method over the&#xD;
      other. Therefore the invesitgators propose a pilot study to measure the extent of tissue loss&#xD;
      after debridement using Debritom+ micro-water jet technology versus traditional instrument&#xD;
      debridement procedure using scalpel and curette.&#xD;

      Chronic wounds (CWs) are common and carry out an important and often neglected burden not&#xD;
      only to the individual, the family but also to the society as a whole. A wound becomes&#xD;
      chronic when they fail to progress through a timely sequence of repair resulting in anatomic&#xD;
      and functional integrity within a period of approximatively three months. CWs affect a large&#xD;
      segment of the world population (3) with a prevalence of mixed aetiologies of 2.21 per 1000.&#xD;
      The annual costs of care of patients with CWs is estimated to be £6 billion for 2.2 million&#xD;
      in the United Kingdom (UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In CWs a massive production of matrix molecules resulting from underlying cellular&#xD;
      dysfunction and dysregulation can be found. Fibrinogen and fibrin are also common in chronic&#xD;
      wounds and it is thought that these and other macromolecules scavenge growth factors and&#xD;
      other molecules involved in promoting wound repair. Chronic wound fluid is also biochemically&#xD;
      distinct from acute wound fluid; it slows down, and can block the proliferation of cells,&#xD;
      which are essential for the wound healing process. The therapeutic approach to enhance the&#xD;
      wound healing process include wound bed preparation or wound dressing management. Wound bed&#xD;
      preparation as a concept allows the clinician to focus systematically on all of the critical&#xD;
      components of a non-healing wound to identify the cause of the problem, and implement a care&#xD;
      programme so as to achieve a stable wound that has healthy granulation tissue and a well&#xD;
      vascularised wound bed. Debridement is an integrated part of wound bed preparation, achieving&#xD;
      certain goals and, thus, creating a healthy wound bed, margins and peri-wound skin with the&#xD;
      objective to promote and accelerate healing (8). Debridement is defined as the removal of&#xD;
      foreign material and necrotic tissue from a wound and it can also help to stimulate wound&#xD;
      healing (8). However, not all methods of debridement are the same. Each method has advantages&#xD;
      and disadvantages that must be clearly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present clinical practice, there are several methods of wound debridement: autolytic,&#xD;
      enzymatic, mechanical, surgical (sharp) and biologic. The most common method is the&#xD;
      mechanical debridement. Autolytic, chemical, and surgical methods are considered to be&#xD;
      selective techniques, whereas mechanical methods are considered to be nonselective. Selective&#xD;
      modalities remove mainly necrotic tissue, whereas nonselective modalities remove both&#xD;
      necrotic and viable tissue. In practice, selective modalities can also remove or damage&#xD;
      healthy tissue. The most selective modalities are autolytic and biologic techniques.&#xD;
      Instrument debridement is the most used debridement method from many years. It has been shown&#xD;
      to improve wound healing and its main advantages are the low cost of treatment and the speed&#xD;
      of dead tissue removal. This method is done with the intention of removing small amounts of&#xD;
      visible devitalized tissue. However, residual nonviable tissue may remain at the microscopic&#xD;
      level resulting in slowing healing process. On the contrary, the risk of exaggerated /&#xD;
      mismanaged excision is not non-existent and can lead to damage to healthy tissue or even&#xD;
      damage to deeper structures (blood vessels, nerves, tendons or even bones), resulting in&#xD;
      delayed healing too. Instrument debridement can be painful. Patient's fear about this&#xD;
      approach is a reality that can also be problematic. Autolytic or enzymatic debridement, which&#xD;
      are more selective and less prone to patient's reluctance could remediate to this situation.&#xD;
      However, time for complete dead tissue removal is considerably increased, requiring multiple&#xD;
      applications and stringent patient compliance. While this type of debridement does not damage&#xD;
      healthy tissue and causes little or no pain, it can cause contact sensitization. Water-jet&#xD;
      debridement systems seems to pose a valid alternative to other methods. The approach is based&#xD;
      on mechanical and homogenous wound cleansing and stimulation by a micro-jet of water. It uses&#xD;
      an ultra-fine, powerful and adjustable micro-jet of water that precisely removes soft to&#xD;
      fibrous deposits from the wound. It is usually fast. Softness of the treatment depends on the&#xD;
      speed and intensity of the water jet according to wound condition. Adequate pain control&#xD;
      should be performed and surface anaesthesia may be required. Water jet debridement promotes&#xD;
      natural wound healing by inducing micro-bleeding from the wound bed and minimizes scarring.&#xD;
      While there is ample anecdotal evidence about the efficacy of such method to preserve healthy&#xD;
      tissue, the investigators propose here to document this ability by measuring precisely wound&#xD;
      depth before and after debridement using Debritom+ micro water jet technology. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to systematically assess patient's apprehension regarding this&#xD;
      technique too.&#xD;
