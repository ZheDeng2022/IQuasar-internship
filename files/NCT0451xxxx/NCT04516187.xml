  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this diagnostic accuracy study is to develop a clinical prediction rule based on&#xD;
      signs, symptoms, patient characteristics and blood tests, to be used in ambulatory care to&#xD;
      help physicians safely rule out a serious infection in an older patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be performed in general practices across Flanders (Belgium).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional diagnostic cohort study in older adults presenting to primary care,&#xD;
      including a follow-up period of 30 days. This study will be used to construct an algorithm&#xD;
      consisting of clinical features and blood test results to identify serious infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will run in general practices in Flanders. Recruitment is expected to last 20&#xD;
      months, with each patient entering the study only once. Older adults will be approached for&#xD;
      possible participation in the study by practice staff. There is only one study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who agree to participate via written informed consent will have demographics and&#xD;
      clinical features recorded. A blood sample will be taken in all participants on study entry.&#xD;
      Follow-up information for all participants will be collected using general practice notes&#xD;
      (EMD) and patient diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and other management decisions will be left to the treating physicians' discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If we are unable to reach our predefined sample size in primary care, we will also start&#xD;
      recruitment at emergency departments. In that case, we will send an amendment to this&#xD;
      protocol to the involved ethics committees.&#xD;
