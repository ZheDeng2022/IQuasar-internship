    <textblock>
      This rSO2 study is a prospective clinical study. The purpose of the rSO2 study is to&#xD;
      investigate whether there is a correlation between the intraoperative cerebral and renal&#xD;
      tissue oxygen saturation and the incidence of developmental and socioemotional delay after&#xD;
      living donor liver transplantation for children. This study will also investigate whether&#xD;
      intraoperative cerebral and renal tissue oxygen saturation are related to postoperative&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There is high incidence of developmental and socioemotional delay and postoperative&#xD;
      complications in pediatric living donor liver transplantation patients. In this prospective&#xD;
      observational clinical study, the investigators aim to investigate the correlation between&#xD;
      the intraoperative cerebral and renal tissue oxygen saturation and the incidence of&#xD;
      developmental and socioemotional delay and postoperative complications. This study will&#xD;
      enroll patients aged from 6 to 36 months old who are scheduled for elective standard&#xD;
      living-donor liver transplantation and have signed informed consent before the surgery.&#xD;
