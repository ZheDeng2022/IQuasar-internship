    <textblock>
      We aim to assess the effect of Ofatumumab on microglial activation using [F-18]PBR06 PET in&#xD;
      MS patients in relation to changes in serum markers, MRI abnormalities and clinical&#xD;
      impairment longitudinally over 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine the effect of Ofatumumab on microglial activation in MS over 9&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the time course of effect of Ofatumumab on microglial activation&#xD;
      and its relationship with peripheral B-cell depletion, serum neurofilament light (sNfL) chain&#xD;
      and glial-fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) levels and other serum biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To determine the relationship of PET changes following Ofatumumab initiation&#xD;
      with 3T MRI changes and clinical parameters.&#xD;

      Design: This is an open-label, observational, prospective, 9-month follow-up study to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy of ofatumumab on microglia pathology in patients with MS, as measured by changes&#xD;
      in microglial activation in the lesional and non-lesional, normal appearing white matter,&#xD;
      cortical and subcortical grey matter, and peri-plaque area of chronic lesions in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first visit, subjects will be adminsitered the screening questionnaire (if that&#xD;
      has not already been done over telephone). Subjects will review and eventually sign the&#xD;
      consent form. They will be administered a physical examination, clinical assessment and&#xD;
      standardized questionnaires for cognitive testing and/or other co-morbidities. In addition,&#xD;
      blood samples will be drawn for genotype testing, infection screening, complete blood count&#xD;
      and liver function test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics, physical examinations and neurologic assessments will be conducted at Partners&#xD;
      MS Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 60 Fenwood Road, Boston, MA 02115.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genotype Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sample drawn on the initial screening visit will be used to obtain genomic DNA for&#xD;
      genotyping for polymorphism within the TSPO gene on chromosome 22q13.2, using a Taqman assay.&#xD;
      High affinity and medium affinity binders will be included in the study, whereas low affinity&#xD;
      binders will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET Scanning:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, all subjects will undergo five separate visits for [F-18]PBR06 PET scans, one&#xD;
      visit before starting Ofatumumab treatment (day 0 baseline) and four more visits at&#xD;
      approximately 5, 28, 90 and 273 days after initiating treatment. During the PET scan visits,&#xD;
      all women subjects of child bearing age will undergo a stat quantitative serum hCG pregnancy&#xD;
      test and only women with a negative test will undergo the radiopharmaceutical injection. The&#xD;
      radiotracers will be produced using standardized procedures. At the time of imaging, the&#xD;
      subjects will be positioned in the gantry of a high-resolution PET/CT camera. Head alignment&#xD;
      will be made, relative to the canthomeatal line, using projected laser lines whose positions&#xD;
      are known with respect to the slice positions of the scanner. A head support apparatus will&#xD;
      be used to minimize head motion. Dynamic data over 120 minutes for PET quantification will be&#xD;
      acquired, according to previously described methods for the tracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI Scanning:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo five 3T brain MRIs with and without contrast, one before starting&#xD;
      Ofatumumab treatment (day 0 baseline) and four more at 5, 28, 90 and 273 days after&#xD;
      initiating treatment. MRI visits may precede or follow the PET scan visits within 2-3 days of&#xD;
      each other. All women will be queried about their pregnancy status, use of contraception and&#xD;
      last menstrual period. If a woman is of child bearing potential, she will undergo a urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test. Subjects will undergo intravenous gadolinium contrast administration, during&#xD;
      all visits. Hence, all women of child bearing potential will undergo urine pregnancy testing&#xD;
      for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Follow-up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will come in for five clinical visits, one visit before starting Ofatumumab&#xD;
      treatment (day 0 baseline) and four more visits at 5, 28, 90 and 273 days after initiating&#xD;
      treatment. However, if the patient meets all inclusion criteria at the screening visit, the&#xD;
      screening and baseline visits may occur on the same day. During these visits, subjects will&#xD;
      undergo a physical examination, clinical assessment and cognitive assessment using the&#xD;
      measures outlined in section e of Study Procedures. A blood sample will be drawn to determine&#xD;
      levels of sNfL, GFAP and other serum biomarkers. Visits will be conducted under the&#xD;
      supervision of PI and other board-certified neurologists. Any adverse event reported by the&#xD;
      patient or observed by the investigator will be recorded and reviewed at each clinical visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following non-imaging, clinical data will be obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Timed 25-feet walk (T25W), 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT),&#xD;
      Four component MS Functional Composite (MSFC-4), Symbol-Digit Modality test (SDMT), cognitive&#xD;
      and symptom questionnaires, vision testing, Levels of serum biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Safety Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed at 0, 3, 6, and 9 months of the study including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy Testing: All women of childbearing potential will undergo a serum pregnancy&#xD;
           test at the screening visit and at each of the following scheduled visits to the&#xD;
           hospital. The investigator will also review the contraception status of subjects at each&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG): An ECG will be performed either at the screening visit or on&#xD;
           day 0 clinical visit and at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine labs: Blood samples will be collected at the screening visit and at each visit&#xD;
           time point. Blood samples will be assessed for red blood cell count, hemoglobin,&#xD;
           hematocrit, platelets, total white blood cell (WBC) count and WBC differential counts&#xD;
           (neutrophils, lymphocytes, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes) as well as for&#xD;
           electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, bicarbonate, Ca, Mg, P), random glucose, total protein, blood&#xD;
           urea nitrogen, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, GGT, total bilirubin, conjugated&#xD;
           bilirubin, creatinine, amylase, , C-Reactive protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Samples for total IgM and IgG levels at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient diary review&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monthly telephone interview&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Administration/Dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the baseline clinic visit, subjects will be instructed by one of the&#xD;
      investigators on proper drug administration technique. The first injection of ofatumumab will&#xD;
      be performed under the guidance of an appropriately trained healthcare professional in the&#xD;
      clinical space at the Partners MS Center.&#xD;

    <description>Ofatumumab (OMB157) is a fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) self-administered by a once-monthly subcutaneous injection that is in development for MS. Ofatumumab drug product (also referred as OMB157) is formulated as 20 mg/0.4 mL (50 mg/mL) solution for injection, provided in autoinjectors, for subcutaneous administration. The autoinjectors contain a small overfill to allow for a complete withdrawal of the labeled amount (20 mg) of ofatumumab.</description>
