  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will test the efficacy of a Community Health&#xD;
      Worker/Registered Nurse (CHW-RN) HCV intervention for homeless individuals, many who are also&#xD;
      drug users. The intervention will be designed during Phase I of the proposal using an&#xD;
      iterative process between a Community Advisory Board (CAB) and focus groups. The CHW/RN&#xD;
      intervention will occur over a 2 or 3 month (8-12 weeks) period depending on the&#xD;
      Direct-Acting Antiviral (DAA) prescribed. Homeless adults assigned to the CHW/RN HCV&#xD;
      treatment group will receive culturally-sensitive education, case management, and daily DOT&#xD;
      delivery of DAA by an RN-guided CHW. The CHW will run a brief (20 min) weekly 1:1 education&#xD;
      and 20 min case management session over the 8 or 12 weeks and will deliver all components of&#xD;
      the program (which will be developed and refined during Phase I). The CHW-RN HCV intervention&#xD;
      will be compared to a clinic-based standard of care group (cbSOC). Primary outcomes are the&#xD;
      completion of the Direct-Acting Agent (DAA) treatment (month 2 or 3) and SVR12 Cure (month 5&#xD;
      or 6). Secondary outcomes are improved mental health status, decrease in substance use, and&#xD;
      improved access to health care, and shelter stability at month 5 or 6.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HCV infection disproportionately affects homeless and drug-using populations and represents a&#xD;
      critical focus for effective HCV prevention at the individual and community level. Homeless&#xD;
      persons have a 26 fold increase in HCV prevalence compared to the general population;&#xD;
      particularly with injection drug use (IDU). In fact, 50-80% of HCV infection is among persons&#xD;
      who inject drugs (PWID). Among homeless populations, risk factors for HCV include older age,&#xD;
      IDU, needle sharing, previous incarceration, veteran status, fair-or-poor health status, and&#xD;
      sharing toothbrushes. Among the 48% of HCV-infected homeless persons who did not inject&#xD;
      drugs, correlates of HCV infection include older age, less education, use of drugs, and&#xD;
      history of multiple tattoos. While HCV treatment for PWID can reduce HCV prevalence, despite&#xD;
      recommended guidelines, only 1-6% of drug-using HCV-infected persons have received treatment.&#xD;
      Among the homeless adults, factors associated with low HCV treatment completion include&#xD;
      untreated mental illness, current substance use, unstable housing, and limited access to&#xD;
      care. Although the new Direct Acting Agent (DAA) are costly, cure rates have risen to above&#xD;
      98%. Yet limited research has been conducted on DAA agents among drug-using homeless adults.&#xD;
      Extending HCV treatment beyond the traditional tertiary care model and involving peer&#xD;
      supports can facilitate access to HCV treatment. The scientific premise of this proposal is&#xD;
      that homeless HCV positive adults often do not obtain/complete HCV treatment due to&#xD;
      significant psychosocial barriers. Thus, developing and testing a strategy that combines&#xD;
      treatment with psychosocial support would be expected to change this outcome. To our&#xD;
      knowledge, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has yet assessed the efficacy of a&#xD;
      comprehensive community-based model that incorporates HCV and substance use treatment to&#xD;
      address HCV among homeless persons, despite the critical need that exists. The proposed&#xD;
      treatment concept - Community Health Worker/Registered Nurse (CHW-RN) - is innovative and&#xD;
      helps HCV treatment reach beyond the clinic walls, directly into the community where the&#xD;
      homeless reside, reducing barriers to treatment. Guided by our community-based model, the&#xD;
      CHW/RN intervention will focus on improving social support, coping skills, problem-solving,&#xD;
      self-management, physical and mental health, substance use, and stable housing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will contribute to our knowledge about culturally-sensitive strategies for&#xD;
      HCV treatment among homeless adults, many of whom use drugs and alcohol. It will address a&#xD;
      substantial health disparity in a historically underserved population, with broader&#xD;
      implications for public health. While DAAs have not been assessed among homeless adults using&#xD;
      RCTs, homeless persons who are active drug users, in particular, have had challenges with&#xD;
      uptake and compliance of other HCV treatments. To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the&#xD;
      effect of a CHW/RN HCV treatment program, delivered in the community where the participant&#xD;
      lives, compared to a cbSOC model to assess HCV treatment completion and Sustained Virologic&#xD;
      Response (SVR) after 12 weeks of treatment completion. For further innovation, we will now&#xD;
      evaluate the extent to which the pathways posed by the CHSCP and similar models, including&#xD;
      the BMVP affect health outcomes by adding to Aim 3 analyses an examination of mechanisms of&#xD;
      therapeutic change by the mediating effects of improved psychosocial and structural factors&#xD;
      (e.g. housing, social support, etc ) on improved rates of SVR12. Improved understanding of&#xD;
      the mechanisms of effect will advance the understanding of these factors and their role in&#xD;
      determining health outcomes. The proposed study will pretest an RN-guided, CHW-delivered,&#xD;
      program wherein a CHW/RN program will be developed and pretested with the community through&#xD;
      focus group methodology. The intervention will focus on improving the completion of HCV&#xD;
      treatment, reducing drug and alcohol use, reducing mental illness, and improving housing&#xD;
      stability. The findings of this study can lay the groundwork for a subsequent larger trial to&#xD;
      test the efficacy of the developed CHW/RN program more broadly and may inform health policy&#xD;
      that could encourage enrollment of this high-risk group into HCV treatment. Results may also&#xD;
      inform future cost-effective, community-based interventions that could be scaled-up and&#xD;
      disseminated more broadly. Employing a treatment-as-prevention focus of HCV transmission in&#xD;
      the community is urgent since HCV among the homeless represents a reservoir for HCV infection&#xD;
      in the general population.&#xD;

    <description>A team of 2-3 CHWs and a research RN will deliver all components of the program including daily DOT delivery of Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA) and assess HCV side effects all under the guidance of their RN. Recruitment will be continuous: each CHW may be assigned up to 7-8 participants every 2-3 months until the target sample size (n=54 for the intervention group) is achieved. After the first dose of the DAA, the CHW will run a brief weekly 1:1 education and case management session over the 8 or 12 weeks (total 20 minutes). The CHW/RN team will assist the participant in picking up the monthly medication and storing the medication in a secure, locked cabinet at the research office. The CHW will rigorously track participants who have missed a dose, and will also be involved in facilitating medical, mental health, substance use, social service, legal appointments for participants, housing referrals, and accompany the participants to the appointments.</description>

    <description>This program will be delivered by a clinic-based MD or clinic-based NP at the clinic site. Evaluation Staff (ES) will be hired and trained to do the interviewing/survey administration and follow-ups at the clinic-based site. The clinic NP will conduct, per usual care at the study clinics, the education and monitoring of these participants who will interact with the clinic-based-MD and/or NP monthly over the 8 or 12-week program. Usual care will include: 1) HCV pre-treatment education; 2) two month supply of DAA; 3) monitoring adverse events; and 4) responding to questions on HCV. Referral to drug/alcohol and housing programs will be provided over the standard of care. The cbSOC participants will not receive the community delivery of the DAA, or case management, or accompaniment to needed services. The cbSOC Program will receive the medication on a monthly basis from the clinic MD or NP.</description>
