  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies find that anesthetic methods may influence the recurrence of tumor and the&#xD;
      overall survival of patients after primary cancer surgery. Radiofrequency (RF) ablation is&#xD;
      now widely used in the clinic for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Currently,&#xD;
      diverse anesthetic methods, including general anesthesia (GA), epidural anesthesia and local&#xD;
      anesthesia (LA), are used for RF ablation surgery. Using serum from HCC surgery patients&#xD;
      randomized to receive either GA or LA during surgery, we will investigate the effects of&#xD;
      anesthetic methods on cellular invasion, migration and proliferation of HepG2 hepatic cancer&#xD;
      cells in vitro. The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum from patients of&#xD;
      both groups will also be analyzed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing elective radiofrequency&#xD;
      (RF) ablation surgery will be randomly allocated to general anesthesia(GA) group or local&#xD;
      anesthesia(LA) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from GA group will receive anesthesia induced with 0.05-0.1mg/kg intravenous&#xD;
      midazolam, 3-6ug/kg fentanyl, 1.0-2.5mg/kg propofol and 0.1-0.2mg/kg atracurium. Laryngeal&#xD;
      mask will be used to maintain ventilation. Anesthesia will be maintained with 4-8mg/kg/h&#xD;
      propofol and 0.1-0.3ug/kg/min remifentanil, and additional non-depolarizing muscle relaxant&#xD;
      when necessary. In patients from LA group, analgesia will be provided by a subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection of 2% lidocaine by the surgeons before insertion of the needles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum will be collected from patients of both groups at before induction and 1h post-surgery.&#xD;
      The HepG2 hepatic cancer cell line will be treated with patient serum from both groups. The&#xD;
      effects of anesthetic methods on cellular invasion, migration, proliferation will be&#xD;
      measured. The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum from patients of both&#xD;
      groups will also be analyzed.&#xD;
