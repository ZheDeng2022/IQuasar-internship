    <textblock>
      This is a single center study of 60 subjects including those with asthma and mucus plugging,&#xD;
      those with asthma and without mucus plugging, and healthy controls. Screening data will be&#xD;
      reviewed to determine participant eligibility. Participants who meet all inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will participate in image-guided bronchoscopy (&quot;virtual navigation bronchoscopy&quot; [VNB]) to&#xD;
      sample airway biospecimens in mucus plugged and control airways.&#xD;

      This is a single center study of 60 subjects. The investigators will enroll 30 subjects with&#xD;
      asthma who demonstrate mucus plugging on a screening CT lung scan, 15 subjects with asthma&#xD;
      without mucus plugging, and 15 healthy controls. The healthy controls and subjects with&#xD;
      asthma but without mucus plugging with also undergo CT scans to confirm that their lungs&#xD;
      aren't obstructed by mucus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening data will be reviewed to determine participant eligibility. Participants who meet&#xD;
      all inclusion criteria will participate in image-guided bronchoscopy (&quot;virtual navigation&#xD;
      bronchoscopy&quot; [VNB]) to sample airway biospecimens in mucus plugged and control airways.&#xD;
      Subjects will participate in up to 5 study visits at the Airway Clinical Research Center.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will examine differences in type-2 inflammatory markers in bronchoalveolar biospecimens. Eosinophils are an indicator of type 2 inflammation in bronchial lavage samples. Indicators of airway inflammation will be compared with healthy control biospecimens and those of non-mucus plugged asthmatics.</description>
