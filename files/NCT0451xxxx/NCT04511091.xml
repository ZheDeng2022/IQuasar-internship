  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background VATS lobectomy centers face pressure to reduce hospitalization to contain costs,&#xD;
      and some centers have sought to develop &quot;fast-track&quot; protocols. There are limited data to&#xD;
      identify which patients would be appropriate for fast-tracking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The first objective was to identify factors associated to short lenght of stay&#xD;
      after VATS lobectomy. The second objective was to verify the influence of these variables in&#xD;
      uncomplicated VATS lobectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods We reviewed all thoracoscopic lobectomies for cancer operations reported to the&#xD;
      Italian VATS Group between January 2014 and January 2020. Patient and procedural&#xD;
      characteristics, length of stay and 30-day morbidity and mortality were reviewed. Patients&#xD;
      were divided into two subgroups depending on their reaching the targeted length of stay (≤ or&#xD;
      &gt; 4 days). The association between preoperative and intraoperative variables and&#xD;
      postoperative length of stay (LOS) ≤ 4 days was assessed using a stepwise multivariate&#xD;
      logistic regression analysis to identify factors independently associated with LOS and&#xD;
      factors related to LOS in uncomplicated cases.&#xD;

      Data source The Italian VATS Group Database is a validated, risk-adjusted, prospective,&#xD;
      outcomes-based program with 50 participating hospitals in Italy. The VATS Group Database&#xD;
      collects data on different variables on a standardized data form: patient demographics&#xD;
      informations, surgical interventions, medical history, cancer staging and outcome. Patients'&#xD;
      outcomes are reviewed and records are updated the first time at 30 days after surgery, then&#xD;
      at 180 days. Next update is recorded at 6 months from surgery and every 6 months for the&#xD;
      first 2 years of follow-up, and annually thereafter. The VATS Group Database implements&#xD;
      rigorous quality assurance and safety procedures to maintain a high level of accuracy and&#xD;
      security of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been approved by hospital ethics committee. The current analysis was reviewed&#xD;
      and approved for scientific merit and feasibility by the VATS Group Scientific Committee and&#xD;
      presented at the annual VATS Group meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population and study design Study population consisted of patients who received&#xD;
      intended VATS lobectomy as the primary procedure for NSCLC at VATS Group participating&#xD;
      centres and included in the VATS Group database between January 2014 and January 2020. We&#xD;
      excluded all patients with incomplete clinical, intraoperative and postoperative data. Data&#xD;
      entered from centers sporadically (less than 10 cases per year) were also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to analyse the factors related to lenght of stay, the study design provides a&#xD;
      comparison between two groups of patients: the first group, identified as &quot;LOS ≤ 4&quot; including&#xD;
      all patient disharged within 4 days after surgery, while the second group, called &quot;LOS &gt; 4&quot;&#xD;
      including all cases discharged after the fourth postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covariates We compared selected clinical variables to analyse the presence of a possible&#xD;
      association with lenght of stay: data were divided into preoperative, intraoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, three groups were made according to the number of cases entered by the different&#xD;
      centers and considered as a possible influential variable: group A (less than 50 cases),&#xD;
      group B (number of cases between 51 and 100) and group C (above 100 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Patient baseline demographic and comorbidity variables were analyzed&#xD;
      using frequencies and proportions for categorical variables and means, standard deviations&#xD;
      (SDs), medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparisons between groups (LOS ≤ 4 vs LOS &gt; 4) categories were made by the following&#xD;
      tests: Student t-test for continuous variables with approximately normal distribution,&#xD;
      non-parametric Wilcoxon Mann Whitney test for other numerical variables and for categorical&#xD;
      variables Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact test in the case of low-volume&#xD;
      categories were adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the factors independently associated with the hospital stay outcome we used&#xD;
      simple logistic regression models with the variables of interest, and a simplified multiple&#xD;
      model with a stepwise backward procedure to obtain a more parsimonious model that contained&#xD;
      only the significant factors. Covariates of interest were patients' demographics, co-&#xD;
      morbidities, hospital lobectomy volume , operative features, pain relief techniques, type of&#xD;
      surcial approach. A significance level of 0.2 was required to enter the model and a level of&#xD;
      0.05 was required to remain in the model. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals (95% CIs) were presented. All P-values are two sided with statistical significance&#xD;
      evaluated at the 0.05 α level. All tests were performed with Stata 13.0 statistical software&#xD;
      (Stata Corp, College Station, TX).&#xD;

    <description>VATS lobectomy allows surgeons to carry out exactly the same operation within the chest that is performed by thoracotomy, but it is done through 3-4 small incisions without rib spreading rather than the large incision with rib spreading that a thoracotomy entails. The surgeon gains his view inside the chest from a small video camera inserted through one of the small incisions, and the procedure is carried out with long instruments passed through the other small incisions.</description>
