      This research evaluates the effects of prenatal factors on adverse pregnancy outcomes, the&#xD;
      general demographic information, the level of maternal exposure to air pollution, the&#xD;
      environmental condition, pregnancy-related information, the occurrence of adverse pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes, and serum indicators of pregnant women during pregnancy are collected. Finally, the&#xD;
      research explores that whether prenatal factors including environment can mediate the&#xD;
      occurrence of maternal hemorrhage.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The degree of hemoglobin changes before and after delivery can be used as an index, to&#xD;
      accurately estimate postpartum hemorrhage in clinical practice. Postpartum hemorrhage is the&#xD;
      leading cause of maternal death in the world, accounting for 30% of maternal deaths. Studies&#xD;
      have shown that most deaths caused by postpartum hemorrhage are avoidable. Domestic and&#xD;
      foreign literature reports that the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage is 5%~10%, however,&#xD;
      the amount of blood loss clinically estimated is often lower than the actual amount, the&#xD;
      actual incidence of postpartum hemorrhage is higher. A large number of studies have confirmed&#xD;
      that maternal exposure to air pollution during pregnancy such as particulate matter (PM),&#xD;
      nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO) can increase&#xD;
      the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including miscarriage, gestational diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus(GDM), hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy, preterm birth and low birth&#xD;
      weight(LBW). So, a prospective cohort study is conducted to explore the influence of prenatal&#xD;
      factors and environment on maternal hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research content: This research is a prospective cohort study from June 2020 to December&#xD;
      2022, 500 pregnant women will be recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an&#xD;
      Jiaotong University and First Affiliated Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University.&#xD;
      A health management birth cohort will be established. ①To construct a spatial and temporal&#xD;
      series about maternal hemorrhage influenced by maternal exposure to air pollution during&#xD;
      pregnancy; ②To explore the effects of prenatal factors and environment on maternal&#xD;
      hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research meaning：① Practical significance: To explore the factors that affect maternal&#xD;
      hemorrhage, and to reduce the occurrence of postpartum hemorrhage, which contributes to&#xD;
      reducing the healthy risks and medical economic burdens caused by the healthy problems of&#xD;
      mothers and children. ② To define the critical period of the developing of maternal&#xD;
      hemorrhage in spatial and temporal series, and to calculate the cutoff value of air pollution&#xD;
      on maternal hemorrhage, propose short-term control target of air pollution related to&#xD;
      maternal and child health, construct the first-level prevention strategy for adverse&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research steps: ① Complete the recruiting of subjects, which meet the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria sign an informed consent before the carrying out of research; ② Follow up:&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be conducted to acquire the information including sociodemographic&#xD;
      characteristics, menstrual history and childbearing history, residence during pregnancy,&#xD;
      lifestyle and diet habits, the information of illness and medication, history of past&#xD;
      illness, etc. Then the maternal exposure level of air pollutants in every trimester will be&#xD;
      calculated, based on air pollution detection station, from Shaanxi Meteorological and&#xD;
      Environment Bureau according to residence information of participants; ③ Serum indicators:&#xD;
      fasting venous blood samples will be taken before and after childbirth to detect serum level&#xD;
      of hemoglobin, all the blood samples will be taken and tested in the laboratory of the First&#xD;
      Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University and First Affiliated Hospital of the Fourth&#xD;
      Military Medical University; ④ Monitoring of postpartum hemorrhage: closely monitor the&#xD;
      volume of blood loss. During the whole study period, the subjects could withdraw the cohort&#xD;
      at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prenatal hemoglobin level: blood hemoglobin level within one week before delivery; Postpartum&#xD;
      hemoglobin level: blood hemoglobin level 1 day after delivery; The difference of hemoglobin&#xD;
      before and after delivery: prenatal hemoglobin level minus postpartum hemoglobin level (if he&#xD;
      patient received red blood cell transfusion during this period, this value is the degree of&#xD;
      hemoglobin change after calibration); The 24 h postpartum hemorrhage is calculated as 400 ml&#xD;
      for every 10g/L drop in hemoglobin; Birth weight: the weight of newborn within the first&#xD;
      hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical method: ①Univariate analysis: The maternal exposure levels of air pollution&#xD;
      during pregnancy will be treated as independent variables, postpartum hemorrhage will be&#xD;
      treated as dependent variables, univariate logistic regression will be used to analyze the&#xD;
      relationship between them; ②Multivariate analysis: postpartum hemorrhage will be taken as&#xD;
      dependent variables, maternal exposure levels, sociodemographic characteristics, nutritional&#xD;
      status, dietary status, and other factors are included as independent variables, the&#xD;
      multivariate logistic regression analysis will be used to data analysis. In the multivariate&#xD;
      regression the odds ration value and 95% confidence intervention of air pollution to affect&#xD;
      adverse pregnancy outcomes will be calculated adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics,&#xD;
      nutrition, dietary conditions and other factors; ③Spatial and temporal series analysis will&#xD;
      be adapted to define the critical period of the developing of postpartum hemorrhage under&#xD;
      maternal exposure to air pollution, and calculate the cut-off value of air pollution about&#xD;
      postpartum hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research planning: ①Complete research design, follow-up questionnaires, and pre-experiments&#xD;
      before July 2020; ②Complete enrollment of subjects, collect pregnancy-related information,&#xD;
      follow-up of the study subjects, detecting of serum indicators, monitor the occurrence of&#xD;
      postpartum hemorrhage before July 2022; ③Complete data export and analysis about basic&#xD;
      information and data analysis; ④Clarify the relationship between maternal air pollution&#xD;
      exposure during pregnancy and postpartum hemorrhage, explore the potential mechanism in the&#xD;
      occurrence of postpartum hemorrhage influenced by prenatal factors and environment.&#xD;
