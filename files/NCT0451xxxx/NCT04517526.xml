  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer still occupies the highest incidence and mortality rate in the wordwild, and&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 80% to 85% of all lung cancers.&#xD;
      Currently, immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 have become one of the new&#xD;
      standard treatments for advanced NSCLC in some molecular subtypes. In the Asian population,&#xD;
      EGFR mutations are the most important molecular subtype in lung cancer patients, with an&#xD;
      incidence of 39.6% in NSCLC and even more than 50% in adenocarcinoma. EGFR-TKIs are still the&#xD;
      first-line treatment for advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC and can induce a rapid response in this&#xD;
      type of NSCLC, but acquired resistance usually occurs between 9 and 16-18 months (three&#xD;
      generations of TKI), and the mechanism is complex. Subsequent treatment options are&#xD;
      challenging. In contrast, immune checkpoint inhibitors have a specific role in improving the&#xD;
      immune status of cancer patients, which may lead to sustained disease control. Clinical&#xD;
      studies have shown that the regimen of pemetrexed/platinum-based chemotherapy combined&#xD;
      with/PD-L1 inhibitors and bevacizumab has been effective in patients with EGFR-sensitive&#xD;
      mutations. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that EGFR-TKIs can modulate the tumor&#xD;
      immune microenvironment and optimize the anti-tumor activity, thus enhancing the benefit of&#xD;
      PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in patients with NSCLC. In addition, recent studies have shown that&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT/SRT) also performs well in the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with stage IV NSCLC and can bring survival benefits to patients with advanced disease. We&#xD;
      propose to design a prospective, multicenter, phase II clinical study of platinum-containing&#xD;
      dual-drug chemotherapy + bevacizumab + SBRT/SRT for EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      with first-line progression of Osimertinib, taking into account the current clinical research&#xD;
      status. The Durvalumab regimen consists of 4 to 6 cycles of bevacizumab and/or Durvalumab&#xD;
      maintenance therapy until disease progression, with stereotactic radiotherapy to&#xD;
      oligoprogression sites, with the ultimate expectation of long-term survival benefit for this&#xD;
      group of patients. The primary endpoints are PFS, overall OS, secondary endpoints are&#xD;
      treatment-related toxicity, disease control rate, and exploratory endpoints are molecular&#xD;
      markers of potential efficacy and toxicity,&#xD;
