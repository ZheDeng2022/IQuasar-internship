  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this experiment the investigators would like to test a new new human itch model based on&#xD;
      papain, and to characterize the sensory quality and temporary aspects of papain skin prick&#xD;
      test (SPT) in comparison to the inactivated-cowhage delivery system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most used model of non-histaminergic itch is cowhage but this models presents several&#xD;
      problems, such us the impossibility of standardizing the amount of the spicules inserted in&#xD;
      the skin and the difficulty of obtaining the substance. These aspects bring us the necessity&#xD;
      to find a new and more standardized model of non-histaminergic itch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Papain is a cysteine protease extracted from papaya plant that is known to cause itch if&#xD;
      applied to the skin. For these reasons the investigators would like to test a new new human&#xD;
      itch model based on papain, and to characterize the sensory quality and temporary aspects of&#xD;
      papain skin prick test (SPT) in comparison to the inactivated-cowhage delivery system.&#xD;

    <measure>Measuring Alloknesis</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Alloknesis is measured by using mildly pruritic, non-painful von Frey nylon filaments of a predetermined intensity (generally 5-30 milliNewton of force). This stimulator is applied 0.5 cm outside the area of itch provocation.</description>

    <measure>Measurement of Cold Detection Thresholds (CDT)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The tests for thermal sensation will all be conducted using a PATHWAY ATS (Medoc Ltd, Israel) thermal sensory testing device. A thermode stimulator of 3x3 cm will be placed on the treated/placebo areas and kept in place by means of Velcro tape. During the first 8 seconds, the temperature decreases 1°C per second from a starting temperature of 32°C until the subject perceives a temperature change (cold sensation) and presses a button that will terminate the measurement and return the temperature to baseline at a rate of 5°C /s. A cut-off temperature of 0°C will be used.</description>
