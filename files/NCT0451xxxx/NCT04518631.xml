  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Teachers in Hong Kong are susceptible to professional stress and its associated psychosomatic&#xD;
      illnesses. To enhance teachers' well-being, mindfulness training is conducted in local&#xD;
      schools. The present study is a randomized controlled trial to investigate 1) the effects of&#xD;
      mindfulness training on teachers' well-being (i.e. general health, positive affect, life&#xD;
      satisfaction, stress, negative affect), and 2) the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of&#xD;
      mindfulness (i.e. emotional care strategies including anchoring, decentering, and&#xD;
      acceptance). Participants will be randomized to either intervention (8-week .b Foundations/&#xD;
      .begin course) or waiting-list control condition. They will complete survey before&#xD;
      (baseline), after (post-intervention), and two-months (follow-up) after the intervention.&#xD;
