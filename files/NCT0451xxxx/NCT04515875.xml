      The investigators developed and tested the Daily Engagement in Meaningful Activities (DEMA)&#xD;
      intervention to improve life satisfaction and health outcomes for patients and caregivers.&#xD;
      DEMA is a positive health focused, theoretically grounded, tailored, family-centered,&#xD;
      multi-faceted intervention. Over 7 session, dyads work with a nurse to 1) identify meaningful&#xD;
      activities, assess capacity, problem-solve barriers, and establish routines for engagement&#xD;
      and 2) learn more about MCI by working through six Self-Management Toolkit topics (e.g.,&#xD;
      benefits of meaningful activity; planning the future). The investigators' purpose is to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of DEMA in a two-group randomized controlled trial with 200&#xD;
      patient/caregiver dyads (DEMA intervention vs. the information support (IS) attention control&#xD;
      group).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20% of Americans over 65 have mild cognitive impairment (MCI), defined as&#xD;
      experiencing more memory problems than normally expected with aging, but no other symptoms of&#xD;
      dementia such as impaired judgment or reasoning. Persons with MCI (patients) are at great&#xD;
      risk for developing dementia (10-33% per year). Memory problem (poor executive function)&#xD;
      diminish the patient's confidence and ability to perform meaningful and/or important&#xD;
      activities (e.g. socialization, medication management).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deteriorating life satisfaction in patients and care partners (caregivers) is a prevalent&#xD;
      problem due to diminished meaningful activity engagement which occurs as a result of patient&#xD;
      frustration and embarrassment, lack of self-efficacy (confidence), and diminishing activity&#xD;
      performance. As a result, patients experience additional negative health outcomes: 38% report&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and anxiety. Caregivers often lack confidence to manage their own and the&#xD;
      patient's daily challenges and meaningful activity engagement, leading to high caregiver&#xD;
      burden, depressive symptoms, and anxiety. As a dyad, both patients and caregivers report&#xD;
      diminished satisfaction within their communication and relationship due to disagreement about&#xD;
      the patient's functional ability to effectively and safely perform meaningful activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging evidence indicates regular engagement in social, physical or cognitive activities&#xD;
      can improve life satisfaction, activity performance, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and dyad&#xD;
      communication; health outcomes are even better when the activities are self-selected and&#xD;
      meaningful. To promote patients' and caregivers' life satisfaction and health outcomes,&#xD;
      interventions to maximize patients' capacity for full engagement in meaningful activities are&#xD;
      essential; yet, there is a marked absence of such empirically validated interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators developed and tested the Daily Engagement in Meaningful Activities (DEMA)&#xD;
      intervention to improve life satisfaction and health outcomes for patients and caregivers.&#xD;
      DEMA is a positive health focused, theoretically grounded, tailored, family-centered,&#xD;
      multi-faceted intervention. Over 7 session, dyads work with a nurse to 1) identify meaningful&#xD;
      activities, assess capacity, problem-solve barriers, and establish routines for engagement&#xD;
      and 2) learn more about MCI by working through six Self-Management Toolkit topics (e.g.,&#xD;
      benefits of meaningful activity; planning the future).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' purpose is to evaluate the efficacy of DEMA in a two-group randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial with 200 patient/caregiver dyads (DEMA intervention vs. the information&#xD;
      support (IS) attention control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 (Primary Objective): Test DEMA's efficacy for improving life satisfaction in patients&#xD;
      and their caregivers over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 (Secondary Objective): Over time, evaluate DEMA's efficacy for patient and caregiver&#xD;
      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. increase patient activity performance and diminish depressive symptoms and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis 2.1: Compared to the IS group, patients receiving DEMA will have improved&#xD;
           activity performance and decreased depressive symptoms and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. decrease caregivers burden, depressive symptoms, and anxiety . Hypothesis 2.2: Compared&#xD;
           to the IS group, caregivers receiving DEMA will have decreased burden, depressive&#xD;
           symptoms, and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Explore improvement in health outcomes over time in the sub-sample of patients with&#xD;
      depressive symptoms using the (PHQ)-9 ≥ 5 at baseline) and explore the burden on caregivers&#xD;
      when patients have PHQ-9 is &gt;5. Compared to the non-depressed participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3.1. Patients with depressive symptoms (scores &gt; 5 on PHQ-9 measured at baseline)&#xD;
      will have improved activity performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3.2 Caregivers of patients with depressed symptoms (scores &gt; 5 on PHQ-9 measured&#xD;
      at baseline) will report reduced burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses 3.3. Patients with depressive symptoms (scores &gt; 5 on PHQ-9 measured at baseline)&#xD;
      and their caregivers randomized to DEMA will report improved: confidence to manage daily&#xD;
      challenges, communication satisfaction, life satisfaction, relationship satisfaction,&#xD;
      decreased depressive symptoms and anxiety.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Following consent, the project manager will arrange a time convenient for patient-caregiver dyads to separately complete the baseline (T1) measures by phone. A data collector, blinded to randomization status, will administer all measures at all time points via phone interviews in a quiet, private setting and be available for questions following data collection. Immediately following completion of the T1 measures; and enter patient scores on the PHQ-9 depression scale directly to the database. A web-based computer-generated stratified randomization scheme will be used to assign the patient-caregiver dyads to DEMA or the information support group in 1:1 ratio using a block-randomized approach stratified on a depression score PHQ-9 ≤ 4 vs. PHQ-9 ≥ 5 or higher will be used to determine the randomization scheme. The Project Manager will immediately schedule Session 1. Only the statistician, PI, project manager, and the intervener will know the patient-caregiver dyad's randomization status.</masking_description>

    <description>The Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale (COS), a 15-item with a 7-point scale, self-report inventory, will be utilized to assess family caregiver outcomes. The scale has been used in family caregivers of those with a variety of other chronic conditions (Bakas, Champion, Perkins, Farran, &amp; Williams, 2006; Pressler, 2008). It is one of recommendation instruments that can be used to identify priority areas for nursing intervention designed to improve caregivers' outcomes (Bakas et al., 2006; Deeken, Taylor, Mangran, Yabroff, &amp; Ingham, 2003). It includes caregiver's financial well-being, level of energy, role functioning, physical functioning, and general health. The internal consistency reliability was provided alpha = .90 (Bakas et al., 2006). The scale takes about 5 minutes to complete it.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline DDS at 10 days post-intervention evaluation, 3 months post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Dementia Deficits Scale (DDS), patient version is used to assess MCI patients' awareness of the performance capacity (Snow et al., 2004). This multidimensional scale measures memory, attention, orientation, language, executive functioning, emotional and behavioral symptoms, and functional abilities. The patient rates him or herself performance capacity. Items are coded &quot;0&quot; if the deficit or symptom is not present or &quot;1&quot; if the deficit/symptom is present. The total score ranges from 0 to 35. The internal reliability for DDS with patient version was 0.77 to 0.91(Snow et al., 2004). The scale takes about 12 minutes to complete it.</description>

    <description>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)-Importance subscale will be used to assess MCI patient's meaningful daily activities (Law et al., 1994). It is a generic measure with a semi-structured interview in which the patient is encouraged to identify problems in self-care, productivity or leisure activities. It is a widely known and valuable tool to assist in client-centered physical activity intervention studies. It concerns those activities the patient wants, needs, or is expected to do, but cannot to do, or those in which the patient is not satisfied with current performance. Then the patients will rate importance of the problems on a 10-point scale from &quot;Not important at all&quot; to &quot;extremely important&quot; (score 10). The internal reliability was 0.86 to 0.95 (Law et al., 1994)</description>

    <description>The 6-item Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) is used to assess participants (patient/caregivers) perception of intervention credibility/expectancy (Devilly &amp; Borkovece, 2000). This multidimensional scale measures credibility and expectancy of intervention or program. The scale is from 1 to 9. The item coded 1 to 3 for &quot;Not at all&quot;, 4 to 6 for Somewhat, or Very for 7 to 9. The items 1, 2, and 3 are loading on factor credibility; the items 4, 5, and 6 are loading on factor expectancy. The total score ranges from 1 to 42. The internal reliability of CEQ was 0.79 to 0.90 (Devilly &amp; Borkovece, 2000). The scale takes about 3 minutes to complete it.</description>

    <measure>Six-item Screener [Completed by caregiver]</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-consent</time_frame>
    <description>The six-item screener is a subset of the full MMSE, a brief cognitive screener with acceptable sensitivity (86%) and specificity (91%) for identifying subjects with cognitive impairment (Callahan, Unverzagt, Hui, Perkins, &amp; Hendrie, 2002). It can be readily incorporated into an initial patient assessment of eligibility. The scale takes only 1 to 2 minutes to complete as compared with 7 to 15 minutes for longer scales. In addition, the six-item screener can be easily administered by telephone or in face-to-face interviews. The research can alter the cut-off score to match the goals of the study and the targeted population and diagnosing dementia using a cut-off score of 5 (range of possible scores 0-8 (Callahan et al., 2002). This measure has been used for identify family caregivers with cognitive impairment and it took only 2 minutes to complete it.</description>

    <measure>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) [Completed by Patient]</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-consent</time_frame>
    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a rapid screening instrument designed to help health professionals detect mild cognitive dysfunction (Nasreddine et al., 2003; Nasreddine et al., 2005). It assess numerous cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstrutional skills, conceptual thinking, calculation, and orientation. Time to administer is approximately 10 minutes. The total possible scores is 30 points; a score of 26 or above is considered normal. The test-reliability was .92 and the internal consistency was .83 ( Nasreddine et al., 2005). The high sensitivity of MoCA was found for identifying both AD and MCI patients (100% and 90%, respectively), specificity of the MoCA (defined as the ability to identify non-cognitively impaired subjects) was 87%. Positive and negative predictive values were also high for both AD patients (89% and 100%, respectively) and MCI patients (89% and 91%, respectively) (Nasreddine et al., 2005).</description>
