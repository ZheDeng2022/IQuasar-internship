    <textblock>
      As the population ages and medical progress is made, many elderly patients that previously&#xD;
      would not have been candidates for surgery are now undergoing operations. In this group of&#xD;
      older patients, brain dysfunction after anesthesia and surgery, naming post-operative&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction, is well known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a term used to describe subtle changes in&#xD;
      cognition, such as memory and executive function. The most commonly seen problems are memory&#xD;
      impairment and impaired performance on intellectual tasks. In severe cases, it can lead to&#xD;
      inability to perform daily living functions. It was previously found that the presence of&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction 3 months after non-cardiac surgery was associated with increased&#xD;
      mortality. The mechanisms leading to cognitive impairment after anesthesia and surgery are&#xD;
      not yet fully clear. The risk factors are related to patient characteristics, type of&#xD;
      operation and anesthetic management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have recently shown that using different electrophysiological markers, they&#xD;
      can monitor attention and perception which might be associated with brain frailty and brain&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this proof of concept study are: (i) to find-out whether attention processes&#xD;
      might be in association with brain frailty. (ii) to find our whether brain injury which is&#xD;
      expressed by interhemispheric synchronization is is associated with POCD; (iii) to find out&#xD;
      whether the level of anesthesia, as measured electrophysiological by perception might be&#xD;
      linked primary to POCD.&#xD;

      As the population ages and medical progress is made, many elderly patients that previously&#xD;
      would not have been candidates for surgery are now undergoing operations. In this group of&#xD;
      older patients, brain dysfunction after anesthesia and surgery is well recognized, naming&#xD;
      post-operative cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a term used to describe subtle changes in&#xD;
      cognition, such as memory and executive function. The most commonly seen problems are memory&#xD;
      impairment and impaired performance on intellectual tasks. In severe cases, it can lead to&#xD;
      inability to perform daily living functions. The reported incidence figures for postoperative&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction vary depending on the group of patients studied, the definition of POCD&#xD;
      used, the tests used to establish the diagnosis and their statistical evaluation, the timing&#xD;
      of testing, and the choice of control group. The diagnosis of POCD relies on the availability&#xD;
      of the neuropsychological tests. In a large prospective multicenter cohort study, it was&#xD;
      found that the presence of cognitive dysfunction 3 months after noncardiac surgery was&#xD;
      associated with an increased mortality. Furthermore, patients with cognitive decline at 1&#xD;
      week had an increased risk of leaving the labor market prematurely and a higher prevalence of&#xD;
      time receiving social transfer payments. The mechanisms leading to cognitive impairment after&#xD;
      anesthesia and surgery are not yet fully clear. The risk factors for developing POCD are&#xD;
      related to patient characteristics, type of operation and anesthetic management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, and renal insufficiency are all associated with&#xD;
      impaired brain performance. It is theoretically obvious that an adequate intraoperative&#xD;
      oxygen supply for all vital organs is essential if postoperative cerebral dysfunction is to&#xD;
      be avoided. Casai et al found that brain desaturation (rSO2 decrease &lt;75% of baseline)&#xD;
      occurred in 40% of elderly patients after noncardiac surgery, and the cerebral desaturation&#xD;
      was linked with a high incidence of POCD. A recent systematic review shows that reductions in&#xD;
      cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) during cardiac surgery may indicate CPB cannula&#xD;
      malposition, particularly during aortic surgery. However, only weak evidence links low rSO2&#xD;
      during cardiac surgery to POCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POCD is a well-recognized clinical phenomenon of multifactorial origin; emboli,&#xD;
      hypoperfusion, inflammation, and patient's preoperative cerebral dysfunction. Meticulous&#xD;
      surgical and anesthesiological techniques are important for preventing complications and&#xD;
      keeping the risk of POCD to a minimum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EEG is an electrophysiological monitoring method used to record electrical activity of&#xD;
      the brain, including normal and abnormal activity. In recent years, numerous clinical studies&#xD;
      were performed to evaluate whether the use in intraoperative electroencephalography (EEG) to&#xD;
      control the depth of anesthesia has any effect on POCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently it was confirmed that intraoperative neuro-monitoring for depth of anesthesia is&#xD;
      associated with a lower incidence of delirium. However it is unrelated to the incidence of&#xD;
      POCD. The most common available monitor for depth of anesthesia is the Bispectral index,&#xD;
      developed more than 20 years ago. The device's output is based on electroencephalographic&#xD;
      (EEG) signals from the frontal lobe (monitors brain activity) in combination with&#xD;
      electromyographic (EMG) waves (monitors muscle activity). The BIS produces a number ranging&#xD;
      from 0 -100, which matches the patient's level of consciousness (awake, sedated or&#xD;
      unconscious) under GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its limitations, over-anesthesia as monitored by BIS, was at-least correlative with&#xD;
      POD (but not with POCD). Therefore, it is hopeful that an even more precise evaluation of the&#xD;
      level of anesthesia will improve POD prediction (and thereby prevention) even further. On the&#xD;
      other hand the measure of depth of anesthesia by itself does not provide sufficient&#xD;
      prediction for POCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have recently that brain injury is demonstrated by interhemispheric&#xD;
      desynchronization, which is recognized by our new algorithm, which monitors&#xD;
      electrophysiological markers of attention and of perception. This algorithm was based on a&#xD;
      previous set of studies, which showed the ability to decompose the entire multi-electrode&#xD;
      EEG/ ERP sample to a superposition of attention and perception processes, spread in space&#xD;
      (over the scalp) and time (hundreds of milliseconds). Our algorithm is unique in the ability&#xD;
      to extract the needed perceptual and attentional information indicating depth of anesthesia&#xD;
      and hemispheric damage (manifested by interhemispheric desynchronization) in real time every&#xD;
      30 seconds and with a minimal electrodes' setup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this proof of concept study are: (i) to find-out whether attention processes&#xD;
      might be in association with brain frailty. (ii) to find our whether brain injury which is&#xD;
      expressed by interhemispheric synchronization is is associated with POCD; (iii) to find out&#xD;
      whether the level of anesthesia, as measured electrophysiological by perception might be&#xD;
      linked primary to POCD.&#xD;
