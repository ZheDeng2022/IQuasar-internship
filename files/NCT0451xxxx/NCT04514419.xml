      A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, positive drug parallel control design was used. The&#xD;
      trial included screening period (4 weeks) and treatment period (4 treatment cycles, at least&#xD;
      12 weeks). All eligible subjects were randomly divided into experimental group (hs627&#xD;
      treatment group) and control group (pertuzumab) treatment group. After 4 treatment cycles,&#xD;
      the subjects arranged surgical treatment, and then conducted the last visit.&#xD;
