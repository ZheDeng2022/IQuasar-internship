      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary studies have shown that application of a prophylactic mesh during stoma closure&#xD;
      reduces the incidence of incisional hernia at site of stoma closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomized controlled single-blinded monocentric study determining the&#xD;
      1-year incidence of incisional hernia in cancer patients undergoing ileostomy or colostomy&#xD;
      closure with or without prophylactic non-absorbable mesh applied in the sublay position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention of incisional hernia at site of stoma closure will lead to an improvement in&#xD;
      patients' quality of life and generating savings for healthcare systems. To date, no&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of prophylactic mesh applied during stoma&#xD;
      closure on the prevention of incisional hernia has been published. With the present&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial, we expect to demonstrate that the application of a prophylactic&#xD;
      mesh reduces the one-year incidence of incisional hernia at site of stoma closure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent pooled evidence indicates that the incidence of incisional hernia after stoma closure&#xD;
      is of 7.4%, but this finding is limited by an important heterogeneity (reported incidences&#xD;
      ranging from 0 to 48%). The pooled incidence of incisional hernia ranges from 4 to 10%&#xD;
      according to the type of stoma, with the highest incidence reported after colostomy closure&#xD;
      (10%). These incisional hernias at site of stoma generate patient discomfort, alteration of&#xD;
      quality of life, complications such as bowel occlusion and increased costs for healthcare&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several retrospective studies have investigated the impact of a prophylactic mesh during&#xD;
      stoma closure on the incidence of incisional hernia. For instance, Liu et al. compared 47&#xD;
      patients who benefited from ileostomy closure with a synthetic non-resorbable mesh with 36&#xD;
      patients who underwent the same surgery without mesh, and found that incidences of incisional&#xD;
      hernia (with a median follow-up of 18 months) were of 6.4% and 36.1%, respectively 3.&#xD;
      Similarly, a retrospective case-control study compared 30 patients who had ileostomy closure&#xD;
      with prophylactic biological mesh with 30 matched patients without mesh. At one year, the&#xD;
      incidence of incisional hernia diagnosed with CTscan was of 3.3% in patients with mesh versus&#xD;
      40% in patients without mesh 4. A multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) is currently&#xD;
      underway to evaluate whether an intra-abdominal mesh allows to prevent the one year incidence&#xD;
      of CTscan-proven incisional hernia in patients undergoing ileostomy and colostomy closures 5.&#xD;
      A preliminary feasibility study demonstrated the safety of the procedure 6. However, no&#xD;
      specific techniques for mesh fixation and position are documented in the RCT protocol, which&#xD;
      might introduce confusion factors in the final analysis. Further, applying an intra-abdominal&#xD;
      mesh might potentially result in long-term complications due to bowel adhesion to the&#xD;
      abdominal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we have planned to undertake a RCT aiming at determining whether a prophylactic&#xD;
      non-resorbable mesh in the sublay position allows or not reducing the incidence of incisional&#xD;
      hernia after ileostomy or colostomy closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomized controlled single-blinded monocentric study determining the&#xD;
      one year incidence of incisional hernia in patients undergoing ileostomy or colostomy closure&#xD;

      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the incidence of incisional hernia at site of stoma at one year&#xD;
      after closure. The presence or not of an incisional hernia will be assessed clinically by a&#xD;
      specialist in general surgery and radiologically by computed tomography realized in the&#xD;
      setting of cancer follow-up. The investigator performing the one-year follow-up and the&#xD;
      radiologist interpreting the CTscan will be blinded for the study group. Patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with incisional hernia and/or reoperated for a complication related to stoma closure and/or&#xD;
      mesh will be considered as treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome will be the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) at site of stoma&#xD;
      closure, evaluated at 7 and at 31 days after stoma closure according to the Center for&#xD;
      Disease Control definition. Specialized nurses will record pictures of the stoma site for&#xD;
      blinded evaluation by an investigator. In case of occurrence, SSI will be treated according&#xD;
      to institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization, allocation concealment and blinding :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited during the preoperative consultation. Patients will be given&#xD;
      written information related to the study and will sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
      Investigators will be contacted and perform randomization using the RedCap (Research&#xD;
      Electronic Data Capture) software system on a 1:1 allocation ratio between study groups. The&#xD;
      surgery planning form will be forwarded to the investigators, which will indicate if a mesh&#xD;
      should be added or not to the stoma closure procedure. Patients will be blinded for the study&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the results of existing studies comparing the incidence of incisional hernia&#xD;
      after stoma closure with and without prophylactic mesh, we aimed reducing the incidence of&#xD;
      incisional hernia from 30% to 5%. Using the two-sided Pearson's chi-squared test for&#xD;
      proportions, with a power set at 0.8 and an alpha at 0.05, and considering a 1:1 allocation&#xD;
      ratio, we will have to include 72 patients (36 with mesh and 36 without mesh).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables of interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables of interest will be recorded by the investigator into a case-report form generated&#xD;
      in the RedCap software.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Statistical analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be expressed as medians±SD. Categorical variables will be expressed&#xD;
      as numbers (proportions). Continuous variables and outcomes will be compared using the&#xD;
      two-sided Student's t test. Categorical variables and outcomes will be compared using the&#xD;
      Chi-square test or the exact Fisher test, when appropriate. Subgroup analyses will be&#xD;
      performed according to BMI class and type of stoma. An in interim analysis will be performed&#xD;
      when 36 patients are included; if a difference &gt;15% of SSI (the short-term outcome) between&#xD;
      the 2 groups is put observed, the study will be terminated. A p-value &lt;0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered as significant. Analyses will be performed using GraphPad Prism version 15 and&#xD;
      STATA version 13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing literature reports heterogeneous incidences of incisional hernia at stoma site after&#xD;
      stoma closure. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses, however, documented clinically&#xD;
      significant pooled incidences 1, 2. Considering that the incisional hernia usually requires&#xD;
      surgery and hospitalization, we believe that this complication, in addition to altering&#xD;
      patients' quality of life, also impairs healthcare systems budgets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary studies have shown that insertion of a prophylactic mesh, resorbable or not,&#xD;
      during stoma closure, reduces the incidence of incisional hernia at stoma site 3, 4. However,&#xD;
      to date, no RCT has been released on the subject. Further, the procedure seems to be safe,&#xD;
      with very few SSI reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present RCT will be to determine whether application of a prophylactic&#xD;
      non-absorbable mesh during stoma closure allows or not for the prevention of incisional&#xD;
      hernia at one year. Subgroup analysis will be performed according to the type of stoma and to&#xD;
      BMI class. Furthermore, secondary analysis of the results might allow us to gather enough&#xD;
      data for an objective cost-benefit analysis of the technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strengths of the present RCT will be the following : (1) Good external validity due to&#xD;
      the representation of all types of stomas, (2) Mesh in the sublay position, where the risk of&#xD;
      intra-abdominal complications is lower and application is the easiest (as compared to&#xD;
      intra-abdominal mesh), (3) Use of an affordable mesh (as compared to biological mesh), (5)&#xD;
      assessment of the presence or not of incisional hernia by CTscan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RCT protocol was accepted by the local ethical committee.&#xD;
