  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advance care planning (ACP) has been widely advocated to persons with early stage dementia&#xD;
      (PWEDs) and persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This feasibility randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) aims to test a theory-based ACP programme &quot;Have a Say&quot; specifically&#xD;
      designed for this population, which is underpinned by the Bandura's self-efficacy model. It&#xD;
      is the first of its kind in Hong Kong and will be conducted in the community through&#xD;
      medical-social collaboration. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility and&#xD;
      preliminary effects of the &quot;Have a Say&quot; programme. It is hypothesized that participants in&#xD;
      the intervention group will be more engaged in ACP and their dyadic concordance on&#xD;
      end-of-life care preference with their family caregivers will be significantly higher than&#xD;
      that in the control group.&#xD;

      This study aims to test the feasibility and preliminary effects of an advance care planning&#xD;
      (ACP) programme &quot;Have a Say&quot; for persons with early stage dementia (PWEDs) or mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and their family caregivers in the community. A multi-centre, single-blind,&#xD;
      two-arm randomizsed controlled trial with repeated blinded outcome assessment will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who have a clinical diagnosis of any form of dementia at the early stage or have&#xD;
      a Global Deterioration Score (GDS) 3 or 4 will be eligible to this study. Participated&#xD;
      elderly community centres will be randomly assigned to intervention group and control group.&#xD;
      Staff members from centres assigned to intervention group will be trained as ACP facilitators&#xD;
      and conduct the ACP intervention. Participants in the experimental group will receive a&#xD;
      3-session ACP programme. It includes an educational component, guided reflection and ACP&#xD;
      discussion through a series of group-based activity and dyadic discussion delivered by&#xD;
      trained ACP facilitator and guided by an ACP booklet. Dyads of participants will be provided&#xD;
      with information about the trajectory of dementia, their future healthcare needs and caring&#xD;
      options. Their values and care preferences on future care will be elicited in a consistent&#xD;
      manner. They will be supported to have an individualized ACP discussion led by ACP&#xD;
      facilitators and guided by an ACP booklet. Individuals assigned to the control group will&#xD;
      receive attention-control health talks related to ageing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a process evaluation, a group of informants comprised of ACP facilitators and dyads of&#xD;
      participants will be conveniently sampled and recruited for an semi-structured individual&#xD;
      interview after receiving the intervention. Their experiences of participating in &quot;Have a&#xD;
      Say&quot; programme as an ACP facilitator and participants will be explored. Qualitative data will&#xD;
      be collected until data saturation. All verbatim will be transcribed and analyzed through&#xD;
      qualitative content analysis. The results of this qualitative evaluation will enable us to&#xD;
      understand the strengths and weaknesses of this ACP programme during implementation and give&#xD;
      us insight about the mechanisms of impact and contextual factors affecting the intervention&#xD;
      implementation, sustainability, and outcomes.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in advance care planning engagement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after the intervention, 1 month and 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The behavior change process in ACP behaviours is measured using a 9-item ACP engagement survey. It covers two sub-scales, self-efficacy and readiness, of ACP engagement. Each item is rated on a 5-point likert scale. The higher score means the higher level of engagement for the ACP behaviour.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in dyadic concordance of end-of-life care preferences</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after the intervention, 1 month and 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The dyadic concordance on end-of-life care preferences is measured by a modified Life Support Preferences Questionnaire (LSPQ). Dyads of participants are invited to answer individually, simultaneously but separately on two hypothetical scenarios, one featured the prospect of developing into advance stage of dementia, and another scenario featured the prospect of developing into an irreversible vegetative stage. PWEDs or persons with MCI are asked to consider themselves in each scenario and indicate their preference for receiving three discrete life-sustaining medical treatments (cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation and tube feeding) in each of the two scenarios using a 3 point Likert Scale (want to attempt, refuse or not sure). The dyadic congruence is determined based on whether both of them choose the same option for end-of-life treatments and care goals for the two scenarios. Score ranges from 0-8. A higher score means a higher level of dyadic concordance.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, immediately after the intervention, 1 month and 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The level of depression of PWEDs or persons with MCI is measured by the 19-item Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD). It is to evaluate any adverse outcome posed by the intervention on them. The score ranges from 0-38. A cutoff point of nine or more indicating a depressive disorder, and a higher score means a higher depression level.</description>

    <measure>Caregivers' stress</measure>

    <description>Caregivers' stress is measured by the 12-item Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview. It is to evaluate any adverse outcome posed by the intervention on family caregivers. Score ranges from 0-48. A higher score means a higher level of caregiver burden.</description>

    <description>It is a theory-driven advance care planning programme specifically designed for PWEDs or persons with MCI and their family caregivers. The intervention is underpinned by the Bandura's self-efficacy model. Each dyad of participants will receive a 3-session ACP programme, which consists of educational components, guided reflection, and dyadic ACP discussion, guided by ACP facilitators and an ACP booklet. It is composed of 1 group-based sessions and 2 dyadic discussions. One hour for each session, and once weekly. Dyads of participants will be provided with information about the trajectory of dementia, their future healthcare needs and caring options. Their values and care preferences on future care will be elicited in a consistent manner. They will be supported to have an individualized ACP discussion. By the end of the programme, each dyad of participant will be given an ACP booklet documenting the ACP process.</description>
