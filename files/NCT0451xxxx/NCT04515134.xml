      The aim of this study to assess the follicular fluid level of coenzyme Q10 in women&#xD;
      undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and its impact on pregnancy outcome.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ICSI was first applied to human gametes in 1988, it was first used in cases of fertilization&#xD;
      failure after standard IVF or when few sperm cells were available. The first pregnancies were&#xD;
      reported in Belgium in 1992.It is a part of an in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle and refers&#xD;
      to a technique in which a single sperm is injected directly into the cytoplasm of a mature&#xD;
      oocyte (Palermo et al.,1992).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oocyte quality remains the most important issue during in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles,&#xD;
      it is affected mainly by age of woman and ovarian reserve (Trifunovic et al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oocyte maturation is a complex process including nuclear and cytoplasmic components.&#xD;
      Mitochondria which is in the cytoplasm is the key regulator of energy production via&#xD;
      oxidative phosphorylation process which is extremely important in oocyte maturation process.&#xD;
      Any problem during oxidative phosphorylation might affect both the quality and DNA content of&#xD;
      the oocytes (Ben-Meir et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative phosphorylation involves the action of the mitochondrial respiratory chain which&#xD;
      consists of four complexes that are located in the inner mitochondrial membrane (May-Panloup&#xD;
      et al., 2007). These are the NAD-linked dehydrogenase, Flavoproteins, Co-enzyme Q10, and&#xD;
      cytochromes. Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinone) is structurally similar to vitamin E and vitamin K. It&#xD;
      acts as a carrier of proton (H+) from flavoproteins to cytochrome (Bentinger et al., 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coenzyme Q10 is essential for stability and action of complex III (May-Panloup et al., 2007).&#xD;
      It also participates in the transport of protons in the mitochondria to maintain the membrane&#xD;
      potential and drive ATP formation through ATP synthetase so it has a critical role in cell&#xD;
      growth and energy metabolism. One of the most important factors during oogenesis and oocyte&#xD;
      maturation is energy consumption so CoQ10 was reported to improve development, hatching, cell&#xD;
      proliferation, and ATP content of in vitro-produced bovine embryos (Gendelman et al., 2012;&#xD;
      Stojkovic et al., 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coenzyme Q10 is a commonly used antioxidant supplement in multiple clinical conditions like&#xD;
      diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Also, it was shown that Coenzyme Q10 improves&#xD;
      sperm motility, semen quality, and pregnancy rate (Garrido-Maraver et al., 2014). Recently&#xD;
      Bentov et al. reported that the use of coenzyme Q10 supplementation resulted in reduced&#xD;
      aneuploidy and increased pregnancy rate however it is not clinically significant (Bentov et&#xD;
      al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies reported that pretreatment with CoQ10 could improve ovarian response to&#xD;
      stimulation and embryological parameters in women with poor ovarian reserve in IVF-ICSI&#xD;
      cycles, however their results are conflicting so further work is needed to determine whether&#xD;
      there is an effect on clinical endpoints (Akarsu et al., 2017). In our study we will&#xD;
      investigate the relationship between follicular fluid level of Coenzyme Q10 and clinical&#xD;
      pregnancy rate (Xu et al., 2018).&#xD;
