      This study will acquire imaging information from 3-5 patients that will demonstrate&#xD;
      feasibility of future implementation of personal dosimetry-based treatment planning for&#xD;
      Trans-arterial Radio-embolization (TARE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TARE therapy of liver neoplasia using 90Y-theraspheres has a long history. The device is FDA&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, but has been used extensively for&#xD;
      treatment of secondary liver neoplasia, including metastatic colorectal lesions under&#xD;
      Humanitarian Device Exemption protocols such as this one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a targeted radioactive therapy, the current TARE implementation suffers from a lack of&#xD;
      efficiency characteristic of radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) in general; namely, that the&#xD;
      activity determined to treat the patient is not optimized according to normal organ tolerated&#xD;
      absorbed dose and tumor efficacy thresholds. The amount of activity to be administered is&#xD;
      determined from volumetrics established from associated imaging, either MRI or X-ray CT,&#xD;
      where the total volume of irradiated tissue is considered as irrigated by the artery selected&#xD;
      for administration, including both tumor and normal organ tissue. From this volume&#xD;
      determination, the activity necessary to deliver an average pre-determined safe absorbed dose&#xD;
      (120 Gy) to the entire irradiated region is calculated and administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In RPT, in the theranostic paradigm, a pre-therapeutic, or surrogate, quantity of activity is&#xD;
      administered to the patient; 3D imaging (SPECT/CT or PET/CT) is then acquired at several time&#xD;
      points and the individual patient's pharmacokinetics are determined, the normal organ and&#xD;
      tumor dosimetry are performed and the optimal administered activity calculated that will&#xD;
      deliver safe and efficacious treatment for the individual patient is determined, generally&#xD;
      limited by the normal organ at risk maximum tolerated dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TARE presents a number of unique characteristics that enable a simpler version of this&#xD;
      approach than is typical for most RPT. The method of administration means that only the&#xD;
      normal liver and lungs need to be considered as potential organs at risk as the microspheres&#xD;
      embolize and do not circulate systemically; the lack of associated photons in the 90Y decay&#xD;
      chain means that a simple activity-to-dose-rate conversion can be used; the embolization&#xD;
      means that only a single imaging time point is necessary as there is no redistribution of&#xD;
      activity over time and the dose rate is converted to absorbed dose using the physical decay&#xD;
      parameters of 90Y. These natural simplifications are already exploited in the current&#xD;
      volumetric paradigm, where a 99mTc-macro albumin aggregate (MAA) surrogate and planar imaging&#xD;
      are used to determine the fraction of total activity that is shunted to the lung and where a&#xD;
      derived conversion factor is used to convert activity to absorbed dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technical complication in TARE is that the surrogate (99mTc-MAA) has a different nature&#xD;
      from the therapeutic device (90Y-theraspheres), and thus the reliability of the predictive&#xD;
      quality of the surrogate is disputed. However, with precise and advanced imaging&#xD;
      reconstruction and dosimetry the investigators have shown the ability to accurately and&#xD;
      precisely predict normal liver and tumor average 90Y-therasphere uptake and absorbed dose&#xD;
      from 99mTc-MAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol seeks to acquire the imaging information from 3-5 patients that will&#xD;
      demonstrate feasibility of future implementation of personal dosimetry-based treatment&#xD;
      planning for TARE. In addition to the clinical standard of care assessments: 1. a single&#xD;
      SPECT/CT instead of the current planar image will be acquired of the surrogate 99mTc-MAA; 2.&#xD;
      An additional single 3D image (either SPECT/CT or PET/CT, depending on machine availability)&#xD;
      will be acquired up to 6 hours post-administration of the therapeutic 90Y-microspheres for&#xD;
      comparison. Informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
