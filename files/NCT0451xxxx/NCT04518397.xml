  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the impact of a 6-week theatre intervention rooted in&#xD;
      African culture (Sankofa) on the wellness of girls (predominately African American) ages 8-18&#xD;
      receiving services at five Boys &amp; Girls Club Indianapolis sites. Theatre interventions are&#xD;
      led by Asante theatre personnel and evaluated by the PI and occupational therapy graduate&#xD;
      students. The theatre intervention being evaluated has been conducted for decades by an&#xD;
      established theatre company with widespread community participation and anecdotal positive&#xD;
      responses, but has not been scientifically evaluated to understand how it impacts wellbeing.&#xD;
      This will be the first large-scale study of the mechanisms of change and of the impact of the&#xD;
      theatre intervention in the community and will help to guide future therapeutic interventions&#xD;
      using theatre with underserved populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions include: Is Sankofa a feasible and acceptable intervention for the target&#xD;
      population? Does participation in Sankofa result in improved scores on wellness outcome&#xD;
      measures, including the National Youth Outcomes Initiative (NYOI) survey?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is funded by Asante Children's Theatre via the Central Indiana Community Foundation&#xD;
      Women's Fund.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project will take place over a 3 year period and will consist of 10 6-week theatre&#xD;
      interventions (5 for girls 8-12 and 5 for girls 13-18). The first two (pilot) interventions&#xD;
      (one for each age group) are scheduled to take place in Spring of 2020. From Fall 2020&#xD;
      through Spring 2022, one intervention per age group will be implemented each fall and one per&#xD;
      age group each spring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The theatre intervention is an Asante Theatre production that involves reading a script,&#xD;
      being assigned a role, rehearsing, participating in discussions about the script that will&#xD;
      contribute to script development/editing to personalize it, and eventually performing the&#xD;
      play in front of a community audience. The play is free and open to the public and at the end&#xD;
      of the performance participants will participate in a community conversation during which&#xD;
      audience members can ask questions about the process. The talk back is moderated by the PI,&#xD;
      and participants are not required to respond to questions but can speak up if/when they feel&#xD;
      comfortable doing so. Theatre interventions are led by Asante theatre personnel and evaluated&#xD;
      by the PI and occupational therapy graduate students. Evaluations take place after the PI&#xD;
      obtains parental/guardian informed consent, the week after the intervention, 6 weeks follow&#xD;
      up, and 6 months follow up. Evaluation sessions are conducted individually with each girl who&#xD;
      signs up to participate, using data collection tools described below and attached in the&#xD;
      'notes/attachment' section, and will take no longer than 60 minutes. Adult audience members&#xD;
      at performances are also participants of this study if they consent by checking &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;&#xD;
      on the Audience Survey and responding to questions. The audience survey is described briefly&#xD;
      below and attached in the notes/attachments section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 4 weeks leading up to each intervention, recruit will take place through posting flyers&#xD;
      throughout the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Indianapolis (BGCI) where the interventions are to take&#xD;
      place (implemented at 5 different clubs throughout the city). Flyers will also be circulated&#xD;
      through BGCI social media and listservs, and sent home to parents. Girls who want to&#xD;
      participate can let BGCI staff members know and BGCI staff will provide that girl's&#xD;
      parent/guardian with an informed consent document to review and sign with the PI's contact&#xD;
      information on it in case the parent/guardian has questions. The PI will call parents to&#xD;
      ensure understanding and answer questions. She will also review the document to obtain assent&#xD;
      from girls who want to participate and have their parents' signed consent forms.&#xD;
