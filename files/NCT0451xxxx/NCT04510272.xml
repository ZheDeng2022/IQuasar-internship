      This study will evaluate whether a systematically delivered, patient-oriented real time&#xD;
      communication via aloud real time readings of ICU diary entries during patient's ICU stay is&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of sepsis and acute respiratory failure suffer from long-term impairment in the&#xD;
      domains of physical, cognitive, and psychological functioning collectively known as post&#xD;
      intensive care syndrome (PICS) associated with increased re-hospitalization rates, higher&#xD;
      health care costs and impaired quality of life. Pioneering work in the field of early&#xD;
      physical rehabilitation of intensive care unit (ICU) patients and in identification of&#xD;
      strategies for delirium reduction demonstrated improvement in physical and cognitive&#xD;
      outcomes. Prevention of psychological complications, however, has not been adequately&#xD;
      addressed. Anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affect over a third&#xD;
      of all critical illness survivors post discharge, which is more than double of what has been&#xD;
      reported in combat veterans. Despite the staggering rates of mental health morbidity,&#xD;
      research on targeting preventive measures to be employed in the ICU before development of&#xD;
      psychological symptoms has earned sparse attention. Memories of frightening and delusional&#xD;
      experiences appear to be the strongest potentially modifiable risk factor, with higher rates&#xD;
      of PTSD reported in those who had delusional memories without recall of factual events.&#xD;
      Indeed, psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD can be conceptualized as&#xD;
      disorders of memory content, whereby the neural representation of the emotional component of&#xD;
      the memory of a traumatic experience persists beyond any adaptive purpose. This causes&#xD;
      dysregulation in the fear memory system, resulting in pathology associated with impaired&#xD;
      cognitive, affective, and volitional functions. Research on the formation of fear memories&#xD;
      demonstrates that one can interfere with the initial process of fear conditioning during the&#xD;
      temporal windows when memory consolidation and reconsolidation occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a potential approach to treatment may be to introduce mitigating/factual&#xD;
      information during the time period when the consolidation of the initial memory occurs and&#xD;
      also following its initial recall, because at this time memories are labile and susceptible&#xD;
      to alteration; however, the longer a memory has been stored in the brain, the more difficult&#xD;
      it is to destabilize and alter it, explaining the lack of effectiveness of outpatient&#xD;
      interventions. For the critically ill this would mean introducing some form of communication&#xD;
      as soon as feasible following admission and providing communication in parallel with medical&#xD;
      care in the ICU. Even though semantic processing continues in an altered states of&#xD;
      consciousness, very little verbal communication systematically takes place with sedated&#xD;
      and/or cognitively altered patients during the time window when the negative memories are&#xD;
      being formed. How can such communication be introduced?&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lot of patients receive ICU diaries following hospital discharge. The original design that&#xD;
      has remained unchanged on over 30 years has care team and family members write entries of the&#xD;
      patient's daily events, written in a non-medical language. Despite decades of research, ICU&#xD;
      diaries failed to demonstrate consistent benefit for mental health outcomes. What if the&#xD;
      reason is simply due to the timing of the information provided? What is reading the entries&#xD;
      in real time, as the events unfold, can provide that protective factual information to&#xD;
      mitigate formation of traumatic memories?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that reading ICU diary entries aloud in real time (in addition&#xD;
      to providing them to patients following hospital discharge as has been the standard&#xD;
      previously) is feasible and may translate into improved mental health outcomes including&#xD;
      symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD as well as more delirium free days. Doing so&#xD;
      systematically may mitigate formation of false negative memories, provide reorientation and&#xD;
      factual information, and thus help patients understand what is happening to them in real&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be accomplished via the following aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: To conduct a feasibility trial of reading ICU diaries aloud daily and to&#xD;
      refine the intervention based on stakeholder feedback Objective 1: ICU diaries will be read&#xD;
      aloud in real time daily to 30 enrolled patients by ICU nurses/therapists. The approach will&#xD;
      subsequently be refined based on semi-structured interviews of all involved stakeholders&#xD;
      (patients, families, nurses, therapists). Patients will also complete anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      acute stress/PTSD and cognitive function evaluation as measured by validated instruments.&#xD;
