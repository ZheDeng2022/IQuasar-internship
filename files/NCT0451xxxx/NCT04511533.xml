    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, open label, single arm, multi-center, prospective clinical trial of&#xD;
      dacomitinib that will be performed in India. This study will enroll a sufficient number of&#xD;
      participants to ensure that 100 participants are treated with dacomitinib. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of dacomitinib. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to evaluate antitumor activity of dacomitinib by objective response&#xD;
      rate and duration of response.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 4, open label, single arm, multi-center, prospective clinical trial of&#xD;
      dacomitinib that will be performed in India. This study will enroll a sufficient number of&#xD;
      participants to ensure that 100 participants are treated with dacomitinib. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of dacomitinib. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is to evaluate antitumor activity of dacomitinib by objective response&#xD;
      rate and duration of response. Drug administration: Dacomitinib will be supplied by Pfizer&#xD;
      and administered in accordance with the India Local Product Document (LPD). The recommended&#xD;
      dosage of dacomitinib is 45 mg taken orally once a day at approximately the same time each&#xD;
      day, until disease progression, participant refusal/lost to follow-up, or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: Participants will be screened within 28 days prior to first dosing of dacomitinib&#xD;
      to confirm that they meet the eligibility criteria for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visit: All participants will return to the study site up to 28 days after the last&#xD;
      dose of study drug administration for assessment of potential AEs, recording of concomitant&#xD;
      treatment use and to confirm appropriate contraception usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASSESSMENTS Tumor Assessments: Tumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease&#xD;
      sites. Computerized tomography (CT) or Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of Chest&#xD;
      Abdomen and Pelvis and MRI of the brain will be performed at Screening and repeated every 12&#xD;
      weeks ±1 week until the end of treatment. For all tumor assessments, the method of assessment&#xD;
      that was used at Screening will be used throughout the study. Tumor assessment will be&#xD;
      repeated at the end of treatment if more than 6 weeks have passed since the last evaluation.&#xD;
      Assessment of response will be made using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST) version 1.1. Confirmation of response will be required ≥4 weeks after initial&#xD;
      response is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Assessments: The following parameters will be assessed - Physical examination, vital&#xD;
      signs, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance score (ECOG PS), safety lab data, 12&#xD;
      lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Unscheduled clinical laboratory measurements may be obtained at&#xD;
      any time during the study to assess any perceived safety concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse event reporting: All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or&#xD;
      suspected causal relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as per&#xD;
      regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study: The end of study is defined as 1 year after the last participant first visit&#xD;
      (LPFV) date in the study. At the end of study, participants who are on treatment and&#xD;
      benefiting from dacomitinib treatment will be switched to commercially available dacomitinib&#xD;
      if considered appropriate by the investigator, as soon as feasible.&#xD;
