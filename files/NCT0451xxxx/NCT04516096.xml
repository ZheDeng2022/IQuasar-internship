    <textblock>
      The protocol is intended to provide extended treatment with AMX0035 to patients who&#xD;
      previously participated in an Amylyx sponsored study of AMX0035 for ALS.&#xD;

      In this open-label, compassionate extended use study, patients who have completed their&#xD;
      participation in an Amylyx sponsored protocol for ALS may be offered compassionate use&#xD;
      extension of treatment with AMX0035 under this protocol. Patient currently treated with&#xD;
      AMX0035 will continue to receive treatment at their current dose/regimen. Patients who have&#xD;
      interrupted AMX0035 for more than 28 days will resume AMX0035 treatment with 1 sachet (oral&#xD;
      [or feeding tube]) once a day in the morning to be escalated to twice a day (morning and&#xD;
      evening) after approximately 2 weeks on the basis of GI tolerance. Enrolled patients will&#xD;
      complete regular outpatient visit approximately every 16 weeks (Â± 2 weeks). Completion of the&#xD;
      ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) will be optional.&#xD;
