  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation(AF) can be asymptomatic and thus left unidentified in many people, but&#xD;
      holds potential risk of lethal complications such as stroke and congestive heart failure.&#xD;
      With different screening strategy, the screening result will be different. The longer the&#xD;
      monitoring period is, the higher chances AF episodes can be identified, but with greater cost&#xD;
      and lower compliance. Therefore, in this study, the investigators want to find the most&#xD;
      cost-effective method for AF screening in high risk population with prolonged continuous&#xD;
      single-lead ECG device.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of participates with AF episodes identified using continuous ECG monitoring compared to routine practice.</measure>
    <time_frame>2020-2023</time_frame>
    <description>Some atrial fibrillation patients may be left undiagnosed by routine practice due to several reasons. On ECG, AF episodes are defined as irregularly irregular QRS complex with disappearance of P wave that last over 30 seconds. A routine ECG examination may not able to capture AF episodes, however, by monitoring the subjects' cardiac rhythm continuously for a prolonged time period, we can detect asymptomatic AF episodes with higher sensitivity that would have been missed. And by further analyzing the detection rates of different monitoring periods, we can find out the most cost-effective monitoring duration and pattern.</description>

    <description>We use Smartpatch, a listed ambulatory electrocardiographic system that can continuously record and save patients' cardiac rhythm for up to 45 days.</description>

    <intervention_name>Intermittent ECG monitor</intervention_name>
    <description>When using Smartpatch, we can set time markers by pressing the button on the device. We ask our subjects to press that button twice a day and also when they feel any discomfort. Analyzing the ECG 1 minute after those time markers can serve as a surrogate for intermittent ECG monitor.</description>
