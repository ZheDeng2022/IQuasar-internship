  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis is a degenerative tendinosis of the extensor carpi radialis brevis&#xD;
      muscle and is the most common work/sports-related chronic musculoskeletal problem affecting&#xD;
      the elbow. This randomized, double-blinded, controlled study aimed to evaluate the short term&#xD;
      and residual effectiveness of the Kinesio taping method on pain, grip force, quality of life,&#xD;
      and functionality.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty patients diagnosed with chronic unilateral lateral epicondylitis with a symptom&#xD;
      duration of at least 12 weeks. The study group received a true inhibitor Kinesio taping while&#xD;
      the control group received sham taping for the first four weeks. In both groups, progressive&#xD;
      stretching and strengthening exercises were given as a home program for 6 weeks. Patients&#xD;
      were assessed with the numerical rating scale (NRS), Cyriax resistive muscle test evaluation,&#xD;
      maximal grip strength, PRTEE (Patient- Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation), and SF-36 (Short&#xD;
      Form-36) by the first assessor who was blinded to taping types.&#xD;

    <measure>numerical rating scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The numerical rating scale (NRS) was used to evaluate the pain level of the patients included in the study. It is a one-dimensional scale consisting of 11 items that measure pain intensity in adults and is a segmented - intermittent numerical version of the visual analogue scale (VAS).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>resisted muscle test evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>According to the Cyriax method, each joint tested was kept in the mid- range of motion, without allowing movement. Resistance was applied to the forearm distal to avoid muscle involvement other than that tested in pronation and supination, thus the wrist was prevented to be involved. Subsequently, the patients were asked to apply a maximum force for at least three seconds. Resisted wrist extension, third finger extension, elbow supination, and pronation were evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal Isometric Handgrip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The maximal isometric handgrip strength was measured in pounds using the Jamar hand dynamometer (Baseline® Hand Dynamometer - HiRes™ Gauge - ER™ 300 lbCapacity). Measurement was performed in two different positions, elbow at extension and 90° flexion. In the first position, the patient was in the sitting position, shoulder abducted to 0° and in neutral rotation, elbow position was at 90° flexion, the forearm was in neutral rotation and wrist was in the neutral position. In the second position, while the patient was standing, shoulder abducted to 0° and in neutral rotation, the elbow was in full extension, forearm and wrist were in the neutral position. The patient was asked to squeeze the dynamometer with full force for three seconds every 30 seconds. This procedure was repeated three times and the mean measurement values were obtained</description>

    <measure>The Patient-rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation(PRTEE)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) is a questionnaire with subscales related to pain and function, which is used to evaluate upper extremity functionality. It is specially prepared for patients with lateral epicondylitis.Scoring ranges from 0 (no pain/disability) to 100 (worst possible pain and disability). The total score can be 100 points maximum and low scores refer to better functionality.Turkish validity and reliability was proven by Altan et al.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is valid and reliable for patients with chronic musculoskeletal disorders. The items include eight different domains that indicate physical functioning, physical role limitation, pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role limitation, and mental health. The score of each domain ranges from 0 (worst quality of life) to 100 (the best quality of life).</description>

    <description>The true taping method was applied to the first group according to the method determined by Kase. According to this method, a 2-inch (5 cm) wide beige-colored Kinesio tape (Kinesio® Tex Gold FP) was measured from the second-third metacarpal base to the lateral epicondyle while the elbow was extended and the wrist was in the neutral position and the tape was applied in the shape of a 'Y'. In a position where the wrist-ankle extensors were most tense (wrist-ankle extension - forearm pronation), the anchor point of the tape was applied to the insertion of the muscle without creating any tension. Then, the tape was applied to the medial and lateral edges of the wrist extensors by applying a 15-25% tension towards the origin of the muscle. Both ends of the Y-shaped tape were terminated without tension on the lateral epicondyle.</description>

    <description>In the placebo group, the 10 cm I-shaped tape was placed 5 cm inferior to the lateral epicondyle using the same Kinesio tape in the study group. It was applied transversely, starting from the painless side of the midline on the forearm extensor face directing towards the lateral side of the forearm without a tension.</description>
