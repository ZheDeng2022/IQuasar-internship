  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether computer aided technology (CAD) can help in&#xD;
      the diagnosis of polyps found the bowel compared with visual inspection alone and therefore&#xD;
      whether it is beneficial in helping clinicians to decide whether to remove a polyp or not.&#xD;
      Presently, most endoscopists remove all polyps found and send them to the laboratory for&#xD;
      testing. The number of colonoscopies is increasing, meaning that more polyps are detected and&#xD;
      removed. This comes at a significant cost to the health service and increases the time taken&#xD;
      to complete a colonoscopy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Removing precancerous polyps from the bowel during a colonoscopy (camera test) is the&#xD;
      cornerstone of colorectal cancer screening and prevents polyps developing into bowel cancer.&#xD;
      Most polyps develop in the rectosigmoid colon (lower part of the bowel). Many polyps never&#xD;
      grow into cancer and it can be difficult for the clinicians performing the procedure&#xD;
      (endoscopists) to tell which ones are precancerous. This means many polyps are removed&#xD;
      unnecessarily, with a considerable waste of resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent preliminary study indicates a novel artificial intelligence system (EndoBRAIN) for&#xD;
      computer-aided diagnosis may be able to distinguish different types of polyps during&#xD;
      colonoscopy and therefore help doctors decide which polyps to remove. This study aims to&#xD;
      compare the in accuracy of artificial intelligence against the endoscopist's assessment for&#xD;
      diagnosis of diminutive (&lt;5mm) polyps in the lower colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are age 18 years or older who undergo colonoscopy for any indication at the&#xD;
      participating clinical centres and are diagnosed with diminutive rectosigmoid polyps are&#xD;
      eligible for study enrolment. For each detected polyp in the rectosigmoid colon, endoscopists&#xD;
      will assess the polyp type using standard colonoscopies (cameras) and then with the use of&#xD;
      the EndoBRAIN technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The polyps will be removed and sent to the laboratory for testing. The difference between&#xD;
      clinician diagnosis and EndoBRAIN diagnosis will be compared with the laboratory findings. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that the EndoBRAIN technology provides a superior accuracy in identifying&#xD;
      precancerous rectosigmoid polyps, compared to endoscopist's own prediction with a standard&#xD;
      colonoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the trial confirms the superior accuracy of the EndoBRAIN system, polyps classified as&#xD;
      non-cancerous with the EndoBRAIN system no longer need to be removed, meaning a large gain&#xD;
      for patients and society, due to significantly less polypectomies and pathology reviews.&#xD;
