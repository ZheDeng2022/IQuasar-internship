  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial investigates the side effects of chemotherapy and cellular immunotherapy&#xD;
      in treating children with IL13Ralpha2 positive brain tumors that have come back after a&#xD;
      period of improvement (recurrent) or do not respond to treatment (refractory). Cellular&#xD;
      immunotherapy (IL13(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ T cells) are brain-tumor specific cells that may induce&#xD;
      changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Many patients with brain tumor respond to&#xD;
      treatment, but then the tumor starts to grow again. Giving chemotherapy in combination with&#xD;
      cellular immunotherapy may kill more tumor cells and improve the outcome of treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the feasibility and safety of lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by cellular&#xD;
      immunotherapy utilizing IL13Ralpha2-specific hinge-optimized 41BB-co-stimulatory chimeric&#xD;
      antigen receptor [CAR] truncated CD19-expressing autologous T-lymphocytes&#xD;
      (IL13[EQ]BBzeta/CD19t+ Tn/mem cells) administered by intraventricular (ICV) delivery for&#xD;
      pediatric participants with IL13Ralpha2+ recurrent/refractory brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe persistence and expansion of CAR T cells in peripheral blood (PB) and&#xD;
      cerebrospinal (CSF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe cytokine levels (PB, and CSF) over the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. In research participants who receive the full schedule of 4 CAR T cell cycles:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIa. To estimate 6-month progression free survival (PFS) rate per disease. IIIb. To estimate&#xD;
      disease response rates per disease. IIIc. To estimate 1-year overall survival rate per&#xD;
      disease. IV. To evaluate the use of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) to&#xD;
      evaluate tumor burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. For study participants who undergo an additional biopsy/resection or autopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Va. To evaluate CAR T cell persistence in the tumor tissue and the location of the CAR T&#xD;
      cells with respect to the infusion site. Vb. To evaluate IL13Ralpha2 antigen expression&#xD;
      levels on tumor tissue pre and post CAR T cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of IL13(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -5 and -4, and fludarabine IV on&#xD;
      days -5 to -2. Patients then receive autologous IL13(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ T cells&#xD;
      intraventricularly over 5 minutes once a week (QW) on day 0. Treatment with autologous&#xD;
      IL13(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ T cells repeats every 7 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive additional cycles of&#xD;
      IL13(EQ)BBzeta/CD19t+ T cells as long as they continue to meet eligibility criteria and have&#xD;
      doses available for infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up at 30 days, 3, 6, 9, and 12&#xD;
      months, and then yearly for 15 years.&#xD;
