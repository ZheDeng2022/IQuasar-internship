    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study to test the safety and efficacy of a three different light and&#xD;
      laser handpieces for the improvement of skin color, tone, texture and laxity. All subjects&#xD;
      will receive up to four treatments, administered in intervals of 28 +/- 2 days. Each full&#xD;
      face treatment duration will be approximately 60 minutes. The initial power and number of&#xD;
      passes parameters shall be set according to the clinical indication and skin type of the&#xD;
      subject treated. The treatment area will be cleaned and photographed before each treatment.&#xD;
      Photographs will be taken at baseline, prior to each treatment and during each follow-up&#xD;
      visit. Before the initiation of the first treatment each subject will undergo clinical&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical improvement will be assessed by the investigator from the visual appearance of the&#xD;
      treated area and from the fixed magnification clinical photographs according to the following&#xD;
      scale: -1 for exacerbation, 0 no change, 1 for 1%-25% improvement, 2 for 25%-50% improvement,&#xD;
      3 for 50%-75% improvement, and 4 for 75%-99% improvement. Adverse side effects will be scored&#xD;
      by clinical evaluation of erythema, edema, and burns. Treatments and results will be&#xD;
      documented in a Case Report Form at each treatment session and follow-up session (1 month and&#xD;
      3 months after the last treatment). In case of adverse side effects and symptoms other than&#xD;
      erythema or edema appear during or following a treatment, the next treatment may be skipped&#xD;
      by two weeks or treatment parameters reduced until symptoms resolve. If adverse side effects&#xD;
      are observed, the investigator should provide the subject with the proper care and remedy and&#xD;
      will document it in the Case Report Form.&#xD;
