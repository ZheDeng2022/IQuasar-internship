  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of the Emerald device in Rett syndrome patients diagnosed with a&#xD;
      confirmed MECP2 mutation. MC10 BioStamp nPoint patches will also be assessed with the goal to&#xD;
      develop Rett-specific breathing algorithms&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two sequential cohorts with a total of approximately 20 patients&#xD;
      enrolled. Patients in each cohort may participate for up to 4 weeks. Each participant will&#xD;
      have up to 2 Emerald devices installed in their home for monitoring sleep, breathing and&#xD;
      movement, and will use between 3 and 9 nPoint patches for determining proper patch placement&#xD;
      for detecting breathing signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a Screening visit, an Observation period, and a Follow-up phone&#xD;
      call. The Screening Period will be one day in clinic, the Observation period will be up to 4&#xD;
      weeks at home and the Follow up phone call will be performed at the completion of the&#xD;
      Observation Period.&#xD;

    <description>will enroll approximately 5 patients with pronounced respiratory dysfunction. Patients may be enrolled with tremors and or seizures. All patients will be observed via Emerald to capture sleep staging, movement and breathing for up to approximately 4 weeks. Caregivers will keep a daily questionnaire diary of the patient's anxiety, sleep and seizures. MC10 nPoint data will be captured for at least two 24-hour periods in each of the 4 weeks to assess patch placements for breathing detection. Ongoing assessment of MC10 nPoint data may lead to the use of more or less sensors, changes in duration of sensor data collection, or placement as Cohort 1 progresses.Preliminary results from Cohort 1 will determine if Emerald will continue to be evaluated and will inform on MC10 nPoint optimizations for Cohort 2. If preliminary results indicate Emerald is not an effective device, then Emerald will be discontinued</description>

    <arm_group_label>Cohort 2</arm_group_label>
    <description>will enroll approximately 15 patients. Patients with pronounced respiratory dysfunction, tremors, seizures, and/or other expanded features of Rett syndrome deemed appropriate may be enrolled. If Emerald is continued, all patients are observed via Emerald to capture sleep staging, movement and breathing up to for approximately 4 weeks. Caregivers will keep a daily questionnaire diary of the patient's anxiety, sleep and seizures. Ongoing assessment of MC10 nPoint data may lead to the use of more or less sensors, changes in duration of sensor data collection, or placement as Cohort 2 progresses.</description>

    <description>The Emerald is a wireless sensor that can track the motion, breathing, and sleep of subjects without touching or requiring any interaction with the subjects, allowing them to go about their normal lives. The physical device is roughly a 30 x 35 x 5 cm box that contains directional antennas and a motherboard to process these signals. In typical operation, the device is mounted onto a wall within a clinic or home setting using peel-away (reversible) mount strips.</description>
