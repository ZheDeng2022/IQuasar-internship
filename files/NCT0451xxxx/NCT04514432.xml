  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this quality improvement project, our objectives were to assess the feasibility and&#xD;
      effectiveness of using music as an adjunct to or replacement of pharmacological interventions&#xD;
      for patient agitation on an inpatient psychiatric unit. We hypothesized that music&#xD;
      availability would help to reduce agitation and reduce the amount of as-needed medications&#xD;
      used for cases of patient agitation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of as-needed medications for agitation was quantified during a three month period&#xD;
      during which patients had the option of listening to music in cases of agitation. This was&#xD;
      compared to the number of medications needed for agitation during another 3 month period&#xD;
      during which music was not available. The medications used were quantified using pharmacy&#xD;
      records. Patients and nurses were surveyed to determine how effective and feasible they&#xD;
      thought the music intervention was. The study was conducted at the SUNY Upstate University&#xD;
      Hospital inpatient psychiatric unit, which is a 24-bed unit. 172 patients were included in&#xD;
      the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting to offer music, a basic training meeting was held with nursing staff to&#xD;
      understand the purpose of the project. Patients participating had the option of selecting a&#xD;
      preferred musical genre and they listened to music using wireless headphones. The playlists&#xD;
      used were genre playlists automatically generated by Spotify music application. If patients&#xD;
      did not like the song that was generated, they had an option to skip the song using their&#xD;
      bluetooth headphone controls. Headphones were collected after 30 minutes of listening unless&#xD;
      they were return prior to completion of the listening session.&#xD;
