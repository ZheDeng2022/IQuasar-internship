    <intervention_model_description>Current warfarin dose individualization methods tend to be empirical, rather than based upon pharmacological and statistical principles. A theory-based model of warfarin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PKPD) has been developed for dose individualization when used in conjunction with a Bayesian forecasting tool (NextDose).&#xD;
This study compares standard of care clinician judgement for warfarin management with the use of a web-based dosing tool (NextDose). Computer-assisted anticoagulant dosing has been shown to be helpful using empirical models. This study will evaluate a theory-based model which has shown superior performance over empirical models in predicting clinical doses of warfarin. The study is also guided by quality and service improvement principles.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>All patients who are screened for enrolment will be allocated an enrolment number. The recruiting clinician will record into a logbook the details of all patients screened for enrolment, including the reason for exclusion from trial entry.&#xD;
A randomization sequence using block randomization with random block sizes of 4, 6 and 8 (to maintain equal sample size in each arm) will be created by researchers using PASS. Assignments will be enclosed in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.&#xD;
Participants who provide written informed consent and are enrolled will be allocated to study arm by the study pharmacists. The pharmacist will be responsible for opening envelopes sequentially, writing the participant enrollment number on the envelope prior to opening, and recording the envelope number and study arm allocation in the CRF. On conclusion of the data collection phase, the (actual) study allocation status of the participants will be compared to the randomization sequence.</masking_description>
