  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, static scans are commonly used for Positron Emission Tomography/Computed&#xD;
      Tomography (PET/CT) examination in the literature. Accordingly, functional images of&#xD;
      2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose (18F-FDG) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography&#xD;
      (PET/CT) with dynamic scans can be more sensitive to detect metastatic lymph node, since the&#xD;
      introduction of temporal dynamic variables would provide more imaging quantification than&#xD;
      conventional static scans. The purpose of this study is to provide the dynamic 18F-FDG PET/CT&#xD;
      imaging for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patient to quantify the difference&#xD;
      between malignant lymph nodes (MLN) and benign lymph nodes (BLN).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is one of the most aggressive malignancies in the world, which accounted&#xD;
      for an estimated 572,034 new cases and 508,585 deaths in 2018 worldwide. The incidence and&#xD;
      mortality of esophageal cancer is ranked first in China and esophageal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (ESCC) is the main histological subtype of esophageal cancers in China. Correct&#xD;
      preoperative evaluation of whether the tumor has reached any lymph nodes is important for&#xD;
      management. Various methods have been used to detect primary and lymph node metastases in&#xD;
      esophageal cancer patients, including computed tomography (CT), endoscopic examinations, and&#xD;
      endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). However, even such advanced imaging modalities do not&#xD;
      always reliably identify lymph node metastasis prior to surgical resection and pathological&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The appearance of lymph nodes with morphological imaging procedures is classified by their&#xD;
      shape, size, density and, if applied, contrast enhancement. BLN usually tend to have a fatty&#xD;
      hilum, an oval shape and frequently do not measure more than 1 cm in the short axis diameter.&#xD;
      However, the use of size as the most important criterion for differentiation of benign and&#xD;
      malignant lymph nodes has limitations: small metastases without an increase in lymph node&#xD;
      size are frequently missed. Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) is&#xD;
      increasingly used as single &quot;one stop shop&quot; method, which the combination of morphological&#xD;
      and functional imaging represents the optimal approach for lymph node staging and general&#xD;
      staging. A radioactive tracer，2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose (18F-FDG) currently used is based&#xD;
      on the increased glucose metabolism, which may be reported with semiquantitative standard&#xD;
      uptake value (SUV). Routinely, 18F-FDG is intravenous injected and PET/CT scan is performed&#xD;
      after 60 min. The static imaging in differentiation of inflammatory from MLN may be&#xD;
      problematic. Because inflammatory lymph nodes goes along with an increase in glucose&#xD;
      metabolism, and thus may manifest increased 18F-FDG uptake. It was reported that PET-CT&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity for the detection of loco-regional metastases were moderate, but&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity were reasonable for distant metastases. Many researchers found&#xD;
      there is a correlation between the 18F-FDG uptake and time. In malignancy, the uptake of FDG&#xD;
      uptake continues to increase for several hours after FDG injection whereas such prolonged&#xD;
      period of FDG uptake is rare in inflammatory/infectious or normal tissues. Shum et al ever&#xD;
      assessed clinical usefulness of dual-time FDG PET/CT in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,&#xD;
      which turned out the sensitivity of FDG PET-CT in detecting the primary ESCC with combination&#xD;
      of early maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) ≥2.5 or retention index (RI) ≥10% was 96.2%.&#xD;
      However, for loco-regional lymph node detection, there was no significant difference using&#xD;
      dual-time 18F-FDG PET/CT assessment. Dynamic 18F-FDG PET/CT allows quantitative assessment of&#xD;
      lesion in vivo by using a Patlak model to obtain the influx constant (Ki), and the glucose&#xD;
      metabolic rate (MRglu). The purpose of the study is to determine whether the dynamic 18F-FDG&#xD;
      PET/CT imaging (0-60 min) add additional value in differentiation MLN from BLN.&#xD;
