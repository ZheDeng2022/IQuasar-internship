    <textblock>
      Single arm pilot study to evaluate the safety and initial feasibility of the Neurolyser XR, a&#xD;
      high intensity focused ultrasound device, for non-invasive treatment of axial chronic low&#xD;
      back pain&#xD;

      Study design: Prospective, single arm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline: six month enrollment period and 12 months follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sites: The study will be conducted at five sites in Canada: McGill University, Toronto&#xD;
      Western, Silver Medical Group, Precision Sport &amp; Spine, Kinetix Integrated Orthopaedic &amp;&#xD;
      Regenerative Medicine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Thirty adult patients diagnosed with facet related low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study objective: Safety and efficacy of the Neurolyser XR for the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic low back pain secondary to zygapophyseal joint syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety is measured by the incidence and severity of treatment related adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy is measured by the changes in pain severity at the treatment area, using a numerical&#xD;
      rating scale (NRS), of 0 to 10 between baseline and 6 months.&#xD;
