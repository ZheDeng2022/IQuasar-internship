      This study will evaluate the performance of two point-of-care dual syphilis and HIV tests&#xD;
      [Multiplo TP/HIV test (MedMira Inc, Halifax, Nova Scotia) and the INSTI Multiplex&#xD;
      HIV-1/HIV-2/Syphilis Antibody Test (bioLytical Laboratories Inc., Richmond, BC)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to standard syphilis and HIV testing, point-of care testing (POCT) will be&#xD;
      performed on 1,500 consecutive participants who are being screened for syphilis and HIV and&#xD;
      who are at least 16 years old. POCT will be conducted using a fingerprick whole blood&#xD;
      specimen. The study will be conducted at multiple sites in Northern Alberta (Canada), a&#xD;
      region which is currently experiencing a resurgence of infectious syphilis.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of resurgent syphilis in Alberta (Canada), the investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      performance of two dual HIV/syphilis POCT. Their utility in the point of care treatment for&#xD;
      syphilis among populations who access outreach or acute care services and in rural/remote&#xD;
      areas will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Syphilis is an important sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium&#xD;
      Treponema pallidum which if left untreated, can result in serious complications and can be&#xD;
      transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy resulting in severe consequences (Singh,&#xD;
      1999). Alberta is currently in the midst of an outbreak of infectious syphilis, with rates&#xD;
      not reported since 1948 (AH, 2019). Many syphilis cases in this outbreak have occurred among&#xD;
      high risk populations, such as street-involved persons, who are difficult to reach through&#xD;
      standard health care services and are also at high-risk for HIV infection. Cases are also&#xD;
      occurring in rural and remote areas where access to services is also limited and may result&#xD;
      in delays in treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Point of care testing (POCT) for syphilis is widely available for diagnostic use and point of&#xD;
      care treatment in many countries. There are more than a dozen commercially available tests&#xD;
      internationally, but none are approved for use in Canada. In contrast, HIV POCT has been&#xD;
      available in Canada since 2006. With the current syphilis outbreak in Alberta, POCT for&#xD;
      syphilis and HIV offers the opportunity for immediate and rapid access to testing and&#xD;
      results. For syphilis, POCT also provides the opportunity to provide immediate treatment in&#xD;
      remote/rural communities and in non-traditional venues. Immediate treatment can prevent&#xD;
      complications of syphilis in the infected individual and limit the spread of syphilis, as&#xD;
      well as reduce the demand on limited healthcare resources by allowing treatment to occur at&#xD;
      the time of testing, thus reducing the need for an additional visit by the client. In&#xD;
      addition, a scoping review found that between 81-97% of Canadians prefer POCT to traditional&#xD;
      testing and 96-100% were highly satisfied with the testing process (Minichiello, 2017).&#xD;
      Studies using POCT for HIV in British Columbia and Ontario have also demonstrated that POCT&#xD;
      is effective in reaching the undiagnosed (Fielden, 2013, Sullivan, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to take full advantage of POC diagnostic tests, their utility, acceptance,&#xD;
      effectiveness, potential adverse events and cost-effectiveness must be evaluated in field&#xD;
      settings in Canada. The investigators have previously conducted an evaluation of a POCT for&#xD;
      syphilis (SD Bioline 3.0 Test, Standard Diagnostics Inc, Korea) and HIV (INSTI HIV-1/HIV-2&#xD;
      Antibody Test, bioLytical Laboratories, Richmond, Canada) using separate test kits since no&#xD;
      dual HIV/syphilis kits were available at that time (Bergman, 2013). In the evaluation (not&#xD;
      reported in the manuscript), the field staff using the SD Bioline kit expressed lower&#xD;
      satisfaction and acceptability using this kit in the field due to long time [~30 mins] to&#xD;
      results, and also reported more difficulty in conducting and reading the test relative to the&#xD;
      INSTI HIV test which was used simultaneously and was reported as easier to use with shorter&#xD;
      time (~5 minutes) to test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population and recruitment procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Syphilis and HIV POCT will be performed on 1,500 consecutive participants [e.g. Indigenous&#xD;
      communities experiencing a resurgence of syphilis, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex&#xD;
      with men (gbMSM), sex workers, street-involved people, persons who use injection drugs&#xD;
      (PWID)] &gt; 16 years accessing STI screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals eligible for syphilis screening will be eligible for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
      Consecutive participants presenting to STI Services or designated locations will be informed&#xD;
      about the study by the RN/LPN. If the participant is interested in participating, a RN/LPN&#xD;
      will assess if he/she meets the inclusion criteria and agrees to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Signed consent will be obtained and routine care will be provided in addition to the 2&#xD;
      additional POCT. Participants must consent to both HIV and syphilis screening as the POCT&#xD;
      interprets both simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests and specimen flow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two finger prick specimens will be collected from all eligible participants. Each finger&#xD;
      prick specimen will be used to conduct the dual HIV/syphilis POCT. Health Canada&#xD;
      Investigational Testing Authorization( ITA) has been obtained for both test kits for this&#xD;
      evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Multiplo TP/HIV test (MedMira Inc, Halifax, Nova Scotia) is a visually interpreted&#xD;
           immunoassay that qualitatively detects IgM and IgG antibodies to recombinant T. pallidum&#xD;
           antigens (Tp0171 (TpN15), Tp0435 (TpN17) and Tp0574(TpN47) and to HIV 1 &amp; 2 in serum,&#xD;
           plasma or whole blood. This test is also CE marked in Europe and in use in several&#xD;
           countries including the UK, Switzerland and Norway. The product is also used in&#xD;
           Colombia, Panama, India and China. Results are read visually.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  INSTI Multiplex HIV-1/HIV-2/Syphilis Antibody Test (bioLytical Laboratories Inc.,&#xD;
           Richmond, BC), is a single use, rapid, flow-through in vitro qualitative immunoassay for&#xD;
           the detection of antibodies to Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 &amp; 2 antibody and Treponema&#xD;
           pallidum in human EDTA-whole blood, fingerstick blood, serum or EDTA-plasma. This test&#xD;
           is CE Marked in Europe and is in clinical use in France and the UK. The manufacturer of&#xD;
           this assay produces the only POC HIV test currently authorized by Health Canada, in use&#xD;
           across the country. Results are read visually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a serum specimen will be collected as per standard procedures and submitted to&#xD;
      the local laboratory for standard testing as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For HIV, a fourth generation EIA (Architect HIV Ag/Ab Combo, Abbott Laboratories, Illinois,&#xD;
      USA) as the initial screening test and if positive, will be repeated in duplicate.&#xD;
      Confirmation will be done using the GeeniusTM HIV-1/2 Antibody Differentiation Assay. For&#xD;
      samples that screen positive on the EIA but are not confirmed in the Geenius, an additional&#xD;
      specimen is requested HIV RNA (qualitative) testing (ProvLab, May 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For syphilis a treponemal specific enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Architect Syphilis TP&#xD;
      Microparticles, Abbott Laboratories, Illinois, USA) will be used as the initial screen and if&#xD;
      reactive will be followed by a quantitative RPR. A TPPA is done on all samples with no&#xD;
      previous confirmation of syphilis (ProvLab, December 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Algorithms will be used to guide testing, treatment, partner notification and reporting of&#xD;
      HIV and syphilis. Patients will be informed that the syphilis and HIV POCT results are&#xD;
      &quot;preliminary&quot; and that the standard testing will be performed to confirm the result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Syphilis treatment and counselling will be provided based on a positive POCT result from&#xD;
      either test kit, presence of symptoms or signs of syphilis, the participant's sexual history,&#xD;
      and prior history of syphilis diagnosis and treatment. As syphilis serology can remain&#xD;
      sero-fast throughout life despite treatment, all syphilis treatment will be done in&#xD;
      consultation with the provincial STI program as per standard procedure to determine necessity&#xD;
      for treatment. STI Services RNs will follow standard treatment guidelines for syphilis which&#xD;
      includes access to provincial records related to previous treatment. Other sites will be able&#xD;
      to contact STI Centralized Services during business hours to determine prior syphilis history&#xD;
      and necessity for treatment. A STI physician will be available during study hours to provide&#xD;
      consultation on cases where the provision of treatment is uncertain. When indicated,&#xD;
      long-acting benzathine penicillin G will be administered according to Medication&#xD;
      Administration policies as per each organization. Given the relative safety of treatment&#xD;
      (with single dose intramuscular benzathine penicillin G) and the potential harm related to&#xD;
      untreated syphilis and the potential for ongoing transmission, it is anticipated that the&#xD;
      potential benefits will outweigh the potential harms of overtreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those testing positive for HIV, the result and case will be reviewed by phone with a STI&#xD;
      physician to determine whether immediate referral or management is required. The study RN/LPN&#xD;
      will provide referrals to HIV organizations for support while waiting for the results from&#xD;
      standard testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All confirmed positive results from standard testing will be reported to public health as per&#xD;
      current requirements. Arrangements for required follow-up from positive results will be&#xD;
      completed by the study RN in consultation with public health (e.g. linkage to treatment for&#xD;
      HIV and follow-up serology for syphilis).&#xD;
