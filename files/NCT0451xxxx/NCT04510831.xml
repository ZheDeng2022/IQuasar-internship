  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the growing world population, there is a need to develop viable ecological and&#xD;
      nutritional alternatives to animal food products. However, animal products are a key dietary&#xD;
      source of well-absorbed iron, and iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia remain highly&#xD;
      prevalent in high- and low-income countries. Meat and fish provide a substantial proportion&#xD;
      of absorbed iron in the western diet by two distinct components: a) heme iron is well&#xD;
      absorbed (20-45% fractional absorption) and is not affected by most dietary enhancers and&#xD;
      inhibitors, which often affect non-heme iron absorption; b) peptides in muscle meat exert an&#xD;
      enhancing effect the absorption of non-heme iron contained in other meal components. The&#xD;
      potential of edible insects as a dietary source of well-absorbed iron has not been&#xD;
      investigated in detail. In particular, it is unclear whether insects provide an iron moiety&#xD;
      similar to hemoglobin which would be well absorbed and unaffected by other dietary&#xD;
      components, and whether their presence in a test meal exerts an enhancing effect on iron&#xD;
      bioavailability from the whole meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, chitin, a major component of insect biomass, is a known iron binder and is&#xD;
      potentially responsible for a decreased iron absorption from insect-based foods. Decreasing&#xD;
      chitin content could allow the high amounts of iron in insects to be well-absorbed, and&#xD;
      enhance the absorption of iron from plant-based foods. To differentiate iron absorption from&#xD;
      insect biomass from other sources, insects will be intrinsically labelled with the stable&#xD;
      iron isotope 57Fe, while other food iron components will be labelled with the iron isotope&#xD;
      58Fe.The present study will provide novel data to elucidate the nutritional value as sources&#xD;
      of dietary iron of insect species (Tenebrio molitor). Since 2017 T.molitor is recognised as&#xD;
      an edible insect in the Swiss food legislation and commercially available (Essento Food AG,&#xD;
      Zürich; Insekterei, GmbH, Zürich).&#xD;
