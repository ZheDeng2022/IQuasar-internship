  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will propose a randomized cross-over trial using a uniform and strongly&#xD;
      balanced 4-period design in which will include four operations for each surgeon. Surgeons&#xD;
      will be randomized to 1 of 4 sequences: ABBA, BAAB, AABB or BBAA. The design is &quot;uniform&quot; in&#xD;
      that each treatment appears the same number of times within each sequence (uniform within&#xD;
      sequence) and if each treatment appears the same number of times within each period (uniform&#xD;
      within each period). It is strongly balanced with respect to first-order carryover effects&#xD;
      because each treatment precedes every other treatment, including itself, the same number of&#xD;
      times&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects will be randomly assigned to use either the CoolSource™ cooling vest (worn&#xD;
      between scrubs) and a conventional surgical gown for each of 4 surgeries. Sequence of&#xD;
      treatments within the subjects will be randomized (ABBA, BAAB, AABB or BBAA), and determined&#xD;
      using the PLAN procedure in SAS, such that each surgeon will wear vest and non-vest twice.&#xD;
      The sequencing will not be shared with any study personnel. Allocation for each case will be&#xD;
      concealed with a web-based system that will be accessed only shortly before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will target an ambient temperature of 21°C ± 1°C, and try to maintain the&#xD;
      same temperature of each of the four study cases for each surgeon. The CoolSource vest holds&#xD;
      six reusable cooling packs located bilaterally on the shoulders, angled flank along the base&#xD;
      of the rib cage, and along each side of the spine, mid-back. The vest will be donned over&#xD;
      hospital-issued scrubs after all temperature sensing devices have been applied and before&#xD;
      surgical hand scrubbing. The subjects will wear the vest throughout surgery, and for a few&#xD;
      additional minutes while postoperative assessments are made (details below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The weight of the disposable cooling vest is 1 kg which is evenly distributed over both&#xD;
      shoulders. The cooling packs have an insulated cover to reduce condensation or sweating while&#xD;
      seated inside the vest pocket. The flexible frozen reusable cooling packs will be inserted&#xD;
      into each of the six pockets and the vest belt will be tied to hold the cooling packs&#xD;
      securely. The disposable cooling vests will be discarded after each case, and the cooling&#xD;
      packs returned to a freezer.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-rated thermal comfort.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately after surgery, while still gowned, surgeons will rate their thermal comfort on a 0-10 Likert scale, with 0 representing extreme cold, 5 being thermal comfort, and 10 representing extreme heat. Two points on the 11-point Likert scale will be considered a clinically important difference.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean core temperature.</measure>
    <time_frame>the sensor will be worn for a total of 90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The first secondary outcome will be the mean core temperature for a case, calculated as the time-weighted average over the taken measurements. The surgeon's core body temperature will be monitored by a validated wireless wearable iThermonitor WT701 biosensor which estimates core temperature within ±0.5⁰C (Pei et al., 2018). The sensor will be applied to the surgeon's right axilla 15-20 minutes prior to the surgical hand scrub performed at the start of surgery and secured with an adhesive cover. A small patch of axillary hair will be clipped or shaved as necessary.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean skin temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>the sensor will be worn for a total of 90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The second secondary outcome will be the mean skin temperature for a case, calculated as the time-weighted average over the taken measurements. Mean skin temperature will be estimated from skin temperature from the back of the upper chest, deltoid arm, thigh, and calf using the formula [MSTR = 0.3 tchest + 0.3 tarm + 0.2 tthigh + 0.2 tleg or 0.3(tchest + tarm) + 0.2(tthigh + 0.2 tleg)] (Ramanathan, 1964). Skin temperature will be continuously measured using wireless patches, TempTraq, which meet professional accuracy standards for digital thermometers (ASTM E1112-00). The sensors will remain affixed with adhesive dressing on the surgeon's body surface throughout surgery and approximately 10 minutes required for post-operative testing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgeons' cognitive performance, measured with the C3B battery.</measure>
    <time_frame>Applied before and after surgery, 12 Minutes long.</time_frame>
    <description>The self-administered C3B is a performance-based battery of cognitive tests which measure visual memory; episodic learning and delayed memory (five learning trials with a total score of 70) and processing speed; information processing speed and incidental memory (15 symbols repeated for 120 seconds). Also, relevant distractions or interruptions will be recorded and the frequency in which they occur during the C3B battery test. Testing will take place right after surgery with surgeons still gowned. The surgeons will sit with the iPad touch screen placed on a desk in front of them for approximately 10 minutes to complete the cognitive test. To minimize learning during the trial, participating surgeons will complete the cognitive assessment battery before the first study day. For subsequent cases, the test will be administered prior to the surgical hand scrub and after the end of surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgeon' perceived ergonomic workload measured with Borg CR10 scale of exertion and the rating-of-fatigue (ROF) scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately after surgery, while still gowned, surgeons will rate their perceived exertion on a 1-10 Borg CR10 scale, with 1 representing very slight exertion, 5 being severe, and 10 representing maximal exertion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgeon' perceived fatigue measured as 0 representing not fatigued at all, 5 moderately fatigued, and 10 total fatigue &amp; exhaustion</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived fatigue will be rated on a 0-10 ROF scale, with 0 representing not fatigued at all, 5 moderately fatigued, and 10 total fatigue &amp; exhaustion. Two points difference on either scale will be considered a clinically important difference.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time the surgeon wore the Cooling Vest</measure>
    <time_frame>Surgery Time duration</time_frame>
    <description>Time the surgeon removes the sterile surgical gown and the cooling vest after completing the C3B will be recorded. Also, total amount of time the surgeon wore the sterile surgical gown / cooling vest in minutes will be calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Operating Room Temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>Ambient operating room temperatures will be monitored at 15-minute intervals during surgery .</time_frame>
