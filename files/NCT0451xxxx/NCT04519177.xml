  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have shown that sleep health education and sleep disorders screening improve health and&#xD;
      safety of employees. There is potential to increase the benefits of the sleep health&#xD;
      education and screening program if more firefighters are evaluated, diagnosed and referred&#xD;
      for treatment. We will evaluate whether firefighters in stations randomized to participate in&#xD;
      the Sleep Health and Education Program (SHEP) intervention will have improved health and&#xD;
      safety outcomes as compared to firefighters in stations randomized to the control condition.&#xD;
