  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators designed the Child-Caregiver Interaction Observation Scale（CCIOS）to assess&#xD;
      social communication behaviors, stereotyped behaviors for children with autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorder(ASD) via a 20-min video of interactions between a caregiver and a child. The&#xD;
      original CCIOS coding scheme consists 23 items. The score range for each item is 0-4, with&#xD;
      higher scores being indicative of more atypical behavior. The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      determine items for inclusion in the final CCIOS coding scheme through exploration of item&#xD;
      correlations, establish the cutoff score of CCIOS for ASD and evaluate the reliability and&#xD;
      validity of CCIOS. The reliability evaluation include test-retest reliability and inter-rater&#xD;
      reliability. DSM-5 criterion is used as the gold standard. Validity is assessed by&#xD;
      determining the correlation and consistency between CCIOS and DSM-5 criterion.&#xD;

      The investigators designed the Child-Caregiver Interaction Observation Scale（CCIOS）to assess&#xD;
      social communication behaviors, stereotyped behaviors for children with autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorder(ASD) via a 20-min video of interactions between a caregiver and a child. The&#xD;
      original CCIOS coding scheme consists 23 items. The score range for each item is 0-4, with&#xD;
      higher scores being indicative of more atypical behavior. The investigators conduct this&#xD;
      study to determine items for inclusion in the final CCIOS coding scheme through exploration&#xD;
      of item correlations, establish the cutoff score of CCIOS for ASD and evaluate the&#xD;
      reliability and validity of CCIOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is of importance to accurately distinguish children with ASD from those with Global&#xD;
      Developmental Delay (GDD) and Language Disorder (LD) without ASD, sometimes, it's very&#xD;
      difficult in children with mental ages below 2 years. This differentiation has strong&#xD;
      implications for treatment recommendations and may also inform long-term prognosis. In this&#xD;
      study, The investigators planned to recruit 60 children with ASD and 60 children with GDD/LD&#xD;
      aged from 18 months to 48 months. The reliability evaluation include test-retest reliability&#xD;
      and inter-rater reliability. DSM-5 criterion is used as the gold standard. Validity is&#xD;
      assessed by determining the correlation and consistency between CCIOS and DSM-5 criterion.&#xD;
