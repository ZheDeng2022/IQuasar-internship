  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2016 and 2017 the investigators conducted two clinical trials in which emergency medicine&#xD;
      physicians were randomized either to an intervention (customized, theoretically-based video&#xD;
      games) or to a control (nothing or text-based education). This study will now assess&#xD;
      long-term outcomes for physicians enrolled in those two trials to evaluate the effect of the&#xD;
      interventions on triage practices for trauma patients who presented initially to non-trauma&#xD;
      centers in the US between December 2016 and November 2018.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will use Medicare claims to measure the number of patients, treated by study participants, who present initially to non-trauma centers after a moderate-severe injury and are transferred to a Level I/II trauma center during that episode of care. They will compare triage patterns for patients treated by physicians in the intervention and in the control groups.</description>
