  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this retrospective study is to describe the different types of acute&#xD;
      neurologic complications in children who underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation&#xD;
      (ECMO), and their risk factors. The research will also assess the child health at 1 year&#xD;
      after withdrawal from ECMO and in 2020 in terms of neurological state and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurological complications are relatively common (around 30%) in patients undergoing extra&#xD;
      corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). They can be hemorrhagic or ischemic and are partly due&#xD;
      to the difficulty of balancing heparin therapy. Few pediatric studies have estimated the&#xD;
      incidence and risk factors for these lesions. In addition, the developmental monitoring and&#xD;
      quality of life of these children is not systematic or standardized, and their long-term&#xD;
      outcome deserves to be better evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this retrospective study is to describe the different types of acute&#xD;
      neurologic complications in children who underwent veno-veinous or veno-arterial ECMO and&#xD;
      their risk factors. The study is being conducted at Necker Enfants Malades hospital between&#xD;
      2014 and 2019. The research will also assess the child health at 1 year after withdrawal from&#xD;
      ECMO and in 2020 in terms of neurological state and quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>The DENVER II is a measure of developmental problems in young children. It was designed to assess child performance on various age-appropriate tasks and compares a given child's performance to the performance of other children the same age. The instrument consists of 125 tasks, which broadly reflect the following areas: personal-social, fine motor-adaptive, language, and gross motor.&#xD;
The target population corresponds to infants and pre-school age children.&#xD;
The POPC and PCPC are global scales based on observer impressions. Scores include 1 for good, 2 for mild disability, 3 for moderate disability, 4 for severe disability, and 5 for vegetative state or coma (6 indicates death).</description>

    <intervention_name>Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ (PedsQL)</intervention_name>
    <description>The PedsQL questionnaire is a modular approach to measuring health-related quality of life in healthy children and adolescents and those with acute and chronic health conditions. The PedsQL Measurement Model integrates seamlessly both generic core scales and disease-specific modules into one measurement system. Twenty-three items divided into different functional areas are evaluated: physical (8 items), emotional (5 items), social (5 items) and school (5 items over 4 years old; 3 items before 4 y.o).&#xD;
Child self-report and parent proxy report formats of the questionnaire allows self-assessment of child over 5 years old and parents' evaluations. Items can be reverse and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale (0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0) with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>
