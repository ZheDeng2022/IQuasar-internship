      This study gathers information from the blood cells and tumor tissue during treatment with&#xD;
      anti-HER2 therapies, such as trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib, or neratinib, in patients&#xD;
      with HER2 positive stage I-IV breast cancer who are scheduled to start anti-HER2 therapy. The&#xD;
      information gained from this study may help researchers better understand the relation&#xD;
      between cell response and anti-HER2 therapies.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I. To determine the correlation between HER2 specific T-cell response in&#xD;
      HER2-positive breast cancer patients with stage I-IV who receive anti-HER2 therapies, such as&#xD;
      trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib, or neratinib and clinical responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the correlation between antibody response in HER2-positive breast cancer&#xD;
      patients with stage I-IV who receive anti-HER2 therapies, such as trastuzumab, pertuzumab,&#xD;
      lapatinib, or neratinib and clinical responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the proportion of patients who develop HER2-specific T cell and endogenous&#xD;
      antibody responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine within individual patients trends in levels of HER2 CD4 T-cells, HER2 CD8&#xD;
      T-cells, and HER2-specific antibodies over the course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine if combination therapy induces immunity to common breast cancer associated&#xD;
      antigens (i.e. CEA, IGFBP2, and P53).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine if induction of HER2-specific T cell or antibody immunity is associated with&#xD;
      improved progression-free and overall survival in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine if there are Fc gamma receptor (R) or HLA genotypes associated with the&#xD;
      ability to generate immunity in response to anti-HER2 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine whether anti-HER2 therapy induces HER2 loss and modulation of HER2-specific&#xD;
      adaptive immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To determine if loss-of-function mutations in antigen presenting genes are associated&#xD;
      with recurrence in patients with HER2+ breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To determine gene expression levels in tumors from patients who did not achieve&#xD;
      pathologic complete response (pCR) that are associated with recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo collection of blood samples at baseline, 8 and 16 weeks after starting&#xD;
      treatment, and at the time of invasive disease recurrence for patients with stage I-III, or&#xD;
      progressive disease for patients with stage IV. Patients with stage IV HER2 positive breast&#xD;
      cancer with no disease progression &gt;= 2 years on the same line of therapy, undergo blood&#xD;
      sample collection at baseline anytime during their treatment with anti-HER2 therapies, 8 and&#xD;
      16 weeks after the first blood draw, and at the time of invasive disease recurrence. Patients&#xD;
      also undergo tumor tissue collection for the evaluation of gene expression and&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) variants.&#xD;
