  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Simulation is an active teaching strategy capable of reproducing real situations and allowing&#xD;
      practical experiences, in which the student is the protagonist of his own knowledge.&#xD;
      Scientific evidence highlights, that exposure to the unknown or new can generate stress to&#xD;
      the individual, but when dosed, to a certain extent it can increase the level of knowledge.&#xD;
      Not infrequently, the lack of stress control can trigger physiological and subjective changes&#xD;
      resulting from the increase in its level, such as situations that include the implementation&#xD;
      of simulation scenarios in pedagogical teaching models.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of simulation (high and low fidelity) on the cognitive, physiological&#xD;
      and emotional sphere of nursing students in caring for patients with signs of sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: Students undergoing high-fidelity simulation will show similar levels of&#xD;
      stress, cognitive performance and retention of knowledge in relation to those who will&#xD;
      perform low-fidelity simulation in patients with signs of sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis: The cognitive performance and stress will be higher in students who&#xD;
      experience high fidelity simulation when compared to students who experience low fidelity&#xD;
      simulation.&#xD;

    <description>First, students will go through an inverted class on sepsis. Then, they will be submitted to high-fidelity simulation scenarios to care for patients with sespe. After the scenario, the students' physiological parameters (blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation) will be measured. After the scenario, students will go through a reflective debriefing session.</description>
