  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to help scientists learn about the use of a device called an atomic&#xD;
      magnetometer. The device uses sensors called optically-pumped magnetometers (OPM) which&#xD;
      function at room temperature. This research will compare the non-invasive brain imaging&#xD;
      application of the OPM sensors to the present SQUID-based cryogenic sensor technique used in&#xD;
      conventional Magnetoencephalography (MEG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being conducted in conjunction with the University of Colorado Boulder's&#xD;
      Mechanical Engineering Department.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators at UC Boulder have an active program to develop &quot;chip-scale&quot; optically-pumped&#xD;
      magnetometer (OPM) sensors, which combine high sensitivity with small size, low cost and low&#xD;
      power operation. These sensors are an attractive alternative to superconducting quantum&#xD;
      interference device (SQUID) magnetometers for the reasons outlined below, but remain largely&#xD;
      unverified for use in biomagnetic applications. While considerable testing can be carried out&#xD;
      without the use of humans, human testing is considered essential to encourage acceptance of&#xD;
      this technology by the biomagnetic research community and more broadly by the medical&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this research is to assess and validate how well the new types of sensors perform&#xD;
      for non-invasive brain imaging and to optimize and improve their performance for imaging. The&#xD;
      goal is to show that these sensors are not just more economical and easier to use, but also&#xD;
      improve signal quality. In this project specifically, OPMs can prove usefulness for&#xD;
      telemetry, which means that long-term measurements over several days are possible, in&#xD;
      principle. This is important, since these non-invasive imaging with these OPM sensors might&#xD;
      be able to use replace the invasive imaging with implanted electrodes (electrocoticography&#xD;
      (EcoG) for pre-surgical mapping of epileptic seizures. The project proposes to compare the&#xD;
      use of OPM and SQUID sensors during recording spontaneous and evoked brain activity in&#xD;
      healthy human volunteers as well as in patients with intractable epilepsy. Two objectives:&#xD;
      (1) to show that the patient can move with a confined area during measurements (this is&#xD;
      currently not possible with rigid MEG systems) and (2) to show that images can be generated&#xD;
      with a spatial resolution equivalent to that of internal electrodes.&#xD;

    <description>Optically-pumped magnetometers (OPM) sensors, which are based on optical probing of alkali atoms in the vapor phase at (or slightly above) room temperature, have recently demonstrated sensitivity levels comparable with SQUID magnetometers in the laboratory. These sensors require no cooling and can potentially be fabricated at much lower cost than SQUIDs. Beginning in the late 1990s, optically-pumped magnetometers began to be used for biomagnetic applications, first for measurement of heart magnetic fields and more recently for measurement of brain fields by several groups around the world.</description>

    <description>Magnetic sensors based on superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) have been the dominant sensor in the field of magnetoencephalography since its birth in the early 1970s. SQUIDs have exceptional sensitivity to enable the detection of these very weak signals. Current FDA-approved MEG devices contain liquid helium gas in a big container that is mounted over the head of the subject</description>
