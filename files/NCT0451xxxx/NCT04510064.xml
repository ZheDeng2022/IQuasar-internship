    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of domestic programmed death 1（ PD-1）&#xD;
      antibody (Camrelizumab for injection) combined with fluorouracil plus leucovorin,&#xD;
      oxaliplatin, and albumin bound paclitaxel (modified FLOT, mFLOT) regimen in the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with unresectable locally advanced or limited metastatic gastric cancer. The primary&#xD;
      efficacy endpoint is R0 resection rate.&#xD;

      This is an open, single center, prospective phase II clinical study to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of domestic PD1 antibody (Camrelizumab for injection) combined with mFLOT regimen&#xD;
      in the treatment of unresectable locally advanced or limited metastatic gastric cancer. This&#xD;
      study will be carried out in our center, about 40 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with unresectable locally advanced or limited metastatic gastric cancer who had not&#xD;
      received any prior antitumor therapies were treated with domestic PD1 antibody (Caerelizumab&#xD;
      for injection) commbined with mFLOT regimen, and human epidermal-growth-factor receptor 2&#xD;
      (HER-2) positive patients were treated with Herceptin. The efficacy of therapy was evaluated&#xD;
      every 3 treatment cycles. After 6 cycles, surgical experts evaluated the resectability of the&#xD;
      tumor, and the patients who were confirmed to be resectable received surgery within 3-6 weeks&#xD;
      after immunochemotherapy. The patients with good postoperative recovery continued to receive&#xD;
      the same immunochemotherapy in 3-6 weeks, and totally at most 12 cycles. Patients who were&#xD;
      evaluated as progressive disease (PD) at any time withdrawn from the study as conversion&#xD;
      failure.Patients who did not PD at 6 cycles of treatment but did not reach the criteria for&#xD;
      R0 resection, continued to receive another 3 cycles of the prior chemotherapy. If resectable&#xD;
      then, surgical treatment was performed, if still unresectable, the immunochemotherapy for&#xD;
      transformation was evaluated as unsuccessful. The patients were treated according to the&#xD;
      principle of palliative treatment until the disease progressed or intolerable toxicity. The&#xD;
      efficacy and safety will be continuously monitored and evaluated throughout the study period&#xD;
      (including a 30 day follow-up period). 40 cases were expected to be enrolled: 3-4 cases per&#xD;
      month, completed in 1 year and finished in 2 years.&#xD;
