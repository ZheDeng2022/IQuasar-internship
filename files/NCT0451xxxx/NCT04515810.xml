  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are to: (1) refine and field-test a mobile application intervention&#xD;
      (PACT) using an iterative design approach, &quot;Think Aloud&quot; exercises, and usability protocols;&#xD;
      (2) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, usability, satisfaction, and user engagement of&#xD;
      the intervention among advanced cancer patients and their caregivers; (3) test the&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of the intervention on patients' and caregivers' level of engagement in&#xD;
      ACP, documented ACP conversations, and patients' completion of ADs (primary outcomes); and&#xD;
      patients' and caregivers' perceived social support and family functioning as well as&#xD;
      patients' receipt of goal-concordant care (secondary outcomes); and (4) evaluate process&#xD;
      measures in a post-intervention interview.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in level of engagement in advance care planning (patient)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be assessed using the reliable and valid Advance Care Planning Engagement Survey: Action Measures. This scale is composed of four sub scales with a total of 18 items. All items are rated on a yes=1 and no=0. Scores can range from 0 (no action taken) to 18 (all actions taken).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in level of engagement in advance care planning (caregiver)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers will be assessed using an adapted caregiver version of the reliable and valid Advance Care Planning Engagement Survey: Action Measures. This scale is composed of four sub scales with a total of 18 items. All items are rated on a yes=1 and no=0. Scores can range from 0 (no action taken) to 18 (all actions taken).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in documentation of advance care planning conversations</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured using our previously utilized 8-item measure of discussing EoL care, living will, HCP, and DNR orders with family (or patient) and doctor (or patient's doctor) (all yes/no questions).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in completion of advance directives</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by asking patients whether they have completed a Do Not Resuscitate order(DNR), living will, or identified a Health Care Provider(HCP). All yes/no questions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in user engagement as measured by number of views</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>User engagement will be assessed through tracking of activity (i.e., number of views) over a 3-month period following randomization.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in user engagement as measured by time spent on app</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>User engagement will be assessed through tracking of activity (i.e., time spent on app) over a 3-month period following randomization.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in treatment preference</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed in patients with an item used previously in our team's NCI-funded cohort studies that asks patients to express a preference for life-extending versus comfort care (two answer choices).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in healthcare utilization (summary score for total healthcare utilized)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This measure will assess patients' receipt of life-prolonging care (number of emergency room visits, hospital admissions, length of stay in the hospital, rates of ICU admission) and use of palliative or hospice care (length and duration of palliative and/or hospice care). A total score will be created for healthcare utilization.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in number of subjects receiving goal-concordant care</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This will be determined by comparing patients' treatment preferences to treatment received. Patients matching on their desired and received care will be designated as having received goal-concordant care.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perceived social support</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed among patients and caregivers using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). The MSPSS is a 12-item valid and reliable measure of social support from family, friends, and significant other, scored on a 5-point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree; 5=strongly agree), with previously reported excellent internal reliability (Cronbach's Î± = 0.84 to 0.92).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in family functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed among patients and caregivers using the Family Relationship Index (FRI), a scale derived from the Family Environment Scale. FRI consists of 12 true/false items consisting of three subscales (cohesiveness, expressiveness, and conflict resolution) with scores ranging from 1 to 4 with higher scores indicating better family functioning. The FRI is well-validated in cancer patients.</description>

    <description>PACT is grounded in decision-making research that indicates individuals often make decisions with the input of social &quot;informants&quot; or influences.10 PACT will utilize mHealth technology to provide the following empirically based features to meet patients' reported need to incorporate loved ones into the advance care planning (ACP) decision-making process and thus bolster their social networks: Pick one's team of loved ones to be involved in ACP through its shareability feature; Address common barriers of traditional family meetings (e.g., distance of loved ones, domineering family members) by exploiting the ubiquitous access of an online application with the ability to control online ACP meetings; Complete advance directives with the engagement and, if desired, input of loved ones through structured question prompts; Team up with loved ones to share one's wishes both informally through care preference messages and formally through shared advance directive forms.</description>

    <description>PACT (Planning Advance Care Together) is the mobile app interactive prototype that has been developed by the PI (Shen) in partnership with developers. PACT represents a digitally enhanced mHealth app that will help patients engage in ACP as a social process and ultimately plan for, document, and receive their preferred end-of-life care. PACT will be a digital solution that accounts for the social nature of ACP. PACT will be a progressive web application (PWA) that will allow for a virtual engagement in ACP with patients' loved ones and advance directive documentation process.</description>
