  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Gabby Preconception Care program is an innovative communication system designed to&#xD;
      identify and mitigate or resolve health risks for young Black and African American (AA) women&#xD;
      before pregnancy, as a means of reducing racial health disparities in birth outcomes. The&#xD;
      system uses embodied conversational agent technology the investigators call &quot;Gabby,&quot; who&#xD;
      empathically interacts with users to assess health risks and delivers interventions to&#xD;
      resolve or mitigate these risks. This research team has been working on the &quot;Gabby&quot;&#xD;
      Preconception Care program, which features Virtual Patient Advocate (VPA) technology, for&#xD;
      over seven years and the system is now ready for dissemination beyond the research&#xD;
      environment and into the clinical and community context. The purpose of this project is to&#xD;
      examine the implementation and dissemination process of the evidence-based Gabby Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caseworkers at Healthy Start (HS) Programs and healthcare providers at Community Health&#xD;
      Centers (CHC's) do not have time to assess for the over 100 preconception health risks that&#xD;
      can impact birth outcomes; our system can assist by streamlining that assessment to create a&#xD;
      personalized list of risks.Gabby will be introduced/released to sites as part of their&#xD;
      standard of care where patients and clients can then share their list with healthcare&#xD;
      providers and case workers/managers to make their in-person interactions much more effective.&#xD;
      Studies by the research team have shown that Gabby reduces health risks by 25 percent among&#xD;
      young Black and AA women. The investigators will evaluate the success of the implementation&#xD;
      process through both quantitative and qualitative measures including key informant telephone&#xD;
      interviews and guidance from a Gabby Toolkit Advisory Board in order to prepare an&#xD;
      implementation toolkit that can be used to facilitate broader dissemination. The Gabby&#xD;
      program will not be evaluated as a research intervention, as this has been done previously,&#xD;
      instead, how well the Gabby program worked within each site will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' implementation approach includes: 1) engaging 6 Healthy Starts and 6 CHCs&#xD;
      and assessing the workflow and readiness of these clinical sites; 2) implementing the Gabby&#xD;
      program for a period of 6 months at each of these clinical sites; 3) assembling a&#xD;
      preliminary, revised, and final implementation toolkit; and 4) broadly disseminating the&#xD;
      toolkit and results of the implementation. Input from a Gabby Toolkit Advisory Board will&#xD;
      guide implementation efforts and toolkit development to be used for wider dissemination into&#xD;
      other clinical based sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources will include qualitative and quantitative methods, such as surveys/ assessments,&#xD;
      key informant interviews, system-generated data, learning communities, and implementation&#xD;
      logs. Evaluation will focus on site recruitment, training, and engagement; client engagement;&#xD;
      clinical risk reduction; toolkit, technical assistance, and support resources; and&#xD;
      dissemination efforts.&#xD;
