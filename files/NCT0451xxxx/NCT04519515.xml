    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized to receive up to 1cc of Juvéderm Vollure on one side of their&#xD;
      face and up to 1cc of Saline on the other. On Day 30, this treatment with the same left-right&#xD;
      assignment can be repeated. Subjects will return 24-48 hours after their first treatment to&#xD;
      fill out questionnaires, take pictures, and to be assessed by blinded evaluators regarding&#xD;
      short term adverse events. Subjects will fill out a 30 day subject diary and also return 30&#xD;
      and 90 days after their last treatment to fill out questionnaires, take pictures, complete&#xD;
      the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS), and to be assessed on the QGSGS and for&#xD;
      long-term adverse events by blinded evaluators. At 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months, the&#xD;
      subjects will return to fill out questionnaires, take pictures, and to be assessed by blinded&#xD;
      evaluators for long-term efficacy.&#xD;

      Subjects with grades ranging from 4-55 on the Quantitative Global Scarring Grading System&#xD;
      (QGSGS)1 will be randomized to receive up to 1cc of Juvéderm Vollure on one side of their&#xD;
      face and up to 1cc of Saline on the other. On Day 30, this treatment with the same left-right&#xD;
      assignment can be repeated if optimal correction on the active intervention side has not been&#xD;
      achieved according to the treating investigator. Subjects will return 24-48 hours after their&#xD;
      first treatment to fill out questionnaires, take pictures, and to be assessed by blinded&#xD;
      evaluators regarding short term adverse events. Subjects will fill out a 30 day subject diary&#xD;
      and also return 30 and 90 days after their last treatment to fill out questionnaires, take&#xD;
      pictures, complete the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS), and to be assessed on the&#xD;
      QGSGS and for long-term adverse events by blinded evaluators. The subjects will be eligible&#xD;
      to receive treatment with Juvéderm Vollure 90 days after their last treatment on the&#xD;
      placebo-controlled side if they choose. In addition, at 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months,&#xD;
      the subjects will return to fill out questionnaires, take pictures, and to be assessed by&#xD;
      blinded evaluators for long-term efficacy.&#xD;
