  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to examine the effect of short-term rehabilitation exercise support using&#xD;
      digital healthcare system (Uincare homeplus) in the patients with total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
      The study is a two-arm prospective randomized controlled study comparing the effect of&#xD;
      rehabilitation exercise digital healthcare system at home with conventional brochure-based&#xD;
      home exercise. Gait speed (4-meter), Pain (using Numerical rating scale), knee joint range of&#xD;
      motion (ROM), lower extremities motor power (using Manual muscle test), Western Ontario and&#xD;
      McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and quality of&#xD;
      life using EQ-5D-5L will be evaluation on enrollment, 3-weeks, 6-weeks, 12-weeks and 24-weeks&#xD;
      after enrollment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty is treatment of choice for knee degenerative arthritis patients who&#xD;
      are unresponsive to non-operative management including medications and physical therapies.&#xD;
      Total knee arthroplasty is an effective treatment enhancing the joint range of motion as well&#xD;
      as reducing pain and correcting deformities which leads to better patient function with&#xD;
      better quality of life. Current method of post-operative rehabilitation is home-based self&#xD;
      rehabilitation using brochure, combined with one or two times of education at the hospital&#xD;
      before discharge. Patients often find difficulty in doing rehabilitation by themselves at&#xD;
      home without supervision which resulted in decreased compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With development of technologies using multi-motion sensor and AR(augmented-reality) system,&#xD;
      the investigators have developed a digital healthcare system(Uincare Homeplus) which can&#xD;
      supplement patients' rehabilitation at home by giving them proper instructions as well as&#xD;
      feedback. In this prospective randomized controlled study, the investigators aim to compare&#xD;
      the efficacy of the newly-developed digital healthcare system with conventional&#xD;
      rehabilitation program.&#xD;

    <measure>Manual Muscle Test (MMT) on the affected lower extremities</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment, 3-weeks, 6-weeks, 12-weeks, 24-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of change of MMT in the affected lower extremities from baseline to 24 weeks. affected lower extremities MMT scales from 0-25, higher score meaning better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) on the affected knee</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment, 3-weeks, 6-weeks, 12-weeks, 24-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC is a self-administered questionnaire used in the evaluation of knee osteoarthritis. It is consisted with 24 items divided into 3 subscales; Pain, Stiffness and Physical function. WOMAC score ranges from 0-96 with higher score meaning worse pain, stiffness and function.</description>

    <measure>Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment, 3-weeks, 6-weeks, 12-weeks, 24-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BBS is a 14-item objective measure that assess static balance and fall risk in adults. BBS score ranges from 0-56, with higher score meaning better balance.</description>
