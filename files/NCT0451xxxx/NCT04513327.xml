  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to examine the effect of short-term rehabilitation exercise support using&#xD;
      digital healthcare system (Uincare homeplus) in the patients with anterior cruciate ligament&#xD;
      reconstruction. The study is a two-arm prospective randomized controlled study comparing the&#xD;
      effect of rehabilitation exercise digital healthcare system at home with conventional&#xD;
      brochure-based home exercise. Limb Symmetry Index (LSI), Pain (using Numerical rating scale),&#xD;
      knee joint range of motion (ROM), lower extremities motor power (using Manual muscle test),&#xD;
      International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and quality of life using EQ-5D-5L will be&#xD;
      evaluation on enrollment, 2-weeks, 6-weeks, 12-weeks and 24-weeks after enrollment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anterior cruciate ligament(ACL) is a vital structure in the knee maintaining the stability&#xD;
      and due to increased population engaging in sports activities, the ACL injury is becoming&#xD;
      more prevalent among young adults. Rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction is essential to&#xD;
      restore knee function and many factors including age, degree of sports activities engagement,&#xD;
      weight bearing should be considered when organizing rehabilitation programs. Knee joint&#xD;
      stiffness and weakness of knee flexor/extensor muscles are common problems following the&#xD;
      surgery which are related to improper rehabilitation after ACL reconstructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current method of post-operative rehabilitation is home-based self rehabilitation using&#xD;
      brochure, combined with one or two times of education at the hospital before discharge.&#xD;
      Patients often find difficulty in doing rehabilitation by themselves at home without&#xD;
      supervision which resulted in decreased compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With development of technologies using multi-motion sensor and AR(augmented-reality) system,&#xD;
      the investigators have developed a digital healthcare system(Uincare Homeplus) which can&#xD;
      supplement patients' rehabilitation at home by giving them proper instructions as well as&#xD;
      feedback. In this prospective randomized controlled study, the investigators aim to compare&#xD;
      the efficacy of the newlydeveloped digital healthcare system with conventional rehabilitation&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
