  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the context of making high quality dietary choices among Black adults&#xD;
      with hypertension. Secondly, this study will also investigate what Black adults need or&#xD;
      desire to participate in a digital intervention to improve dietary quality by adopting the&#xD;
      DASH eating pattern.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 50% of adults in the United States have high blood pressure, a leading contributor to&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. When race is considered, the majority of black adults (55%) have high&#xD;
      blood pressure, a greater prevalence than other racial/ethnic groups. The elevated rate of&#xD;
      high blood pressure, a diet-related disease, reflects the sub-optimal diet quality observed&#xD;
      in blacks. The DASH dietary pattern is an evidence-based strategy to treat high blood&#xD;
      pressure that has become part of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. DASH promotes a diet&#xD;
      rich in fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy, controlled amounts of total fat, cholesterol&#xD;
      and saturated fat, high fiber and protein content. Data from the National Health and&#xD;
      Nutrition Examination Survey indicate that approximately 19% of adults with high blood&#xD;
      pressure were DASH adherent. Those who were adherent tended to be older and non-black with a&#xD;
      higher education level. Even after intervention, lower DASH adherence scores have been seen&#xD;
      in blacks versus whites, possibly due to lower baseline consumption of DASH foods in blacks.&#xD;
      Although dietary improvements from DASH-promoting interventions have been observed, adherence&#xD;
      has decreased over time, and when translated to less controlled settings. Sufficient&#xD;
      representation of blacks is important for clinical trials testing DASH given the&#xD;
      disproportionate prevalence of high blood pressure. This study will examine factors that may&#xD;
      influence black adults' participation and success in improving dietary quality through the&#xD;
      following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify barriers to and facilitators of recruiting black adults into a digital&#xD;
           DASH-promoting intervention. A semi-structured interview guide will direct individual&#xD;
           interviews via phone with black men and women to understand what supports or deters&#xD;
           participation in a digital health intervention trial for dietary quality improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the barriers and facilitators to improving dietary quality in black adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants in the individual interviews (Aim 1) will also identify their motivations,&#xD;
           concerns and priorities surrounding dietary change. This will inform recruitment efforts&#xD;
           and our understanding about how to improve dietary quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To conduct secondary data analyses to determine the effectiveness, by race and gender&#xD;
           group, of various recruitment methods from a 12-month randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
           examine the effects of the intervention on changes in dietary quality and blood pressure&#xD;
           among men and women with high blood pressure (clinical trails identifier: NCT03875768).&#xD;
           The intervention asks participants to track their diet daily using a common commercial&#xD;
           tracking app with an extensive nutrient database via smartphone. Food and nutrient data&#xD;
           from the app is processed using an application programming interface, compared against&#xD;
           an algorithm, and generates personalized automated text messages to each participant&#xD;
           with information on DASH diet adherence and diet tips. Responsive coaching is also&#xD;
           included for participants that require greater support for dietary change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diverse sample recruitment is essential to producing outcomes that are applicable to diverse&#xD;
      populations living with hypertension. Examination of barriers and facilitators to consuming a&#xD;
      quality diet and identification of effective recruitment methods for digital interventions&#xD;
      may inform how investigators reach black men and women with hypertension to effectively&#xD;
      improve diet for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
