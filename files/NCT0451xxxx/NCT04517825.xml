  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-phase study designed to assess measures of feasibility, sustainability,&#xD;
      acceptability, penetration, and fidelity before and after implementation of a rapid molecular&#xD;
      HIV-1 viral load testing infrastructure at a level III health center in rural western Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that implementation of PoC HIV-1 testing without accompanying&#xD;
      modifications to clinic triage and flow, laboratory processes, and existing protocols guiding&#xD;
      adherence counseling and regimen change, will not result in significant improvement in&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in PLWH.&#xD;

      This is a two-phase study designed to assess measures of feasibility, sustainability,&#xD;
      acceptability, penetration, and fidelity before and after implementation of a rapid molecular&#xD;
      HIV-1 viral load testing infrastructure at a level III health center in rural western Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1, the study team will perform/record the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Administer a basic demographic and health questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Record routine clinical parameters during visit to include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Current ARV and prophylaxis regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Last CD4 and VL, if available&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Clinical illness since last visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Document the amount of time each patient spends in each phase of clinic (i.e. waiting&#xD;
           room, provider, phlebotomy, waiting for results, adherence counseling).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Measure the number of participants requiring HIV-1 VL testing each clinic day,&#xD;
           proportion electing to receive results by phone or at next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients having blood drawn for HIV-1 VL testing will complete a semi-structured&#xD;
           interview to explore perceptions of the current testing paradigm when results are&#xD;
           received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Provider and laboratory staff will complete a semi-structured interview to explore&#xD;
           perceptions of the current testing paradigm with emphasis on workload&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2, the study team will perform/record the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Record routine clinical parameters during visit to include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Current ARV and prophylaxis regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Last CD4 and VL, if available&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Clinical illness since last visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the amount of time each patient spends in each phase of clinic (i.e. waiting&#xD;
           room, provider, phlebotomy, waiting for results, adherence counseling).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measure the number of Xpert HIV-1 tests performed, the amount of time laboratory staff&#xD;
           spends performing the tests and conducting maintenance, the number of tests failures&#xD;
           and/or invalid tests, and equipment downtime related problems with software or power&#xD;
           supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Measure the number of participants requiring HIV-1 VL testing each clinic day,&#xD;
           proportion electing to receive results on same day, by phone, or next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients having blood drawn for HIV-1 VL testing will complete a semi-structured&#xD;
           interview to explore perceptions of the current testing paradigm when results are&#xD;
           received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Provider and laboratory staff will complete a semi-structured interview to explore&#xD;
           perceptions of the current testing paradigm with emphasis on workload.&#xD;
