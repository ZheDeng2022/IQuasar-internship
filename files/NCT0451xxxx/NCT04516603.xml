    <measure>Medium-load working memory performance</measure>
    <time_frame>test day 1 and 2, each 4 hours after intake of study medication to assess differences between the Verum and Placebo condition</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy as assessed by a letter n-back task (Papassotiropoulos, Henke et al. 2011) with the levels 0-back and 2-back.&#xD;
This test includes a 2-back task assessing working memory and a 0-back task ('x-target' task) measuring concentration. The 2-back task requires participants to respond to a letter repeat with one intervening letter (for example, S-m-s-g…). The 'x-target' task requires participants to respond to the occurrence of the letter 'x' in a sequence of letters (for example, N-l-X-g…). Accuracy (i.e. correct 2-back responses minus correct 0-back responses) will be calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reaction time</measure>
    <time_frame>test day 1 and 2 each 4 hours after intake of study medication to assess differences between the Verum and Placebo condition</time_frame>
    <description>Reaction time for correct 2-back responses minus correct 0-back responses.</description>

    <measure>N-back with a 3-back condition</measure>
    <time_frame>test day 1 and 2 each 4 hours after intake of study medication to assess differences between the Verum and Placebo condition</time_frame>
    <description>N-back with a 3-back condition, which is more demanding than the 2-back condition. Accuracy (3-back minus 0-back) will be calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symbol Digit Modalities Test, SDMT</measure>
    <time_frame>test day 1 and 2 each 4 hours after intake of study medication to assess differences between the Verum and Placebo condition</time_frame>
    <description>Symbol Digit Modalities Test, SDMT (Smith 2013, 13th edition), a processing speed test. The test consists of the presentation of a series of 9 symbols, each of them is paired with a single digit, labeled 1-9, in a key at the top of a sheet. The remainder of the page has a pseudorandomized sequence of the symbols and the participant must respond with the digit associated with each of these as quickly as possible. The score is the number of correct answers in 90 seconds. The administration of SDMT will be preceded by a learning sequence at both timepoints. A parallel version will be used for the second test day.</description>

    <measure>Bochumer Matrizentest (BOMAT - advanced -short)</measure>
    <time_frame>test day 1 and 2 each 4 hours after intake of study medication to assess differences between the Verum and Placebo condition</time_frame>
    <description>Bochumer Matrizentest (BOMAT - advanced -short; Hossiep/Turck/Hasella, 2001, 1st edition), matrix reasoning. The BOMAT will be administered to measure fluid intelligence (Gf) consisting of 29 items. A time-limited version will be used according to Jaeggi (Jaeggi 2010). The total score is calculated by summing the correct solutions, ranging between 0 to 29. A parallel version will be used for the second test day.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Digit Span Task</measure>
    <time_frame>test day 1 and 2 each 4 hours after intake of study medication to assess differences between the Verum and Placebo condition</time_frame>
    <description>Digit span task, a subtest of the &quot;Wechsler Intelligenztest für Erwachsene&quot; (WIE;von Aster 2006). Total scores for digit span forward and backward will be calculated as described in the manual of the WIE. A parallel version will be used for the second test day.</description>
