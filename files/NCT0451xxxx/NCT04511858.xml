  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mechanisms contributing to muscle fatigue in extreme long-duration exercise bouts are&#xD;
      poorly understood. Ultra-endurance exercise is an excellent model for the study of adaptive&#xD;
      responses to extreme loads and stress and it is an especially useful model for documenting&#xD;
      the origins of central fatigue. This protocol will compare fatigue during and after&#xD;
      ultra-endurance exercise bouts that result in moderate lower-limb tissue damage (i.e.&#xD;
      cycling) or significant damage (i.e. running). The results of this protocol will allow us to&#xD;
      further understanding of the reasons for major central fatigue, i.e. within the central&#xD;
      nervous system, in ultra-endurance.&#xD;
