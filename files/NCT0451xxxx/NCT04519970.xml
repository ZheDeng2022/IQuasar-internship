    <textblock>
      COMEBACK is an investigator-initiated, 48-week study. The study will be conducted in 100&#xD;
      persons living with HIV (PLWH) who have been off ART for two or more weeks. All enrolled&#xD;
      participants will be prescribed Biktarvy, if determined appropriate upon review of past&#xD;
      historical resistance tests, for use throughout the study period. Participants will also&#xD;
      complete a series of Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) at screening and be assigned one of&#xD;
      three tiers of case management intervention (Piggyback, Got Your Back, Backbone), with each&#xD;
      tier increasing in intensity regarding intervention techniques and options provided.&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed for virologic suppression, retention in care, and PROS&#xD;
      throughout study follow up and at study end.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In most settings in the US when patients out of care and off of ART reengage with clinical&#xD;
      providers routine labs are collected, including CMP, CD4, VL, and HIV resistance testing when&#xD;
      indicated, healthcare benefits are reassessed, and the most recent ART regimen is restarted&#xD;
      if the patient agrees to treatment. There may be characteristics of these regimens that may&#xD;
      present barriers to sufficient adherence, or perform suboptimally in patients with certain&#xD;
      immunologic and/or viral factors, which may impact virologic suppression, including multiple&#xD;
      pills, drug-drug interactions, variable tolerability, low CD4, high VL, or low thresholds for&#xD;
      resistance. Biktarvy is a Single Tablet Regimen (STR) with high potency and good tolerability&#xD;
      that can be safely used in multiple patient groups, with features, including activity in&#xD;
      patients with a history of multi-class resistance, that may facilitate immediate ART&#xD;
      reinitiation among a broad population of patients reengaging in care in order to promote&#xD;
      rapid virologic suppression. Addressing this important patient population with poor retention&#xD;
      with support mechanisms to reengage in care and reinitiate effective ART immediately may&#xD;
      improve retention in care and accelerate virologic suppression as likewise derived in&#xD;
      immediate ART models in treatment-na√Øve patients, and represent a touchstone to drive&#xD;
      sustainability in preventing new HIV transmissions in a high burden area to meet the goals of&#xD;
      reducing HIV as a public health threat over the next 10 years.&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The most intensive tier of case management. Includes three appointment reminders; check ins twice per week; travel compensation; housing support; food insecurity support; follow ups for missed appointments and off pill counts; connections with substance use programs; meetings with the benefits department for health insurance needs; childcare support to make appointments; mental healthcare referrals; open pool appointments as back-up options in case of rescheduling needs; late doctor's appointments and prescription pick up for those working during the day; meetings with the health educators to discuss HIV and ART; and re-motivation of HIV treatment every 3 months.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The middle tier (Got Your Back) will work closely with the CORE case managers to augment their work in housing support, transportation assistance, mental healthcare referrals, childcare assistance, substance use program referrals, food insecurity support and health insurance needs. The retention specialist will additionally provide this middle tier 2 reminders for appointments; check ins once per week; follow ups for missed appointments or off pill counts; support with scheduling appointments for limited availability; meetings with the health educators for information on HIV or ART; and re-motivation for treatment at the 6 and 9 month marks of participation.</description>

    <description>The top tier (Backbone) will need the least amount of support and also have a CORE Center case manager for a majority of the support in housing, food, insurance, transportation, childcare, substance use, and mental healthcare. The retention specialist will still provide an appointment reminder; check ins every other week; text checkups after missed appointments or off pill counts; support with scheduling for appointments or prescription pick up for limited availability; and re-motivation of treatment for HIV at the 9 month mark of study participation.</description>
