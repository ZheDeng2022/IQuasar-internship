  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carotenoids are yellow-orange fat soluble plant pigments primarily obtained from the diet&#xD;
      that serve as an accurate biomarker for fruit and vegetable intake. Carotenoids have&#xD;
      demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-obesogenic properties among others.&#xD;
      Excess carotenoids are deposited in the skin for storage where they protect against UV skin&#xD;
      damage and contribute to improvements in skin health (i.e., decrease the appearance of&#xD;
      wrinkles). However, carotenoid status is linked to bioavailability and absorption, which has&#xD;
      a high inter-individual variability. It has been hypothesized that inter-individual&#xD;
      variations are related to the diversity of gut microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to determine whether probiotic supplementation can enhance&#xD;
      carotenoid status and responsiveness to carotenoid-mediated changes in blood and skin from&#xD;
      intake of a supplement containing mixed forms of carotenoids in pre-menopausal women.&#xD;

    <description>A perception trial is a validated method used to determine the attractiveness preferences of participants (Lefevre &amp; Perrett, 2015). Images of participants from the intervention trial will be sent to the Department of Psychology at McGill University, where the laboratory coordinator will set up an electronic survey that will display randomized sets of images from the same intervention participant at all timepoints (week 0, 5, and 10) of the intervention, in randomized order of presentation (left and right). A separate group of 60 participants will be recruited to participate in the perception trial and assess the images of the intervention participants. These participants will be trained using a few sample photos and then will be instructed to choose the most attractive and healthy looking face in a forced-choice paradigm for each comparison presented in the electronic survey.</description>

    <measure>Changes in quality of life assessed by SF-36 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, 5, and 10</time_frame>
    <description>The short form 36-Item Health Survey 1.0 Questionnaire is a validated questionnaire that will be used to assess QoL as a recent study (Valler-Colomer et al., 2019) demonstrated a consistent association between higher QoL indicators and particular gut microbiota profiles (butyrate-producing Faecalibacterium and Coprococcus bacteria). This survey consists of 36 items that average together to indicate eight scale scores for various health indicators (e.g., emotional well-being, general health, etc.). Scores range from 0-100, with higher scores representing better health. Carotenoid supplementation has also demonstrated improvements in sub-optimal symptoms of physical and emotional health measured via various self-reported questionnaires (Stringham et al., 2018).</description>
