  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this study is to evaluate the post-operative course in patients undergoing diagnostic&#xD;
      or therapeutic oral mucosal biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the wound healing, all variables connected with the surgery (including&#xD;
      post-operative complications) were recorded. To evaluate the psychological and behavioral&#xD;
      impact of the post-operative discomfort, two survey tools were administered: OHIP-14 and&#xD;
      visual number scale of pain (VNS) were administered at 6h, 7 days and 21 days after biopsy.&#xD;

        Eighty-four patients were enrolled in this study; four of them were excluded because the&#xD;
        clinical records were incomplete. Among the 80 patients left, 30 were males and 50 females,&#xD;
        with a mean age of 60.25 years (range 23-88); clinical data about remote pathological&#xD;
        history were collected: 31/80 patients did not have any systemic diseases, 22/80 only one&#xD;
        disease, 27/80 more than one disease; 36/80 patients did not take any drug, 16/80 only one&#xD;
        and 28/80 more than one; 63/80 patients did not smoke, 10/80 were former smokers and 7/80&#xD;
        were smokers.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  no systemic or local contraindications for surgical treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  need for an oral biopsy (both excisional and incisional).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Since no absolute contraindications to oral biopsies are reported, no exclusion criteria&#xD;
        were selected for this study, but if any relative contraindication was present (i.e.&#xD;
        bleeding disorders) biopsy was performed after the resolution of the problem&#xD;
