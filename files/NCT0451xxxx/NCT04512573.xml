  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, real-world observational study in which patients with RA who are&#xD;
      initiating treatment with a JAK inhibitor medication will self-report disease activity and&#xD;
      treatment satisfaction measures using their own web-enabled device such as a smartphone.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include analyzing the epidemiology and natural history of the disease,&#xD;
      its comorbidities, and current treatment practices.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to analyze self-reported disease activity outcomes and&#xD;
      treatment satisfaction measures in the real world using a bring-your-own-device approach for&#xD;
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are initiating a JAKi medication. An exploratory&#xD;
      objective is to assess the feasibility of using smartphone or web-based data collection to&#xD;
      expand upon the insights gained through the Corrona RA Registry which uses a traditional&#xD;
      site-based approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POWER is a prospective, non-interventional study that will collect structured real-world data&#xD;
      from patients with RA using a patient-centered mobile health application called&#xD;
      ArthritisPower™. Patients planning to start treatment with a JAKi medication will self-report&#xD;
      disease activity and treatment satisfaction through their first 3 months of therapy using&#xD;
      their own web-enabled device such as a smartphone or computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the Corrona RA Registry at the time of a routine clinical&#xD;
      encounter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After POWER registration, the remainder of the study is carried out using an automated data&#xD;
      collection schedule via the web-based ArthritisPower™ application. Patients may complete&#xD;
      assessments using a web browser or by downloading the free ArthritisPower™ application to a&#xD;
      smartphone or tablet.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        The following eligibility criteria are designed to select patients for whom study&#xD;
        assessments are deemed appropriate. Patients must have attained at least the locally&#xD;
        recognized age of consent and provide written or electronic informed consent to participate&#xD;
      </textblock>

    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A patient MUST satisfy all of the following criteria to be eligible for enrollment into the&#xD;
        POWER study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient is currently participating in the Corrona RA Registry OR is eligible to&#xD;
             participate and enrolls into the RA Registry prior to POWER study registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is willing and able to complete online weekly surveys about their RA using&#xD;
             their own computer, tablet,or smartphone and have a valid email address.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient is literate in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients provides consent for their data to be included in ArthritisPower™ registry in&#xD;
             addition to providing consent to participate in the POWER study itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. In conjunction with POWER registration:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A Corrona RA Registry Enrollment or Follow-up visit is conducted (includes both&#xD;
                  the Provider and Subject questionnaires and most recent Lab/Imaging Results if&#xD;
                  available)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patient is newly prescribed* or receives their first dose of one of the following&#xD;
                  JAK-inhibitor medications: OLUMIANT® (baricitinib), RINVOQ™ (upadacitinib), or&#xD;
                  XELJANZ / XELJANZ XR® (tofacitinib)**, or any other JAK inhibitor approved during&#xD;
                  the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The decision to treat with a new therapy must precede the decision to&#xD;
                       recruit the patient into this study. Prior use of a JAK-inhibitor medication&#xD;
                       does not exclude a patient from enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Patients switching to and from either formula of tofacitinib (Xeljanz 5&#xD;
                            mg BID or the &quot;once daily&quot; XR 11 mg version) do not qualify for the&#xD;
                            POWER study.&#xD;
