  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oocyte activation is an imperative stage in the initiation of embryo development during the&#xD;
      fertilization. Indeed, the entrance of sperm into the oocyte causes sequences of calcium&#xD;
      oscillations in its cytoplasm, regulating a series of molecular events called oocyte&#xD;
      activation. The intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has allowed fertilization in couples&#xD;
      with severe male factor infertility. But, there was still fertilization failure or low&#xD;
      fertilization occurs in ICSI cycles. It has reported that insufficient of oocyte activation&#xD;
      is the important cause of fertilization failure. Artificial oocyte activation (AOA)&#xD;
      represents an effective technique, can restore the calcium oscillations to improve the&#xD;
      fertilization. Here, the investigators explore the effective of different AOA methods&#xD;
      including oocyte was injected CaCl2 or mechanical stimulated then treated with calcium&#xD;
      ionophore.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ICSI procedure improves fertilization rates in cases of male factor infertility. However,&#xD;
      fertilization failure still occurs in 1-5% in ICSI cycles. The main cause of failed&#xD;
      fertilization is failure to complete oocyte activation. Oocyte activation involves a&#xD;
      multitude of molecular changes. The investigators use a variety of mechanical, electrical,&#xD;
      and chemical methods to trigger the calcium oscillations necessary to activate oocytes.&#xD;
      During mechanical activation of oocytes, oolemmas are pierced using a microneedle to trigger&#xD;
      a calcium influx. Another method for mechanical oocyte activation is the direct&#xD;
      microinjection of calcium into the oocyte to increase intracellular calcium. It has been&#xD;
      described with the use of calcium ionophore A23187, which can mimic the natural pattern of&#xD;
      calcium rise. Mechanical and chemical activation are the most commonly used methods for&#xD;
      artificial oocyte activation, can mimic calcium oscillations resulting in successful&#xD;
      fertilization. AOA, a highly specialized fertilization technique that can be added to&#xD;
      conventional ICSI to overcome fertilization failure in patients that had failed fertilization&#xD;
      or poor quality embryos history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the number of retrieved oocytes was &gt;10, sibling oocytes were divided into 3 groups to&#xD;
      perform the standard ICSI procedure (control group), chemical AOA (A1 experiment group) or&#xD;
      mechanical AOA (A2 experiment group). When the number of retrieved oocytes was 6-10, sibling&#xD;
      oocytes were randomized 1:1 to perform the chemical AOA (A1 experiment group) or mechanical&#xD;
      AOA (A2 experiment group). The number of retrieved oocytes was 1-5, all oocytes were perform&#xD;
      the chemical AOA. Control group, a single spermatozoon was injected into the ooplasm,&#xD;
      standard ICSI procedure. A1 experiment group, were treated by injecting CaCl2 concurrently&#xD;
      with ICSI followed by sequential exposure of calcium ionophore A23187 activation solution for&#xD;
      two times of post-ICSI AOA. A2 experiment group, mechanical stimulation was done before&#xD;
      standard ICSI procedure, then the oocytes were transferred into the calcium ionophore A23187&#xD;
      activation solution for two times of post-ICSI AOA. The investigators want to establish the&#xD;
      effective and safe of different AOA methods, to improve the fertilization outcome and embryo&#xD;
      quality, and finally obtain healthy offspring.&#xD;
