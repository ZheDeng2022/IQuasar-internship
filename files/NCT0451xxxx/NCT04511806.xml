  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Childhood Cancer Predisposition Study (CCPS) is a multi-center, longitudinal,&#xD;
      observational study that will collect clinical and biological data and specimens from&#xD;
      children with a cancer predisposition syndromes (CPS) and their relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that studying individuals at high risk for childhood cancer creates&#xD;
      a unique opportunity for improving the understanding of carcinogenesis, tumor surveillance,&#xD;
      early detection, and cancer prevention, which will collectively contribute to improving care&#xD;
      and outcomes for pediatric patients with cancer and those with cancer predisposition&#xD;
      syndromes (CPS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CCPS is designed as a multi-center, longitudinal, observational study that will collect&#xD;
      clinical and biological data and specimens from children with a CPS and their relatives. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish and maintain a framework for recruitment, participation, and surveillance of&#xD;
           children with cancer predisposition syndromes (CPS) in clinical and translational&#xD;
           research studies;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Define the natural history of disease in children with CPS; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the clinical impact and effectiveness of standard and emerging tumor&#xD;
           surveillance strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 350 Children and 700 Relatives per year. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to collect demographic and diagnostic data at enrollment. Longitudinal&#xD;
      follow-up will be performed at least annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CCPS includes the establishment of a biorepository, with a hub and spoke structure, with&#xD;
      a central repository at Emory University/Children's Healthcare of Atlanta for prospective&#xD;
      collection of some tissues, linked to local biorepositories at participating institutions.&#xD;
      Information about inventory of tumor specimens already banked locally will be available in&#xD;
      the database, along with reference to existing genomic studies of the tumor, such that&#xD;
      investigators may identify and request such tissue or data for specific studies, subject to&#xD;
      approval of the CCPS Scientific Committee.&#xD;
