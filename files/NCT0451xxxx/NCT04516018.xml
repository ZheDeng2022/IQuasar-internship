    <description>An oral glucose tolerance test will be performed on day 1 of the study. The next day (day 2), subjects will be exposed to shivering thermogenesis for at least 1 hour. The day after, an oral glucose tolerance test will be performed (day 3). The following 9 days, subjects will be exposed daily to shivering thermogenesis for at least 1 hour (day 4-12). On the last day (day 13), an oral glucose tolerance test will be performed.</description>
