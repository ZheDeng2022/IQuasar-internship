  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The breastfeeding rates globally in Indonesia generally remain low with only 40% or less&#xD;
      infants aged 6 months are exclusively breastfed. Available national data in 2018 showed the&#xD;
      proportion of wasted in children under 5 years old was 6.7%, while 3.5% children were&#xD;
      severely wasted. This data showed improvement compared data in 2007 and 2013. While&#xD;
      proportion children under 2 years old with stunted and severly stunted was 29.9%. As the&#xD;
      third most abundant group of compounds in human milk, after lactose (70 g/L) and lipids (40&#xD;
      g/L), human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) never been study in Indonesia. HMOs amount and&#xD;
      diversity influenced by non modifiable and modifiable factors. The maternal phenotypes, the&#xD;
      α-1-2-fucosyltransferase (FUT-2) gene and the α-1-3-4-fucosyltransferase (FUT-3) gene divided&#xD;
      the mother into secretor (Se+) and non secretor (Se-) and Le+ or Le-). Studies showed the&#xD;
      breastfed infants of non secretor mothers secrete lower HMOs than secretor mothers. By many&#xD;
      functions in HMOs such as prebiotic, anti infection, modulate immunity, it is thought that&#xD;
      HMOs can influence infant growth. The hypothesis of this study is to show the associations&#xD;
      between maternal factors (secretor gene status/FUT-2 gene, lewis gene status/FUT-3 gene,&#xD;
      gestational age and gestational weight gain) with HMOs profiles and growth indicators of&#xD;
      infants aged 0-4 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective longitudinal study to analyze the association between HMOs&#xD;
      profiles and growth indicators of infants age 0-4 months. In this longitudinal study, the&#xD;
      human milk, anthropometry assessment and questionnaires will be collect in the 0, 2, 4 month&#xD;
      of age. Gestational age and birth weight will be obtain from the medical status upon&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conduct in Government &amp; Private Hospital in Jakarta between Juli - December&#xD;
      2020. Based on sample size calculation, the total minimal samples are 120 samples. Subjects&#xD;
      recruitment will be based on nonprobabilistic consecutive sampling to post partum inpatient&#xD;
      mothers in Government &amp; Private Hospital in Jakarta between Juli - December 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study forms consist of study information, informed consent, screening form, baseline data,&#xD;
      follow up form and laboratory result form. The tools requirements are among others Seca 728&#xD;
      electronic infant scale, Anthropometry Plus (AnthroPlus) Software, World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO) growth velocity chart, Questionnaires, Thermometer, 15 mL polypropylene tube,&#xD;
      Disposable gloves and vacuum bag with dry ice. The specimens obtain for this study are 15 mL&#xD;
      venous blood for genotyping and 10 mL breast milk (0, 2, 4 month).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining clearance from Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Medicine University of&#xD;
      Indonesia, the post partum mothers will be presented with Form A (study information form).&#xD;
      Patients will be informed about the aim, benefits and procedures of the study. If patients&#xD;
      agree, she will have to sign the informed consent (Form B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study phases consists of&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. screening : description of the aims, benefits and procedures of the study, filling the&#xD;
           informed consent, screening based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data collection :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Interview. Interview will be done to fill information in Form C and D.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subjects selected during the screening visit will follow a 4 month study. Primary&#xD;
                and secondary outcomes will be measured at 0, 2, 4 months (visit 1-2-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. All data will be edited, coded and entry to the computer. The Statistical Package&#xD;
                for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for windows version 20.0 will be use for data&#xD;
                analyzing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Univariate analysis will be conduct to know the distribution of each variables.&#xD;
                Test of normality of the data will be perform with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test at the&#xD;
                significance level p&gt;0.05 as normally distributed data. The continuous data will be&#xD;
                present as mean ± standard deviation and for categorical data in n (%) for normally&#xD;
                distributed data and geometric mean ± standard deviation forn non-normally&#xD;
                distributed data.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. For bivariate analysis, Pearson correlation test will be performed if the data is&#xD;
                normally distributed or Spearman Rank test if the data is non-normally distributed.&#xD;
                Reference for rho value show in Table 3.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Multivariate analysis will be conduct by linear regression model.&#xD;
