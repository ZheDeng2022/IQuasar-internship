    <textblock>
      This is a quasi-experimental study with pre-post assessment using a convenience sample of&#xD;
      Calm and Oura employees. We will employ two weeks of baseline data collection and administer&#xD;
      the intervention for four-weeks. Participants will be randomized to one of three groups&#xD;
      (i.e., general meditations, sleep meditations, or Sleep Stories). Self-report assessments&#xD;
      will be conducted during baseline periods and during week 1 and week 4 of the intervention.&#xD;
      Sleep diaries and objective (i.e., Oura ring and Calm app) usage data will be collected on a&#xD;
      continual basis during intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test the preliminary effects of using Calm (daytime vs nighttime) for four weeks on&#xD;
           sleep outcomes (sleep quality, sleep onset, sleep efficiency, number of nighttime&#xD;
           awakenings, total sleep time) using self-report and objective measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Self-report: Sleep diaries, pre-sleep arousal (Pre-Sleep Arousal Survey), fatigue&#xD;
                (Fatigue Severity Scale), daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), insomnia&#xD;
                (Insomnia Severity Index), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Objective: Oura ring (sleep onset, sleep efficiency, number of nighttime&#xD;
                awakenings, total sleep time, REM/light/deep sleep).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test the preliminary effects of using Calm (daytime vs nighttime) on neurophysiological&#xD;
           outcomes [heart rate variability (HRV), heart rate, respiratory rate] as measured by the&#xD;
           Oura ring during meditation and after four-weeks of mobile meditation practice.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 30% of the US population reports sleep disturbances, and the Centers for Disease&#xD;
      Control and Prevention has identified insufficient sleep as a public health epidemic. Current&#xD;
      evidence-based interventions for sleep disturbance (e.g., Cognitive Behavior Therapy for&#xD;
      insomnia, Relaxation Therapy) are lengthy and limited due to the need for specialized&#xD;
      providers. Pharmaco-therapy may help, however they have inherent limitations (e.g.,&#xD;
      tolerance, side effects, interactions) to their use. Novel treatments that effectively and&#xD;
      conveniently address sleep disturbances (i.e., help individuals self-manage sleep) need&#xD;
      further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commercially available mobile applications (apps) may help individuals self-manage health&#xD;
      conditions conveniently at low cost and with little to no side effects. Specifically,&#xD;
      mindfulness-based interventions (e.g., mindfulness meditation) targeting sleep and delivered&#xD;
      via a mobile app may be an attractive, feasible and effective solution to improve sleep. Few,&#xD;
      if any sleep interventions testing mobile meditation apps have assessed their effects on&#xD;
      sleep and most studies only include self-report measures rather than objective measures of&#xD;
      sleep (e.g., portable sleep trackers). Additionally, no studies have assessed the&#xD;
      neurophysiological changes (heart rate variability, heart rate, respiratory rate) during or&#xD;
      with prolonged use of a mindfulness meditation mobile app and whether these changes vary&#xD;
      based on time of day. Thus, there is an unexplored opportunity to efficiently and effectively&#xD;
      test the use of a mindfulness meditation mobile app on sleep and neurophysiological outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from our previous study testing the effects of the mindfulness meditation mobile app&#xD;
      called Calm on sleep outcomes (manuscript in review; PloS one), suggest that the Calm app&#xD;
      improves self-reported sleep quality, and decreases daytime fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and&#xD;
      cognitive/somatic pre-sleep arousal in sleep disturbed adults. However, we did not collect&#xD;
      any objective data to confirm these findings and are unsure if these findings can be&#xD;
      replicated in otherwise healthy adults. We also did not collect any neurophysiological&#xD;
      outcomes during meditation practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test the preliminary effects of using Calm (daytime vs nighttime) for four weeks on&#xD;
           sleep outcomes (sleep quality, sleep onset, sleep efficiency, number of nighttime&#xD;
           awakenings, total sleep time) using self-report and objective measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Self-report: Sleep diaries (Pittsburgh Sleep Diaries), pre-sleep arousal (Pre-Sleep&#xD;
                Arousal Survey), fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale), and daytime sleepiness (Epworth&#xD;
                Sleepiness Scale), insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Objective: Oura ring (sleep onset, sleep efficiency, number of nighttime&#xD;
                awakenings, total sleep time, REM/light/deep sleep).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test the preliminary effects of using Calm (daytime vs nighttime) on neurophysiological&#xD;
           outcomes [heart rate variability (HRV), heart rate, respiratory rate] as measured by the&#xD;
           Oura ring during meditation and after four-weeks of mobile meditation practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Calm app provides daily, 10-minute, guided general meditations as well as sleep-focused&#xD;
      meditations grounded in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and Vipassana meditation.&#xD;
      Uniquely, Calm also offers &quot;Sleep Stories&quot;, developed using techniques from Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavioral Therapy and Relaxation Technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Oura Ring is a portable wearable device designed to be worn on the finger. The device&#xD;
      includes a 3D accelerometer and gyroscope to measure light, deep, and rapid eye movement&#xD;
      sleep. The device also measures heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate. The&#xD;
      Oura Ring has shown promise as a tool to measure sleep outcomes when compared to the gold&#xD;
      standard polysomnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a quasi-experimental study with pre-post assessment using a convenience&#xD;
      sample of Calm and Oura employees. We will employ two weeks of baseline data collection and&#xD;
      administer the intervention for four-weeks. Participants will be randomized to one of three&#xD;
      groups (i.e., general meditations, sleep meditations, or Sleep Stories). Self-report&#xD;
      assessments will be conducted during baseline periods and during week 1 and week 4 of the&#xD;
      intervention. Sleep diaries and objective (i.e., Oura ring and Calm app) usage data will be&#xD;
      collected on a continual basis during intervention.&#xD;
