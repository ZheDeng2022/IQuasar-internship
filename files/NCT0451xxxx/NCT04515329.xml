  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye is the most common reason for visit to an ophthalmologist's office. The prevalence is&#xD;
      on the rise and is mainly attributed to factors such as increased environmental pollution and&#xD;
      contact lens use. The current management options are limited to over the counter artificial&#xD;
      tear drops and three FDA-approved drugs. Of these, cyclosporine has been used worldwide for&#xD;
      treating mild to moderate dry eyes. The earlier version consisted of 0.05% cyclosporine which&#xD;
      worked well for a limited number of inflammatory dry eye conditions. Recently, 0.09%&#xD;
      cyclosporine was approved by the FDA. The nearly double concentration is expected to be more&#xD;
      beneficial for severe inflammation which is often seen in Sjögren syndrome and other&#xD;
      Rheumatological conditions associated with dry eyes. In this pilot project, the investigator&#xD;
      proposes to evaluate the change in expression of SLURP1 and other markers of ocular surface&#xD;
      inflammation before and after treatment with 0.09% cyclosporine eye drops.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be recruited based on their diagnosis of dry eyes and an estimate of the&#xD;
      severity of the disease that would be made by the investigator based on the patient's history&#xD;
      and clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dry Eye Severity is determined by scoring &gt; 12 on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)&#xD;
      rubric, which is standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have been diagnosed with dry eye, but who have not been prescribed a drug to&#xD;
      treat that condition, will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing a consent form, subjects will complete their routine care eye exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI will include consecutive patients for each arm. Once the mandate is completed in both&#xD;
      arms, the investigator will stop the recruitment. The investigator will include patients who&#xD;
      will choose to use artificial tear drops in one group. For the other group, the investigator&#xD;
      will choose patients who would electively agree to use cyclosporine eyedrops. If these&#xD;
      patients choose not to be a part of the study, they will still end up using the treatment&#xD;
      that they would like to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study arm: Treatment will be commenced with cyclosporine eye drops twice daily with&#xD;
           preservative-free artificial tear drops 4 times a day (Treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control arm: Preservative-free artificial tear drops 4 times a day (Control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye drop timetable:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If instructed to take 4 times a day, the subject will instill one drop in the morning,&#xD;
           the afternoon, the early evening, and before bedtime.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If instructed to take 2 times a day, the subject will instill one drop in the morning&#xD;
           and the evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will also be instructed to space eye drops by 3-5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the Cyclosporine and Artificial Tears will be ordered by the subject's doctor, which&#xD;
      will be available through the subject's pharmacist. These drops are normally prescribed as&#xD;
      part of the subject's routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both subjects and physicians will be aware of the type of treatment; however the data entry&#xD;
      and analysis would be blinded. This will be done by giving each individual subject a linking&#xD;
      code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will self-administer the eyedrops for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ---------------------------------------------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following samples would be collected at baseline and at Week 8:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline (Visit 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tear Fluid Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impression Cytology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 4 (Visit 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Data collection: Subject will follow up normally with their ophthalmologist as part of&#xD;
      their routine care eye exam. The following will be collected: Demographics; Clinical History&#xD;
      and office visits; Images and Photography; and Microbiology records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 8 (Visit 3):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tear Fluid Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impression Cytology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 1 and 3 will add up to 20 minutes to the participant's routine care eye exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ---------------------------------------------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explanation of Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numbing Anesthesia Drop (Proparacaine 0.5%):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will receive a numbing anesthesia drop (Proparacaine 0.5%) in the eye that is&#xD;
      inflamed as part of their standard of care. The effect of this drop will wear off in 20&#xD;
      minutes after instillation, but the subject is not required to stay until the numbing&#xD;
      subsides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tear Fluid Collection (Schirmer Testing):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small amount of the subject's tears will be collected by placing paper strips in the corner&#xD;
      of their eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impression Cytology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect a single sample of material from the surface of the subject's&#xD;
      eye and then evaluate it on a cellular level. During impression cytology the subject will be&#xD;
      asked to look straight ahead with their chin slightly lifted. A drop of anesthetic eye drops&#xD;
      is instilled in the lower fornix of the eye. The plunger of the impression cytology device&#xD;
      (EYEPRIM; OPIA Technologies SAS, Paris, France, or equivalent) is pushed to touch the cornea&#xD;
      with the membrane gently for 5 seconds. The pressure is released before removing the device.&#xD;
      The membrane is then carefully transferred from the device into a 1.5-mL tube using a pair of&#xD;
      sterile forceps. Multiple EYEPRIM membranes may be collected. One drop of artificial tear&#xD;
      drop would be instilled on the surface of the eye. The participant would be asked to close&#xD;
      his/her eye for a few seconds. A capillary tube or Schirmer's strip would be used to collect&#xD;
      the tear film.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of research procedures will be approximately 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ---------------------------------------------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiology analysis will be processed at the UPMC Eye Center's Ophthalmology Microbiology&#xD;
      Lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tear fluid samples would be analyzed by ELISA for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Matrix metalloproteinase-9&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SLURP-1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HLA-DR5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL-1RA,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL-6, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL-8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impression cytology samples would be used to isolate total RNA, which will be converted to&#xD;
      cDNA and used for QPCR evaluation of corresponding transcripts for the above targets. QPCRs&#xD;
      along with ELISAs would provide convincing evidence to elucidate the effect(s) of 0.09%&#xD;
      cyclosporine on expression of these markers of ocular surface inflammation. At the end of the&#xD;
      study, the subject assignments will be unmasked and the difference between the treatment and&#xD;
      the control groups analyzed.&#xD;

The OSDI quickly assesses the symptoms of ocular irritation in dry eye disease and how they affect functioning related to vision. This 12-item questionnaire assesses dry eye symptoms and the effects it has on vision-related function in the past week of the patient's life. The questionnaire has 3 subscales: ocular symptoms, vision-related function, and environmental triggers. Patients rate their responses on a 0 to 4 scale with 0 corresponding to &quot;none of the time&quot; and 4 corresponding to &quot;all of the time.&quot; A final score is calculated which ranges from 0 to 100 with scores 0 to 12 representing normal, 13 to 22 representing mild dry eye disease, 23 to 32 representing moderate dry eye disease, and greater than 33 representing severe dry eye disease.</description>
