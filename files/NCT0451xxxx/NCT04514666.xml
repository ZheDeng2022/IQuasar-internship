      Kidney and liver trasplants represent very challenging lifesaving and effective surgical&#xD;
      procedures for patients with end-stage kidney and/or liver disease.&#xD;

      transplants.&#xD;

      While acute rejection is clearly detected due to the clinical features and laboratory tools,&#xD;
      the early identification of chronic rejection is still challenging since the clinical&#xD;
      features are often silents and laboratory tests become suggestive when the damage due to the&#xD;
      rejection is almost irreversible.&#xD;

      Kidney and liver trasplants represent very challenging lifesaving and effective surgical&#xD;
      procedures for patients with end-stage kidney and/or liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays the short and long term success rate of kidney and liver trasplants is pretty hight.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, transplant rejection remains one of the biggest limitations with a strong&#xD;
      impact on patients survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usually acute rejection occurs within 3 months after the transplant and is the most common&#xD;
      cause of transplant failure and the most common indication for re-transplantation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic rejection may occur in 3 to 17% livers transplants and in 20 to 40% kidney&#xD;
      transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While acute rejection is clearly detected due to the clinical features and laboratory tools,&#xD;
      the early identification of chronic rejection is still challenging since the clinical&#xD;
      features are often silents and laboratory tests become suggestive when the damage due to the&#xD;
      rejection is almost irreversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic renal transplant rejection is the result of a gradual decrease in the kidney function&#xD;
      that starts to become evident three months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kidney chronic rejection is, by definition, immune-mediated and generally divides into&#xD;
      chronic active antibody-mediated rejection and chronic active T cell-mediated rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplant vasculopathy is the single most important feature of chronic renal transplant&#xD;
      rejection and it is the direct consequence of an immune reaction that activates a cytokines&#xD;
      cascade with a tissue fibrosis and chronic rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension and proteinuria are the most important features of declining renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests such as serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)ccan&#xD;
      help to early identify kidney allograft dysfunction. The eGFR is suggested to be a more&#xD;
      accurate indicator and predictor of graft function and long term graft loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a biopsy is mandatory for diagnosing chronic renal transplant rejection. C4d&#xD;
      complement fragment deposition in the peritubular capillaries represents the marker for&#xD;
      antibody-mediated tissue injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the incidence of acute and chronic rejection has declined with improvement of&#xD;
      immunosuppression regimens, chronic rejection may lead to re-transplant or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic liver allograft rejection usually occurs more than 2 months after transplantation and&#xD;
      most frequently develops after an unresolved or multiple episodes of acute rejection or&#xD;
      indolently over a period of months to years, with few or no clinically apparent acute&#xD;
      cellular rejection episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic rejection characterized primarily by fibrointimal hyperplasia of arteries, or&#xD;
      obliterative arteriopathy, interstitial fibrosis and atrophy of parenchymal elements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Often the only reliable early indicator of chronic rejection is persistent and preferential&#xD;
      elevation of Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase, which is related to bile&#xD;
      duct damage. In most of cases the only clinical sign is jaundice and it appears when&#xD;
      allograft dysfunction becomes. Biliary sludging or appearance of biliary strictures, hepatic&#xD;
      infarcts, and finally loss of hepatic synthetic function, which can manifest as coagulopathy,&#xD;
      malnutrition, and hepatosplenomegaly are late findings presaging allograft failure. Biopsy is&#xD;
      mandatory to assess the liver damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breath analysis (Breathomics) is applied widely nowadays in clinical setting in order to&#xD;
      identify and evaluate exhaled molecular volatile compounds as expression of a metabolic&#xD;
      derangement of the organism including chronic diseases and cancer disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel approach, a breath test based on the metabolomic evaluation of the volatile organic&#xD;
      compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath, has recently been developed by our group to identify&#xD;
      patients with Colorectal cancer, showing good reliability and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VOCs analysis has also been demonstrated to find an application in the diagnosis of chronic&#xD;
      liver and kidney disease with high sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the recent application of the breathomic to liver and kidney disease and the&#xD;
      difficulty in the early detection of chronic rejection after liver and kidney transplants,&#xD;
      the analysis of the exhaled VOCs pattern could help early detection of chronic rejection&#xD;
      allowing a prompt medical treatment.&#xD;
