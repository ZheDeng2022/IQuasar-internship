  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopy procedure is a frequently used method in the evaluation of the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      system. Upper gastrointestinal system endoscopy can be performed with and without sedation.&#xD;
      Sedation is the controlled sleep of the patient with certain drugs (pharmacological methods).&#xD;
      Non-pharmacological methods help reduce anxiety and pain. In this study, a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological stress ball will be used. It is aimed to evaluate the effect of using a&#xD;
      stress ball on pain, anxiety and satisfaction during upper gastrointestinal system endoscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients do not want to think that an upper GIS endoscopy without sedation will be difficult.&#xD;
      However, some complications can be seen like hypoxemia, allergic reaction, malignant&#xD;
      hyperthermia, hypoventilation, respiratory depression, hypotension, bradycardia, apnea,&#xD;
      hypoxia, etc. due to sedation applied during endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-pharmacological methods help reduce anxiety and pain. Although sedative and analgesic&#xD;
      medications reduce anxiety and relieve pain, endoscopy is still painful for patients. During&#xD;
      the endoscopy process, non-pharmacological methods are used to draw attention to another&#xD;
      direction, but it is not encountered that the stress ball is used as one of these methods in&#xD;
      the endoscopy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was planned as a single-center prospective randomized controlled study for the&#xD;
      treatment of the stress ball method used during the endoscopy procedure, pain in anxiety and&#xD;
      satisfaction levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained in the study will be analyzed using the SPSS (Statistical Package for&#xD;
      Social Sciences) for Windows 22.0 program. Number, percentage, mean, standard deviation will&#xD;
      be used as descriptive statistical methods in the evaluation of data. In comparing the&#xD;
      difference between two independent groups, Student's t test will be used for data conforming&#xD;
      to normal distribution, and Mann-Whitney U test will be used for data that do not comply with&#xD;
      normal distribution. The difference between two repeated measurements will be analyzed with&#xD;
      dependent groups t-test for data conforming to normal distribution, and Wilcoxon test for&#xD;
      data that do not conform to normal distribution. The difference between three and more&#xD;
      measurements that do not comply with the normal distribution will be compared with the&#xD;
      analysis of variance in repeated measures for data that do not fit the normal distribution,&#xD;
      and with the Friedman test for data that do not comply with the normal distribution. A value&#xD;
      of P &lt;0.05 will be considered as statistically significant.&#xD;

    <description>The stress ball is a toy, usually no larger than 7 cm. It is used to relieve stress and muscle tension. Stress ball is one of the cognitive and behavioral therapy methods used in pain control. Stress ball is used as a method of diverting attention during painful procedures. It appears to reduce pain and anxiety.</description>
