      Open label study with peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT). Peanut allergic children aged &gt;1 and&#xD;
      &lt;4 years of age will be randomized 2:1 to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Peanut OIT with slow up-dosing (40-60 weeks) up to a maintenance dose of 286 mg daily&#xD;
           oral peanut protein and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group with peanut allergic children who do not undergo OIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In addition, a group of healthy children without allergic diseases will be included in&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome, sustained unresponsiveness (i.e. tolerance) to 600 mg peanut protein&#xD;
      after 3 years of OIT, efficacy and safety will be compared between group 1 and 2. Group 3 is&#xD;
      a control group for analyses of immunological markers.&#xD;

      Problem: Today there is no clinically available treatment for peanut allergy. Oral&#xD;
      Immunotherapy (OIT) studies have shown promising results, particularly in younger children&#xD;
      (&lt;4 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Peanut OIT in children aged &gt;1 and &lt;4 years with peanut allergy (clinical&#xD;
      symptoms at peanut challenge and IgE &gt;0.1 kU /l to peanut and/or Ara h 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison: Three groups are compared. Peanut allergic children are randomized 2:1 to group 1&#xD;
      (active OIT) or group 2 (control). Group 3 consists of age-matched healthy controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1; Children with peanut allergy receiving peanut OIT, slow up-dosing, 40-60 weeks,&#xD;
      until the maintenance dose 286 mg peanut protein. Three years' treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2; Age-matched children with peanut allergy who do not undergo OIT peanut. Peanut&#xD;
      challenge one and three years after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3; Healthy, non-allergic, age-matched children. No challenges are performed in this&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion of study subjects: A review of samples sent to the Karolinska University Laboratory&#xD;
      for IgE-ab responses to peanut/Ara h 2 for children in the Stockholm area aged 1-&lt;4 years is&#xD;
      used for identification of potential participants to whom a letter is sent with information&#xD;
      about the study. The families are randomized 2:1 to OIT or control group, group 1 or group 2.&#xD;
      Children without allergies, healthy Controls (group 3), will be identified through the day&#xD;
      surgery at Astrid Lindgren's Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary outcome is defined as sustained unresponsiveness to 775 mg peanut&#xD;
      protein (cumulative dose) at an open oral peanut challenge 4 weeks after 3 years of OIT was&#xD;
      stopped (group 1 and 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are adverse events among peanut allergic children with/without OIT&#xD;
      treatment (group 1 and 2), and changes in quality of life parameters and immunological&#xD;
      markers (group, 1, 2, 3).&#xD;

    <description>Examine how quality of life, measured with Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire-parental Form (FAQLQ-PF), is affected in families with peanut allergic children undergoing peanut OIT compared to those without peanut OIT. FAQLQ-PF has questions for food-allergy specific QoL with general emotional impact; food anxiety; social and dietary limitations. The FAQLQ-PF has a seven-point scale ranging from 0 (no impact on HRQL) to 6 (extreme impact on HRQL).Overall and domain-specific HRQL scores will be calculated. Higher scores mean a worse outcome and a score of ≥ ±0.5 will be considered clinically relevant.</description>

    <description>To study differerent immunological biomarkers (e.g. T-helper cell-population and polarization and IgE levels) before, during and after OIT treatment and compare this to healthy controls. Immunological marker in mononuclear cells in peripheral blood will be analyzed ex vivo with flowcytometri and RNA-sequensingplatforms. Cirkulating immunological factors, e.g. cytokines and chemocines will be analyzed in plasma with ELISA-based methods.Mononuclear cellpopulations in periferal blood will be exposed to different stimuli (such as peanut, anti-C D3/C D28) in vitro, type anf level of reaction in the different cellpopulations will be monitored at mRNA- och protein-level.</description>
