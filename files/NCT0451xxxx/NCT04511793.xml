  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Duke HAI program was implemented in November 2018 and treated 30 patients in its first 17&#xD;
      months using the Medtronic Synchromed II device (only commercially available device suitable&#xD;
      for HAI for cancer patients). The Duke HAI program has demonstrated safety of HAI with an&#xD;
      overall complication rate was 19%, similar to prior published data, with all but one&#xD;
      complication (extrahepatic perfusion) salvaged. The Investigator has also demonstrated&#xD;
      feasibility and efficacy of a new HAI program, with 95% of patients initiating therapy with&#xD;
      promising hepatic response and disease control rates. This protocol will enable the team to&#xD;
      continue this program. All eligible patients will receive the synchromed II pump with a&#xD;
      Codman catheter and chemotherapy including FUDR, dexamethasone and heparin. Systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be given per standard of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is an interventional study for HAI therapy at Duke. The protocol is essentially&#xD;
      for clinical treatment and the Investigator is not collecting safety and effectiveness data&#xD;
      on the device itself. There are three primary indications for the hepatic artery infusion&#xD;
      pump. The first are patients with unresectable, metastatic, liver-only or -dominant&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. Although conversion to resection is a primary goal in these patients, most&#xD;
      of these patients will die of liver disease and therefore controlling liver disease is a&#xD;
      secondary goal to improve survival. The second group of patients are those with resectable,&#xD;
      but high risk metastatic, liver-only or -dominant colorectal cancer. These patients are at&#xD;
      high risk for liver recurrence, and HAI has demonstrated significant improvement in outcomes.&#xD;
      The last group are patients with unresectable primary liver cancer, primarily intrahepatic&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma. These patients have central tumors that are rarely resectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will have the following procedures performed during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. On the day of surgery, the Synchromed II pump will be implanted and the Codman® catheter&#xD;
           placed for chemotherapy infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During the hospital stay, patients will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Daily physical examination to evaluate for the development of complications&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Daily blood tests to evaluate blood cell counts and liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Initiation of a proton-pump inhibitor, if not already a home medication, which will&#xD;
                continue indefinitely&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic visits and study activities will take place every 2 weeks after surgery, and include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine blood tests for blood cell counts, kidney function, and liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nuclear medicine SPECT/CT scan to confirm the pump and catheter are working properly.&#xD;
           This is a type of scan where the images or pictures from two different types of scans&#xD;
           are combined together.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Start hepatic artery infusion (HAI) chemotherapy (at 2 week post-op).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HAI includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Floxuridine (FUDR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heparin: (If heparin allergy, fondaparinux will be added)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal saline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation and treatment, including blood work and refilling the pump, every 2 weeks,&#xD;
           until treatment is discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Systemic chemotherapy (every 2 weeks after HAI started)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer will receive systemic chemotherapy that will&#xD;
           consist of either FOLFIRI, FOLFOX, or Irinotecan/oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with cholangiocarcinoma will receive Gemcitabine/Oxaliplatin or Gemcitabine&#xD;
           alone&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the chemotherapy regimen has completed, the Synchromed II pump will be reprogrammed&#xD;
      every 4 weeks indefinitely.&#xD;

    <description>The Medtronic Synchromed II pump with the Codman® Catheter will be used to create the investigational device. The Medtronic Synchromed II pump is a surgically implantable device that allows for the delivery of high doses of chemotherapy directly to the liver, in order to treat cancer. The device is surgically implanted into a subcutaneous pocket in the abdominal wall, and the catheter is inserted into the arterial system of the liver, allowing for chemotherapeutic delivery.</description>
