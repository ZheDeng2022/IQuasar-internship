  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies if a single session of palliative radiation therapy can help&#xD;
      improve symptoms of gynecologic cancers that have spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (metastatic) and that affect quality of life as well or more so than multiple sessions (which&#xD;
      is the standard of care). Palliative radiation therapy may help patients with metastatic&#xD;
      gynecologic cancers live more comfortably. Researchers also want to learn how radiation&#xD;
      affects the immune system and to compare the effects of giving one radiation treatment to&#xD;
      giving multiple radiation treatments.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether single fraction palliative radiation therapy (SFRT) improves&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) over multi-fraction palliative radiotherapy (MFRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether single fraction palliative radiation therapy (SFRT) improves&#xD;
      individual domains of health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) over multi-fraction palliative&#xD;
      radiotherapy (MFRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether SFRT increases clinically meaningful HR-QOL improvement over MFRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine whether SFRT provides non-inferior symptom burden improvement to MFRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To describe radiation related toxicity rates within 21 days and within year for patients&#xD;
      receiving SFRT and MFRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe T-cell repertoire of patients receiving SFRT and MFRT. II. To describe vaginal&#xD;
      microbiome of patients receiving SFRT and MFRT. III. To describe gut microbiome of patients&#xD;
      receiving SFRT and MFRT. IV. To describe financial burden of patients undergoing palliative&#xD;
      pelvic radiation with either SFRT or MFRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients undergo standard of care radiation therapy in the form of 3-dimensional&#xD;
      conformal radiation therapy (3D CRT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), or volume&#xD;
      modulated arc therapy (VMAT) at the physician's discretion for 1 fraction in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with &lt; 30% decrease in the Symptom&#xD;
      Inventory Scale (SIS) may receive an additional fraction on day 21 at the physician's&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients undergo standard of care radiation therapy in the form of 3D CRT, IMRT, or&#xD;
      VMAT at the physician's discretion over 2 weeks for 10 fractions in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 1&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
