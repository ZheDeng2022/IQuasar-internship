    <textblock>
      This trial investigates how well a smartphone-based smoking cessation program called&#xD;
      SmartQuit works to help patients stop smoking. SmartQuit is an smartphone application-based&#xD;
      smoking cessation program that includes a defined program consisting of interactive&#xD;
      evidence-based exercises for dealing more effectively with urges to smoke, a place to track&#xD;
      desired behaviors, personalized plans for quitting, and a certificate of completion once the&#xD;
      recommended program components are completed. SmartQuit may help patients quit smoking, lower&#xD;
      healthcare costs and reduce premature tobacco-related deaths.&#xD;
