  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brachial plexus block (BPB) is frequently used as the sole anesthestic technique for upper&#xD;
      extremity surgery. However, the choice of injection can be made from different approaches&#xD;
      that often depends on the site of surgery because the extent of sensory-motor blockade after&#xD;
      a BPB varies with the approach used. The investigator is not aware of any single BPB&#xD;
      technique that can consistently produce surgical anaesthesia of the whole ipsilateral upper&#xD;
      extremity. However, occasionally surgery entails that the whole upper extremity is&#xD;
      anesthetized, i.e. from the shoulder to the elbow, or even the forearm, wrist or hands. This&#xD;
      clinical challenge has been addressed previously using a combination of BPB techniques. The&#xD;
      investigator has recently demonstrated that it is feasible to accurately identify majority of&#xD;
      the main components of the brachial plexus above the clavicle, including the three trunks,&#xD;
      using ultrasound imaging. Since majority of the innervation of the upper extremity, i.e.&#xD;
      shoulder, arm, elbow, forearm, wrist and hand, originates from the three trunks of the&#xD;
      brachial plexus, the investigator hypothesized that selectively blocking upper, middle, and&#xD;
      inferior trunks of the brachial plexus will produce surgical anesthetsia of the whole&#xD;
      ipsilateral upper extremity. The aim of this study is to assess a novel brachial plexus block&#xD;
      technique, the selective trunk block (SeTB), and provide preliminary clinical evidence of its&#xD;
      effectiveness in producing surgical anesthesia of the whole ipsilateral upper extremity.&#xD;

      Brachial plexus block (BPB) is frequently used as the sole anesthetic technique for upper&#xD;

      whole ipsilateral upper extremity, except for the area innervated by the intercostobrachial&#xD;
      nerve (T2- medial aspect of the upper arm). In addition, there may be a potential advantage&#xD;
      that phrenic nerve can be spared, so this blockade will not affect the respiratory function&#xD;
      as it is common to see phrenic nerve palsy after interascalene BPB (100%) and supraclavicular&#xD;
      BPB (50-67%). The aim of this study is therefore to assess a novel brachial plexus block&#xD;
      technique, the &quot;selective trunk block&quot; (SeTB), and provide preliminary clinical evidence of&#xD;
      its effectiveness in producing surgical anesthesia of the whole ipsilateral upper extremity.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes of sensory block of the upper extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>within 45 minutes after the block at 5 minutes interval</time_frame>
    <description>Sensation to coldness (ice) will be tested at the median (lateral three and half digits on the palmar side), radial (dorsal side of hand), ulnar (medial one and a half digits), musculocutaneous (lateral side of the forearm), axillary (skin over the lower deltoid) and supra scapular nerve (skin over the scapula) and graded using a verbal rating scale (VRS: 0-100, 100=normal sensation, 0=no sensation). Onset of sensory block for each nerve will be defined as the time that it took to achieve a sensory block score of ≤ 30.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of motor blockade of the upper extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>within 45 minutes after the block at 5 minutes interval</time_frame>
    <description>Motor blockade will be graded using a 3-points scale revising from previous study: 2 = no block, 1 = paresis and 0 = paralysis. Motor blockade of each individual nerve in the anaesthetized upper extremity will be evaluated by testing for opposition of thumb with the index finger (median nerve), wrist extension (radial nerve), thumb opposition with little finger (ulnar nerve), elbow flexion (musculocutaneous nerve) and abduction of shoulder (axillary nerve). The onset of motor block for each nerve will be defined as motor grading at each nerve ≤ 1. Complete block will be defined as a sensory and motor block score of '0' in all five nerve (median, ulnar, radial, musculocutaneous nerve and axillary) functions and a sensory score of '0' at Suprascapular nerve dermatome.</description>

    <measure>Readiness for surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>within 45 minutes after the block at 5 minutes interval</time_frame>
    <description>Overall sensory scores ≤ 30 (VRS: 0-100, 100=normal sensation, 0=no sensation) and motor score ≤ 1 (3-points scale: 2=no block, 1=paresis, 0= paralysis) in all the five nerves tested.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of the Diaphragmatic function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline(before brachial plexus block) and at 30 minutes after block</time_frame>
    <description>Excursion of the right Hemidiaphragm will be measured by ultrasound machine in supine position via the anterior subcostal route. The movement of the diaphragm will be measured in centimetres. The range of diaphragmatic excursion will be recorded from the resting expiratory position to deep inspiration (sigh test) as will be the range of diaphragmatic movement from resting expiratory position when quickly inspiring through the nose (sniff test). The decrease in diaphragmatic excursion will be calculated as the difference (in %) in diaphragmatic excursion measured before and 30 minutes after SeTB. Reduction in diaphragmatic excursion of more than 75%, or no movement, or paradoxical movement will be considered as complete paresis. Reduction in diaphragmatic excursion of both sigh and sniff test between 25% and 75% will be considered as partial paresis and diaphragmatic excursion of less than 25% will be considered as 'no paresis.</description>
