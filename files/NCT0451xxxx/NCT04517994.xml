  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Strength at Home Couples program is designed to enhance intimate relationships and&#xD;
      prevent intimate partner violence (IPV) among service members and their partners in light of&#xD;
      the unique stressors and experiences of this population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A Hybrid Type-I Implementation-effectiveness research design will allow the research team,&#xD;
      comprising investigators with expertise in treatment development, efficacy and effectiveness&#xD;
      research, and implementation science, to simultaneously investigate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      SAH-C in a military population while identifying any barriers to implementation that would&#xD;
      need to be addressed before SAH-C could be successfully implemented on a larger scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAH-C derives from a unique fusion of interventions for trauma and IPA, integrating elements&#xD;
      of cognitive processing therapy for PTSD,39 couples therapy for PTSD,40 and a cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral intervention for IPA.41 SAH-C consists of 10 two-hour weekly sessions, co-led by&#xD;
      two therapists. This was the minimum length deemed necessary to incorporate components&#xD;
      addressing the proposed IPA mechanisms and is consistent with the briefest IPA&#xD;
      interventions.42 During each session, couples are provided assignments to practice skills&#xD;
      together and to assist with the consolidation of material. A group couples format is used&#xD;
      because group cohesion among clients appears to be associated with IPA prevention.43 Group&#xD;
      interventions also use less time and resources than individual-based interventions.&#xD;
