  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to investigate whether the addition of a surgeon-administered adductor&#xD;
      canal blockade to a multimodal periarticular injection cocktail provides additional pain&#xD;
      relief for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. This study will help identify the&#xD;
      effectiveness of surgeon-administered adductor canal blockade in perioperative pain control&#xD;
      for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Local anesthesia is an important component of multimodal pain management during the&#xD;
      perioperative period for total knee arthroplasty, particularly with increased emphasis on&#xD;
      early mobilization and decreased length of stay. Periarticular injections and regional nerve&#xD;
      blocks are both effective in providing short-term pain relief when administered in isolation,&#xD;
      and multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that when administered in&#xD;
      conjunction with one another, they also provide a synergistic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periarticular injections are the simplest mechanism for infiltrating the surgical site with&#xD;
      analgesic medications, and these provide effective pain relief. One described technique&#xD;
      involves infiltrating this mixture into the lateral femoral periosteum, posterior capsule,&#xD;
      medial periosteum, capsule and skin during various portions of a total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
      This is the technique used in our practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional nerve blocks also have beneficial effects on pain, early mobilization and length of&#xD;
      stay. Traditionally, anesthesiologist-administered femoral nerve blocks were utilized for&#xD;
      this purpose. The femoral nerve consists of 4 main branches:the terminal portion of the&#xD;
      vastusmedialis branch innervates the medial collateral ligament (MCL). The terminal portion&#xD;
      of the vastusintermedius branch innervates the anterosuperior aspect of the knee capsule. The&#xD;
      terminal portion of the vastuslateralis branch does not innervate the knee capsule. The&#xD;
      saphenous nerve is the terminal sensory branch of the femoral nerve and travels in the&#xD;
      adductor canal. It gives off an infrapatellar branch which exits the adductor canal to&#xD;
      innervate the skin on the anteromedial aspect of the knee and the anteroinferior aspect of&#xD;
      the knee capsule. Blockade of the entire femoral nerve results in significant quadriceps&#xD;
      motor deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adductor canal blocks can be targeted to anesthetize only the saphenous branch of the femoral&#xD;
      nerve, however, and this spares the motor innervation to the quadriceps. Multiple randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials have shown that these adductor canal blockades provide equivalent analgesic&#xD;
      effects to femoral nerve blocks without associated deficits in quadriceps strength. In one&#xD;
      study, quadriceps strength was measured immediately prior to and immediately following&#xD;
      placement of femoral and adductor can blocks in patients undergoing TKA. After the femoral&#xD;
      block, quadriceps strength decreased to 16% of the baseline pre-block value. After the&#xD;
      adductor-canal-block, however, strength increased to 193% of the pre-block value. MRI&#xD;
      measurements, cadaveric injections, and dissections have shown that a surgeon-performed&#xD;
      injection of the saphenous nerve from within the knee after it exits from the adductor canal&#xD;
      is a feasible procedure, and a randomized controlled trial found that a surgeon-administered&#xD;
      adductor canal blockade was non-inferior to the traditional adductor canal blockade&#xD;
      administered by an anesthesiologist. This technique is simple and can be easily performed&#xD;
      during administration of a periarticular injection. It is unclear based on the current&#xD;
      literature whether this surgeon-administered adductor canal blockade provides a synergistic&#xD;
      effect on pain relief when combined with a periarticular injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment group will consist of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty who receive&#xD;
      standardized 100 cc periarticular injection into the lateral femoral periosteum, posterior&#xD;
      capsule, medial periosteum, capsule and skin. Patients will then receive 10cc of ropivacaine&#xD;
      into their adductor canal. This will be administered by injecting into the adductor canal&#xD;
      without dissecting down to the saphenous nerve and without ultrasound guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison (Control) Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will consist of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty who receive a&#xD;
      standardized periarticular injection into the lateral femoral periosteum, posterior capsule,&#xD;
      medial periosteum, capsule and skin. Patients randomized in this group will then receive 10cc&#xD;
      of saline into their adductor canal. This will be administered by injecting into the adductor&#xD;
      canal without dissecting down to the saphenous nerve and without ultrasound guidance.&#xD;
