  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      68Ga-FAPI has been developed as a tumor-targeting agent as fibroblast activation protein is&#xD;
      overexpressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts and some inflammation, such as IgG4-related&#xD;
      disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Some researches identified FAP expression in synovial&#xD;
      samples taken from both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis patients.Thus this&#xD;
      prospective study is going to investigate whether 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT may be superior for&#xD;
      diagnosis, therapy response assessment and follow-up of arthritis than 18F-FDG PET/CT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arthritis is a term used to mean any disorder that affects the joints. The two most common&#xD;
      forms of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.Rheumatoid arthritis is an&#xD;
      autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology and is characterized by chronic&#xD;
      inflammation of the joint capsule's synovial membrane. This chronic inflammation ultimately&#xD;
      destroys the underlying cartilage and bone. Activated fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) line&#xD;
      the synovial membrane and are a prominent cell type responsible for inflammation and joint&#xD;
      destruction. Osteoarthritis is characterized by degradation of joint cartilage. Studies&#xD;
      demonstrate chondrocytes expressed FAP and that chondrocyte FAP expression was elevated in&#xD;
      patients with osteoarthritis. Other researches identified FAP expression in synovial samples&#xD;
      taken from both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis patients. However, FAP expression was&#xD;
      greater in samples taken from refractory rheumatoid arthritis patients in comparison to&#xD;
      end-stage osteoarthritis patients.68Ga-FAPI has been developed as a tumor-targeting agent as&#xD;
      fibroblast activation protein is overexpressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts and some&#xD;
      inflammation, such as IgG4-related disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Recently the&#xD;
      investigators have published an article of the application of 68Ga-FAPI in IgG4-related&#xD;
      disease which showed it was more sensitive than FDG in detecting a certain type of&#xD;
      inflammations. Thus this prospective study is going to investigate whether 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT&#xD;
      may be superior for diagnosis, therapy response assessment and follow-up of arthritis than&#xD;
      18F-FDG PET/CT.&#xD;
