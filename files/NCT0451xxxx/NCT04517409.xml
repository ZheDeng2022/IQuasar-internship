    <textblock>
      The aim of the study of patients undergoing major hepatic resection was compared standard&#xD;
      perioperative (control Group) with hemodinamic management based on PPV, VVS, continuos CO&#xD;
      trending and dynamic arterial elastance using radial artery pulse contour analysis (GDHT&#xD;
      group). We hypothessized that following this treatment regimen after hepatic resection&#xD;
      results in reduced postoperative complications (primary endpoint) and reduced length of&#xD;
      hospital stay (secundary endpoint)&#xD;

      The study was performed as a prospective randomized trial at the Department of Anesthesiology&#xD;
      and Intensive Care Medicine and the Department of Surgery of the Hospital Universitario de&#xD;
      Ciudad Real, Spain.Faculty. The study was approved by the local ethical committee. All&#xD;
      patients scheduled for hepatic resection of more than two segments were found eligible for&#xD;
      study inclusion. Exclusion criteria were: age less than 18, body weight less than 50 kg or&#xD;
      more than 150 kg, irregular heart rhythm, severe cardiovascular disease (chronic heart&#xD;
      failure, valvular abnormality, cardiomyopathy, etc.), severe liver dysfunction (Child Pugh&#xD;
      score B or C). All participants signed informed consent prior study inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients were equally randomized into two study groups: 1) Standard perioperative&#xD;
      (Control group ) and 2) hemodinamic management based using radial artery pulse contour&#xD;
      analysis (GDHT group). Randomization was performed the day before surgery by the study member&#xD;
      responsable for anesthesia delivery using sealed opaque envelope technique stored in&#xD;
      non-transparent containers with group allocation in a 1:1 ratio. Only patients were blinded&#xD;
      to group allocation. Care providers and investigators could not be blinded due to the&#xD;
      presence of the cardiac index trending monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects received balanced anaesthesia, i.v. anaesthetic induction, and neuromuscular&#xD;
      relaxants; for pragmatic reasons, their administration was at the discretion of the&#xD;
      anaesthetist. Bispectral index monitoring was used to monitor the depth of anaesthesia.&#xD;
      Sevoflurane was used for anaesthesia maintenance, with a BIS target range of 40-60. Central&#xD;
      venous catheter placement and invasive radial arterial blood pressure monitoring were&#xD;
      performed per preference of the anaesthetist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects had basic anaesthetic monitoring with fivelead ECG, pulse oximetry, and&#xD;
      oscillometric blood pressure; at least one peripheral i.v. line was established. All subjects&#xD;
      received standard measures to maintain oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry &gt;94%,&#xD;
      normothermia, and heart rate &lt;100 beats min-1. Ventilation with inspired oxygen fraction of&#xD;
      60% was mechanically controlled to maintain PaCO2 between 4.7 and 6.0 kPa, with a positive&#xD;
      end-expiratory pressure of 4-6mm Hg and tidal volume of 6-8 ml kg-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases when PM was used, hemodynamic data were recorded one minute before the clamp, one&#xD;
      minute after the clamp and one minute afterthe PM's release. Ephedrine was given in case of&#xD;
      hemodynamic instability (mean arterial pressure &lt;65 mmHg) and if repeated boluses were&#xD;
      ineffective, noradrenaline infusion was started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a case of acute blood loss (more than 150 mL/ min or more than 500 mL), colloid infusion&#xD;
      of was administered with respect to maximal recommended dose (30 mL/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, blood loss was compensated for by infusi√≥n of colloid in a 1:1 ratio. Packed&#xD;
      red cells were transfused for haemoglobin &lt;10 g dl-1 in subjects with cardiac comorbidities,&#xD;
      or &lt;7 g dl-1 in those without cardiac comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic data were documented every 15 minutes. At the beginning of hepatic resection,&#xD;
      middle and at the end of surgery blood samples were drawn for arterial and central venous&#xD;
      blood gas analysis. At the end of surgery total catecholamine administration, estimated blood&#xD;
      loss, urine output and infused fluids were recorded. The time between the end of surgery and&#xD;
      extubation was recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GDHT group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The arterial line was additionally connected to the cardiac index trending monitor (ProAQT,&#xD;
      PULSION Medical Systems SE, Munich, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid therapy was given. Before hepatic resection (Static phase) all patiens received&#xD;
      continuous infusion of balanced crystalloid fluids (Ringer,s lactate) at 1 ml kg-1h-1 After&#xD;
      hepatic resection (Dynamic phase), the patients received an initial hemodynamic assessment&#xD;
      based on PPV, CI and MAP, as shown in Figure 1. First, preload was optimized by fluid loading&#xD;
      until PPV was &lt;14% or VVS &lt;12%, subjects were given 4 ml kg-1 boluses colloid solution every&#xD;
      5 minutes. At this point, the patient's individual preload optimized CI was determined and&#xD;
      used as the hemodynamic goal until the end of surgery. Only if this value was below 2.5&#xD;
      L/min/(m2), inotropes were applied to reach this minimum CI, serving as a safety parameter to&#xD;
      prevent patients from low cardiac output. If PPV and CI were within the target range but MAP&#xD;
      was below 65 mmHg or PPV/VVS&gt;1,2, vasopressors were started. After the initial assessment,&#xD;
      patients were reassessed every 15 minutes intraoperatively to maintain values&#xD;
