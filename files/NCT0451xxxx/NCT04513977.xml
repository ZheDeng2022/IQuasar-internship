      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing the impact of Geriatric-Oncology-Supportive&#xD;
      Clinic (GOSC) on quality of life in older adult with newly diagnosed cancer undergoing cancer&#xD;
      related treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      (i) Recognition of unique need of older adults cancer patients Cancer is a disease largely&#xD;
      affecting the older adults, with incidence of malignancies after age of 65 years 11 folds&#xD;
      higher than younger adults. Despite this, our understanding of cancer treatment effects in&#xD;
      older adults is poor because they are largely unrepresented in such trials. Efforts to&#xD;
      extrapolate cancer treatment effects from younger adults to the older adults have been&#xD;
      difficult because of their heterogeneous health status, which lead to a recognition of the&#xD;
      need for Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) to detect vulnerability and formulate&#xD;
      individualized care plan. This awareness has been echoed in multiple international guidelines&#xD;
      including the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), European Organization for&#xD;
      Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO),&#xD;
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and has led to the founding of International&#xD;
      Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) in 2000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Geriatric-Oncology In Geriatric Medicine, CGA is the cornerstone in caring for the older&#xD;
      adults and is defined as &quot;multidisciplinary diagnostic and treatment process that identifies&#xD;
      medical, psychosocial, and functional capabilities of older adults to develop a coordinated&#xD;
      plan to maximize overall health with aging&quot;. The diagnostic outcomes and treatment targets of&#xD;
      CGA are traditionally represented as &quot;geriatric giants&quot; including instability, incontinence,&#xD;
      immobility and intellectual impairment, with recent inclusion of &quot;modern geriatric giants&quot;&#xD;
      represented by frailty and sarcopenia. CGA has been shown to improve function, health status,&#xD;
      quality of life and healthcare utilization outcomes in diverse clinical settings. It is&#xD;
      important to understand that the key to improve patient outcomes based on CGA relies not only&#xD;
      on the assessment butalso the intervention that follows. The CGA by a geriatrician, however,&#xD;
      is labor-intensive, time consuming and limited by the number of geriatricians available.&#xD;
      Hence, in a busy oncology clinic, there are 3 recommended approaches for assessment of older&#xD;
      adults. Firstly, in a form of risk assessment tool, such as Cancer and Aging Research Group&#xD;
      (CARG) or Chemotherapy Risk Assessment Scale for High-Age Patients (CRASH), that predicts&#xD;
      likelihood of toxicity from chemotherapy. Secondly, a screening test, such as Geriatric-8&#xD;
      (G8) with an aggregate that serves to identify vulnerable older adults who may benefit from a&#xD;
      subsequent CGA. Thirdly, a geriatric assessment (GA) which takes into account the different&#xD;
      domains of CGA to identify vulnerable older adults who may benefit from a subsequent CGA. The&#xD;
      above 3 pathways also form the current models of care for geriatric-oncology. G8 has been&#xD;
      recommended by ASCO and EORTC as a screening test of choice (&lt;=14 as vulnerable and &gt;14 as&#xD;
      fit) with good sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive&#xD;
      value for vulnerability against CGA assessment outcomes as the gold standard. G8 has been&#xD;
      extensively studied in older adults with cancer undergoing radio(chemo)therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) Special consideration to older adults with early and locally advanced cancer Current&#xD;
      published trials and ongoing trials focused on older adults who are undergoing oncological&#xD;
      treatment regardless on cancer stage. However, generally, early and locally advanced cancer&#xD;
      patients and advanced cancer groups should not be regarded to be homogenous. Firstly, the&#xD;
      intention for treatment may be vastly different with most of the advanced cancer group being&#xD;
      treated with palliative intent. Henceforth, the treatment intensity, frequency and likelihood&#xD;
      for further treatment escalation is higher in early and locally advanced cancer. Secondly,&#xD;
      the prognosis between the 2 groups, in view of disease burden and treatment intent, will be&#xD;
      vastly different. Thirdly, recently studies of early palliative care has shown significant&#xD;
      improvement in quality of life and mood in patients with advanced cancer, but there had been&#xD;
      no studies looking at early and locally advanced cancer group. Henceforth, older adults with&#xD;
      early and locally advanced cancer is a unique group facing higher potential of complication&#xD;
      from treatment with worsened quality of life for a prolonged period of life without any&#xD;
      useful service option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iv) Special consideration to early palliative care in older adults with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      cancer In older adults, frequently their focus is for maintenance of quality of life and less&#xD;
      so for prolonging life. In Geriatric-Oncology, this aim is fulfilled by (1) detecting&#xD;
      vulnerability (2) intervention to maintain fitness and quality of life (3) providing advice&#xD;
      to oncologist for optimized management. However, we propose for a 4th dimension of care for&#xD;
      older adults with cancer which entails symptom control from principles of palliative care. It&#xD;
      is crucial to know that poorly controlled symptoms is associated with poorer quality of life.&#xD;
      This is even more important for older adults who are not undergoing treatment. Henceforth, to&#xD;
      look into maintenance of quality of life, there had been recent calls for integration of&#xD;
      palliative care with geriatric oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (v) Identified evidence gap Despite multiple studies looking at the efficacy of&#xD;
      Geriatric-Oncology, there had been a paucity in research on its impact on quality of life.&#xD;
      This is especially so specifically for older adults with early and locally advanced cancer&#xD;
      who may suffer for a prolonged time with poor quality of life. Research is also lacking on&#xD;
      the effect of palliative care in early and locally advanced cancer. Henceforth the impetus to&#xD;
      seek for the benefit of a new service that integrates principles of Geriatric-Oncology with&#xD;
      palliative care.&#xD;
