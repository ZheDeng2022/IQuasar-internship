  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates how well elotuzumab works in treating patients with&#xD;
      JAK2-mutated myelofibrosis. Elotuzumab may help to control myelofibrosis and/or help to&#xD;
      improve blood cell count and bone marrow function.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of elotuzumab in patients with&#xD;
      myelofibrosis (MF) by estimating the rate of overall response by International Working&#xD;
      Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) 2013 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the safety and tolerability of elotuzumab in patients with MF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess for improvements in cytopenias and bone marrow fibrosis grade, splenomegaly and&#xD;
      disease-related symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the duration of objective responses, if any, to elotuzumab. IV. To&#xD;
      determine the time to next treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the proportion of circulating monocytes expressing the target of elotuzumab,&#xD;
      SLAMF7, and any correlation of the same to the mutant JAK2 allele burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess baseline levels of IL-1Ralpha and other cytokines and the effects of&#xD;
      elotuzumab, if any, on these over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine the effects of elotuzumab on fibrocyte count and differentiation, both in&#xD;
      vitro and in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess clonal evolution, if any, in MF patients on elotuzumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive elotuzumab intravenously (IV) over 1-4 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of&#xD;
      cycles 1-2. Beginning in cycle 3, patients receive elotuzumab IV over 1-4 hours on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 36 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then&#xD;
      periodically thereafter.&#xD;
