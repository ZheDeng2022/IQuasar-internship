  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two financial incentive strategies targeting adolescents with type 1 diabetes will be&#xD;
      compared to usual care for motivating adolescents to engage in improved self-care to manage&#xD;
      their diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be asked to choose a self-care goal relevant to the device(s) they use to&#xD;
      manage their diabetes from a pre-defined list of self-care targets. A randomized 3&#xD;
      (treatment) x 3 (occasion) crossover design will be used to compare treatments that are&#xD;
      administered to participants in a predetermined sequence. The intervention arms include&#xD;
      financial incentives administered in a gain- and loss-frame for adherence to daily self-care&#xD;
      goals. The control arm is usual care. Participants can also earn additional incentives for&#xD;
      meeting clinical care goals such as an improvement in the percentage of time glucose levels&#xD;
      are consistent with hyperglycemia (&gt;180 mg/dL). The primary outcome will be HbA1c at 12 weeks&#xD;
      compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes will include frequency of insulin administration,&#xD;
      engagement in diabetes self-care (SCI-R), patient-reported outcomes (Problem Areas in&#xD;
      Diabetes - Teen version and Diabetes Family Conflict Scale).&#xD;
