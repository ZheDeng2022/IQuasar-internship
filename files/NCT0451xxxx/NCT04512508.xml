      DESIGN METHODOLOGY: Prospective, cross-sectional, comparative, double-blind, randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1, 250 HIV negative patients (150 men and 100 women) from the oncology service who&#xD;
      agree to participate in the study and with a negative diagnosis for HIV made at the&#xD;
      Infectious Diseases Service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2, 250 HIV positive patients (150 men and 100 women) attended by the Infectious Disease&#xD;
      Service diagnosed with HIV positive. The sample size was adjusted to the donation of 500 Anal&#xD;
      Test devices and the subsequent molecular determinations for each sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, men and women between 30 and 65 years old with active sexual life and who are&#xD;
      susceptible to the development of anal cancer can participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Immunosuppressed patients, a) infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV or b)&#xD;
           by medication after receiving an organ transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Individuals who have or have had anal intercourse. Women with a history of cervical,&#xD;
           vulva, or vaginal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLANNED ACTIVITIES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First: Candidate patients who meet the inclusion criteria will have an explanation of the&#xD;
      importance of their participation in this protocol, all their doubts will be resolved and&#xD;
      they will be asked to sign the letter of informed consent with witnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second: After signing the letter of consent, the service provider will make a questionnaire&#xD;
      to know the clinical characteristics and identification of the patient, they will be assigned&#xD;
      a consecutive number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If assignation is a non-number, the self-test will be performed as the first in sequence,&#xD;
      followed by liquid cytology and then anoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If assignation is an even number, the liquid cytology will be done as the first in sequence,&#xD;
      followed by self-test and the anoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the Self-Test: the patient will be given the Anal Test medical device with the&#xD;
           following recommendations: a) washing of patient hands, b) removing the plastic&#xD;
           packaging from the device, c) removing the cover, d) Holding it by the handle, the&#xD;
           device will be inserted into the anus, e) patient will be left intro-anal for 30 seconds&#xD;
           and then it will be rotated 180 degrees, f) it will slowly withdraw the device and g) it&#xD;
           will be delivered to the assistant nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The nurse will put the device (with the sample) in a tube with 5 ml of PreservCyt&#xD;
           solution and close it tightly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The tube with the device and the sample will be kept at room temperature until transport&#xD;
           to the laboratory for processing and obtaining results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will answer a satisfaction questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An appointment will be given three weeks later to grant the result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Processing of samples and issuance of results will be done in an external laboratory outside&#xD;
      the Hospital General de México. In the Molecular Biology Laboratory, the coded samples will&#xD;
      be processed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. DNA will be extracted using the Abbott Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)&#xD;
           technology procedures, with the m2000 system. Presence and identification will be&#xD;
           determined for HPV-Ar 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Only the positive samples from the first step; mRNA will be extracted and the viral&#xD;
           oncology proteins expression of the E6 and E7 will be quantified for the following&#xD;
           specific HPV-Ar 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction&#xD;
           (RT-PCR). The results of the laboratory studies will be sent to the responsible&#xD;
           investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Processing of samples in an external laboratory outside the Hospital General de México&#xD;
           and issuance of results. In the Molecular Biology Laboratory, the coded samples will be&#xD;
           processed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. DNA will be extracted using the Abbott Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)&#xD;
                technology procedures, with the m2000 system. The presence and identification will&#xD;
                be determined for HPV-Ar 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Only the positive samples from the first step; mRNA will be extracted and the&#xD;
                expression of the viral oncology proteins E6 and E7 will be quantified for the&#xD;
                following specific HPV-Ar 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 by Real-Time Polymerase&#xD;
                Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). The results of the laboratory studies will be sent to the&#xD;
                responsible investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourth:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If they are positive to HPV-Ar, investigator will follow-up patient to corroborate the&#xD;
      elimination or persistence of the HPV infection (surveillance). Patients who are positive for&#xD;
      E6 and E7 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) will be cited for high-resolution anoscopy and&#xD;
      biopsy, negative patients will be under surveillance. Patients who are normal or with Low&#xD;
      grade Intraepithelial Lesion (lSIL) (NIA1) by cytology will be under surveillance. High grade&#xD;
      Intraepithelial Lesion (HSIL) patients (NIA2 and NIA3) will be scheduled for high-resolution&#xD;
      anoscopy and biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Statistical results will be reported first in a descriptive way,&#xD;
      reporting means and standard deviations of the main study variables, as well as percentages&#xD;
      of the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus analyzed in this investigation. Bi-variate&#xD;
      comparative tests such as t-Student or Chi-square tests will be applied to identify possible&#xD;
      differences between the group of people with the presence/absence of high-risk viruses and&#xD;
      demographics and clinical variables such as the presence of HIV. When there is no normality,&#xD;
      the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test will be applied. Linear correlations will be analyzed&#xD;
      with the Spearman and Pearson correlation tests depending on the type of analyzed variables.&#xD;
      Data concordance analysis such as the kappa test will be performed because due to presence of&#xD;
      human papillovirus HPV-Ar sub-types as well as lesion type compared to the results of liquid&#xD;
      anal cytology that in this study the investigators will consider our &quot;gold standard&quot;, in&#xD;
      addition to perform sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value tests.&#xD;
      Finally, and although it is not part of our main objectives, the investigators will analyze&#xD;
      the possible associate risk factors with the presence of high-risk human papillovirus (HPV)&#xD;
      using logistic regression models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL ASPECTS AND BIOSECURITY. ETHICS. What is indicated in relation to ethics on human&#xD;
      studies will be strictly followed according to Regulations of the General Law of Health in&#xD;
      Matters of Health Research of Mexico, and the Declaration of Helsinki, considering subsequent&#xD;
      versions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFORMED CONSENT LETTER. SAFETY The subject under study will have complete information on the&#xD;
      procedures that will be carrying out. The studies will be done exclusively with the&#xD;
      assistance of the authorized research team and in consulting rooms belonging to the Oncology&#xD;
      Service. If the subject under study expresses his desire not to participate in the process,&#xD;
      it will be suspended immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the studies to be carried out on the patient are totally safe and innocuous.&#xD;
