      Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A population-based survey of Danish inhabitants, will by screening of approximately 10.000&#xD;
      Danes identify approximately 425 persons who report to have psoriasis(PsO) with or without&#xD;
      psoriatic arthritis (PsA). These will receive an e-mail invitation to an internet based&#xD;
      questionnaire regarding demographics, skin and joint complaints, diagnosed diseases, contact&#xD;
      to health care providers, and different aspect of psychological and physical function and&#xD;
      wellbeing (incl. function, health-related quality of life, depression, anxiety, social&#xD;
      participation, and sleep disturbances). In the questionnaire the participant will be asked if&#xD;
      he/she would be interested in participating in a clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who accept the above mentioned invitation (estimated 273) will be seen in a&#xD;
      Department of Rheumatology, for the following examination programme: Clinical examination&#xD;
      with a focus on skin, joints and entheses,ultrasonic (US) examination of joints and entheses,&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes and blood sampling for both stratification and identification of&#xD;
      biochemical signs of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with musculoskeletal pain and certain joint and/or entheseal inflammation documented&#xD;
      by US, will be invited to participate in a 12 months' interventional study (part 3a, below),&#xD;
      whereas patients without musculoskeletal pain but with US findings (as above) will be invited&#xD;
      to participate in a 12 months non-interventional follow-up study (part 3b, below). Patients&#xD;
      with pre-diagnosed PsA that by US have active inflammation (same definition and criteria as&#xD;
      above), will also be invited to participate in the interventional study if they fit the&#xD;
      criteria, especially those described under concomitant medication, otherwise they will be&#xD;
      offered to participate in the non-interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3a:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with musculoskeletal pain in relation to joints and/or entheses (that is not&#xD;
      explained by alternative diagnosis, as assessed by including rheumatologist) and &quot;US-defined&#xD;
      PsA&quot;, i.e. with certain joint and/or entheseal inflammation as documented by US, will be&#xD;
      offered inclusion in a 12 months' interventional study, in which 6 month induction therapy&#xD;
      with apremilast (in addition to their usual therapy) will be followed by cessation of&#xD;
      apremilast and 6 months of observation. Patients will be followed with clinical examination,&#xD;
      PRO's, blood sampling and US at months 3, 6, 9 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI will be performed at inclusion and at 6 months follow-up in selected patients (patients&#xD;
      with dactylitis or with enthesitis in the ankle region (Achilles enthesitis or plantar&#xD;
      fasciitis)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3b:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients without musculoskeletal pain but with certain joint or entheseal inflammation&#xD;
      verified by US will be offered inclusion in a 12 months' non-interventional study. Patients&#xD;
      will continue their current therapy and be followed with clinical examination,&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes, blood sampling and US at months 3, 6, 9 and 12.&#xD;
