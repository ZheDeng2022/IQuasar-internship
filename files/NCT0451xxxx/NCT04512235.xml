  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AL (or light chain) amyloidosis begins in the bone marrow where abnormal proteins misfold and&#xD;
      create free light chains that cannot be broken down. These free light chains bind together to&#xD;
      form amyloid fibrils that build up in the extracellular space of organs, affecting the&#xD;
      kidneys, heart, liver, spleen, nervous system and digestive tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if CAEL-101 improves the overall survival&#xD;
      in Patients with cardiac AL Amyloidosis.&#xD;

      This is a double-blind, randomized, multicenter international Phase 3 study of CAEL-101&#xD;
      combined with the standard of care (SoC) for plasma cell dyscrasia (PCD) versus placebo&#xD;
      combined with standard of care PCD treatment in patients with Mayo stage IIIa AL amyloidosis&#xD;
      that have not received prior treatment. The minimum planned treatment time for each patient&#xD;
      will be at least 50 weeks or until the patient's death. It is planned that all patients will&#xD;
      continue their double-blind treatment until the last patient completes at least 50 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 267 patients will be enrolled using a 2:1 randomization ratio of CAEL-101:&#xD;
      placebo and will involve approximately 100 investigator sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effects of CAEL-101 versus placebo on&#xD;
      all-cause mortality.&#xD;

Any patient records or datasets transferred to the Sponsor must contain only the unique identifier and must not include patient names or any information which would make the patient identifiable. Patients will be informed that their personal study-related data will be used by the Sponsor in accordance with local data protection laws and that their medical records may be examined by representatives of the Sponsor, Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) members and by inspectors from regulatory authorities. Study monitors will inspect all documents and records that are required to be maintained by the Investigator for this study.</ipd_description>
