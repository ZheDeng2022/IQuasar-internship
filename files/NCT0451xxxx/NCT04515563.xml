  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increasing prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in our rapidly aging population&#xD;
      prompts the need for devising effective interventions to prevent the onset of cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and delay its progression to dementia. The benefits of aerobic exercise on the&#xD;
      cognitive function in older adults with MCI are well-documented. However, exercise protocols&#xD;
      and outcome measurement tools in the current literature are highly heterogeneous. It is&#xD;
      therefore imperative to develop standard exercise prescription protocol for the MCI&#xD;
      population or to examine the effectiveness of the existing, well-established exercise&#xD;
      guidelines. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends adults (18 - 64 years of age) and&#xD;
      older adults (65 years and older) to perform 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes&#xD;
      of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week to improve cardiorespiratory and&#xD;
      muscular fitness, bone health, and reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases and&#xD;
      depression. Nonetheless, few studies have determined the effectiveness of the WHO Global&#xD;
      Recommendations on Physical Activity for Health guideline in improving cognitive function in&#xD;
      older adults with MCI. This study thus aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the WHO Physical&#xD;
      Activity Recommendations in improving cognitive function in older adults with MCI. In 2017,&#xD;
      the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) updated the Practice Guideline for Mild Cognitive&#xD;
      Impairment, in which they recommended patients diagnosed with MCI to perform exercise at&#xD;
      least twice a week for at least 6 months to gain cognitive benefits. This recommendation was&#xD;
      based on two class-II studies, in which a 6-month twice-a-week 90-minute multicomponent&#xD;
      exercise program helped maintain global cognition, and selective attention improved&#xD;
      significantly following a 6-month twice-a-week 60-minute multicomponent exercise program.&#xD;
      While they provided pivotal insights into clinical practice, there were several limitations&#xD;
      for these two studies. For instance, in the study conducted by Nagamatsu et al., only female&#xD;
      subjects were recruited, and therefore lead to low generalizability. These two studies&#xD;
      focused on multi-component exercise intervention which included resistance training, aerobic&#xD;
      training, and balance training, and the duration of each component was short (around 20 - 30&#xD;
      minutes). Studies that focus on single exercise modality with longer session duration are&#xD;
      warranted to unveil the efficacy of a certain exercise modality in improving cognitive&#xD;
      function. In this study, we will evaluate the effectiveness of aerobic exercise on improving&#xD;
      cognitive function in older adults with MCI. We intend to follow the WHO Recommendations,&#xD;
      focusing on evaluating the effect of different exercise intensities (moderate versus&#xD;
      vigorous) and frequencies (once versus thrice per week) of aerobic exercise on improving the&#xD;
      cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. In particular, the AAN&#xD;
      also suggested that physical activity of at least twice a week is necessary to produce&#xD;
      cognitive benefits. We, therefore, aim to investigate whether one session per week would also&#xD;
      suffice to improve the cognitive function in older adults with MCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To examine the effectiveness of 12-week WHO Global Recommendations on Physical Activity&#xD;
      for Health in practice in improving the cognitive function in older adults with MCI.&#xD;
