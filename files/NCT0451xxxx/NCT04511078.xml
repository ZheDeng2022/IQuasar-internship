    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if panitumumab-IRDye800 is effective in identifying&#xD;
      cancer, compared to surrounding normal tissue, and the further characterize the safety&#xD;
      profile of this drug.&#xD;

      Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumors can be difficult to visualize intraoperatively.&#xD;
      Most primary oral cavity cancers and previously irradiated head and neck cancers require&#xD;
      surgical resection for definitive treatment. Currently, tumor margins are determined&#xD;
      intraoperatively by a combination of palpation, visual inspection, and microscopic assessment&#xD;
      frozen tissue sections. Difficulty in assessing intraoperative tumor margins of primary head&#xD;
      and neck cancers makes resection inexact -the incidence of involved or close surgical margins&#xD;
      in head and neck cancer patients approaches 40% on histopathological review. Failure to&#xD;
      obtain a complete tumor resection results in significantly worse outcomes in head and neck&#xD;
      cancer patients. With the exception of previously untreated tongue cancers, assessment of&#xD;
      tumor margins by intraoperative palpation is limited because tumors are adjacent to bone or&#xD;
      cartilage (larynx), in deep structures, or in previously irradiated tissues. More accurate&#xD;
      assessment of tumor extent could limit the ablative defect size and improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative frozen sections are used to confirm complete resection of tumors.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, these have significant deficiencies. Frozen sections 1) require resection of&#xD;
      additional normal tissue for assessment, 2) add between 30 and 60 minutes to the operative&#xD;
      time, 3) are difficult to interpret in patients with field cancerization or previous&#xD;
      irradiation, 4) cannot be performed on bone or calcified cartilage, 5) are reversed on&#xD;
      permanent section in approximately 5% of cases and 6) fail to detect close margins (&gt; 5 mm).&#xD;
      Finally, and perhaps most importantly, frozen sections are highly accurate if the right&#xD;
      tissue is biopsied and sent; however, less than 5% of the wound bed can be assessed by frozen&#xD;
      section and this significantly limits the sensitivity of this technique. This sampling error&#xD;
      consistently plagues surgeons and pathologists alike.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of margins during resection is difficult because tumors cannot be palpated and&#xD;
      the surgeon must rely only on subtle tissue changes when using the operating microscope.&#xD;
      Optical imaging is ideally suited to endoscopic and robotic operative approaches since the&#xD;
      surgeon is operating from the video monitor and fluorescence can be easily incorporated into&#xD;
      the surgeon's view. Importantly, optical imaging is being incorporated into the newest&#xD;
      robotic platforms made especially for surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase II study of panitumumab-IRDye800CW, which has emerged as the frontrunner in&#xD;
      optical imaging. This study will be performed in the context of collaborating, completed, and&#xD;
      ongoing dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical trials evaluating the safety of cetuximab-IRDye800&#xD;
      (NCT01987375) and panitumumab-IRDye800 (NCT02415881), respectively, in the same patient&#xD;
      population. This study design is the same as our approved Phase I trials, except there will&#xD;
      be no dose-escalation. This study design is the standard for Phase II clinical trials in the&#xD;
      field of fluorescence-guided surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators saw a limited number of mild side effects with no serious side effects in&#xD;
      patients receiving this drug (no infusion reactions, no Grade 2 or higher adverse events, and&#xD;
      one Grade 1 adverse event in human patients). In 21% of cases, fluorescence imaging was able&#xD;
      to improve surgical decision-making and lead to resection of tumor-containing tissue that&#xD;
      would likely not have otherwise been resected. Given that positive margins are the single&#xD;
      most important prognostic factor for patients with HNSCC, the potential for this technology&#xD;
      to improve margin status has the potential to improve outcomes and survival.&#xD;
