    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective cohort study of all consecutive patients who underwent colon or&#xD;
      rectal resection, between the years 2012-2017 at Rabin Medical Center, a tertiary referral&#xD;
      center in Israel. Data were obtained from patients' electronic medical files. The study was&#xD;
      approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Rabin Medical Center (RMC). The study met&#xD;
      the guidelines outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Due to the minimal risk nature of&#xD;
      this study, the need for informed consent was waived by the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients aged 70 years and above who underwent large bowel resection were included in the&#xD;
      analysis. Inclusion criteria were: age ≥70; all patients undergoing any colonic or rectal&#xD;
      resection for benign or malignant etiologies in an open or minimally-invasive approach&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were: age&lt;70; colon resection without anastomoses; re-operations during&#xD;
      the same admission .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data retrieved included demographic data (age, gender, Charlson comorbidity score, place of&#xD;
      residency, functional capacity, BMI), surgical data (indication for surgery, elective vs&#xD;
      urgent surgery, surgical approach, length of surgery, peri-operative morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality.All surgeries were performed by at least one senior surgeon. The surgical approach&#xD;
      (laparoscopic or laparotomy) was at the senior surgeon's discretion and deemed most&#xD;
      appropriate for the patient's problem, physiological status and underlying illnesses. The&#xD;
      extent of the resection was according to oncological guidelines when relevant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint was the occurrence of postoperative anastomotic leak. Secondary end-point&#xD;
      was postoperative mortality Statistical Analysis The statistical analysis for this paper was&#xD;
      generated using SAS Software. Continuous variables were presented by Mean±Std, Categorical&#xD;
      variables were presented by (N, %). T-Test was used to compare the value of continuous&#xD;
      variables between study groups and Fisher's exact test (for two groups) or Chi-square (for&#xD;
      more than two groups) were used to compare the value of categorical variables between study&#xD;
      groups. Two-sided p values less than .05 were considered statistically significant&#xD;
