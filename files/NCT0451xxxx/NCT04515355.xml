  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 60-70% of people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) lose employment within 10 years of the&#xD;
      diagnosis. This can be due to complex personal and work-based factors including psychological&#xD;
      factors. MS-PROACTIVE aims to test an online self-help therapy to support PwMS to stay in&#xD;
      work called 'READY for MS'. This is a type of Acceptance and Commitment therapy. It is a way&#xD;
      to provide treatment in a flexible way without people having to go to see a psychologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the treatment is to improve self-efficacy which has been shown to be a significant&#xD;
      factor for helping PwMS who want to work to stay in work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will initially develop an online version of READY for MS. We will ask 4&#xD;
      PwMS to test the online'READY for MS' and provide feedback and advice on any necessary&#xD;
      changes. We will then recruit and randomise 88 PwMS in Leeds and London who are at risk of&#xD;
      job loss. Participants in the active treatment group will use the online treatment in&#xD;
      addition to their usual care; the control group will receive their usual care. The&#xD;
      participants will complete questionnaires at the start of the study, at 8 weeks and 6 months&#xD;
      measuring time off work and work instability (to measure risk of job loss), self-efficacy,&#xD;
      mood, quality of life, fatigue and the impact of MS. The questionnaire data will be analysed&#xD;
      to test the effectiveness of the treatment. The research team will also interview 4 PwMS at&#xD;
      each site at the start of the study, at 8 weeks and 6 months to find out about their&#xD;
      experience of using READY for MS in more detail. This will help to inform the use of READY&#xD;
      for MS in a larger trial in the future.&#xD;
