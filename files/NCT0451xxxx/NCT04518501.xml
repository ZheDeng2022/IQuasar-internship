      Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic tumors in the western world.&#xD;
      Most patients have relapses, and responses to subsequent therapies are generally short-lived.&#xD;
      Currently, the population that can benefit from PARPi is mainly focusing on BRCAm, then&#xD;
      homologous-recombination deficiency patients. Limited data revealed the ORR was only 3-4% in&#xD;
      homologous recombination proficiency patients with PARPi therapy. New treatments are urgently&#xD;
      needed to improve patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the efficacy and safety of Fuzuloparib in combination with Arsenic trioxide&#xD;
      therapy in platinum-resistance relapsed Ovarian cancer patients.&#xD;

      Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic tumors in the western world.&#xD;
      Most patients have relapses, and responses to subsequent therapies are generally short-lived.&#xD;
      Currently, the population that can benefit from PARPi is mainly focusing on BRCAm, then&#xD;
      homologous-recombination deficiency patients. Limited data revealed the ORR was only 3-4% in&#xD;
      homologous recombination proficiency patients with PARPi therapy. New treatments are urgently&#xD;
      needed to improve patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' studies have shown that combination therapy with Fuzuloparib and Arsenic&#xD;
      trioxide demonstrated a synergistic anti-tumor effect in BRCAness/HR-proficiency ovarian&#xD;
      cancer cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, CCK8 and clone formation assays showed that the combination of Fuzuloparib and&#xD;
      Arsenic trioxide produced notable tumor cell growth inhibition than either single agent in&#xD;
      SKOV3 and CAOV3 cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, the combination therapy resulted in significantly increased level of γ-H2AX and&#xD;
      decreased level of RAD51 by IF.The investigators also found that combination therapy could&#xD;
      remarkably induced cell apoptosis, which is associated with induction of cleave-PARP and&#xD;
      reduction of p-AKT, when compared with either single drug. (Data not published) Therefore,&#xD;
      the investigators hypothesis is that for those platinum-resistance relapsed patients who have&#xD;
      received at least twice platinum-based chemotherapy, patients with combinate therapy will get&#xD;
      25% of ORR. And platinum-resistance in combination with Arsenic trioxide therapy is well&#xD;
      tolerated.&#xD;
