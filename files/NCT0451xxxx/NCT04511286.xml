    <textblock>
      This study investigates the feasibility of a general exposure-based treatment protocol that&#xD;
      is intended to work for a large variety of patient groups with a clinically significant&#xD;
      preoccupation with physical symptoms. This is a prospective single-group study based at&#xD;
      Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, where 40 adults with DSM-5 somatic symptom disorder&#xD;
      are enrolled in 8 weeks of therapist-guided exposure-based treatment via the Internet.&#xD;
      Exposure is based on general principles but tailored to suit the needs of each patient.&#xD;
      Outcomes include patient-reported credibility and expectancy, adherence to the treatment&#xD;
      protocol, client satisfaction, and negative events. Within-group effects will also be&#xD;
      quantified and discussed in relation to the existing literature.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substantial portion of patients in routine care suffer from a recurrent preoccupation with&#xD;
      physical symptoms, which often leads to substantial suffering and impairment. Exposure-based&#xD;
      treatment - where the patient systematically seeks out that which gives rise to unwanted&#xD;
      sensations, cognitions, or behavior - has been found to lead to beneficial effects in several&#xD;
      types of symptom preoccupation. Yet, this form of treatment is rarely offered in routine&#xD;
      care. This may be partially because existing treatment protocols have been developed for&#xD;
      specific symptom clusters (e.g., functional somatic syndromes such as irritable bowel&#xD;
      syndrome and fibromyalgia) or specific unwanted responses to symptoms (e.g., the fear of&#xD;
      having a severe illness), and that many clinics do not have the resources to offer all these&#xD;
      specialized protocols in parallel. An alternative approach could be to base exposure&#xD;
      treatment on a more general protocol that may be tailored to suit a larger variety of patient&#xD;
      groups who suffer from a recurrent preoccupation with physical symptoms. However, it is yet&#xD;
      unclear if the use of such a general treatment protocol for symptom preoccupation would be&#xD;
      feasible, for example in terms of patient-reported credibility, adherence, identification&#xD;
      with the rationale, and general client satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the feasibility of delivering exposure-based treatment using a general&#xD;
      protocol for clinically significant symptom preoccupation, without selecting patients based&#xD;
      on any specific symptom cluster (such as a functional somatic syndrome) or specific unwanted&#xD;
      response to physical symptoms (such as a frequent fear of illness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective single-group feasibility study based at Karolinska Institutet,&#xD;
      Stockholm, Sweden, where 40 adults with somatic symptom disorder according to the Diagnostic&#xD;
      and statistical manual of mental disorders 5 (DSM-5) are enrolled in 8 weeks of&#xD;
      therapist-guided exposure-based treatment that is delivered via the Internet. Various aspects&#xD;
      of feasibility are assessed; most notably: patient-reported credibility and expectancy,&#xD;
      adherence to the treatment protocol, client satisfaction, and negative events. Within-group&#xD;
      effects are also quantified.&#xD;
