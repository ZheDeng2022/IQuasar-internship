  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is find out how CBT-based weight loss program affects on eating&#xD;
      behavior, weight loss, mood symptoms and risk for coronary heart diseases and type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      and applicability of the program to obesity treatment among patients with comorbid&#xD;
      depression. Our hypothesis is that the CBT-based intervention improves long-term weight&#xD;
      management results and supports positively the change in eating behavior and the risk for CHD&#xD;
      on type 2 DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is randomized controlled one-year intervention study with 1 year follow-up. Study&#xD;
      subjects are adult obese (BMI&gt;35) subjects with comorbid depression. Number of randomized&#xD;
      study subjects will be 80, 40 in intervention group, 40 in control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group will proceed through a 52-week CBT-based weight loss group intervention.&#xD;
      The aim of the intervention is to modify eating behavior and lifestyle factors affecting&#xD;
      weight and weight maintenance. There will be 22 group counselling of 90 minutes divided in&#xD;
      five modules and also three individual person-centered counselling visit, during which&#xD;
      participants had an opportunity to discuss their personal concerns about diet and weight loss&#xD;
      plan. Control group will receive the usual care of obesity in Kuopio University hospital.&#xD;
      (4-8 individual 45-minute visit conducted by dieticians)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits are at baseline and one and 2 years after baseline. For example eating behavior,&#xD;
      health behavior, motivation and depression are studied with questionnaires. Weight, waist&#xD;
      circumference, height and blood pressure are measured. Laboratory tests (lipid, glucose etc)&#xD;
      are taken.&#xD;
