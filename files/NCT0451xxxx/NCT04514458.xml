  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of an electronic health record-based&#xD;
      alert informing providers about evidence-based medications for HFrEF versus usual care (no&#xD;
      alert) in outpatient clinics across a single health system.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data from clinical trials suggest that pharmacological therapies prescribed at appropriate&#xD;
      doses will lead to dramatic improvements in survival and hospitalization rates in patients&#xD;
      with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Consequently, major cardiovascular&#xD;
      societies assign the highest level of recommendation to use these therapies in all eligible&#xD;
      patients. However, data from several registries over the last three decades has failed to see&#xD;
      use of these evidence based therapies at levels noted in clinical trials, despite aggressive&#xD;
      guideline recommendations and promotion by thought leaders in the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It remains unclear as to why many patients with HFrEF are not on evidence-based therapies,&#xD;
      and why the percentages are consistent across national registries over time. One explanation&#xD;
      might be that providers know the data regarding evidence-based therapies, but the therapies&#xD;
      only benefit a narrow population. Another factor might be a lack of knowledge among providers&#xD;
      about the appropriate management of HFrEF patients. A simple way to test this hypothesis is&#xD;
      to examine whether electronic health record (EHR) based &quot;best practice advisories&quot; (BPAs) can&#xD;
      increase use of evidence based therapies. If found to be effective, these low cost&#xD;
      interventions can be rapidly applied across large healthcare systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will conduct a randomized controlled trial across outpatient clinics within a&#xD;
      single health system comparing the effectiveness of an EHR-based alerting system that informs&#xD;
      practitioners about what evidence-based medications they can prescribe for HFrEF patients&#xD;
      versus usual care (no alert). One hundred eligible unique providers will be randomized to an&#xD;
      intervention in which an alert will appear for all eligible patients with HFrEF, or to a&#xD;
      control group in which no alert appears and usual care will continue, with a target patient&#xD;
      enrollment of 1,310. The primary outcome for the trial will be the proportion of patients&#xD;
      with HFrEF with an increase in evidence based medical therapies for HFrEF (beta-blockers,&#xD;
      ACE-I/ARB/ARNI, MRA, SGLT2i). Secondary outcomes will include 30-day hospital admission&#xD;
      rates, 30-day ED visits, one year all-cause mortality, and total 6 month healthcare costs.&#xD;
