  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will identify the efficacy of cooling modalities aimed to attenuate excessive&#xD;
      elevations in skin and internal body temperatures during physical activity in well-healed&#xD;
      burn survivors. The investigators will conduct a randomized crossover design study.&#xD;
      Non-burned control subjects, subjects who experienced burns covering ~20% to 40% of their&#xD;
      body surface area, and subject having burns &gt;40% of their body surface area will be&#xD;
      investigated. Subjects will exercise in heated environmental conditions while receiving the&#xD;
      following cooling modalities: no cooling, fan only, skin wetting only, and a combination of&#xD;
      fan and skin wetting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within the United States, 500,000+ individuals are enduring the long-term consequences of&#xD;
      severe burn injuries covering 20% or more of their body surface area, with upwards to 11,000&#xD;
      individuals experiencing such an injury per year. These burn injuries can severely compromise&#xD;
      body temperature regulation, owing to permanent impairments in the primary thermoeffectors&#xD;
      necessary to dissipate heat, namely profoundly blunted skin blood flow and sweating responses&#xD;
      in the injured skin. The investigators propose that this heat intolerance deters burn&#xD;
      survivors from participating in physical activity, including activities of daily living,&#xD;
      necessary to avoid the adverse cardiovascular and metabolic sequela of a sedentary lifestyle.&#xD;
      Consistent with hypothesis, years after the injury burn survivors have a very low aerobic&#xD;
      capacity; greater all-cause mortality rates; greater hospitalization days for circulatory&#xD;
      diseases; and suffer from greater incidences of ischemic heart disease, heart failure,&#xD;
      diabetes, and cerebrovascular disease (including stroke) relative to matched non-burned&#xD;
      cohorts. The primary goal of this project is to identify modalities to attenuate excessive&#xD;
      elevations in skin and core body temperatures during physical activity in well-healed burn&#xD;
      survivors. The implementation of such modalities will eliminate heat intolerance as a barrier&#xD;
      to participation in activities that are necessary to improve/maintain cardiovascular health&#xD;
      in this vulnerable population. This project will investigate whether increased skin wetness,&#xD;
      with and without accompanying fan use, will restore otherwise impaired evaporative cooling of&#xD;
      well-healed burn survivors, with the extent of that improvement predicated on the&#xD;
      environmental conditions and the percentage of body surface area burned.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will conduct a randomized crossover design study. Burn survivors and non-burned individuals, will each perform four bouts of 60-min of exercise trials with each bout incorporating the following cooling strategy: A) a control trial, B) skin wetting only trial, C) fan only trial, and D) a combination of skin wetting with a fan trial. Subjects will perform these four bouts under one of the following environmental conditions (24 deg C, 30 deg C, and 38 deg C). A subject will only be required to perform exercise across all four cooling modalities for a given environmental temperature (i.e., four exercise bouts); each will not be required to perform exercise across all combinations of environmental temperatures and cooling modalities (i.e., 12 exercise bouts).</intervention_model_description>
