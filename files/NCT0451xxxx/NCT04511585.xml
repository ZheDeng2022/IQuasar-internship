      The Great Live and Move Challenge (GLMC) study is a 2-year cluster-randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial designed to evaluate a multilevel and theory-based intervention to promote PA practice&#xD;
      in children aged 7-11 years from French primary schools.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent population-based surveys have reported that a large majority of children were not&#xD;
      active enough to meet the physical activity (PA) international guidelines in France, Europe&#xD;
      and in the US. Therefore, there is a need to find efficient programs to improve PA habits in&#xD;
      children from early age. The Great Live and Move Challenge (GLMC) study is a 2-year&#xD;
      cluster-randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate a multilevel and theory-based&#xD;
      intervention to promote PA practice in children aged 7-11 years from French primary schools.&#xD;
      The aim of this paper is to describe the GLMC study protocol. The primary hypothesis is that&#xD;
      the GLMC intervention will increase by 15% the proportion of children meeting the World&#xD;
      Health Organization recommendations of 60 minutes/day of moderate to vigorous PA. Study&#xD;
      recruitment goal is 5000 children . The GLMC is implemented on children and their parents and&#xD;
      involves multiple local grass-roots partners, such as school teachers and municipal&#xD;
      officials, as well as policy stakeholders. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) constitutes&#xD;
      the foundations of the intervention conception. The total duration of the intervention is 3.5&#xD;
      months each year, for two years. Children and parents are evaluated at pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention every year regarding PA practice (self-reported and objectively measured in&#xD;
      a subsample of 400 children), TPB variables (i.e., intentions, attitudes, subjective norms,&#xD;
      perceived behavioral control) and other psychosocial variables (e.g., perceptions of active&#xD;
      opportunities). This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a multilevel and theory-based&#xD;
      primary school PA program and potentially provide valuable information for schools and public&#xD;
      health policers looking for innovative PA programs.&#xD;
