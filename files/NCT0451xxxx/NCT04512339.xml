    <measure>Response to treatment/hand eczema severity (Hand Eczema Severity Index, HECSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HECSI is an instrument used in clinical trials to rate the severity of 6 clinical signs of hand eczema and the extent of the lesions on each of 5 hand areas by use of standard scales. The total HECSI score is based on a 4-point severity scale ranging from 0 (none/absent) to 3 (severe) and a 5-point scale rating the affected area(s) ranging from 0 (0% affected area) to 4 (76% to 100% affected area). A decrease in score relates to an improvement in signs and symptoms. Response is defined as HECSI-75: the proportion of patients wit a HECSI score of ≥75% improvement from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Improvement of hand eczema related quality of life (Quality of Life in Hand Eczema Questionnaire, QOLHEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, 8, 12, 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality Of Life in Hand Eczema Questionnaire (QOLHEQ) is an instrument to assess disease specific Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) in patients suffering from hand eczema. The construct HRQOL includes all impairments or limiting conditions caused by the health state of an individual. The QOLHEQ is a disease specific instrument, thereby only assessing impairments caused by hand eczema. It consists out of 30 items which can be summarized according to four domains of HRQOL: Impairments because of (1) symptoms, (2) emotions, (3) limitations in functioning or (4) because of treatment and prevention. A high score is indicative of a poor hand eczema related HRQOL.</description>
