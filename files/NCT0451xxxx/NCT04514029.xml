  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, single-arm, single center pilot study to assess safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      administering dexamethasone intrathecally and simvastatin orally during axicabtagene&#xD;
      ciloleucel (axi-cel) treatment. Feasibility will be measured by the proportion of patients&#xD;
      completing two-thirds (2/3) of their assigned treatments. The study will be deemed feasible&#xD;
      if 2/3 or more of the patients complete 2/3 or more of their allocated treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial gathers preliminary information on the potential effect of the combination of&#xD;
      dexamethasone and simvastatin on treating Neurotoxicity (NT) in the patient population. The&#xD;
      rate of patients completing all required study treatments and the rate of NT will be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simvastatin 40 mg/day will be started at least 5 days prior to apheresis and will be&#xD;
      continued until day +30 after infusion. Intrathecal dexamethasone 8 mg will be administered&#xD;
      on days (related to CAR-T infusion) -1, +6, +13, (+/- 2 days). CSF samples (3 ml) will be&#xD;
      collected at these time points. Peripheral blood samples of 4 ml will be collected on days&#xD;
      -1, +1, +6, and +13. The care team will check weekly CK and LFTs to ensure safety of&#xD;
      simvastatin. Patients who develop NT will be allowed to continue treatment if feasible along&#xD;
      with standard of care management.&#xD;
