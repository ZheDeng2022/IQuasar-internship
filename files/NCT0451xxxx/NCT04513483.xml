    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with atrial fibrillation. This study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of continuous positive airway pressure on the burden of atrial fibrillation in the&#xD;
      patients with obstructive sleep apnea and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.&#xD;

      Traditional risk factors for AF were established from the original Framingham Heart Study&#xD;
      cohort which showed aging, hypertension, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      valvular heart disease and diabetes mellitus (DM) as independent risk factors. In the past&#xD;
      decade, several important risk factors not encompassed in previous studies have also been&#xD;
      found to have a link with AF. One of these newly-identified risk factors is obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea (OSA), which has been listed as one of the risk factor needed to be assessed and&#xD;
      treated in AF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSA and AF often co-exist and indeed share some risk factors, such as hypertension. AF&#xD;
      Patients are more likely to have OSA, with reported prevalence rates of OSA (apnea-hypopnea&#xD;
      index [AHI] ≥15) as high as 62% in AF cohorts from hospital-based studies. In community-based&#xD;
      cohort studies, a cross-sectional analysis from sleep heart health study (SHSS) found those&#xD;
      with sleep-disordered breathing(SDB)/sleep apnea (SA) (respiratory disturbance index [RDI] ≥&#xD;
      30) had four times the odds of a polysomnography (PSG)-detected nocturnal AF as compared to&#xD;
      those without SDB/SA after adjusting confounders. Following from this, a cross-sectional&#xD;
      study on Outcomes of Sleep Disorders in Older Men Study (MrOS Sleep Study) showed a&#xD;
      dose-response association between RDI and AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several pathophysiological mechanisms by which OSA could potentially increase the&#xD;
      risk of development of new AF, or trigger a recurrence of AF in a patient with an established&#xD;
      history of AF. OSA is characterized by repetitive collapse of the upper airway (UA) during&#xD;
      sleep. The UA collapses when sleep-related loss in UA dilator muscle tone is superimposed&#xD;
      upon a narrow and/or collapsible airway. These obstructive apneas or hypopneas, characterized&#xD;
      by unsuccessful inspiratory efforts against an occluded airway, lead to 1) exaggerated&#xD;
      negative intrathoracic pressure swings 2) hypoxia, and 3) co-activation of sympathetic and&#xD;
      parasympathetic systems, all of which have been shown to potentiate a pro-arrhythmic state.&#xD;
      Given that these mechanisms are pro-arrhythmic, CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure),&#xD;
      the gold standard therapy for OSA, works by splinting the upper airway open during sleep with&#xD;
      subsequent abolition of swings in pressure, hypoxia and arousals, can potentially modify the&#xD;
      risk of development of AF or recurrence of AF in OSA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing body of literature supporting that OSA being as a risk factor for&#xD;
      recurrence of AF after cardioversion or ablation and treatment of OSA with CPAP decreased the&#xD;
      risk of recurrence of AF. Nevertheless, all of the aforementioned studies are observational&#xD;
      or retrospective in nature. Recently, Caples et al. conducted the first randomized control&#xD;
      trial using CPAP in patients with AF and OSA but failed to find a difference of recurrence of&#xD;
      AF between those treated with CPAP versus usual care. Notably, there are several issues in&#xD;
      the study design and methodology that do not allow for firm conclusion from the results of&#xD;
      this study. It was a single-center study, enrolling very small number of patients, and used a&#xD;
      low cut-off AHI&gt;5/h as inclusion criteria. More importantly, only patients with persistent AF&#xD;
      scheduled for cardioversion were included. Given the natural time-course from paroxysmal AF&#xD;
      to persistent AF, long-term remodeling or established atrial arrythmogenic substrate in&#xD;
      persistent AF may be less or not reversible even when the initial risk factor is removed. In&#xD;
      this regard, early intervention with CPAP in patients with paroxysmal AF and OSA, which has&#xD;
      never been done in previous studies, should confer a better antiarrythmic effect. Therefore,&#xD;
      the investigators aim to test the hypothesis that treatment of OSA with CPAP would reduce the&#xD;
      burden of AF in patients with paroxysmal AF.&#xD;
