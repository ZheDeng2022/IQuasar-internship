      1. Overview of the study Research design: prospective, single-arm blind randomized control&#xD;
           study, non-inferiority study Study Period: 12 months since IRB approval date Subject:&#xD;
           Patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia Number of study subjects: 90 Vulnerable&#xD;
           Subjects: None&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background and purpose of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Research background&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Overview and main symptoms of prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)&#xD;
&#xD;
           -The prostate is a male reproductive organ located in the lower bladder. Benign&#xD;
           prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) causes lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to bladder&#xD;
           outlet obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The prevalence of prostatic hyperplasia is known to reach 37% in the 50s, 49% in&#xD;
                the 60s, and 70% in the 70s; a disease with a very high incidence in long-aged men.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  BPH is a disease directly related to the quality of life that interferes with the&#xD;
                patient's social life, sexual life, and daily life. If it persists for a long time,&#xD;
                it may cause bladder stones, hematuria, and even renal dysfunction, so timely&#xD;
                treatment is absolutely necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Surgical Treatment of BPH&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Surgical treatment is recommended for an enlarged prostate that is not treated with&#xD;
           drugs, and transurethral surgery using an endoscope is recommended for standard surgery&#xD;
           for an enlarged prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Transurethral surgery for BPH varies from traditional transurethral resection of&#xD;
                the prostate (TURP) to holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  HoLEP has a sharp increase in the number of surgeries worldwide due to its low&#xD;
                recurrence rate, high efficiency, and high patient satisfaction;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Since its first introduction in 2008 in Korea, the number and rate of surgeries&#xD;
                have been steadily increasing. The total number of surgery for BPH is equivalent to&#xD;
                about 10,000 cases per year. TUR-P and KTP laser surgery are on a decreasing trend,&#xD;
                while HoLEP is on an increasing trend.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The importance of HoLEP&#xD;
&#xD;
           -HoLEP is a surgery to completely remove prostate tumors using a Holmium-YAG Laser of&#xD;
           2100nm wavelength.&#xD;
&#xD;
           -The tissue penetration depth of the Holmium laser is less than 0.44mm, enabling sharp&#xD;
           incisions, and has the advantage of less bleeding than traditional transurethral&#xD;
           prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           -The surgery principle of HoLEP is fundamentally different from TUR-P and KTP laser&#xD;
           prostate vaporization. TUR-P and KTP laser prostatectomy aim to remove part of the&#xD;
           prostate tumor, whereas HoLEP performs complete removal of the prostate tumor according&#xD;
           to the anatomical structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           -HoLEP consists of two steps, and the first step consists of an enucleation step in&#xD;
           which the prostate tumor is completely removed and placed in the bladder, and a&#xD;
           morcellation step in which the enucleated adenoma tissue is morcellated and removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  HoLEP is relatively safe compared to other transurethral surgery and can completely&#xD;
                remove prostate adenoma, so it has a low recurrence rate and the patient's&#xD;
                satisfaction with surgery is over 90%, making it the next-generation standard&#xD;
                treatment for BPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Low energy HoLEP related research and clinical status -HoLEP is mainly applied to&#xD;
           treatment with 80-100 Watt high energy equipment. High-energy HoLEP has the advantage of&#xD;
           removing prostate tumors in a short time, but there are problems of frequent laser fiber&#xD;
           damage, device shutdown problems, and possible bladder damage due to scattered lasers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In 2008, Rassweiller et al. proposed the possibility of clinical application of low&#xD;
                energy HoLEP by applying a 40 Watt Holmium laser. Since then, prospective studies&#xD;
                have been published sporadically. In 2018, a prospective randomized study that&#xD;
                compared and analyzed the prostate removal efficiency of 50 Watt laser and 100 Watt&#xD;
                laser in a total of 121 patients was the latest and largest study and confirmed&#xD;
                that low-energy prostatectomy is not inferior to the high-energy procedure. And&#xD;
                proved its clinical safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In theory, low-energy HoLEP reduces dysuria immediately after surgery and storage&#xD;
                symptoms after surgery. It is estimated to be advantageous in preserving erectile&#xD;
                function.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The research team is the first in the world to compare the safety and usefulness of&#xD;
                30 Watt HoLEP with 100 Watt HoLEP through prospective, non-inferiority studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
                2) Research goal The final purpose of the study: To prove that the low-energy&#xD;
                (30Watt) HoLEP is not inferior to the high-energy (100Watt) HoLEP in short-term and&#xD;
                mid-term surgical results (safety and effectiveness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed research objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare short-term (2 weeks-1 months) surgical outcomes/surgical complications of low&#xD;
           energy HoLEP with high energy HoLEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the mid-term (3, 6 months) surgical outcomes/surgical complications of&#xD;
           low-energy HoLEP with high-energy HoLEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) Selection criteria, exclusion criteria, the target number of subjects and basis for&#xD;
      calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selection criteria Men over 50 Patients receiving HoLEP due to an enlarged prostate&#xD;
           Patients who fully understood and agreed to the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion criteria Patients with neuropathy that may adversely affect the urination&#xD;
           function (Parkinson's disease, dementia, etc.) Patients with acute urinary retention&#xD;
           within the last month Patients with symptomatic urinary tract infection In case there&#xD;
           are other factors that can significantly affect treatment results at the discretion of&#xD;
           the researcher&#xD;
&#xD;
           (2) Number of research subjects About 90 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The basis for calculating the number of subjects This study aims to prospectively enroll&#xD;
           and randomize prostatectomy patients, and then compare the results of the treatment at 6&#xD;
           months after the maximum operation to confirm non-inferiority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard is a method using a high-energy holmium laser, and the treatment results&#xD;
      for 6 months after surgery have been published through many studies. The research team wants&#xD;
      to confirm the surgical outcome as a decrease in the International Prostate Symptom Score&#xD;
      (IPSS). After 6 months of predicted high-energy HoLEP, IPSS in other literature (5.1 ± 5.0),&#xD;
      6 months after the expected of low-energy HoLEP. IPSS is estimated from the most recently&#xD;
      published academic paper (5.0 ± 5.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alpha (0.15) and Beta (0.8) were calculated, and the non-inferior margin was set to 3. The&#xD;
      estimated number of subjects is calculated by considering the 20% drop-out rate. Statistics&#xD;
      for calculating the number of subjects are calculated using PASS 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering drop-out 20%, it is necessary to recruit 25-114 patients (total 50-114) per group&#xD;
      to conduct the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This organization is an organization that implements about 20-30 HoLEP cases per month, and a&#xD;
      follow-up period of up to 6 months is required to announce short-term and mid-term results.&#xD;
      Therefore, the actual patient enroll period is estimated to be up to 6 months. It is expected&#xD;
      that 120-180 patients can undergo surgery during the recruitment period of up to 6 months,&#xD;
      and assuming that only 60% of patients will participate in the study based on the median of&#xD;
      about 150, a total of 90 patients, about 45 for each group. It is judged realistic to conduct&#xD;
      a study with 3 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Research method&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Specific research method Since the researchers have already published dozens of studies&#xD;
           related to HoLEP surgery, we are securing a systematic preoperative&#xD;
           examination/postoperative follow-up process. The preoperative examination/postoperative&#xD;
           follow-up protocol of high energy HoLEP surgery, which was previously performed, will be&#xD;
           used as it is, but the study will be conducted by adding only the preoperative&#xD;
           randomization process.&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Pre-screening: After making operation in the outpatient clinic, before hospitalization,&#xD;
           it is checked whether it is subject to enroll according to the patient record.&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Random allocation: Using R package (RandomizeR), low energy HoLEP, and high energy&#xD;
           HoLEP is randomly assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Pre-Op work-up &amp; Operation: This item is irrelevant to Randomization and is a situation&#xD;
           where you do not know who will undergo surgery, so it is considered a normal treatment&#xD;
           process and proceeds according to the existing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Monitoring: It is planned to perform research ethics, safety, and monitoring work&#xD;
                independently from the researcher by requesting the Medical Device Innovation&#xD;
                Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical trial insurance: In case of adverse side effects to patients, the company&#xD;
                plans to subscribe to clinical trial liability insurance through the Medical Device&#xD;
                Innovation Center to notify the patient of the procedures and details of the&#xD;
                clinical trial damage relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Compensation: There is no monetary incentive for research participants, and the&#xD;
                research team will pay 30,000 won of transportation and inspection costs (160,000&#xD;
                won) per visit during the participation period of visit #1-#3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test drug administration/dosage, administration/use method, combination therapy, reasons&#xD;
           for selection when using a reference drug None&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Observation items, clinical test items and observation test methods Primary endpoint:&#xD;
           3-6 month questionnaire (International Prostate Symptom Score, IPSS) total score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Surgery day: surgery time, total energy, resected prostate volume, immediate complication&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) 2 weeks after surgery: questionnaire (IPSS-subscore, IPSS-QoL, OABSS total score), Qmax,&#xD;
      2) post voided residual urine volume, Clavian-Dindo complication classification 3) 3, 6&#xD;
      months after surgery: questionnaire (IPSS-total, IPSS subscore, IPSS-QoL, OABSS total score),&#xD;
      Qmax, post voided residual urine volume, Clavian-Dindo complication classification, urine&#xD;
      test (urinalysis, urine microscopy), serum PSA level&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) Effect evaluation criteria, evaluation method Efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Statistical analysis of low-power HoLEP is not inferior in short-term (2wk/1month) and&#xD;
           mid-term (3-6 months) IPSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Uroflowmetry (UFM) and non-inferiority of post voided residual (PVR) were verified in&#xD;
           urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 3 months/6 months U/A, micro, 6 months PSA&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Non-inferiority was verified in terms of improving the patient's QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To verify the non-inferiority of the storage symptom subscore after the patient's&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The safety of HoLEP has been revealed to some extent through overseas research results,&#xD;
           so animal testing is not required. For the safety, all safety issues that occurred using&#xD;
           the Clavian-Dindo grade, which are commonly used clinically in human studies, were&#xD;
           recorded and compared and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If adverse events that occurred immediately after surgery and during up to 3 visits were&#xD;
           recorded and there was a statistically significant difference in complications of Grade&#xD;
           III-IV, it was judged that there was a safety problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) The difference between existing treatment and research Existing studies comparing low&#xD;
      energy HoLEP surgery and high energy HoLEP are mostly retrospective studies, and two&#xD;
      prospective studies have been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the two prospective studies involved 54 patients and had no active control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most recent study was RCT with 121 subjects, but it was a study comparing 50W laser and&#xD;
      100W laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is the first in the world to compare 30W laser and 100W laser, and it is a&#xD;
      prospective, RCT that recruits 90 patients, and it is judged that the results of the study&#xD;
      can provide important medical evidence for the safety and effectiveness of low-energy HoLEP&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
