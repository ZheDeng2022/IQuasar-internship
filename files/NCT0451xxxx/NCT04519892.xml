  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a highly prevalent and disabling mental health problem. It is associated with&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality and it has a significant economic impact. Effective and&#xD;
      feasible strategies aimed at the population-level to reduce the risk of onset are urgently&#xD;
      needed to manage this ubiquitous condition. Developed from research in the fields of&#xD;
      epidemiology, mental health, and implementation science, the proposed intervention provides&#xD;
      individualized information designed to trigger actions that can reduce the risk of MDE.&#xD;
      Specifically, and as the first step, the investigators developed the first sex-specific&#xD;
      multivariable risk predictive algorithms (MVRPs) for MDE using data from over 10,000&#xD;
      Canadians. This innovative early work shows that the risk of onset of MDE can be quantified&#xD;
      in the same way as can other physical disorders such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer.&#xD;
      Knowing the individualized risk estimated by the MVRPs may serve as a trigger to empower&#xD;
      people to actively engage in effective self-help actions. Self-help strategies are commonly&#xD;
      used to deal with depression and promoting effective self-help strategies to the public as an&#xD;
      early intervention strategy has been recommended as one way to reduce the large disease&#xD;
      burden of depression. Subsequently, the investigators conducted a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) and found that providing individualized depression risk causes no psychological harm in&#xD;
      participants. These studies have laid the required foundation for communicating&#xD;
      individualized risk information to a broad population as a first step towards effecting&#xD;
      changes in self-help and help-seeking behaviours and reducing the risk of MDE onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the MVRPs as the foundation and working with future users, the investigators developed&#xD;
      a personalized depression risk communication tool (PDRC) for sharing information about&#xD;
      individualized depression risk, risk profile (risk factors present), potential risk&#xD;
      reduction, and self-help strategies. At this stage of our research program, the investigators&#xD;
      need to answer the question: Does the PDRC lead to positive changes in self-help and&#xD;
      help-seeking behaviours? Prior to a large scale RCT, the investigators proposed to conduct a&#xD;
      pilot study to gain preliminary understanding about the effect of PDRC on self-help and&#xD;
      help-seeking behaviors. The results will inform the design of a large RCT.&#xD;

      Depression is a highly prevalent and disabling mental health problem. It is associated with&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality and it has a significant economic impact. Effective and&#xD;
      feasible strategies aimed at the population-level to reduce the risk of onset are urgently&#xD;
      needed to manage this ubiquitous condition. Developed from research in the fields of&#xD;
      epidemiology, mental health, and implementation science, the proposed intervention provides&#xD;

      Specifically, and as the first step, the investigators developed the first sex-specific&#xD;
      multivariable risk predictive algorithms (MVRPs) for MDE using data from over 10,000&#xD;
      Canadians. This innovative early work shows that the risk of onset of MDE can be quantified&#xD;
      in the same way as can other physical disorders such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer.&#xD;
      Knowing the individualized risk estimated by the MVRPs may serve as a trigger to empower&#xD;
      people to actively engage in effective self-help actions. Self-help strategies are commonly&#xD;
      used to deal with depression and promoting effective self-help strategies to the public as an&#xD;
      early intervention strategy has been recommended as one way to reduce the large disease&#xD;
      burden of depression. Subsequently, the investigators conducted a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) and found that providing individualized depression risk causes no psychological harm in&#xD;
      participants. Using the MVRPs as the foundation and working with future users, the&#xD;
      investigators developed a personalized depression risk communication tool (PDRC) for sharing&#xD;
      information about individualized depression risk, risk profile (risk factors present),&#xD;
      potential risk reduction, and self-help strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk communication is the open two way exchange of information and opinions about harms and&#xD;
      benefits, with the aim of improving the understanding of risk and of promoting better&#xD;
      decisions about clinical management. Risk communication goes beyond simply sharing&#xD;
      information about the probability of developing a problem (i.e., individualized risk); it&#xD;
      also shares possible actions to be taken. The notable clinical guidelines for coronary heart&#xD;
      disease (CHD) and the Institute of Medicine report recommend that baseline risk should be&#xD;
      estimated; individuals should know their personal risk; and high-quality risk communication&#xD;
      tools should be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing literature reveals that effective risk communication often includes multiple&#xD;
      components: (1) Individualized risk information presented as an absolute risk, as opposed to&#xD;
      a relative risk. The risk information may also list the individual's risk factors. (2)&#xD;
      Appropriate format of presentation (e.g., graphic, visual). The format of presentation can&#xD;
      influence the degree to which individuals perceive their risk and will affect behavioural&#xD;
      change. (3) Presentation of risk reduction. A review of evidence recommends that information&#xD;
      on risk reduction should be presented using absolute risk reduction. Presenting the risk&#xD;
      reduction of behavioural change to the individual is the most commonly used behavioural&#xD;
      change technique in the literature. (4) Framing. Describing the consequences of performing or&#xD;
      not performing an action, presented as a gain versus a loss,18 and (5) Decision aids to help&#xD;
      consumers participate in decisions by providing clear evidence based information on available&#xD;
      choices. Personalized risk communication tools with these components are instrumental for&#xD;
      making informed decisions regarding the uptake of preventive measures, adhering to&#xD;
      risk-reducing therapy, and improving risk perception and health-related behaviours. In mental&#xD;
      health, self-help and help-seeking are particularly important for reducing the disease burden&#xD;
      of mental disorders. However, changing health-related behaviours to improve mental health and&#xD;
      encouraging help-seeking have been very challenging. Based on the theoretical model and the&#xD;
      experience of other medical disciplines (to be described below), risk communication may offer&#xD;
      a unique opportunity for promoting behaviour change, and if successful, will make a&#xD;
      significant contribution to depression prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principle research question of the proposed study is: Are individuals who are at high&#xD;
      risk of having a MDE and who receive the coach-guided PDRC more likely to take self-help&#xD;
      actions than those who receive the PDRC without coach guidance? It was hypothesized that high&#xD;
      risk people who receive the coach-guided PDRC are more likely to take self-help actions than&#xD;
      those receive the PDRC without coach guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary research questions include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What are the impacts of receiving the coach-guided PDRC on psychological distress,&#xD;
           depressive symptoms and mental health service use?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the demographic and clinical factors associated with the behavioural changes?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled trial with two arms. After screening and baseline assessment,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized into: (1) Control group: Receiving PDRC only, and (2)&#xD;
      Intervention group: Receiving PDRC + coach guidance. The trial was designed to compare the&#xD;
      costs and effectiveness between the groups to inform future implementation. The randomization&#xD;
      will be conducted in males and females separately because the MVRPs are sex-specific and the&#xD;
      thresholds of high-risk differ by sex. Participants will be assessed at baseline and 3-month.&#xD;
      After each assessment, the following materials will be mailed to participants: (1) a&#xD;
      thank-you letter, including the date of the next interview. (2) Self-help strategies34 and a&#xD;
      summary of research evidence supporting the effectiveness of the self-help strategies, and&#xD;
      (3) a $20 incentive as appreciation for their participation. Participants in the PDRC+coach&#xD;
      arm will have access to coach to guide them. Participants in the control group will receive&#xD;
      their PDRC only if they are interested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment, baseline assessment and randomization will be contracted to a telephone&#xD;
      interview firm. The target population of the study are individuals who are at high risk of&#xD;
      having a MDE in Canada. Telephone recruitment using the random digit dialing method,&#xD;
      screening and data collection are a feasible and economic way for the proposed study. A&#xD;
      random sample of landline and cell phone numbers will be selected. When a household is&#xD;
      reached, the person who is 18+ years will be assessed for eligibility. If a household has 2+&#xD;
      persons aged 18+ years, one will be randomly selected. The interviewers will explain the&#xD;
      study objectives and procedures and answer questions. Oral consent will be obtained before&#xD;
      assessment of eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: Once a potentially eligible participant is identified, the interviewer will&#xD;
      confirm the participant's age and administer the Composite International Diagnostic Interview&#xD;
      - Major Depression (CIDI) MDE module and the sex-specific MVRPs via telephone. The CIDI is a&#xD;
      fully structured diagnostic interview for mental disorders, that is commonly used in&#xD;
      community-based mental health surveys, and can be administered by trained lay interviewers.&#xD;
      Interviewees who have a MDE at the time of the interview or are below the risk thresholds&#xD;
      based on the MVRPs, will be excluded. Individuals with an ongoing MDE will be encouraged to&#xD;
      contact their family doctors and information about local mental health resources will be&#xD;
      provided. For those who are at low risk, the web site of the MVRPs will be provided so they&#xD;
      may monitor their risk in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment: In eligible participants, the interviewer will administer the&#xD;
      questionnaire about self-help behaviours, mental health service use, depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be carried out in male and in female participants separately. Most survey&#xD;
      firms use a survey software built by VOXCO. The tool contains a random number generator which&#xD;
      randomly creates a digit when the telephone script reads the function. This randomization&#xD;
      approached was used in the IMPACT trial, and the intervention and control groups of the trial&#xD;
      were similar in baseline characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey firm will securely transfer encrypted baseline data to the project coordinator on&#xD;
      a daily basis. The group assignment data will be transferred in a separate file. The&#xD;
      follow-up assessments will be conducted at the PI's telephone interview laboratory at the&#xD;
      Institute of Mental Health Research (IMHR). One month before the scheduled follow-up&#xD;
      interviews, letters will be sent to participants to remind them of the upcoming interview.&#xD;
      After the 3-month interview, group status will be linked with interview data by study ID&#xD;
      numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the study period, investigators will be blinded to participants' group status. The&#xD;
      survey firm interviewers who conduct randomization, will not be involved in follow-up&#xD;
      interviews. The interviewers who conduct the follow-up interviews in Ottawa will not have&#xD;
      access to participants' group status. The coaches will not be involved in follow-up&#xD;
      assessments. Given our description of study objectives, some participants may know their&#xD;
      group status. Therefore, it is possible that some participants in the control group may try&#xD;
      to find more information about the PDRC. At the follow-up assessments, the investigators will&#xD;
      ask if they have used any risk prediction tools over the study period. At the follow-up&#xD;
      assessments, if participants develop a MDE, they will be encouraged to contact their family&#xD;
      doctors and information about local mental health resources will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of intervention. The intervention includes delivering the PDRC report via email and&#xD;
      coach guidance in its interpretation and planning self-help actions. The PDRC will be sent to&#xD;
      the participants within one week after randomization and the coach will initiate contact the&#xD;
      following week.&#xD;
