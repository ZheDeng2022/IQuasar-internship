  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of diabetes is increasing globally, including within Europe. There is an&#xD;
      estimated 20million diabetic patients in Europe, which is likely to increase, thereby adding&#xD;
      to societal demands on European health services. Diabetic patients are more likely to have&#xD;
      surgical interventions than the general population. There are plausible pathophysiology and&#xD;
      clinical mechanisms that diabetics are at increased risk of postoperative complications. When&#xD;
      postoperative complications occur in the general population, they increase mortality or&#xD;
      increase risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (Myocardial Infarction, Cerebrovascular&#xD;
      Accident, Pulmonary embolism) at 30-days and up to one year later. In addition, diabetes is&#xD;
      an independent risk factor for surgical site infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is variation in practice guidelines in different countries in the perioperative&#xD;
      management of diabetic patients undergoing major surgery, but this has not been documented on&#xD;
      a large scale. Given the multiplicity of guidelines and differing recommendations, it is&#xD;
      unsurprising that variability of 'real-world' clinical practice with regard to perioperative&#xD;
      management of oral antihyperglycemic medications and insulin therapy has been noted in audits&#xD;
      such as the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, although it is recognised that diabetic patients are at increased risk of&#xD;
      postoperative complications, this has not been recently evaluated, especially in light of&#xD;
      ongoing developments in perioperative care, such as Enhanced Recovery Programmes. While a&#xD;
      quality improvement intervention study has shown that maintaining tight preoperative&#xD;
      glycaemic control improves postoperative glycaemic control, it is not known if this reduces&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity overall. Further, whether certain anaesthetic techniques may be&#xD;
      associated with better or worse outcomes after major non-cardiac surgery is unknown.&#xD;
