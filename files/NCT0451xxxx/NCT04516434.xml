      The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of intravesical (bladder) electrical&#xD;
      stimulation and intraurethral electrical stimulation on bothersome symptoms and bladder&#xD;
      function in neurologically-intact adult women with underactive bladder. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that electrical stimulation will decrease bothersome urinary symptoms relative to&#xD;
      baseline and increase voided percentage during pressure-flow studies compared to their&#xD;
      routine clinical exam.&#xD;

      1. Objective: The overall objective of this study is to improve lower urinary tract&#xD;
           symptoms (LUTS) in adult neurologically-intact women with underactive bladder through&#xD;
           electrical stimulation of bladder sensory nerves or urethral sensory nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background and Significance: The storage and elimination of urine is regulated by neural&#xD;
           circuits in the brain and spinal cord to coordinate function between the urinary bladder&#xD;
           and the urethra. During micturition (bladder emptying), the elimination of urine is&#xD;
           facilitated by bladder muscle (detrusor) contraction and urethral and pelvic floor&#xD;
           muscle relaxation. Urine flow through the urethra also activates sensory nerves to&#xD;
           amplify bladder contractions and maintain efficient bladder emptying. Incomplete&#xD;
           emptying and urinary retention occur when these mechanisms are disrupted or poorly&#xD;
           coordinated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Incomplete emptying due to underactive bladder is a poorly understood health concern&#xD;
           that symptomatically affects up to 40% of the population, with the highest prevalence of&#xD;
           symptoms in older men and women. Despite the high prevalence of symptoms, the diagnosis&#xD;
           of an underactive bladder remains low due to the lack of consistent terminology and&#xD;
           standardized diagnostic criteria. This results in defining underactive bladder by a&#xD;
           symptom complex that may involve reduced motor drive (detrusor underactivity) during&#xD;
           bladder emptying and/or reduced sensory drive during filling and emptying. Symptoms&#xD;
           experienced by persons with underactive bladder include nocturia, urinary frequency,&#xD;
           urgency, incontinence, slow stream, hesitancy, straining, and sensation of incomplete&#xD;
           emptying. The most common symptoms are nocturia, slow stream, frequency, hesitancy, and&#xD;
           the impact of these symptoms on quality of life is substantial for many patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The management options for persons with underactive bladder include double-void,&#xD;
           intermittent self-catheterization, or pharmacotherapy. However, these treatments are&#xD;
           associated with poor quality of life and patients often fail to completely resolve the&#xD;
           lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). There is a need to clarify the pathological&#xD;
           mechanisms underlying underactive bladder to improve therapeutic outcomes. One approach&#xD;
           to clarify reduced sensory drive is to evaluate the functional integrity of sensory&#xD;
           nerves with quantitative sensory testing. Current perception threshold (CPT) testing&#xD;
           delivers electrical stimulation to activate nerve fibers that evoke sensory perception,&#xD;
           and changes in bladder sensory pathways were demonstrated in persons with diabetic&#xD;
           detrusor underactivity. These diagnostic tests, however, have not been applied to&#xD;
           neurologically intact adult women with underactive bladder and may provide insight into&#xD;
           pathological sensory dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The proposed research will quantify sensory nerve sensitivity in the bladder and urethra&#xD;
           in adult women with underactive bladder. The investigators will then amplify sensory&#xD;
           nerve activity via continuous electrical stimulation to improve LUTS associated with&#xD;
           underactive bladder. Achieving the proposed objectives will establish a prognostic&#xD;
           marker for rationally guided electrical stimulation in women with underactive bladder.&#xD;
           Understanding how these mechanisms contribute to impaired emptying in underactive&#xD;
           bladder will enable the development of novel therapeutics to enhance quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subject Recruitment: Established patients with underactive bladder will be identified by&#xD;
           MaestroCare chart review. New patients with underactive bladder will be identified by&#xD;
           Duke urogynecologists who see patients at one of two urogynecologic offices (Navaho&#xD;
           Clinic in Raleigh or Patterson Place in Durham).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Design and Procedures: The investigators will perform a parallel interventional study&#xD;
           with two non-randomized study arms (bladder stimulation and urethral stimulation).&#xD;
           Potential participants will be screened remotely by email via RedCap by completing a&#xD;
           questionnaire to determine bothersome symptoms and perceptions of bladder function.&#xD;
           Potential participants that meet eligibility criteria will be scheduled for an in person&#xD;
           study procedure visit, where informed consent will be signed. Participants will then&#xD;
           undergo current perception threshold (CPT) testing, where electrical stimulation will be&#xD;
           delivered via a catheter to the urethra (intraurethral) and bladder (intravesical) to&#xD;
           evoke sensation. The CPT results will inform whether the participant receives an&#xD;
           investigational session of intravesical (bladder) electrical stimulation or&#xD;
           intraurethral electrical stimulation. Following electrical stimulation, the participant&#xD;
           will undergo urodynamic studies (cystometrogram, pressure-flow study) to assess bladder&#xD;
           function after the investigational stimulation procedures. The participant will also be&#xD;
           asked to complete remotely by email a post-study symptom RedCap questionnaire 7 days&#xD;
           after study completion.&#xD;
