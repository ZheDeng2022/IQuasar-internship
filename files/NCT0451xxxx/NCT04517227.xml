    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study with a single arm in a single center assessing safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      combination therapy of TACE and ablation and durvalumab. This study will be conducted in&#xD;
      selected patients with intermediate stage HCC not amenable to curative therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled and receive the following treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TACE (day 1, up to twice. TACE interval will be 4～6 weeks) → Ablation (4 weeks after the last&#xD;
      TACE, up to twice. Ablation interval will be 4～6 weeks) → Durvalumab (at least 1 week after&#xD;
      the last ablation, 1500 mg Q4W, until mRECIST criteria defined radiological progression or&#xD;
      other discontinuation criteria were met, but no more than 1 year).&#xD;
