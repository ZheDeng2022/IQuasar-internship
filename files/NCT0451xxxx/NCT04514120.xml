  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several endoscopic scores have been developed to assess Chronic Rhinosinusitis severity like&#xD;
      the Modified Lund-Kennedy (MLK). This is a simple score only based on endoscopic signs. We&#xD;
      proposed a more descriptive Alsaleh-Javer Endoscopic Sinus Score (AJESS) system which&#xD;
      assesses all sinuses and nasal passages based on participant's severity of symptoms too. This&#xD;
      would be a more reliable and clinically valid CRS endoscopic score. We aim to study thE AJESS&#xD;
      system in 100 participants with stable CRS and 30 participants CRS who are experiencing an&#xD;
      exacerbation (worsening of CRS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a prevalent inflammatory disorder of the nasal passages and&#xD;
      sinuses associated with detrimental effects on quality of life and productivity as well as&#xD;
      billions of dollars in healthcare expenses and lost productivity each year. Numerous&#xD;
      endoscopic scoring systems have been developed to assess CRS disease severity such as the&#xD;
      popular Modified Lund-Kennedy (MLK) score which assesses sinus cavities only based on 3&#xD;
      criteria (polyps, edema, and discharge) with small 0-2 integer scales. Yet, such systems at&#xD;
      best have reported good to moderate reliabilities and weak to no correlation with&#xD;
      patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) which should motivate further research to develop a&#xD;
      more reliable and clinically valid CRS endoscopic scoring system, especially one which can&#xD;
      better align the observed endoscopic signs of disease with the severity of symptoms reported&#xD;
      by patients. In this study we propose a more descriptive Alsaleh-Javer Endoscopic Sinus Score&#xD;
      (AJESS) system which assesses all sinuses and nasal passages with a numerical score of&#xD;
      inflammation severity, alphabetical score for presence of CRS features, and an aggregated&#xD;
      numerical score of overall disease severity. Our mixed-methods clinical study of 100 stable&#xD;
      post-operative CRS patients and 30 post-operative CRS patients experiencing an exacerbation&#xD;
      who are visiting St. Paul's Sinus Centre will gather both cross-sectional (1 visit, CRS&#xD;
      stable) and prospective (2 follow-up visits approximately 2-4 weeks apart each, CRS flares)&#xD;
      clinical data including two PROMs (SNOT-22, VAS) and an objective olfactory sensation test&#xD;
      (Sniffin' Sticks TDI Score) to assess AJESS and MLK scores in terms of inter-rater&#xD;
      reliability, test-retest reliability, correlation with clinical data, and responsiveness to&#xD;
      changes in clinical data. Pending validation and head-to-head analysis with the MLK score,&#xD;
      the AJESS system may be a more reliable and valid endoscopic scoring system for clinical&#xD;
      practice and outcomes research in CRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study goals and objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the test-retest and inter-rater reliability of the AJESS and MLK scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the correlation of AJESS and MLK scores with cross-sectional PROMs (SNOT-22, VAS)&#xD;
           and Sniffin' Sticks TDI Score&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the reactivity of AJESS and MLK scores with prospective PROMs (SNOT-22, VAS) in&#xD;
           patients experiencing CRS exacerbations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants visiting St. Paul's Sinus Centre who meet inclusion criteria and no exclusion&#xD;
      criteria who are stable (N=100) and who are experiencing an exacerbation (N=30) will be&#xD;
      approached at random and consented to the study. Encounters are expected to be 30 minutes&#xD;
      each and participants experiencing a CRS or AFRS exacerbation will be expected to present for&#xD;
      follow-up after 3 weeks (+/- 1 week) intervals for a second and a third encounter until their&#xD;
      exacerbation are settled. The first encounter will collect relevant clinical data, endoscopic&#xD;
      photos of 10 anatomic sites, patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs, eg.SNOT-22, VAS) and&#xD;
      olfactory sense test results (Sniffin' Sticks TDI score). Subsequent visits for exacerbated&#xD;
      participants will collect the same endoscopic photos, PROMs and olfactory sense test results.&#xD;
