      This study aims to estimate the effects of nutritional interventions on the improvement of&#xD;
      nutritional status and quality of life (QoL) among gastrointestinal patients in Vietnam&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A quasi-experiment with intervention and control groups for pre- and post-intervention&#xD;
      assessment was carried out at the Department of Oncology and Palliative Care - Medical&#xD;
      University Hospital from 2016 to 2019. 60 gastrointestinal cancer patients were recruited in&#xD;
      each group. At stage 1, we selected patients of the intervention group who met the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria to receive nutritional counseling and diet at the hospital. At stage 2, we chose&#xD;
      patients who were eligible but did not accept the nutritional counseling and diet at the&#xD;
      hospital. Participants in both groups were paired together according to the following&#xD;
      criteria: 1) Age group: &lt;40 years old, 40-65 years old and &gt;65 years old; 2) Gender: Male and&#xD;
      female; 3) Types of cancer: stomach cancer and colon cancer; 4) Disease stages: stage 1-2 and&#xD;
      stage 3-4.&#xD;

    <description>The Scored Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) was used as the preeminent interdisciplinary patient assessment among patients with oncology. This tool includes (1) four patient-generated historical components (Weight History, Food Intake, Symptoms, Activities and Function); (2) the professional part (Diagnosis, Metabolic stress, and Physical Exam); (3) the Global Assessment (A = well-nourished, B = moderately malnourished, C = severely malnourished); (4) the total score, and nutritional triage recommendations. Changes in anthropometric indicators were also reported (weight, MUAC, muscle mass)</description>

    <measure>Change of quality of life after 8 weeks: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) version 3.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We utilized the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) version 3.0, which is an integrated and modular approach to holistically evaluate the QoL of patients with cancer.all dimensions of the tool will range from 0 to 100, in which a higher score presents a better level of functioning/the global health status or a worse level of symptoms.</description>

    <description>Regarding the intervention group, patients were treated with the intervention regimen, which consisted of:&#xD;
Nutritional counseling&#xD;
Each patient was assigned a specific menu which were prepared by research members during the time of staying at the hospital. Before discharge, patients were instructed on preparing their diets at home with the recommended amount of energy and protein and given formula milk within two months.</description>
