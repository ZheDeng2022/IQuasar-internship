  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer incidence and mortality have been increasing steeply in the past thirty years in&#xD;
      the mainland of China. More than 80% of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
      More than 40% of NSCLC patients are found to be in stage IIIb or IV, which is not resectable.&#xD;
      The 5-year survival rate for this group of patients is less than 5% in the SEER database.&#xD;
      Currently, the NCCN guidelines recommend platinum-containing double-drug chemotherapy as the&#xD;
      first- line standard of care for advanced NSCLC without driver gene mutations, and treatment&#xD;
      options after failure of first-line chemotherapy are limited. Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,&#xD;
      ICIs provide new treatment options, and in addition, radiotherapy can also be used in&#xD;
      selected patients with advanced NSCLC, especially in patients with oligo progression, where&#xD;
      irradiation of the thoracic primary lesions can improve the patient's respiratory-related&#xD;
      symptoms, reduce the tumor burden, improve the patient's quality of life, and prolong&#xD;
      survival in some patients. Therefore, we propose that combination of immunotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy to the primary lesion for these patients, who are generally in good KPS status,&#xD;
      may result in improved quality of life and prolonged survival. To date, there have been no&#xD;
      clinical studies of immunotherapy combined with primary lesions radiation therapy in patients&#xD;
      with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (driver gene-negative) after chemotherapy failure or&#xD;
      recurrence, so we designed this prospective, randomized, controlled, investigator-initiated,&#xD;
      phase II clinical study with the primary objective of evaluating the efficacy of combined&#xD;
      immunotherapy and primary lesions radiation therapy in this patient population. This trial&#xD;
      aims at investigating the feasibility and efficacy of this treatment strategy.&#xD;
