  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Declines in muscle mass and strength are expected with aging, but physical&#xD;
      inactivity and low protein intake have been suggested as risk factors of sarcopenia. So far,&#xD;
      lifestyle interventions, especially exercise and nutritional supplementation, prevail as&#xD;
      mainstays of treatment for sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To explore the effect and benefits of protein supplementation on the improvement&#xD;
      of muscle mass and physical performance in older people with sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Methods: Participants&#xD;
      aged 65-95y who meet the following criteria will be invited: (1) muscle mass: bioimpedance,&#xD;
      &lt;7.0 kg/m² (male) and &lt;5.7 kg/m² (female), (2) handgrip strength: &lt;28 kg (male) and &lt;18 kg&#xD;
      (female), and (3) low physical performance: 6-m gait Speed &lt;1.0 m/s. Study participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to two groups. The experimental group will receive a 12-week&#xD;
      intervention with【protein (14g)+ BCAA(4.4g)】 drink per day, while the parallel control group&#xD;
      will receive a placebo oat drink per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control group will be asked to maintain participants' usual diet and&#xD;
      physical activity. There are 3 time-points to measure outcomes and observe other required&#xD;
      information, at week 0(baseline), 6 and 12.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Sarcopenia is defined as an abnormal loss of muscle mass and strength. Declines&#xD;
      in muscle mass and strength are expected with aging, but physical inactivity and low protein&#xD;
      intake have been suggested as risk factors of sarcopenia. Recently, Taiwan is known as the&#xD;
      fastest-aging nation in the world, and the prevalence of sarcopenia has been reported as&#xD;
      3.9-7.3%; even more 9-64% in Dr. Chen's study. So far, lifestyle interventions, especially&#xD;
      exercise and nutritional supplementation, prevail as mainstays of treatment for sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To explore the effect and benefits of protein supplementation on the improvement&#xD;
      of muscle mass and physical performance in older people with sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial which will be&#xD;
      conducted between September and November, 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: The study will be conducted in Keelung, Taiwan. A total of 9 day-care centers,&#xD;
      including 180 over 65 years of residents, will be invited to participate the study via&#xD;
      telephone calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be invited to attend this randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, 2-parallel-groups trial, and will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      experimental and control groups with 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The intervention period will be 12 weeks. The control group will receive 150c.c&#xD;
      placebo oat drink (1.5g protein, 0.5g fat, 0.1g carbohydrate each pack, Zhan Xuan Co. Ltd.,&#xD;
      Taiwan) per day, five days per week, while the experimental group will receive 150c.c protein&#xD;
      supplementation drink (14g protein, 0.6g fat, 7g carbohydrate, 4.4 g BCAA , 2.4g glutamate,&#xD;
      0.5g arginine and 0.4g taurine each pack, Affix Health, Taiwan Branch) per day, five days per&#xD;
      week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplementation in the experimental group contains 90 kcal/d and the placebo oat drink&#xD;
      contains 8.3kcal/d. Participants in the control group will be asked to maintain participants'&#xD;
      usual diet and physical activity. There are 3 time-points to measure outcomes and observe&#xD;
      other required information, at week 0(baseline), 6 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: Referring to the setting in a published paper that gave a sample&#xD;
      size of 30 participants/group, a sample size of 40 participants in each group is considered&#xD;
      in the study, by considering potential dropouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random assignment and blinding: An independent external researcher prepared a computer&#xD;
      generated cluster random sampling. After random assignment, the external researcher newly&#xD;
      assigned a subject ID to each participant. All other study personnel and participants&#xD;
      remained blinded to the identity codes throughout the course of the study. When participants&#xD;
      withdrew from or completed the study, researchers were provided with the participants'&#xD;
      identities, and the participants were told what supplement participants had received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval: The study was approved by Taipei Hospital Human Trial Committee of the&#xD;
      Ministry of Health and Welfare. All participants were assured that data collected from&#xD;
      participants would be strictly conﬁdential, and the physical condition and safety were given&#xD;
      priority. Investigators conducted intervention only after obtaining participants ethical&#xD;
      approval (registration number: TH-IRB-00190046). Anyone who feel uncomfortable during the&#xD;
      study will be allowed to quit immediately with no any restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study measurement: Kihon Checklist, MNA, GDS-SF, SPPB, IADL, MMSE, handgrip, 6m gait speed,&#xD;
      (SMI), SF-12 questionnaire and Tw-FROP-Com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods: Statistical analysis was conducted using the IBM SPSS software (version&#xD;
      22, IBM Corporation, New York, NY). An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. (1)&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics: describe the distribution of category variables by number and&#xD;
      percentage, and the mean and standard deviations describe the distribution of continuous&#xD;
      variables. (2) Inference statistics: chi-square: to verify whether the pre-measured category&#xD;
      variants between the experimental group and the control group are homogeneous. ANOVA: Check&#xD;
      whether the continuous variables measured between the experimental group and the control&#xD;
      group are homogeneous. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) with interactions of time and&#xD;
      group in the models will be conducted to evaluate the intervention effect. A two-sided&#xD;
      p-value &lt; 0.05 is considered statistically signiﬁcant.&#xD;
