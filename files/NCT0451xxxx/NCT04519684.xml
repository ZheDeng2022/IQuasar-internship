  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the procedure of&#xD;
      choice for patients with ulcerative colitis, familial adenomatous polyposis, and select&#xD;
      patients with Crohn's disease due to overall low patient morbidity and good quality of life.&#xD;
      However, some patients can develop Crohn's disease of the pouch, a clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
      Crohn's disease following IPAA. One of the manifestations of Crohn's disease of the pouch&#xD;
      includes a fistula from the pouch that travels to the vagina or perianal area. These fistulas&#xD;
      can be quite difficult to manage with medications and local surgical intervention, and, on&#xD;
      occasion result in a reconstruction pouch but more often require a pouch excision with&#xD;
      permanent end ileostomy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      using allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells to treat people who have a&#xD;
      peri-pouch fistula related to a clinical diagnosis of Crohn's disease of the pouch.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This aim of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of adult allogeneic bone&#xD;
      marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), for the treatment of medically refractory&#xD;
      peri-pouch fistulizing disease in the setting of Crohn's disease of the pouch. The study will&#xD;
      randomize 20 participants. Enrolled participants will be randomized to treatment group with&#xD;
      MSCs, versus placebo in a 3:1 fashion. Participants in the treatment group will have a direct&#xD;
      injection of MSCs at a dose of 75 million cells. This will be given as a direct injection in&#xD;
      and around the fistula tract. Participants will be evaluated for complete healing at three&#xD;
      months. If complete healing has been achieved participants will continue to be followed for&#xD;
      one year. If complete healing has not been achieved at three months, participants will be&#xD;
      eligible for a second injection of MSCs at the same dose of 75 million cells. Control&#xD;
      participants without complete healing from placebo will cross over at the 6 month visit to&#xD;
      receive an injection of MSCs and will be followed for one year after treatment to a total&#xD;
      duration of 18 months. The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted at the month 6 time&#xD;
      point.&#xD;
