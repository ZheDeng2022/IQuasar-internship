  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Quit and Stay Quit Monday model is an innovative smoking cessation approach that guides&#xD;
      smokers' behavior without requiring additional resources. The investigator will conduct a&#xD;
      randomized control trial evaluating the effectiveness of this model as compared to usual&#xD;
      smoking cessation care in a population of smokers with a mental health condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this proposal is to innovate the tobacco treatment paradigm for&#xD;
      smokers with mental health conditions (MHC) by integrating the Quit and Stay Quit Monday&#xD;
      Model into smoking cessation services for this vulnerable population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will conduct a two-group, parallel-randomized controlled trial (RCT). The&#xD;
      target population will be generated by the NYU Langone electronic medical record (EMR). The&#xD;
      investigator will proactively contact patients to offer enrollment and randomize participants&#xD;
      1:1 to one of two groups (n=50/group): (1) Quit and Stay Quit Monday Model or (2) Usual Care.&#xD;
      For evaluation, phone surveys will be conducted at baseline and 3-months to assess quit&#xD;
      attempts, intervention satisfaction, and smoking cessation.&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomized to the study intervention will receive: (1) 2 telephone smoking cessation coaching calls; (2) enrollment into SmokefreeTXT; and (3) enrollment in the iquitmonday.org weekly email newsletter. The telephone coaches will ask these participants to identify a future Monday as their quit date and provide coaching to achieve a Monday quit. The coaches will also enter the selected Monday as the patient's quit day when enrolling the patient into SmokefreeTXT.</description>
