  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main problem in mitral valve repair surgery in children is the high number of&#xD;
      postoperative residual lesions (49% of the total cases). Residual lesions after mitral valve&#xD;
      repair are associated with morbidity and complications in the form of hemolysis and could&#xD;
      affect the postoperative reverse remodeling process. Surgery techniques for mitral valve&#xD;
      repair in children have fewer choices than adult patients because of the smaller and thinner&#xD;
      valve structure. Besides, the weakness of the mitral valve repair technique that often occurs&#xD;
      in large left ventricles with severe mitral regurgitation, after repairing with ring&#xD;
      annuloplasty, there is usually a mild residual regurgitation due to posterior mitral leaflet&#xD;
      that tends to become restrictive due to being attracted by the left ventricular wall that&#xD;
      remains big. No technique has been found to overcome the problem of mitral regurgitation&#xD;
      residuals that occur postoperatively. Therefore, by analyzing postoperative mitral valve&#xD;
      structural abnormalities with conventional techniques, an additional posterior mitral valve&#xD;
      elevation technique was designed to increase the area of coaptation between two leaves of the&#xD;
      mitral valve so that the incidence of postoperative regurgitation lesions can be reduced.&#xD;

      The main problem in mitral valve repair surgery in children is the high number of&#xD;
      postoperative residual lesions (49% of the total cases). Residual lesions after mitral valve&#xD;
      repair are associated with morbidity and complications in the form of hemolysis and could&#xD;
      affect the postoperative reverse remodeling process. Surgery techniques for mitral valve&#xD;
      repair in children have fewer choices than adult patients because of the smaller and thinner&#xD;
      valve structure. Besides, the weakness of the mitral valve repair technique that often occurs&#xD;
      in large left ventricles with severe mitral regurgitation, after repairing with ring&#xD;
      annuloplasty, there is usually a mild residual regurgitation due to posterior mitral leaflet&#xD;
      that tends to become restrictive due to being attracted by the left ventricular wall that&#xD;
      remains big. No technique has been found to overcome the problem of mitral regurgitation&#xD;
      residuals that occur postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, by analyzing postoperative mitral valve structural abnormalities with conventional&#xD;
      techniques, an additional posterior mitral valve elevation technique was designed. The&#xD;
      posterior annulus elevation technique is a technique that is carried by lifting the posterior&#xD;
      mitral annulus towards the cranial so that the posterior mitral leaflet can meet perfectly&#xD;
      with the anterior mitral leaflet indicated by a larger coaptation area. This technique can be&#xD;
      applied after repair with conventional techniques done optimally to reduce the possibility of&#xD;
      postoperative residual lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis in this study is that pediatric patients with mitral regurgitation who undergo&#xD;
      mitral valve repair surgery with posterior annulus elevation techniques can reduce residual&#xD;
      mitral regurgitation, improve clinical and metabolic outcomes of postoperative heart failure,&#xD;
      and reduce the risk of postoperative hemolysis.&#xD;
