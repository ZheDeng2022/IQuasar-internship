    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study evaluates the safety and tolerability as well as pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      properties of a single oral dose of BOS172767 enantiomer E1 and BOS172767 enantiomer E2&#xD;
      following administration to healthy participants. Part 2 of the study was to be conducted to&#xD;
      assess the safety and tolerability as well as pharmacokinetic properties of one selected&#xD;
      enantiomer (BOS172767-Ex) following multiple ascending doses over 14 days of dosing in&#xD;
      healthy participants.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design of Part 1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, single-dose,&#xD;
      two-way crossover, followed by two sequential ascending dose periods in 12 healthy&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 was designed to be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized multiple ascending&#xD;
      dose (MAD) study in 36 healthy participants (12 per study cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 was to progress following completion of Part 1, but was not conducted.&#xD;

In Period 3 and 4, participants received BOS172767-Ex (selected enantiomer from Part 1 [E1 or E2]) tablets or matching placebo (Regimens C and D, respectively) from Regimen A or B in the fasted state. The Period 3 and 4 dose was selected after review of data from Periods 1 and 2. In each Period, dosing occurred on Day 1, and there was a washout period of at least 10 days or 5 half-lives of the parent (whichever is greater) between each dose of investigational medicinal product.</description>
