  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood donations is a essential and crucial in the clinic. A whole blood donation results in&#xD;
      the loss of 450-525 mL whole blood in eight to ten minutes and is known to reduce body iron&#xD;
      stores with 200-265 mg iron depending on the donor's age, hematocrit and sex and accounts for&#xD;
      25% of average tissue iron stores in men and up to 75% in women.In the present study, the&#xD;
      investigators aimed at thoroughly evaluate normal biological variation of relevant biomarkers&#xD;
      and hormones before the donation of 450 mL whole blood as well as the expected alterations in&#xD;
      systemic levels of plasma iron indices and red blood cell measures up to 4 weeks after&#xD;
      donation in healthy, non-anemic, young men and women&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likewise, doping in sport is a major problem concerning both the health of the athletes and&#xD;
      the integrity of sports. Despite major improvements in anti-doping work in recent years, it&#xD;
      is still impossible to test for all existing and future doping strategies, such as&#xD;
      manipulation with blood oxygen carrying capacity. A well-known doping strategy is autologous&#xD;
      blood transfusion (ABT), and at present, the detection of ABT is a challenge for anti-doping&#xD;
      authorities. The hypotheses for this study are that 1) ret% and abnormal blood profile score&#xD;
      (ABPS) have higher sensitivity to micro-dose ABT compared to current variables in the Athlete&#xD;
      Biological Passport (ABP); 2) The plasma concentration of hepcidin and erythroferrone (ERFE)&#xD;
      is sensitive to micro-dose ABT; 3) Gender-specific variations in hematologic variables affect&#xD;
      the interpretation of the athlete's biological passport.&#xD;
