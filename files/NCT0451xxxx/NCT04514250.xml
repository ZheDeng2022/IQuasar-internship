  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Discrepancies exist among aortic stenosis severity classification, patient symptom burden,&#xD;
      and - in some cases - even survival. The new Stress Aortic Valve Index (SAVI) metric&#xD;
      correlates better with transvalvular flow and might be a better predictor of symptoms and&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will demonstrate the value of SAVI (both non-invasive and invasive) in&#xD;
      patients with moderate aortic stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population will consist of subjects at least 50 years old with moderate aortic stenosis&#xD;
      (defined as aortic valve area &gt;1.0 cm2 plus either maximal velocity 2.5-3.9 m/s or mean&#xD;
      gradient 15-39 mmHg). Subjects with severe concomitant valve disease or severe&#xD;
      unrevascularized coronary artery disease will be excluded, so that the isolated prognosis of&#xD;
      aortic stenosis can be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo invasive SAVI measurements during catheterization. Furthermore&#xD;
      patients will receive non-invasive testing with an exercise echocardiogram and computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scan for non-invasive SAVI measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The short-term objective will compare SAVI with standard resting indexes for symptom burden,&#xD;
      functional capacity, and biomarkers. The long-term objective will associate SAVI and standard&#xD;
      resting indexes with clinical outcomes related to valvular disease. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that low SAVI (more marked AS during stress) will track with more symptoms and a&#xD;
      worse prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: The patients will have several study visits. The index visit will be planned to&#xD;
      obtain informed consent and baseline parameters. The measurement visit(s) will consist of the&#xD;
      invasive SAVI measurement, echocardiogram, stress echo imaging, 6-minute walk test, quality&#xD;
      of life questionnaire, and the cardiac CT. During the final visit after 12 months, subjects&#xD;
      will undergo a CT valvular calcium scan, quality of life questionnaire, and 6-minute walk&#xD;
      test. Every subject will have an echocardiogram yearly as suggested by guideline criteria and&#xD;
      could possibly be contacted until five years after enrollment. Blood samples will be drawn at&#xD;
      baseline and the 1-year follow-up. Potentially the new SAVI metric could identify patients at&#xD;
      higher risk among those with moderate gradient AS. However, since no outcome data currently&#xD;
      exists regarding SAVI and prognosis, no conclusions could be derived from these measurements&#xD;
      until study completion.&#xD;
