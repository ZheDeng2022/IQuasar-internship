  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry skin is characterized by a lack of moisture in the outer layer of the skin and can occur&#xD;
      as a result of numerous factors including cold weather, low humidity, age, etc. In this&#xD;
      study, the moisturizing benefits of two formulas were evaluated for barrier function&#xD;
      improvement/impact when used by women with moderately to severely dry skin on their lower&#xD;
      legs.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects were assigned to one of two procedural groups (Regression or Non-Regression) based on Visit 1 scheduling. Subjects were provided with a commercial cleanser to use during a 3-day period with no moisturizers and no hair removal allowed on their lower legs, and to continue using throughout the study. At Visit 2, all subjects received the two test moisturizers to use split-leg (right vs. left lower leg randomized) to use for 6 weeks. Subjects returned for evaluations at Week 2 (Visit 3), Week 4 (Visit 4), and Week 6 (Visit 5). At Week 6, subjects in the Regression group entered a 2-week regression period (no moisturizer usage) and returned for evaluations at Regression Days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 14. Meanwhile, at Week 6, subjects in the Non-Regression group (exploratory) continued using the moisturizers; they returned for evaluations at Week 6 + Days 1, 2, 3, and 4.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The test moisturizers were assigned a product code; each moisturizer was assigned to a subject's right or left lower leg per a randomization schedule. Subjects were blinded to the product identities, and evaluators were blinded to which product was used on each leg. Procedural group was unblinded and based on scheduling at Visit 1.</masking_description>
