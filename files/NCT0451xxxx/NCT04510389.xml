  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a metabolic disorder, characterized by an increase in the body's fat mass, which&#xD;
      will reflect an increase in total body weight. In Brazil, overweight accounts for 53.8% of&#xD;
      the population, and of these 18.9% are obese. Surgical treatment is currently the most&#xD;
      successful method for weight loss in patients with Grade III obesity and reduced associated&#xD;
      morbidities. The general objective is to evaluate genetic, inflammatory, and dietary factors&#xD;
      that would influence weight loss and the appearance of protein deficiency or sarcopenia in&#xD;
      patients undergoing bariatric surgery and to evaluate the effects of protein supplementation&#xD;
      for 8 weeks after the 18th postoperative month in the parameters evaluated. The study has a&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked model. The patients will be selected in two&#xD;
      bariatric surgery services accredited by the Brazilian Health Unic System (SUS) in the city&#xD;
      of Belo Horizonte, Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project has already been approved by the Brazilian Ethics committee CONEP/UFMG by nº.&#xD;
      75415317.8.0000.5149. Patients of both sexes over 20 years of age will be included, attending&#xD;
      the hospitals of the project with regular follow-up in the postoperative period. Data on&#xD;
      anthropometry, body composition, muscle strength, energy expenditure, and inflammatory&#xD;
      profile will be collected. The data will be correlated with the evaluation of the presence of&#xD;
      genetic polymorphisms.&#xD;

      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also objective to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe the food consumption between 18 and 24 months of surgery with respect to&#xD;
           protein and caloric intake;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evolution of weight loss, lean mass, fat mass and metabolic rate before and after&#xD;
           supplementation with WP or placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in protein status (assessed by muscle strength and serum levels of total&#xD;
           protein, albumin, prealbumin, ferritin, hemoglobin) before and after supplementation&#xD;
           with WP or placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The inflammatory blood profile (assessed by cytokine levels and before and after&#xD;
           supplementation with WP or placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The influence of the rS9939609 polymorphism of the FTO gene on the nutritional status,&#xD;
           biochemical and inflammatory parameters in the postoperative (after 18 months) of&#xD;
           surgery;&#xD;
