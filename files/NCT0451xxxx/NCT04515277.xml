      Study to evaluate the effect of gum acacia (FibregumTM) on post-prandial glucose and insulin&#xD;
      levels and food intake in normal-weight and overweight subjects during a 2-7 weeks&#xD;
      intervention period. In addition, tolerability and safety of gum acacia (FibregumTM) will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gum arabic is a heteropolysaccharide (molecular weight 350-850 kDa) harvested from Acacia&#xD;
      seyal or Acacia senegal. It is highly soluble and broadly used in numerous solid and liquid&#xD;
      food matrices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the assessment of non-digestible carbohydrates as dietary fiber, it is eminent to&#xD;
      demonstrate that its consumption is related to a specific beneficial physiological effect&#xD;
      shown in an appropriate clinical study. The aim of the present trial was to expand the&#xD;
      clinical evidence with respect to beneficial effects of gum acacia on post-prandial blood&#xD;
      glucose levels, post-prandial insulin levels and prospective ad libitum food intake, in&#xD;
      normal-weight and overweight subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present double-blind, randomized, controlled, three-way cross-over study was to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of gum acacia versus no treatment on post-prandial glucose (PPG) levels in&#xD;
      normal-weight and overweight subjects during a 2-7 weeks intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, post-prandial insulin (PPI) levels, prospective ad libitum food intake, as well&#xD;
      as the safety and tolerability of gum acacia were assessed.&#xD;
