  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is the provide proof of high correlation between somatic and&#xD;
      germline mismatch repair instability. This correlation is specifically researched in an area&#xD;
      where patients have less access to cancer education and genetic testing for various reasons&#xD;
      such as lack of insurance and general accessibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study concentrates on early diagnosis of Lynch syndrome. Lynch syndrome is usually&#xD;
      diagnosed from a blood test resulting in a mutation of one of the mismatch repair genes.&#xD;
      Those are MLH1, MSH2, MSH 6, PMS2. A mutation in one of these genes creates a mismatch repair&#xD;
      instability,hence higher incidence of cancers in specific organ groups. Amongst these organs&#xD;
      are the Uterus, Ovaries, Upper genitourinary system, Pancreas and GI system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common endometrial carcinoma which is found in Lynch syndrome is of endometrioid&#xD;
      histology. Most patients with known germline mismatch repair instability, have the same&#xD;
      somatic mutation. Our study is looking into correlating somatic mutation to germline&#xD;
      mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By doing so, patients diagnosed with somatic mismatch repair instability will be also&#xD;
      diagnosed with lynch syndrome without germline genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening programs will be utilized earlier and preventive procedures offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to less access to educational programs, genetic counseling and testing in underserved&#xD;
      areas, patients are sometimes lost to follow up. Our study seeks to prove high correlation&#xD;
      between somatic and germline mutations and by doing so, patient will be diagnosed with Lynch&#xD;
      syndrome straight after endometrial cancer staging. As a result, increased compliance will be&#xD;
      expected and patients will be offered the recommended preventative surgeries and screening&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
