  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This case series will recruit patients who require lateral maxillary sinus floor elevation&#xD;
      surgery. This procedure will be carried out as per standard surgical protocol. The&#xD;
      periodontal resident performing the surgery will evaluate the Schneiderian membrane at&#xD;
      several points during the surgery to determine its integrity (beyond visual inspection). This&#xD;
      will be completed by using the videoscope to evaluate the membrane. This evaluation will take&#xD;
      place at at least 3 points during the surgery (before membrane elevation, half-way through&#xD;
      membrane elevation, and prior to initiating bone grafting procedures). If the resident wishes&#xD;
      to evaluate the membrane at other points during the surgery to inspect the integrity of the&#xD;
      membrane, this may be accomplished. This evaluation will be recorded for later, further&#xD;
      evaluation by experienced periodontists. If no visible perforation is evident, a 1% baby&#xD;
      shampoo solution in normal saline (Johnson and Johnson) will be applied topically over the&#xD;
      membrane prior to videoscope evaluation. At this point, the patient will lightly blow their&#xD;
      nose; if any micro-tears not visible to the naked eye are present, these tears will produce a&#xD;
      bubbling effect, which will be recorded by the videoscope. This evaluation will take place&#xD;
      with the 1st and 2nd videoscope evaluations (before membrane elevation, and mid-way through&#xD;
      elevation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to complete a VAS questionnaire at their one-week follow-up&#xD;
      appointment in order to determine how post-op healing has been progressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all procedures have been performed, three experienced periodontists will individually&#xD;
      evaluate the videos post-surgically. They will evaluate each video and determine if, in their&#xD;
      opinion, there is a membrane perforation (yes/no). Each video will be evaluated in a random&#xD;
      fashion (each video being evaluated as a separate event, and not by case). The evaluating&#xD;
      periodontists will also be masked to the results noted by the surgeon who completed the&#xD;
      surgery, and blinded to the patient's information.&#xD;
