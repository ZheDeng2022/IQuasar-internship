  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open label, between-subject, randomized multi-center pilot study will assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of conducting a study remotely with telehealth visits to assess the effect of&#xD;
      cigarettes with minimal filter ventilation vs. moderate filter ventilation on smoking&#xD;
      behavior and biomarkers of tobacco toxicant exposure. Subjective measures, alveolar carbon&#xD;
      monoxide, blood pressure and cigarettes per a day will be collected remotely. Biological&#xD;
      samples will be collected at home and mailed to the study clinic.&#xD;

      Smokers of cigarettes with about 16-30% ventilation in their conventional cigarettes who meet&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will enter 3 weeks of monitoring of usual brand smoking. Subjects will&#xD;
      then be randomly assigned for a period of 6 weeks to one of two conditions: 1) ventilated&#xD;
      cigarettes; or 2) unventilated cigarettes. Subjects in each condition will be unblinded to&#xD;
      simulate real world conditions. Subjects are provided with a debit card (ClinCard) that has&#xD;
      been loaded with the appropriate amount of money to cover self-purchased usual brand&#xD;
      cigarette in baseline and the assigned study cigarettes during intervention. Weekly&#xD;
      telehealth visits will be conducted during baseline and the 6 weeks on study cigarettes to&#xD;
      collect study measures, followed by a one month follow-up.&#xD;
