  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessment of fluid responsiveness (FR) is to detect whether patient could benefit from fluid&#xD;
      therapy. Mini fluid challenge has been widely used in clinical practice to prevent patients&#xD;
      from volume overload. In clinical practice, 100 mL or 250 mL have been used most frequently&#xD;
      and FR was defined as an increase in CO greater than 10% as much as the changes in CO after&#xD;
      infusion of 500 mL. While using a half of volume infusion and assessed by the traditional&#xD;
      standard of FR, this might misclassify more patients as nonresponders. In that it is&#xD;
      imperative to test the predictive ability of mini fluid and find out the threshold of cutoff&#xD;
      value. Meanwhile, in almost mini-FC, cardiac output were measured by echocardiography(VTi)&#xD;
      and pulse contour,None of the studies conducted cardiac output (CO)measurement by gold&#xD;
      standard method of thermodilution by pulmonary artery catheter (PAC). The correlation between&#xD;
      new generated CO measurements and PAC varies in different studies as well. It is imperative&#xD;
      to investigate the reliability of mini-FC to predicting fluid responsiveness(FR).The&#xD;
      investigator's study is to detect the predictive minimal volume using thermodilution by PAC&#xD;
      in septic shock patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluid therapy is the cornerstone of septic resuscitation. In recent decade, a restrictive&#xD;
      fluid strategy has been applied to shock resuscitation for fewer complications and shorter&#xD;
      hospital stays compared with a liberal fluid strategy. Therefore, it is a reasonable step to&#xD;
      assess the patient's response to fluid infusion to avoid excessive fluid&#xD;
      administration.Mini-fluid challenge allows the selection of fluid responders by inducible&#xD;
      changes of hemodynamic parameters after changing the preload gaining popularity. The mini&#xD;
      fluid challenge was firstly described by Muller et al. in 2011. They found an infusion of 100&#xD;
      mL colloid over 1 minute and the assessment by cardiac output using velocity time integral&#xD;
      (VTi) at the aortic outflow tract could predict fluid responsiveness (FR). Since then, a&#xD;
      total of seven investigations have been published. Although a mini-fluid challenge may help&#xD;
      the decision-making process of fluid management, the investigation results differed from each&#xD;
      other, especially in minimal volume and cut off value of hemodynamic parameters change.&#xD;
      Meanwhile, we noticed that when measuring CO, the method of thermodilution by pulmonary&#xD;
      artery catheter (PAC), which is the gold standard of CO measurement, was not used in these&#xD;
      studies. Furthermore, the majority participants of the studies were perioperative patients in&#xD;
      a stable hemodynamic state.Therefore, there are two question needed to be answered:what is&#xD;
      the minimal infusion volume in effectively predicting fluid responsiveness, and whether&#xD;
      mini-volume can perform a real change in septic shock patients. Thus, it is necessary to&#xD;
      explore the minimal volume in fluid challenge by PAC and test its reliability in detecting&#xD;
      responders (R) and nonresponders (NR).&#xD;
