  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proposal, the investigators aim to explore the clinical subtypes and biological&#xD;
      markers to personalize the use antidepressants in MDD. By stratifying the subjects with&#xD;
      (versus without) remission and treatment response, the biological markers are expected to&#xD;
      have important prediction effects in future clinical practice.&#xD;
