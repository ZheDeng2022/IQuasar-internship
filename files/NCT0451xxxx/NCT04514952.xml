  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The drug for this submission is Hope Biosciences' autologous, adipose-derived&#xD;
      culture-expanded mesenchymal stem cells (HB-adMSCs) for the treatment of a single patient&#xD;
      with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Stem cells have become a promising tool for the&#xD;
      treatment of inflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions, including autoimmune diseases,&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

      Once the eligibility is confirmed, approximately 1-2 weeks after the screening visit, the&#xD;
      subject will return for the baseline/first infusion visit. Subsequent treatments will occur 2&#xD;
      weeks apart for 18 weeks, for a total of 10 infusions. Follow-up visits will occur at 22&#xD;
      weeks, 26 weeks and 39 weeks. End of study visit will occur at 52 weeks.&#xD;
