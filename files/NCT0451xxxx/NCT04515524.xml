      Primary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate binocular visual acuity at the end of this study in patients included from&#xD;
           the VGFTe-ROP-1920 study, for treatment of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate long-term safety outcomes in patients included from the VGFTe-ROP-1920&#xD;
           study, for treatment of ROP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe visual function in patients included from the VGFTe-ROP-1920 study, for&#xD;
           treatment of ROP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe overall development in patients included from the VGFTe-ROP-1920 study, for&#xD;
           treatment of ROP.&#xD;
