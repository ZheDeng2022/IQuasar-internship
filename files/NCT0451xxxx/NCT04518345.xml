    <textblock>
      This phase IB/II trial studies the best dose of TP-0903 and how well it works when given&#xD;
      alone or with azacitidine in treating patients with FLT3 gene mutated acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;
      TP-0903 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Chemotherapy drugs, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping&#xD;
      them from spreading. Giving TP-0903 alone or with azacitidine may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine a tolerable dose of dubermatinib (TP-0903) monotherapy for&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory patients with FLT3 acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TP-0903 with azacitidine in untreated&#xD;
      unfit patients with FLT3 AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the complete remission (CR) or complete remission with partial hematologic&#xD;
      recovery (CRh) rate following induction therapy with TP-0903 in relapsed/refractory patients&#xD;
      or TP-0903 with azacitidine therapy in untreated unfit patients with FLT3 AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the toxicity profile of TP-0903 as a single agent and in combination with or&#xD;
      azacitidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine disease-free survival for patients achieving CR/CRh in each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine overall survival for patients in each cohort. IV. To determine the&#xD;
      proportion of patients who go to transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To conduct pharmacokinetic studies of TP-0903 alone and in combination with azacitidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine changes in circulating AXL, Gas6, FLT3 ligand, and other cytokines/chemokines&#xD;
      by TP-0903.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the impact of TP-0903 on the inhibition of kinase signaling (AXL, FLT3,&#xD;
      STAT5, AURKA), and metabolomics in AML cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine differentially expressed genes in bone marrow stromal cells and AML cells&#xD;
      upon TP-0903 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To examine sensitivity and resistance patterns associated with TP-0903 by genomic,&#xD;
      epigenomic, and transcriptomic profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of dubermatinib followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (FLT3 AML WITH RELAPSED/REFRACTORY DISEASE):&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive dubermatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients with clinical or hematologic response and not transplant eligible may&#xD;
      continue dubermatinib until loss of response/clinical benefit. Patients with clinical or&#xD;
      hematologic response and transplant eligible may continue dubermatinib until one week prior&#xD;
      to admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up followed every 3 months for up&#xD;
      to 2 years from registration and then every 6 months for up to 5 years from registration.&#xD;
