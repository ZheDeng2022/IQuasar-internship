  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of mFOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab and avelumab&#xD;
      as first line treatment of patients with initially unresectable and previously untreated RAS&#xD;
      wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), in terms of Progression-free Survival.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, multicentric phase II single-arm trial in which patients&#xD;
      with initially unresectable and previously untreated RAS wild-type mCRC will receive&#xD;
      induction treatment with mFOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab and avelumab up to 12 cycles followed by&#xD;
      maintenance with 5-FU/LV plus cetuximab plus avelumab until disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity or patient's refusal. The second- and subsequent lines of treatment will be at&#xD;
      investigators' choice.&#xD;
