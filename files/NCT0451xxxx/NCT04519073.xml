      The primary and secondary objectives of this Phase 1 study are respectively to assess the&#xD;
      safety and the immunogenicity of two administrations of the RSV vaccine candidate at three&#xD;
      different doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, sequential, parallel cohorts,&#xD;
      dose-escalation (three dosages) design. Each of the three cohorts (N=20 subjects per cohort,&#xD;
      total of 60 subjects) will receive placebo (n=5), or a low (15 µg, n=15), intermediate (50&#xD;
      µg, n=15) or high dosage (150 µg, n=15) of candidate vaccine, on two occasions (Day 0 and Day&#xD;
      56). Subjects will be healthy adult women aged between 18 and 45 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two phases: an active treatment phase from Day 0 to Month 3, and a follow-up&#xD;
      phase from Month 3 + 1 day to Month 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the active phase, subjects will complete diary cards to record oral temperature&#xD;
      (daily), solicited local and general adverse events (AEs) and unsolicited AEs for 7 days&#xD;
      after each administration. Unsolicited AEs will be recorded up to Day 28 post-each&#xD;
      administration. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of specific interest (AESI)&#xD;
      will be recorded throughout the duration of the active phase. Subjects will visit the&#xD;
      clinical site for safety monitoring on Days 1, 7 and 28 following each administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn at a screening visit and the safety test data will be available just&#xD;
      before 1st administration. The screening set includes markers of infection with hepatitis B&#xD;
      virus, hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus. A serum sample will be taken for&#xD;
      detection of pregnancy. At the next scheduled time points, pregnancy will be screened in a&#xD;
      urine sample. Laboratory safety parameters will be examined further at Days 0, 1, 7, 28, 56,&#xD;
      57, 63 and 84.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow-up phase, visits for safety monitoring are scheduled at Months 6, 9 and 12&#xD;
      post-1st administration. SAEs and AESI will be recorded at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Humoral immunity will be measured on Days 0, 28, 56, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9 and Month 12.&#xD;
      Cellular immunity will be measured on Days 0, 7, 28, 56, 63 and 84.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study for each subject will be approximately 13 months. The total&#xD;
      duration of the study will be approximately 18 months.&#xD;

      Virometix designed and developed a candidate vaccine coded V-306 based on synthetic virus&#xD;
      like particles (SVLP) that present the neutralizing Palivizumab epitope of the antigenic site&#xD;
      II region of the F-protein (FsII). V-306 has been evaluated in cotton rats, mice and rabbits&#xD;
      for safety and immunogenicity. Strong immunogenicity was demonstrated in mice and rabbits by&#xD;
      ELISA and RSV A and B neutralization. Full protection with no vaccine-associated enhanced&#xD;
      respiratory disease (VAERD) was demonstrated in a validated mouse challenge model. Reduction&#xD;
      of the viral load with no VAERD was also shown in the cotton rat challenge model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the first-in-human Phase 1 study is to assess the safety of two&#xD;
      administrations of the RSV vaccine candidate at three different dosages of V-306.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess the immunogenicity of two administrations of the RSV&#xD;
      vaccine candidate at three different dosages of V-306.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, sequential, parallel cohorts,&#xD;
      dose-escalation (three dosages) design. It will be conducted in one centre. Each of the three&#xD;
      cohorts (N=20 subjects per cohort, total of 60 subjects) will receive placebo (n=5), or a low&#xD;
      (15 µg/administration, n=15), intermediate (50 µg/administration, n=15) or high dosage (150&#xD;
      µg/administration, n=15) of candidate vaccine, on two occasions (Day 0 and Day 56). Subjects&#xD;
      will be healthy adult women aged between 18 and 45 years. The enrolment schedule with&#xD;
      sentinel dosing will be the same in each cohort. After each administration, the subject will&#xD;
      be observed in the clinical trial centre for 120 minutes, before being discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be in two phases: (1) an active treatment phase from Day 0 to Month 3, i.e.&#xD;
      one month post 2nd administration, with unblinding and primary analysis of data collected up&#xD;
      to Month 3, and (2) a follow-up phase from Month 3 + 1 day to Month 12 post-1st&#xD;
      administration for safety and immunogenicity. The sponsor will be unblinded at Month 3, while&#xD;
      the clinical site and laboratory will remain blinded during the whole study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the active phase, subjects will complete diary cards to record oral temperature&#xD;
      (daily), solicited local and general adverse events (AEs) and unsolicited AEs for 7 days&#xD;
      after each administration. Unsolicited AEs will be recorded up to Day 28 post-each&#xD;
      administration. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of specific interest (AESI)&#xD;
      will be recorded throughout the duration of the active phase. Subjects will visit the&#xD;
      clinical site for safety monitoring on Days 1, 7 and 28 following each administration. A time&#xD;
      window will be defined for each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn at a screening visit (up to 14 days before Day 0 for lab safety analyses&#xD;
      and up to 2 months before Day 0 for serology analyses) and the safety test data will be&#xD;
      available just before 1st administration. The screening set includes markers of infection&#xD;
      with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus. These data will&#xD;
      be part of the baseline health status of each subject. A serum sample will be taken for&#xD;
      detection of pregnancy. At the next scheduled time points, pregnancy will be screened in a&#xD;
      urine sample and if positive will be confirmed by blood analysis. Laboratory safety&#xD;
      parameters will be examined further at Days 0, 1, 7, 28, 56, 57, 63 and 84.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow-up phase, visits for safety monitoring are scheduled at Months 6, 9 and 12&#xD;
      post-1st administration. SAEs and AESI will be recorded at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Humoral immunity will be measured on Days 0, 28, 56, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9 and Month 12.&#xD;
      Months 6, 9 and 12 aim to evaluate the persistence of the humoral response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cellular immunity will be measured on Days 0, 7, 28, 56, 63 and 84. Data collection will use&#xD;
      an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). The duration of the study for each subject will be&#xD;
      approximately 13 months. The total duration of the study will be approximately 18 months.&#xD;
