  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to conduct a randomized, double blind, randomised controlled multicentre&#xD;
      trial of sirolimus drug coated balloon versus standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty&#xD;
      for the treatment of below the knee arterial disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The burden of limb loss as a result of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is high and this&#xD;
      problem is set to worsen globally. Treatment of PAD primarily involves revascularisation of&#xD;
      the limb. Angioplasty as a first line strategy of revascularization over surgical procedures&#xD;
      has been adopted by most vascular centers. Local drug delivery using drug coated balloons&#xD;
      (DCB) during angioplasty for PAD can successfully deliver effective local tissue&#xD;
      concentrations of anti-proliferative drugs to the lesions in the artery involved in the PAD.&#xD;
      This offers the potential for sustained anti-restenotic efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized trials have shown superiority of Paclitaxel DCBs over just plain-balloon&#xD;
      angioplasty for treatment of PAD, and DCB is now considered the standard of care. However, a&#xD;
      recent meta-analyses which showed increased mortality at two years in patients treated with&#xD;
      paclitaxel DCBs have called into question the safety of paclitaxel based DCBs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative drugs for DCBs are therefore urgently needed and sirolimus offers an attractive&#xD;
      alternative. Compared to Paclitaxel, sirolimus is cytostatic in its mode of action with a&#xD;
      high margin of safety. It has a high transfer rate to the vessel wall and has been shown to&#xD;
      effectively inhibit neointimal hyperplasia in the porcine coronary model. In the coronary&#xD;
      artery interventions, preliminary clinical studies using Sirolimus DCBs have also shown&#xD;
      excellent procedural and 6 month patency.&#xD;
