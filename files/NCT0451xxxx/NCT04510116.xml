    <description>The AIM prevention program, modeled after an existing family-based skills-training intervention in a group format for rural African American preadolescents, consists of six consecutive weekly group meetings held at community facilities, with separate parent and youth skill-building curricula and a family curriculum. Each of the six meetings includes separate, concurrent training sessions for parents and youth, followed by a joint parent-youth session during which the families practice the skills they learned in their separate sessions. Concurrent and family sessions each last 1 hour. Thus, both parents and youth receive 12 hours of prevention training.</description>
