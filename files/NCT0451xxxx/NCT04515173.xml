      To improve the quality of mental health services, we will develop a robot that includes&#xD;
      disease screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. The effectiveness of robots will be&#xD;
      verified in a prospective, randomized, multi-center clinical trial. We assume that the robot&#xD;
      will reduce the differences in the experience of doctors of different years and will improve&#xD;
      mental health care across the country, and improve the uneven distribution of mental health&#xD;
      resources through remote resource sharing.&#xD;

      Anxiety disorder is the most common mental disorder in the world. The lifetime prevalence of&#xD;
      anxiety disorder in China is as high as 7.6%, but the treatment rate is less than 30%, and&#xD;
      the standard treatment rate is only 9.8%. The disease burden is heavy, and it is one of the&#xD;
      most serious public health problems in China. Anxiety disorder is a chronic relapsing&#xD;
      disease, single drug treatment only 35-50% efficient, psychological treatment as the most&#xD;
      international evidence-based foundation and anxiety disorder most commonly used treatment&#xD;
      method, can be a single treatment for anxiety disorders or improve the effect of the&#xD;
      medication, but because of clinical psychology in China started late, the lack of&#xD;
      professionals, unable to meet the huge demand for psychological treatment in our country,&#xD;
      therefore, how to develop efficient and standardized anxiety disorders psychotherapy pattern,&#xD;
      improve the psychological treatment of acquired, is the key to improve the clinical curative&#xD;
      effect of anxiety disorders. Based on the intelligent assisted psychotherapy system based on&#xD;
      cognitive behavior and mindfulness developed in the early stage, this research group&#xD;
      established the accurate psychotherapy artificial intelligence robot based on evaluation to&#xD;
      assist the whole process of standardized psychotherapy for anxiety disorders.&#xD;
