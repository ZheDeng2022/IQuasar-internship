    <textblock>
      When antihypertensive drugs or laser therapy can not reach the target intraocular pressure,&#xD;
      trabeculectomy (TRAB) is still the standard surgical method for glaucoma. The scarring of the&#xD;
      operative area is a common reason for the failure of trabeculectomy. After trabeculectomy,&#xD;
      maintaining the shape and function of the filtering bleb is an important aspect to maintain&#xD;
      the surgical effect. The increase in the number of blood vessels on the filtering bleb and&#xD;
      the morphological curvature are often the manifestations of decompensation of the filtering&#xD;
      bleb. Angiogenesis in the filtering bleb region plays an important role in surgical incision&#xD;
      healing and is related to the accompanying scar formation. Therefore, the evaluation of&#xD;
      vascular distribution of filtering blebs is an important index and early parameter to&#xD;
      evaluate the success or failure of surgery. With the improvement of detection methods, it is&#xD;
      possible to use AS-OCTA to evaluate the function and prognosis of filtering bleb after&#xD;
      trabeculectomy. Antimitotic drugs such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or mitomycin C (MMC) have&#xD;
      always been the most commonly used clinical drugs, but the side effects caused by their use&#xD;
      are not satisfactory. It is still the research direction of glaucoma to find new targets for&#xD;
      regulating wound healing and more safe and effective drugs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a group of optic nerve diseases characterized by progressive and irreversible&#xD;
      degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. Retinal ganglion cells, RGCs is a&#xD;
      kind of central nervous system neuron whose cell bodies are located in the retina and axons&#xD;
      make up the optic nerve. When antihypertensive drugs or laser therapy can not reach the&#xD;
      target intraocular pressure, trabeculectomy (TRAB) is still the standard surgical method for&#xD;
      glaucoma. The scarring of the operative area is a common reason for the failure of&#xD;
      trabeculectomy. After trabeculectomy, maintaining the shape and function of the filtering&#xD;
      bleb is an important aspect to maintain the surgical effect. The increase in the number of&#xD;
      blood vessels on the filtering bleb and the morphological curvature are often the&#xD;
      manifestations of decompensation of the filtering bleb. Angiogenesis in the filtering bleb&#xD;
      region plays an important role in surgical incision healing and is related to the&#xD;
