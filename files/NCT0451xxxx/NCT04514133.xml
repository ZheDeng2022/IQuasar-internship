  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to understand how participating or not participating in an&#xD;
      action civics curriculum may affect the health and wellbeing of young people. Participants&#xD;
      will be chosen from students who attend certain schools that choose to participate in the&#xD;
      action civics curriculum. Participation in this research involves completing surveys during&#xD;
      class time in the Spring and Fall 2021-2022 semesters and then completing online surveys&#xD;
      outside of class in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Equal access to civic resources, such as opportunities for civic engagement and connections&#xD;
      to one's community, are an important part of a culture of health. Meaningful experiences in&#xD;
      civic engagement and community connectedness are transformative for young people - especially&#xD;
      for youth from marginalized backgrounds, who often feel voiceless and excluded from&#xD;
      decision-making in civic and social institutions. Theories and correlational evidence point&#xD;
      to positive associations between civic engagement (e.g., volunteering, voting, and feelings&#xD;
      of civic empowerment) and better mental, physical, and behavioral health and wellbeing.&#xD;
      Meaningful civic engagement experiences may have an especially powerful effect on health and&#xD;
      wellbeing for those from traditionally marginalized backgrounds. However, causal pathways&#xD;
      between civic interventions, civic outcomes, and health and wellbeing outcomes among are not&#xD;
      firmly established. Further, how civic engagement and sense of community affect health and&#xD;
      wellbeing outcomes are unknown, and questions remain about for whom these effects may be&#xD;
      especially beneficial. In this study, we ask whether an established civic intervention called&#xD;
      Action Civics affects civic engagement and sense of community, and subsequently affects&#xD;
      health and wellbeing among youth. To build on these observational findings, the study team&#xD;
      will: (a) examine the causal links between youth civic engagement and sense of community and&#xD;
      health, and (b) test whether an established school-based, civic engagement intervention can&#xD;
      affect individual health and wellbeing and equity outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Students in this arm will take part in an Action Civics (AC) program. AC delivers action civics programming to young people from diverse backgrounds nationwide. AC offers a school-based action civics curriculum in which classes collectively choose a local issue, learn strategies and skills for taking civic action, develop an action plan, and take action on their selected local issue. Students, as a class, tackle topics ranging from health-related (e.g., health of school lunches) to safety-related (e.g. lack of crosswalks) to community social issues (e.g., community-police relations).</description>
