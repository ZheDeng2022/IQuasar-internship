      1. BACKGROUND &amp; RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
           Endoscopic resection is used frequently for the management of benign and early&#xD;
           neoplastic gastrointestinal (GI) lesions. Bleeding can occur during or after endoscopic&#xD;
           mucosal resection and may impact patient's morbidity and mortality. Following colorectal&#xD;
           endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), the delayed bleeding rate may range between 5 and 9%&#xD;
           [1, 2]. Several endoscopic hemostatic therapies based on coagulation, clipping or&#xD;
           adrenaline may be used to prevent or treat post-polypectomy bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adrenaline has a temporary effect, is associated with reduction of early&#xD;
           post-polypectomy bleeding but does not reduce the risk of delayed bleeding [3]. The use&#xD;
           of coagulation forceps may be associated with complications such as perforation [4] and&#xD;
           necrosis [5], and its role on the prevention of delayed bleeding is not established yet&#xD;
           [3]. Different hemoclips may be applied in this context. However, their use may be&#xD;
           technically difficult in some colonic areas and may be more difficult to deploy and to&#xD;
           remain in place for long periods in the left colon and rectum where the colonic wall is&#xD;
           thicker [6]. Clips are effective in complete closure of mucosal defects in only 57% of&#xD;
           cases [7] [6] and that has impact on the prevention of delayed bleeding. Most of the&#xD;
           studies evaluating theses different strategies are performed in high-volume centers with&#xD;
           high expertise on endoscopic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is a need for a safe, effective and friendly to use preventive hemostatic therapy,&#xD;
           that would be easier to deploy, irrespective of mucosal defect size, location and&#xD;
           endoscopist's expertise.&#xD;
&#xD;
           PuraStat is a synthetic self-assembling aqueous peptide that ionises rapidly to form a&#xD;
           network of nanofibers when it comes into contact with blood or ionic fluid. It is a&#xD;
           safe, non-biogenic, biocompatible, resorbable peptide hydrogel with no infection&#xD;
           transmission risk and is available in 1ml, 3ml and 5ml syringes. The syringe is&#xD;
           connected to a dedicated endoscopy catheter that is placed through the working channel&#xD;
           of the endoscope. It is CE marked and indicated for use for haemostasis in the following&#xD;
           situations encountered, during surgery, when haemostasis by ligation or standard means&#xD;
           is insufficient or impractical: bleeding from small blood vessels and oozing from&#xD;
           capillaries of the parenchyma of solid organs, oozing from vascular anastomoses,&#xD;
           bleeding from small blood vessels and oozing from capillaries of the GI tract following&#xD;
           surgical procedures. PuraStat is also indicated for the reduction of delayed bleeding&#xD;
           following gastrointestinal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) procedures in the&#xD;
           colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Studies have suggested that PuraStat may have a wide range of benefits, including&#xD;
           haemostasis and regeneration of soft tissues [8-18].&#xD;
&#xD;
           A 25-patient study in cardiovascular surgery with PuraStat showed that no postoperative&#xD;
           bleeding or adverse events [8]. Ohri et al.2018, published a 50 patient feasibility and&#xD;
           efficacy study in adult cardiac surgery, concluding PuraStat as easy-to-use and&#xD;
           effective haemostatic agent in a wide range of cardiac procedures [9]. In Addition&#xD;
           Ananda et al, 2017 undertook a 60 patient haemostatic efficacy and feasibility study in&#xD;
           ENT turbinate surgery with no nasal packing demonstrating in all patients there was no&#xD;
           post-operative re-bleeding observed and healing went well in absence of adhesion&#xD;
           formation[10] . A 12-patient GI pilot study assessed PuraStat's haemostatic efficacy&#xD;
           following endoscopic resection of gastric neoplasia was conducted and PuraStat was found&#xD;
           to be effective [15]. Pioche et al. in 2016 performed a study of PuraStat used&#xD;
           prophylactically following endoscopic resection in patients of high risk of delayed&#xD;
           bleeding, demonstrating a delayed bleeding rate of 6.2% [16]. Uraoka et al. demonstrated&#xD;
           the use of PuraStat for preventing delayed bleeding and enhancing gastric ulcer healing&#xD;
           following ESD with good effect [17]. Most recently in 2018 a study was published by&#xD;
           Bhandari et al. where PuraStat was used on 100 patients undergoing endoscopic resection&#xD;
           to assess safety, feasibility, haemostatic efficacy and delayed bleeding rates. This&#xD;
           study showed PuraStat to be effective at controlling bleeding and a delayed bleeding&#xD;
           rate of 3% [18].&#xD;
&#xD;
           PuraStat is a novel haemostatic agent with published haemostatic safety and efficacy&#xD;
           data in a number of surgical / interventional areas. However, there is limited trial and&#xD;
           observation data in relation to delayed bleeding following endoscopic resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators aim to evaluate PuraStat's clinical effectiveness, safety and&#xD;
           technical feasibility in the prevention of post colorectal EMR delayed bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AIMS &amp; OBJECTIVES&#xD;

           with low molecular weight heparin. Acenocumarol or warfarin will be discontinued 5 days&#xD;
           before the procedure. Bridging therapy with heparin will be used as recommended. Before&#xD;
           the procedure, an international normalized ratio (INR) &lt;1.5 will be confirmed in&#xD;
           patients who received anticoagulation therapy. NOACs will discontinued 48 to 72 hours&#xD;
           before EMR and restarted the day after EMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.SAMPLING This study aims to investigate the use, effectiveness, feasibility and safety of&#xD;
      PuraStat in reducing delayed bleeding following EMR in the colon. Delayed bleeding in the&#xD;
      colon following EMR is recorded as being between 5-9%. This is a feasibility study where the&#xD;
      investigators aim to include approximately 144 patients treated with PuraStat over a 12 month&#xD;
      period period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. STUDY PROCEDURES A dedicated Case report form (CRF) to capture data points will be&#xD;
      designed and made available to all participating centres. The CRF will contain all of the&#xD;
      data needed for the study but no patient identifiable details. All endoscopists participating&#xD;
      in the study will be trained in the use of PuraStat. Patients will be followed up for&#xD;
      evidence of [clinically relevant] delayed bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experienced senior endoscopists (&gt;100 successful EMRs each) will perform the procedures using&#xD;
      conventional or high definition white light endoscopes. The lesion size will be measured&#xD;
      either with open forceps or with the longitudinal edge of an open snare. Injection- assisted&#xD;
      EMR with lifting solution with indigo carmin/methylene blue will be performed according to&#xD;
      the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ERBE models (VIO-200, VIO-300 or VIO 3 will be used in the automatic controlled mode&#xD;
      (Endocut-Q, ERBE Electromedizin®, Tübingen, Germany) Coagulation of submucosal vessels by&#xD;
      means of snare tip coagulation, argon plasma coagulation or coagulation forceps will be&#xD;
      performed when the endoscopist considered it necessary. If bleeding occur during the&#xD;
      procedure (immediate bleeding), specific prophylactic measures on selective vessels will be&#xD;
      carried out and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1 Recruitment The investigators anticipate that all participating centers will recruit 144&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2 Screening and Enrolment Ideally, all patients meeting the inclusion criteria for the&#xD;
      study will be approached for inclusion to avoid potential bias. Patients will be provided&#xD;
      with information about the procedure in an appropriate time frame. Signed informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained prospectively from the patient for the use of their data for inclusion in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.3 Study Assessments A secure electronic database will be used for data entry. Post&#xD;
      colonoscopy assessment will be performed at 7 and 30 days by an external assessor by&#xD;
      telephone interview.&#xD;

&#xD;
      8. INTERVENTIONS 8.1 Description of Study Intervention / Treatment This is an interventional&#xD;
      study of PuraStat used prophylactically to reduce delayed bleeding following EMR in the colon&#xD;
      &lt;2cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PuraStat is supplied in a pre-filled syringe and is currently available in 1mL, 3mL and 5mL&#xD;
      syringes. It is delivered via a dedicated catheter passed through the working channel&#xD;
      (minimum 2.8mm diameter) of the endoscope. It is applied to in the mucosal defect under&#xD;
      direct visualisation at the end of the EMR procedure, ensuring to cover the entire resected&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY Where a complication occurs that has the characteristics of a&#xD;
      Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction, (i.e. related' - that is, it resulted from&#xD;
      administration of any of the research procedures; and 'unexpected' - that is, the type of&#xD;
      event is not listed in the manufacturers information as an expected occurrence, and is also&#xD;
      Serious - i.e. results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly or other&#xD;
      important medical event) sites will be asked to report this to the Chief Investigator and the&#xD;
      Chief Investigator will in turn report this information to the manufacturer directly. The&#xD;
      Chief Investigator will also assess whether the event should be reported to the local&#xD;
      Regulatory Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING 10.1 Data Collection Forms Data will be recorded onto a&#xD;
      dedicated CFR following the initial endoscopy where PuraStat was used. The anonymised data&#xD;
      form will then be entered onto a secure password protected electronic database with&#xD;
      appropriate backup systems and security protocols in place. No patient identifiable data will&#xD;
      be stored on the database. The data collection forms and electronic database will capture&#xD;
      information on data described above on points 9.3 A-C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.2 Data Management&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be inserted in a e-CRF/paper CRF along the different steps of the process:&#xD;
      previously and immediately after colonoscopy and during the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications will be externally assessed by phone call or during a clinic visit at 7 and 30&#xD;
      days after the procedure and after review of medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All serious adverse will be reported to and reviewed by a data safety monitoring board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will have an identification code number that will enable anonymized storing of&#xD;
      all data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be stored in an anonymized electronic password protected database that will be&#xD;
      assessed by the one member of the research group and one external assessor (in each&#xD;
      hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. DATA ANALYSIS Description of Analysis Populations&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be anonymized stored. An intention to treat analysis will be performed in all&#xD;
      included all patients. The per protocol analysis will include the cases in which complete&#xD;
      mucosal defect treatment with PuraStat is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12. ETHICS 12.1 Participant Confidentiality The study staff will ensure that the&#xD;
      participants' anonymity is maintained. The participants will be identified only participant's&#xD;
      code number on the CRF and any electronic database. All documents will be stored securely and&#xD;
      only accessible by study staff and authorized personnel. The study will comply with the Data&#xD;
      Protection Act which requires data to be anonymized as soon as it is practical to do so&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.2 Other Ethical Considerations This study will be carried out subject to approval by each&#xD;
      Institution research ethics committee. It will be carried out in accordance with the Medicine&#xD;
      for Human Use (Clinical Trial) regulations (2004), International Conference for Harmonisation&#xD;
      of Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) guidelines and World Association Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      (1964) and Scotland (2000) amendments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient confidentiality will be maintained throughout. No information will be disclosed or&#xD;
      reproduced through which patients could be identified. Should new relevant information arise&#xD;
      from other studies on PuraStat (e.g on safety or efficacy profile), the Sponsor will review&#xD;
      this and disseminate the information appropriately to study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.3 Declaration of Helsinki The study will be carried out in accordance with the Declaration&#xD;
      of Helsinki (1964) and Scotland (2000) amendments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      13. FINANCING AND INSURANCE The device has a CE mark and is covered by product liability&#xD;
      insurance from the company, the evidence of which can be provided upon request. There will be&#xD;
      no excess treatment costs associated with the study as the haemostatic device will be&#xD;
      provided free of charge for the purpose of the study by the manufacture, 3-D Matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14. RESOURCES, EQUIPMENT AND PHYSICAL FACILITIES&#xD;
&#xD;
