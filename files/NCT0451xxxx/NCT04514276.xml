  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the fetoneonatal pathway it is possible to identify pregnant women with an increased&#xD;
      risk of fetal growth restriction or pre-eclampsia in early stages (from 10th week of&#xD;
      pregnancy). Women whose pregnancy is considered high-risk receives risk-adapted prenatal&#xD;
      treatment as well as certain treatments for their newborn and infant until 1 year of age. The&#xD;
      tasks of all involved persons are defined by standard operating procedures (SOP)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By implementing a preventive feto-neonatal pathway, healthcare for pregnant women with high&#xD;
      risk of fetal growth restriction (FGR) or pre-eclampsia will be improved and, therefore the&#xD;
      occurence of children's health problems may be prevented.The pathway allows healthcare to be&#xD;
      structured, ross-sectoral, inter- and multidisciplinary in consideration of medical and&#xD;
      psychosocial imensions. The feto-neonatal pathway transfers scientific findings, which&#xD;
      already determine international routine care, in the project region into clinical routine&#xD;
      care. The anamnestically increased risk for FGR or pre-eclampsia is validated by ultrasound&#xD;
      and the identified high-risk pregnancy is attended risk-adapted from birth until the end of&#xD;
      the first year of life of the child.As a result, the mothers' pregnancy-related risks (death,&#xD;
      premature delivery, traumatic stress disorders) as well as risks for the child (prematurity&#xD;
      and associated problems, childhood growth restriction with the risk of metabolic syndrome,&#xD;
      developmental neurological problems) are reduced and the sustainability of the interventions&#xD;
      is ensured in the long term through improved health competence of the families. The&#xD;
      feto-neonatal pathway shows how highly specialised fetoneonatal care of high-risk pregnancies&#xD;
      can be ensured while ensuring primary care in a health region, and offers the possibility of&#xD;
      being extended to other indications.&#xD;
