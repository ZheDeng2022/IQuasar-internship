  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research program aims to comprehensively investigate the clinical, physiological,&#xD;
      metabolic, and molecular effects of reducing sedentary behavior in post-bariatric patients.&#xD;
      To this aim, we will conduct a crossover trial and a randomized controlled trial. The&#xD;
      crossover trial aims to unravel potential mechanisms underlying the metabolic, physiological&#xD;
      and molecular effects of breaking up sedentary time with light-intensity physical activity&#xD;
      versus carrying out the minimum amount of daily exercise at once and then remaining sedentary&#xD;
      versus simply remaining sedentary throughout all sessions, in a well-controlled laboratorial&#xD;
      condition. The 4-month parallel-group randomized controlled trials aim to investigate the&#xD;
      feasibility and efficacy of a newly developed personalized intervention focused on replacing&#xD;
      sedentary time with light- (or very light-) intensity physical activity in these patients. A&#xD;
      multitude of gold-standard techniques will be applied to evaluate the effects of the&#xD;
      intervention on several outcomes, including sedentary time (primary outcome), physical&#xD;
      activity levels, clinical parameters specific to each condition, cardiometabolic risk&#xD;
      factors, immune function, and health-related quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>A 4-month parallel-group randomised controlled trial will be performed, in which patients post-bariatric surgery will be assessed at baseline pre-surgery (PRE-BAR), 3 months after surgery and pre-intervention (PRE-INT) and 4 months after intervention (POST). Moreover, a sub-sample of patients will perform a randomised crossover trial at baseline (PRE). Patients will complete three experimental sessions in a random manner, as follows: Prolonged sitting (SIT), in which participants engaged in prolonged sitting throughout an 5-h period and were instructed to minimize excessive movement; Exercise followed by prolonged sitting (EX), in which participants performed a 30-min moderate-to-vigorous exercise bout on a treadmill, subsequently, participants engaged in prolonged sitting as described for SIT; Light-intensity breaks (BR), in which participants completed a 3-min bout of light-intensity walking every 30 min of sitting throughout the experimental period.</description>
