    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, dose-escalation, open-label clinical trial determining the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of adding Pitavastatin to Venetoclax in subjects with chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia (CLL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These are subjects who are newly diagnosed&#xD;
      subjects with AML who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy,&#xD;

             woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has&#xD;
             not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had&#xD;

         12. Patients with certain uncontrolled intercurrent illness are excluded. These include,&#xD;
             but are not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart&#xD;

             oral/enteral route of administration are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;

             recurrence, skin cancers that have been excised, or on prolonged adjuvant hormonal&#xD;
             therapy (ie, for breast or prostate cancer) but are otherwise considered in remission&#xD;
