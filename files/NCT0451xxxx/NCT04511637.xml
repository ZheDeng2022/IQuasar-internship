    <textblock>
      Researchers in this study wanted to compare the effect of the formulation (orally&#xD;
      disintegrating tablet and film-coated tablet) on the bioequivalence of drug Rivaroxaban&#xD;
      (brand name: Xarelto) at dose of 15 mg in Japanese healthy male subjects aged 20 to 40 years.&#xD;
      Rivaroxaban is an approved drug to be used for the prevention of events/diseases caused by&#xD;
      blood clots. Currently, there are two formulations of Rivaroxaban available on the market in&#xD;
      Japan and they are film-coated tablets and fine granules. To further improve patients'&#xD;
      convenience, a new formulation, orally disintegrating tablet (ODT, a drug dosage form&#xD;
      designed to be dissolved on the tongue rather than swallowed whole) is under development. The&#xD;
      goal of this study was to compare the effect of this new formulation with film-coated tablets&#xD;
      when taken with or without water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study received one oral dose of rivaroxaban 15 mg ODT either with or&#xD;
      without water and one oral dose of rivaroxaban 15 mg film-tablet. There were at least 5 days&#xD;
      between the two doses. Observation for each participant lasted about 6 weeks in total. Blood&#xD;
      samples were collected from the participants to measure the blood level of the study drug.&#xD;
