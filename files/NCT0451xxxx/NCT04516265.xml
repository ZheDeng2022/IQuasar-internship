      The aim of our study is to compare the effects of NGT-based trunk training, video-based trunk&#xD;
      training and video-based trunk training applied with Theratogs in children with hemiparetic&#xD;
      type Cerebral Palsy. It is planned to include 45 patients with hemiparetic cerebral palsy&#xD;
      between the ages of 5-15 and with Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level&#xD;
      I-III. Patients with cerebral palsy will be divided into 3 groups in a randomized controlled&#xD;
      manner. Each group will continue and follow routine physiotherapy and rehabilitation&#xD;
      treatments for 8 weeks. Then, structured trunk training will begin. NGT-based trunk training&#xD;
      (45 minutes) to the first group, video-based trunk training (45 minutes) to the second group,&#xD;
      and Video-based trunk training (45 minutes) will apply with Theratogs to the third group.&#xD;
      Treatments will be applied two days a week for 8 weeks.&#xD;
