    <textblock>
      Investigating people with bowel symptoms uses a test that detects traces of blood in the&#xD;
      stools, the FIT test. There are many possible reasons for positive tests. A few people have&#xD;
      cancer. However, most participants with symptoms don't have any serious bowel disease but&#xD;
      have benign problems such as piles or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is very difficult to&#xD;
      diagnose on symptoms alone, those participants who have serious bowel disease and those who&#xD;
      do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a positive test, people are invited for colonoscopy - a sort of articulated tube that&#xD;
      is passed up the bowel. Most people invited for colonoscopy don't have cancer. Only about 5%&#xD;
      of those with positive FIT tests have cancer. About 25% have other bowel diseases, but most&#xD;
      have nothing serious wrong at all. So they have the inconvenience and discomfort of&#xD;
      colonoscopy but don't get any benefit from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to try adding another test, the volatile organic compound (VOC) test,&#xD;
      to see if the investigators can separate those with positive FIT tests who do have something&#xD;
      wrong, from those who don't. The VOC test uses a urine sample. Using both tests might also be&#xD;
      better for detecting cancer. FIT alone misses about 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So the investigators think that using both tests might not only be better for detecting&#xD;
      cancer, but also might mean that a lot of people will avoid having to have colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit 1,819 participants with bowel symptoms from NHS trusts in the UK.&#xD;
      They will provide stool samples for FIT and urine for VOC analysis. They will have&#xD;
      colonoscopy to get a definite diagnosis. Then the investigators will look at their FIT and&#xD;
      VOC test results to see if in future, people with both tests negative.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently disparity between demand and available resources for colonoscopy. At&#xD;
      present around 300,000 participants (and rising) are being referred annually to NHS trusts&#xD;
      suspected of colorectal cancer (CRC). These participants are offered invasive colonic&#xD;
      examinations (colonoscopy or CT colonography) but only 30% will have significant bowel&#xD;
      disease. Significant bowel disease includes neoplasia (cancer and benign tumours) and&#xD;
      significant treatable benign conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and microscopic&#xD;
      colitis. Of the remaining 70%, 40% have completely normal colonic investigations and 30% have&#xD;
      functional bowel conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome or diverticular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Set against this there is and will remain for the foreseeable future a capacity shortfall for&#xD;
      colonoscopy. This limits the ability of the NHS to extend colorectal cancer detection within&#xD;
      the Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP) or to target those participants that present for&#xD;
      the first time through the Emergency Department (25% of all colorectal cancer diagnoses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increasing demand, limited capacity and lack of a triage tests have left NHS trusts with&#xD;
      a conundrum of how best to stratify those with symptoms and at risk of SBD including CRC. The&#xD;
      National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended a stool test (faecal&#xD;
      immunochemical testing for haemoglobin, known as FIT) in the assessment of those suspected of&#xD;
      CRC. NICE have recommended 10 μgHb/g faeces as the cut off for investigation of people with&#xD;
      low risk symptoms who, account for only 10% of those referred with suspected CRC. When&#xD;
      applied to high risk symptom groups, FIT will miss a significant number of participants with&#xD;
      CRC (~10%) if used on its own at the threshold recommended by NICE (10 μgHb/g faeces). FIT&#xD;
      will also miss a large number of significant potentially pre-cancerous polyps (~40%). Early&#xD;
      detection and removal of such polyps will reduce risk of CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP) has set a FIT cut off of &gt;120 μgHb/g faeces,&#xD;
      compared to the NICE threshold of 10 μgHb/g faeces, but even at the lower threshold&#xD;
      recommended by NICE some SBDs will be missed. Whilst a lower threshold might improve&#xD;
      detection of SBD, it will increase the number of colonoscopies that find no abnormality.&#xD;
      Consequently, the investigators have been investigating a urine test (in addition to FIT) to&#xD;
      improve detection of participants with SBD with a view to reducing unnecessary colonoscopies.&#xD;
      The urine test analyses volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that originate from the body and&#xD;
      provides a chemical 'fingerprint' that is disease specific. Stool FIT and urine VOCs identify&#xD;
      different biological characteristics of SBD - haemoglobin (as a marker of excess blood loss)&#xD;
      versus metabolic response to inflammation. In a preliminary study of 562 participants, stool&#xD;
      FIT on its own (at a threshold determined from the data) detected 80% of those with&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. However, the addition of urine chemical testing improved this to 97%. The&#xD;
      number of CRC cases missed by combined FIT and urine chemical testing is similar to that of&#xD;
      colonoscopy, the current gold standard.&#xD;
