  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this trial is to find out whether taking semaglutide tablets at different times&#xD;
      before and after eating has a similar effect compared to the recommended dosing time.&#xD;
      Participants with type 2 diabetes are recommended to take semaglutide on an empty stomach,&#xD;
      and they should not eat, drink, or take any oral medicine for at least 30 minutes after that.&#xD;
      The trial will look at how different dosing times of semaglutide before and after eating a&#xD;
      meal changes how much semaglutide participants get into their blood. Participants will get&#xD;
      one semaglutide tablet daily for a total of 10 days. For the first 5 days participants will&#xD;
      receive semaglutide tablets of 3 mg and for the next 5 days, participants will receive&#xD;
      semaglutide tablets of 7 mg. From here onwards, semaglutide tablets will be referred to as&#xD;
      the 'trial medicine', unless specifically mentioned. Participants will get the trial medicine&#xD;
      (3 mg and 7 mg) under one of the 5 following dosing conditions. It will be decided by chance&#xD;
      under which dosing condition participants will receive the trial medicine: A 2 hour fast&#xD;
      before taking the trial medicine and 30 minutes fast after taking the trial medicine (Test&#xD;
      arm A), A 4 hour fast before taking the trial medicine and 30 minutes fast after taking the&#xD;
      trial medicine (Test arm B), A 6 hour fast before taking the trial medicine and 30 minutes&#xD;
      fast after taking the trial medicine (Test arm C), A 2 hour fast before taking the trial&#xD;
      medicine and an overnight fast (at least 6 hours fast) after taking the trial medicine (Test&#xD;
      arm D), An overnight fast before taking the trial medicine and 30 minutes fast after taking&#xD;
      the trial medicine (Reference arm E). Before each fasting period prior to receiving the trial&#xD;
      medicine, participants will fast for 4 hours and then receive a standardised meal. The meal&#xD;
      should be completed before the 2, 4 or 6 hours fasting is started. The trial will last for&#xD;
      about 48 to 78 days (about 1.5 to 2.5 months). Participants will have 4 scheduled visits with&#xD;
      the study doctor. At one of the visits, participants will be admitted to the trial unit and&#xD;
      have to stay for 12 consecutive days. At all visits participants will meet with trial staff&#xD;
      and will have blood tests along with other clinical checks and tests. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked about their health, medical history, and habits. Women only: Women cannot take part if&#xD;
      pregnant, breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant during the trial period.&#xD;
