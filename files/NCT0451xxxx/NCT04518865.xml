  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was directed to compare the treatment outcomes of subjects with Class II&#xD;
      malocclusion who were treated with Herbst appliance before and after puberty.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-six Class II patients were randomly selected and divided into two groups based on&#xD;
      their stage of skeletal maturation: pre-pubertal group (18 patients, mean age 9.15± 1.5&#xD;
      years) and post-pubertal group (18 patients, mean age 16.3 ± 1.0 years). All patients were&#xD;
      treated with metallic splint supported Herbst IV appliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pretreatment and post-Herbst IV treatment cone beam CT(CBCT) scans were obtained for both&#xD;
      groups. Dentoskeletal and TMJ measurements made on the CBCT scans were analysed.&#xD;

    <description>The DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files from the pre and post CBCT scans were imported to Mimics software (Version 10.1, Materialise NV, Leuven, Belgium); and the cephalometric landmarks and planes were defined . Linear sagittal measurements of point A, point B, glenoid fossa, upper incisor, lower incisor, upper molars, and lower molars were recorded in relation to orbital perpendicular plane.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Condylar head position</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Most middle-superior point of the mandibular condyle was determined in sagittal, axial and coronal views. In the sagittal slice of the middle condylar head, a line was drowned through the widest measurement of the condylar heads visible on the slice, from this line, three lines were raised crossing the glenoid fossa at 45°, 90°, and 135° . Four linear measurements representing the anterosuperior, superior, posterosuperior, and posterior distance were taken from the glenoid fossa wall to the surface of the condyle</description>
