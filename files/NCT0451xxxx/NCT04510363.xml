  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prediction of the neurological outcome in resuscitated post-cardiac arrest patients is&#xD;
      important to tailor appropriate management plans. Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) had been&#xD;
      proved to be associated with increased intracranial pressure and can be used as one of the&#xD;
      prognostic factors in cardiac arrest patients. It is simple, quick and can be measured&#xD;
      repeatedly. Carotid duplex and transcranial duplex(TCD) provide rapid, noninvasive, real-time&#xD;
      measures of cerebrovascular function. It can be used to assess the vascular territory by&#xD;
      measuring blood flow, and to evaluate factors include brain perfusion, plaque morphology, and&#xD;
      patency of intracranial collaterals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, it could act as a crucial role in neuroprognosis in post-arrest patients. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigator aimed to analyze the ONSD diameters, carotid duplex and transcaranial&#xD;
      duplex parameters in different stages of post-cardiac arrest care, demographic&#xD;
      characteristics and resuscitation information with the neurological outcome of post-cardiac&#xD;
      arrest patients.&#xD;

      Prediction of the neurological outcome in resuscitated post-cardiac arrest patients is&#xD;
      important to tailor appropriate management plans. Brain imaging, electrophysiological&#xD;
      evaluations, biomarkers all take part in neuroprognosis in cardiac arrest patients, however,&#xD;
      these modalities are more expensive or not suitable to repeat in a short time. Optic nerve&#xD;
      sheath diameter (ONSD) had been proved to be associated with increased intracranial pressure2&#xD;
      and can be used as one of the prognostic factors in cardiac arrest patients. It is simple,&#xD;
      quick and can be measured repeatedly. Carotid duplex and transcranial duplex(TCD) provide&#xD;
      rapid, noninvasive, real-time measures of cerebrovascular function. It can be used to assess&#xD;
      the vascular territory by measuring blood flow, and to evaluate factors include brain&#xD;
