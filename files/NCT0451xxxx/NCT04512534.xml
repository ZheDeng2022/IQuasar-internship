  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, single-arm, phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Anti-PD-1 antibody(Sintilimab) plus HDAC inhibitor(Chidamide) in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (r/r PTCL).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral T-cell lymphoma accounts for 12-15% of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in western&#xD;
      countries, however, this number is up to 35% or more in some Asian countries, including&#xD;
      China. According to the 2016 World Health Organization annual classification, there are 29&#xD;
      subtypes of peripheral T cell lymphoma, among which the most common types are peripheral T&#xD;
      cell lymphoma non-specific type (PTCL-NOS), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and&#xD;
      anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). For r/r PTCL, the prognosis was poor with objective&#xD;
      response rate range from 8-50% and median progression free survival（PFS）range from 3.2-5&#xD;
      months for chemotherapy. Thus, the treatment of this patient population remained clinically&#xD;
      unmet need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will be conducted under Simon's optimal two-stage design. The first stage&#xD;
      needs 15 participants, if ≥5 participants acquire remission, the study will move on to the&#xD;
      second stage and enroll another 36 patients to achieve a total number of 51 participants&#xD;
      enrolled. Drop rate is assumed to be 10%, to insure 47 participants involving the efficacy&#xD;
      evaluation statistically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive anti-PD-1 antibody plus HDAC inhibitor every three weeks for a&#xD;
      cycle, until disease progression or severe/ intolerant toxicity, the maximum treatment period&#xD;
      is 2 years.&#xD;

    <description>Patients receive anti-PD-1 antibody Sintilimab+ HDAC inhibitor Chidamide three weeks for a cycle, detailed as follows:&#xD;
Anti-PD-1 antibody (Sintilimab): Fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks, intravenous drip (without pretreatment), infusion time: 30 minutes (no less than 20 mins, no more than 60 mins), the maximum treatment period is 2 years (up to 35 doses), complete remission（CR）patients confirmed by imaging assessment can be considered off anti-PD-1 treatment after 12 treatment cycles.&#xD;
Chidamide: Chidamide is administered orally at a dose of 30mg (initial dose). It is recommended to be administered within 0.5h after a meal with a fixed time. Chidamide will be given until disease progression or intolerant toxicity. The maximum treatment is 2 years. If chidamide therapy requires to be continued over 2 years due to clinical benefit, the prescription/decision should be made after discussion with the principal investigator.</description>
