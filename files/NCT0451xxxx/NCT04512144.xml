  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with endometrial cancer who will be undergoing surgery or patients with cervical&#xD;
      cancer who will be treated with chemoradiation will be randomized to utilize the Headspace&#xD;
      smartphone application or not prior to their anticipated treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A diagnosis of cancer can be a major stress-inducing event. The prevalence of depression in&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with cancer is estimated up to 16%. Practicing mindfulness is a&#xD;
      cost-effective treatment which can also help manage treatment adverse effects and&#xD;
      cancer-related symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even short exposure and practice of mindfulness exercises have demonstrated improved&#xD;
      subjective and objective measurements of stress and anxiety with breast biopsies. Patients&#xD;
      with breast cancer also have improved quality of life with mindfulness training. Self-guided&#xD;
      mindfulness with smartphone applications, specifically the app Headspace, has been associated&#xD;
      with positive benefits and ease of use in the general population and among cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient's inherent level of baseline mindfulness has been associated with lower pain scores&#xD;
      following minimally invasive hysterectomy. This study did not specifically encourage practice&#xD;
      of mindfulness exercises. Our own study of post-operative opiate usage in women following&#xD;
      minimally invasive hysterectomy contains self-reported data of women using opiates to relax&#xD;
      or help sleep. This suggests that mindfulness exercises may improve quality of life in these&#xD;
      areas and thus reduce opiate usage. Patients undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy for&#xD;
      treatment of endometrial cancer were specifically chosen as a study cohort to build on our&#xD;
      own data and that currently reported in the literature as well as the highest incidence of&#xD;
      this cancer as a gynecologic malignancy. The second study cohort chosen was women with&#xD;
      cervical cancer undergoing definitive treatment with chemo-sensitizing radiation given the&#xD;
      significant endeavor required for complete treatment. Additionally, these women are often&#xD;
      younger with the diagnosis of cervical cancer often being their first major medical&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
