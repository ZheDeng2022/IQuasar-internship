  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The poverty rate among children under 18 years old in Hong Kong in 2015 was 18% after social&#xD;
      welfare intervention. James Heckman, a Nobel Prize winner in Economics, advocates early&#xD;
      childhood investment to enhance social mobility, given its lifelong impact of on child&#xD;
      development. However, few randomized control trails have been used to examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of early childhood intervention in promoting social mobility through child&#xD;
      development in Hong Kong. To fill these gaps, we propose an interdisciplinary intervention&#xD;
      study involving academics from economics, sociology, social work, gerontology, education, and&#xD;
      psychology to investigate methods to promote the social mobility of children living in&#xD;
      poverty through early intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective is to enhance the developmental outcomes of children in poverty by&#xD;
      utilizing parental resources within a family system, technological resources available in&#xD;
      modern metropolis and the human resources enjoyed by the elderly in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate an internet- and family-based intervention to promote&#xD;
      the development of children in poverty aged 24 months to three years. The examined outcome&#xD;
      will be the developmental well-being of participating children, with the long-term goal of&#xD;
      promoting their social mobility to break the cycle of poverty. In the long run, we aim to&#xD;
      establish the proposed intervention in policy to promote the development of disadvantaged&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to identify intergenerational volunteerism as a means for&#xD;
      productive aging through a mentoring program using older adults as mentors to participating&#xD;
      parents.&#xD;

      The proposed research consists of three phases. The first phase will be a cross-sectional&#xD;
      survey with a sample of 1,000 cases from 60 nurseries cum kindergartens to explore the family&#xD;
      demographics and developmental profiles of low-income children in comparison to others. The&#xD;
      second phase will be a randomized control trail implementing a 24-month internet-based&#xD;
      intervention with 200 toddler-parents dyads from 20 to 30 of the original 60 nurseries.&#xD;
      Interventions will be delivered by older mentors professionally trained by the research team.&#xD;
      All children, parents and elderly mentors will be evaluated through a set of outcome&#xD;
      measurements to assess the effectiveness of the program. The last phase will involve the&#xD;
      dissemination of research information that may become building blocks for policies on&#xD;
      internet-based early childhood education, poverty alleviation and social mobility&#xD;
      enhancement, as well as productive aging.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Large-scale survey: Using the stratified sampling method, a randomized list of 60 samples was selected from the official list of 506 kindergartens-cum-child care center provided by the Bureau of Education. Out of the 60 schools, a total of 40 schools from 12 NGOs agreed to join the survey. As of April 2019, we have received 700 responses for the survey.&#xD;
Intervention Study: There are two phases of intervention in this stage. The total sample size for both phases is 200 parent-child dyads. For both phases, the team applied stratified randomization method for randomization. Participants were assigned to either treatment group or wait-list control group on a school basis.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The psychologist and our advisory team had successfully developed a total of 100 hours of parenting curriculum.&#xD;
The adopted curriculum had focused on using play to facilitate parents in promoting their children's development in cognitive, motor, emotional and social aspects. Play-based activities are instrumental in improving children's development. Given that parents in poverty had difficulties spending time and money travelling back-and-forth to the training site and their homes, the research team decided to use e-learning as the medium of learning for our parenting programme. Web-based learning has the advantage of cutting time and travelling costs, which are luxuries to many parents in poverty.</description>
