  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the technique of choice for evaluation of patients with positive fecal occult&#xD;
      blood (FIT). Identification of polyps and their removal has been shown to decrease colorectal&#xD;
      cancer incidence rates and mortality. Many endoscopic imaging technologies and devices have&#xD;
      been developed to increase adenoma detection (ADR) during screening colonoscopies. They vary&#xD;
      in the way they work, and some of the technologies are costly and not widely available.&#xD;
      Studies has shown the simple to use pan-colonic chromoendoscopy can improve ADR compared to&#xD;
      standard colonoscopy. However, there is little evidence on the utility of pan-colonic&#xD;
      chromoendoscopy in asymptomatic individuals undergoing colonoscopy after a positive FIT test.&#xD;
      In this randomized study, the investigators aim to compare the utility of chromoendoscopy and&#xD;
      high-definition white-light endoscopy in asymptomatic individuals undergoing colonoscopy&#xD;
      after a positive FIT test&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects with positive screening FIT test referred to the Department of&#xD;
      Gastroenterology, Singapore General Hospital will be approached and recruited. The included&#xD;
      patients will be randomised to either a) Group A- Chromoendoscopy or b) Group B- high&#xD;
      definition white light based evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that application of non-absorbable dye during colonoscopy would&#xD;
      enhance the mucosal contrast, delineate the border and surface patterns by accumulating in&#xD;
      the innominate grooves and, thereby, enhance the detection of adenoma during colonoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pan-colonic chromoendoscopy and high-definition white light endoscopy will be performed by&#xD;
      five experienced endoscopist, and hospital sedation guidelines will be followed. The&#xD;
      colonoscopy will be performed using Olympus (CF-HQ190) or Fujifilm (EC-590) colonoscopies.&#xD;
      Indigo carmine dye will be used for pan-colonic chromoendoscopy. Two ampules of Indigo&#xD;
      carmine (0.8%, 5ml/ampule) will be dissolved in 250 ml of water and sprayed through the&#xD;
      waterjet channel by using the auxiliary foot pump upon reaching the caecum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The colonoscopy insertion will be performed using high-definition white light, and the scope&#xD;
      will be advanced till the caecum. The quality of the bowel preparation will be rated&#xD;
      according to the validated Boston bowel preparation score. Participants with inadequate bowel&#xD;
      preparation score (Score &lt;6) will be excluded from the study. The fecal residue will be&#xD;
      washed, suctioned and cleared during insertion to improve visibility. No special care will be&#xD;
      taken to look for lesions during the insertion. Assessment for colonic lesions will only be&#xD;
      performed during withdrawal of the endoscope. The minimum withdrawal time was set at 7&#xD;
      minutes. Randomization: Once the caecum is intubated and if the bowel preparation is&#xD;
      adequate, the participants will be randomized to pan-colonic chromoendoscopy based withdrawal&#xD;
      or high-definition while light based withdrawal. In the pan-colonic chromoendoscopy group,&#xD;
      the indigo carmine was sprayed by pressing the auxiliary foot pump, and dye was delivered&#xD;
      systematically to coat the entire colonic mucosa. In both, the groups, the lesion size,&#xD;
      number, location, morphology will be documented during withdrawal. The investigators&#xD;
      characterized the morphology of the lesion according to the established Paris classification.&#xD;
      The investigators characterized the lesion as flat neoplasm if the lesion project &lt;2.5mm or&#xD;
      polypoid lesion if lesion project &gt;2.5mm into the lumen. The investigators measured the size&#xD;
      of the lesions using an open biopsy forceps when needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both the groups, the identified polyps will be removed using the standard techniques, and&#xD;
      the tissue will be placed in separate formalin bottles and sent for histology assessment. The&#xD;
      histology of the polyps was assessed by dedicated pathologist trained in gastrointestinal&#xD;
      pathology. Both the endoscopists and the pathologist will not be blinded to the study&#xD;
      technique. The investigators defined advanced adenoma as any adenoma &gt;10 mm in size or with&#xD;
      &gt;25% villous histology or high-grade dysplasia. The investigators classified hyperplastic&#xD;
      polyps and sessile serrated polyps (SSA) as serrated lesions, The investigators excluded&#xD;
      hyperplastic lesions in the rectum from the analysis as such lesions are frequently&#xD;
      encountered in the rectum&#xD;
