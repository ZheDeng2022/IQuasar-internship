  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the third most common cancer in male and female worldwide. In&#xD;
      India, it is the fourth most common cause of cancer in males and third most common cancer in&#xD;
      female. Age, smoking, colonic adenomatous polyp, family history are traditional risk factor&#xD;
      for CRC. The vast majority of CRC results from malignant transformation from adenoma, which&#xD;
      is called as adenoma carcinoma sequence. These adenomatous polyps grows slowly over many&#xD;
      years and malignant transformation eventually occurs over 10 years. So, the early detection&#xD;
      and removal of polyp at early stage should benefit in preventing CRC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The third most common cancer in both male and female is colorectal carcinoma (CRC) worldwide.&#xD;
      In India, it is the fourth most common cause of cancer in males and third most common cancer&#xD;
      in females. The age - standardized rates of CRC in India have been estimated to be 4.2 and&#xD;
      3.2/100000 for males and females, respectively. Age, smoking and colonic adenoma along with&#xD;
      family history is considered as traditional risk factors for CRC. The US National Polyp study&#xD;
      demonstrated that colonoscopy and polypectomy could prevent 76% to 90% of colorectal cancers.&#xD;
      The vast majority of CRC result from malignant transformation from adenomas. This is called&#xD;
      adenoma - carcinoma sequence, these adenomatous polyps grows slowly over many years and&#xD;
      malignant transformation eventually occurs. The time span for this transformation is on an&#xD;
      average 10 years. So, the detection and removal of polyp at early stage on adenoma -&#xD;
      carcinoma sequence should benefit in preventing CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of adenoma, utilization of colonoscopy for its detection and subsequent&#xD;
      reduction in CRC has been well studied and established in western population. This has led to&#xD;
      formulation of national screening colonoscopy programs elsewhere. However, data from Indian&#xD;
      subcontinent is scanty. In current study, at a large tertiary care center, we aimed to study&#xD;
      prevalence of colonic polyps and adenoma who are undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy using high&#xD;
      definition colonoscopy and characterizing with Narrow Band Imaging and to find associated&#xD;
      demographic, social, personal and family related risk factors in patients with adenomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, single center, observational study. All subjects referred for&#xD;
      diagnostic colonoscopy will be prospectively enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects referred for the diagnostic colonoscopy will be enrolled. A member of the&#xD;
      research team will approach each subject to discuss participation in the study, including&#xD;
      background of the proposed study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, benefits and risks of the&#xD;
      procedures and follow-up. If this is of interest to the subject, the informed consent form is&#xD;
      discussed and presented. The subject must sign the consent form prior to enrollment. This&#xD;
      form will have prior approval of the study site's Institutional Review Board (IRB). Failure&#xD;
      to obtain informed consent renders the subject ineligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study equipment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscope:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olympus HDWL colonoscope will be used to perform colonoscopies. Technical specifications&#xD;
      include outer diameter 13.2 mm, instrument channel diameter 3.7 mm, air-water suction&#xD;
      channels, field of view 170 degrees, 4-way angulations (180 degrees up and 180 degrees down,&#xD;
      160 degrees right and left), working length, 168 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy procedure and definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients, either moderate sedation with intravenous midazolam or conscious sedation&#xD;
      with intravenous propofol will be administered in a standard fashion prior to undergoing&#xD;
      colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The colonoscope will be inserted and cecum will be intubated. Photo documentation of the&#xD;
      cecum will be performed. The colonic mucosa will be carefully visualized upon withdrawal of&#xD;
      the colonoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time from the point of insertion of the colonoscope into the rectum to the intubation of&#xD;
      cecum will be recorded with a stop watch by a research coordinator and will be documented as&#xD;
      the &quot;insertion time&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time spent in inspecting the mucosa during withdrawal of the colonoscope will be&#xD;
      documented as the &quot;withdrawal time&quot;. During withdrawal of the colonoscope the stop watch will&#xD;
      be stopped whenever mucosa is being cleaned, fluid/solid debris is suctioned or a polyp is&#xD;
      being removed to ensure that the withdrawal time is the actual representation of the mucosal&#xD;
      inspection time. Meticulous technique will be employed during the withdrawal phase with&#xD;
      special efforts to visualize portions of colonic mucosa on the proximal aspects of haustral&#xD;
      folds, flexures and valves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All polyps detected will be documented: size, location, and morphology (using the Paris&#xD;
      classification - Appendix A and Narrow Band Imaging classification - NICE and JNET). Photo&#xD;
      documentation of the polyps will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polyps will then be removed with a biopsy forceps or snare and sent for histopathological&#xD;
      evaluation, each in a separate jar and labeled accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bowel preparation will be evaluated and graded according to previously reported criteria&#xD;
      using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale. Complications including post colonoscopy pain,&#xD;
      perforation or gastrointestinal bleeding (requiring intervention) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary investigator at each site will monitor any adverse events reported to the study&#xD;
      staff and determine if it's related to the study procedures including standard colonoscopy at&#xD;
      the respective site. All adverse events will be monitored until a satisfactory resolution and&#xD;
      will be reported to the local IRB within 5 days of knowledge. A table will be maintained for&#xD;
      the adverse events in each arm and in case of any statistically significant adverse even rate&#xD;
      in any arm, the primary investigator will make the decision to remove the treatment arm or&#xD;
      stop the study. Because the risks of this proposed study are low, this program will not&#xD;
      require a Data Safety and Monitoring Board. Instead, the Principal Investigator and clinical&#xD;
      Site Investigators performing the endoscopies will be responsible for implementing a detailed&#xD;
      Data and Safety Monitoring plan in compliance with the IRB guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data integrity and safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All paper charts pertaining to the patient will be kept under lock and key in coordinators&#xD;
      office away from the endoscopy area. The data will be entered in to a data base weekly after&#xD;
      collection of histology reports. The data is password protected and stored on the AIG&#xD;
      internal server where it will remain throughout the study. Computers and/or files will be&#xD;
      password-protected. Only approved personnel by the IRB will have access to the file storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To protect subject confidentiality, each subject will be assigned a case study number. The&#xD;
      subject's name is not to appear anywhere on the Case Report Forms (CRF's) or supporting&#xD;
      documentation. A study log with the identifiable information will be kept in a separate&#xD;
      folder to enable the investigators to assist in any research audit. No procedural data except&#xD;
      the date of examination will be entered in to this log.&#xD;
