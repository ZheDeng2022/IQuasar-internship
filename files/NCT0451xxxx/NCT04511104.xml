      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postburn changes in whole-body, glucose and protein metabolism are at their peak during the&#xD;
      acute phase of severe burns. The resulting metabolic derangements lead to substantial muscle&#xD;
      wasting, insulin resistance, which ultimately hampers full recovery and reintegration into&#xD;
      society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This quasi-experimental trial was initiated to investigate the effects of exercise-based&#xD;
      rehabilitation on muscle wasting, insulin resistance, and quality of life during the acute&#xD;
      phase of severe adult burns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moderate to severely burned adults (10-80%TBSA) will be recruited from two Belgian burn&#xD;
      centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects allocated to the intervention group will undergo an up to 8-week-long exercise&#xD;
      program in addition to standard care rehabilitation. As part of the exercise program,&#xD;
      participants will carry out progressive resistance and aerobic training, initiated as soon as&#xD;
      medical safety and patient cooperation allow. Exercise type and dosage will be chosen&#xD;
      according to patient status in terms of grafts, mobility, and strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive standard care rehabilitation only, including passive,&#xD;
      assisted, active range of motion exercise, functional exercise, and scar treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect on muscle wasting will be determined by B-mode ultrasound-derived measures of&#xD;
      quadriceps muscle layer thickness (QMLT) and rectus femoris cross sectional area, as well as&#xD;
      peak force measurements by handheld dynamometry. Insulin resistance will be derived from the&#xD;
      HOMA-2 index based on fasting plasma glucose and insulin. Quality of life will be determined&#xD;
      by the EQ-5D-5L and Burn Specific Health Scale-Brief (BSHS-B) questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this clinical research will provide insight into the effects of exercise on&#xD;
      both a fundamental and clinical spectrum.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The added exercise intervention is initiated in line with the following readiness criteria,&#xD;
      which will be checked prior to each training session:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean arterial pressure (MAP) 60 - 110 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) &lt;60%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Partial pressure of oxygen / fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) &gt;200&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory rate &lt;40 bpm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) &lt;10 cmH2O&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No high inotropic doses (Dopamine &gt;10 mcg/kg/min or Nor/adrenaline &lt;0,1 mcg/kg/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temp. 36 - 38,5°C&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) -2 - +2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical Doctor clearance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical research council (MRC) score lower limbs ≥3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the post burn starting time differs per enrolled subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercises are administered as in-bed exercises or out-of-bed exercises, depending on whether&#xD;
      subjects are able and allowed to engage in out-of-bed mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal exercise intensity for resistance training is set at 60% peak force based on a weekly&#xD;
      peak force measurement by hand-held dynamometry, or on a 3 RM in case of out of bed&#xD;
      exercises. Goal aerobic exercise intensity is set at 50-75% peak Watts determined by a weekly&#xD;
      cycle ergometer or treadmill ramp protocol.&#xD;
