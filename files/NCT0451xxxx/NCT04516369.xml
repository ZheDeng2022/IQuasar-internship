    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide safety and efficacy data for voretigene neparvovec,&#xD;
      administered as subretinal injection, in Japanese patients with biallelic RPE65&#xD;
      mutation-associated retinal dystrophy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bilateral&#xD;
      subretinal administration of voretigene neparvovec in Japanese patients with biallelic RPE65&#xD;
      mutation-associated retinal dystrophy. Assessments will include full-field light sensitivity&#xD;
      threshold testing, visual fields, visual acuity, vector shedding, immunogenicity and adverse&#xD;
      events. Participants will be monitored for 5 years after treatment.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Japanese participants with biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy;&#xD;
             molecular diagnosis of RPE65 mutation must be confirmed by a Novartis designated&#xD;
             laboratory in Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age four years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Visual acuity worse than 20/60 (both eyes) and/or visual field less than 20 degrees in&#xD;
             any meridian as measured by a III4e isopter or equivalent (both eyes).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sufficient viable retinal cells as determined by non-invasive means, such as optical&#xD;
             coherence tomography (OCT) and/ or ophthalmoscopy. Must have either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  An area of retina within the posterior pole of &gt; 100 µm thickness shown on OCT,&#xD;
                  or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ≥ 3 disc areas of retina without atrophy or pigmentary degeneration within the&#xD;
                  posterior pole, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Remaining visual field within 30 degrees of fixation as measured by a III4e&#xD;
                  isopter or equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior participation in a study in which a gene therapy vector was administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in a clinical study with an investigational drug in the past 6 months&#xD;
             from screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the study treatments including excipients or to&#xD;
             medications planned for use in the peri-operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to reliably perform the FST assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of retinoid compounds or precursors that could potentially interact with the&#xD;
             biochemical activity of the RPE65 enzyme in the past 6 months from screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior intraocular surgery within 6 months from screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior use of any medicines that, in the opinion of the investigator, may have caused&#xD;
             retinal damage (e.g., sildenafil or related compounds, hydroxychloroquine,&#xD;
             chloroquine, thioridazine, any other retino-toxic compounds)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing eye conditions or complicating systemic diseases that would preclude the&#xD;
             planned surgery or interfere with the interpretation of study. Complicating systemic&#xD;
             diseases would include those in which the disease itself, or the treatment for the&#xD;
             disease, can alter ocular function.&#xD;
