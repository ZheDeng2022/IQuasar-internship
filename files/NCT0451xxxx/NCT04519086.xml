      This study focuses on the use of contrast enhanced low-dose CT imaging as a modality to&#xD;
      differentiate between uncomplicated and complicated acute appendicitis. Accurate differential&#xD;
      diagnosis allows the assessment of all available treatment options. Complicated acute&#xD;
      appendicitis requires emergency appendectomy, while uncomplicated acute appendicitis can be&#xD;
      safely and efficiently treated with antibiotics in the majority of patients. Our study group&#xD;
      already published the results of the initial OPTICAP trial enrolling patients with BMI under&#xD;
      30 showing similar accuracy between the low-dose and the stadard dose CT, but a significant&#xD;
      dose reduction associated with the low-dose CT. All patients will undergo both imaging&#xD;
      protocols as the standard CT is also optimized for a low as possible radiation dosage and&#xD;
      imaging sequence per patient is randomized due to the optimization of contrast media&#xD;
      injection timing. All patients participating in this study will be treated operatively with a&#xD;
      laparoscopic appendectomy to obtain histological confirmation for the diagnosis to evaluate&#xD;
      the accuracy of the CT imaging. The aim of this study is to optimize a well-performing&#xD;
      low-dose CT imaging protocol to use in the diagnosis of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in&#xD;
      patients with body mass index over 30 kg/m2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute appendicitis is one of the most common causes of abdominal pain in emergency&#xD;
      departments as well as one of the most common indications for emergency abdominal surgery.&#xD;
      The clinical diagnosis has been based on patient history, physical examination and laboratory&#xD;
      findings as well as the &quot;clinical eye&quot; of the surgeon. Still the diagnosis remains&#xD;
      challenging. One of the main problems is that many other disorders can mimic the clinical&#xD;
      presentation of appendicitis, thus increasing the role of imaging techniques to aid in&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy. Now preoperative imaging in patients with suspected acute appendicitis&#xD;
      is currently widely accepted as the gold standard and CT has been shown to clearly outperform&#xD;
      US in terms of diagnostic performance. Currently CT imaging is considered the primary imaging&#xD;
      modality in the diagnosis for acute appendicitis as it is appraised for its high sensitivity&#xD;
      and specificity. The main disadvantage of CT imaging is exposure to radiation. Thus the&#xD;
      favorable diagnostic performance of CT imaging has encouraged optimization of protocols to&#xD;
      minimize exposure to radiation through the development of low-dose CT protocols. Initial&#xD;
      studies have indicated that contrast enhanced low-dose CT was not inferior to standard-dose&#xD;
      contrast enhanced CT with no statistical significance in negative appendectomy rates,&#xD;
      appendiceal perforation rates or patients requiring additional imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study focuses on the use of contrast enhanced low-dose CT imaging as a modality to&#xD;
      differentiate between uncomplicated and complicated acute appendicitis in patients with BMI&#xD;
      over 30 kg/m2. Accurate differential diagnosis allows the assessment of all available&#xD;
      treatment options. Complicated acute appendicitis requires emergency appendectomy, while&#xD;
      uncomplicated acute appendicitis can be safely and efficiently treated with antibiotics in&#xD;
      the majority of patients. Our study group already published the results of the initial&#xD;
      OPTICAP trial enrolling patients with BMI under 30 showing similar accuracy between the&#xD;
      low-dose and the stadard dose CT, but a significant dose reduction associated with the&#xD;
      low-dose CT. All patients will undergo both imaging protocols as the standard CT is also&#xD;
      optimized for a low as possible radiation dosage and imaging sequence per patient is&#xD;
      randomized due to the optimization of contrast media injection timing. All patients&#xD;
      participating in this study will be treated operatively with a laparoscopic appendectomy to&#xD;
      obtain histological confirmation for the diagnosis to evaluate the accuracy of the CT&#xD;
      imaging. The aim of this study is to optimize a well-performing low-dose CT imaging protocol&#xD;
      to use in the diagnosis of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in patients with body mass index&#xD;
      over 30 kg/m2.&#xD;
