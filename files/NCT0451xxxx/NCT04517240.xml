      The aim of the current study is to investigate if there is GIT involvement in pt's with SLE&#xD;
      particularly protein losing enteropathy also its prevalence among the studied cases and it's&#xD;
      relation to disease activity .&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system&#xD;
      mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body. Symptoms vary between people and&#xD;
      may be mild to severe. Common symptoms include painful and swollen joints, fever, chest pain,&#xD;
      hair loss, mouth ulcers, swollen lymph nodes, feeling tired, and a red rash which is most&#xD;
      commonly on the face. Often there are periods of illness, called flares, and periods of&#xD;
      remission during which there are few symptoms Virtually every system and organ can be&#xD;
      affected by SLE. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in SLE patients, and more than half of&#xD;
      them are caused by adverse reactions to medications and viral or bacterial infections. Though&#xD;
      not as common as lupus nephritis, SLE-related gastrointestinal involvement is clinically&#xD;
      important because most cases can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. Lupus&#xD;
      mesenteric vasculitis is the most common cause, followed by protein-losing enteropathy,&#xD;
      intestinal pseudo-obstruction, acute pancreatitis and other rare complications such as celiac&#xD;
      disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, etc. Protein-losing gastroenteropathy (PLGE)is a&#xD;
      condition characterized by profound edema and severe hypoalbuminemia secondary to excessive&#xD;
      loss of serum protein from the gastrointestinal tract, clinically indistinguishable from&#xD;
      nephrotic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal loss of albumin is harder to investigate, as is its etiology. Consequently,&#xD;
      in patients with hypoalbuminemia in which other possible etiologies have been excluded,&#xD;
      protein-losing enteropathy must be considered and persistently investigated. The diagnosis of&#xD;
      lupus-associated protein-losing enteropathy relies on characteristic clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      features of SLE and on the exclusion of other possible causes of protein loss. Usually there&#xD;
      are no findings suggestive of lymphatic leakage, such as steatorrhea, lymphocytopenia, and&#xD;
      hypogammaglobulinemia; complement levels were low and serum cholesterol was high in about 70%&#xD;
      of the reported cases . No antibodies were specifically associated with protein-losing&#xD;
      enteropathy.Colonoscopy in (PLGE)showed mucosal thickening in 44% of patients, and the&#xD;
      majority of patients (52%) revealed no abnormalities; on the other hand, intestinal histology&#xD;
      either revealed mucosal edema, inflammatory cell infiltrate, lymphangiectasia, mucosal&#xD;
      atrophy or vasculitis in 80% of patients.Intestinal biopsy should be done to exclude other&#xD;
      diseases but does not help in defining the etiopathogenesis of the protein loss. Intestinal&#xD;
      biopsies were normal in many cases, and others showed nonspecific findings including&#xD;
      mononuclear infiltration, lymphangiectasia, vasculitis, deposits of C3 in capillary walls,&#xD;
      and shortened villi. Generally there are no lesions of the epithelial surface.calprotectin&#xD;
      protein is found in large quantities in neutrophil granulocytes, where it represents 5% of&#xD;
      total proteins and 60% of cytoplasmic proteins.In the presence of inflammatory processes,&#xD;
      calprotectin is released following granulation of neutrophil granulocytes. In the case of an&#xD;
      inflammation of the intestine, calprotectin can be detected in feces. Fecal dosing is the&#xD;
      only one that can provide direct indications on the location of inflammation, while the&#xD;
      dosage in serum or plasma shows a state of inflammation that can be present anywhere in the&#xD;
      body of the analyzed patient.&#xD;
