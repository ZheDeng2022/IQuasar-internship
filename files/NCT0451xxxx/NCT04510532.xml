      Breast cancer is the most common cancers among women worldwide.Although chemotherapy and&#xD;
      surgery have greatly improved the survival rate, most types of chemotherapy have been&#xD;
      reported to have varying degrees of cardiotoxicity. The investigators will focus on the&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity of pyrotinib and apatinib which belong to the new tyrosine kinase inhibitors&#xD;
      in respective chemotherapy among more subjects.&#xD;

      Breast cancer is the most common cancers among women worldwide. Although chemotherapy and&#xD;
      surgery have greatly improved the survival rate, most types of chemotherapy have been&#xD;
      reported to have varying degrees of cardiotoxicity. We have focused on the field of&#xD;
      chemotherapy-related cardiomyopathy. Using the unified magnetic resonance sequences and&#xD;
      parameters, effect of chemotherapeutic drugs on the myocardium are studies. Our team's&#xD;
      previous pilot study has found that chemotherapy-related cardiomyopathy (CMP) may be&#xD;
      predicted within one week after chemotherapy initiation. The specific intervention timing,&#xD;
      and the sensitivity and specificity of the early screening indicators are to be explored. At&#xD;
      the same time, in patients with human epidermalgrowth factor receptor-2-positive breast&#xD;
      cancer, our team observed the change of blood pressure, exercise tolerance and myocardial&#xD;
      structure, function and tissue characteristics in patients who used tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors (pyrotinib and apatinib). This is a supplement to the existing drug knowledge. We&#xD;
      are planning to further explore whether it is related to the patient's pre-existing&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases, drug type, dose or dosing. There are no published data addressing&#xD;
      the above two research areas. The overall goal is to explore the commonness and specificity&#xD;
      of myocardial changes after chemotherapy in breast cancer patients and to predict the&#xD;
      development of CMP through multimodality imaging and clinical indices. We aim to propose the&#xD;
      CMP time window in respective chemotherapy among more subjects.&#xD;
