  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical frailty is an age-related medical syndrome defined by a decline in multiple body&#xD;
      systems, thus causing increased vulnerability, even in the face of minor stressors (1) It has&#xD;
      been linked to multiple negative health outcomes, including extended length of stay in acute&#xD;
      care due to complications, hospital re-admissions, and mortality among older patients. About&#xD;
      10-30% of community-dwelling seniors are considered frail(2) with an additional 40% being at&#xD;
      risk for the condition (pre-frailty). By 2030, the number of older adults with frailty is&#xD;
      expected to at least double, in parallel to the projected growth of the older segment of the&#xD;
      population. Frail seniors consume 3-times more health care resources then their robust&#xD;
      counterparts. Thus, the health economic impact of frailty is expected to be enormous and a&#xD;
      call to action has been posed. Big data in healthcare provides important opportunities for&#xD;
      the identification of frailty among the growing number of older patients. This is relevant as&#xD;
      frailty is considered a better predictor of adverse outcomes than chronological age alone.&#xD;
      Therefore, several medical specialties have started to assess frailty in cancer patients,&#xD;
      heart surgery candidates and potential organ transplant recipients.&#xD;

      The Swiss Frailty Network and Repository is a Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN) driver&#xD;
      project. The investigators aim to promote the sustainable implementation of a frailty data&#xD;
      network for research and clinical purposes in strong partnership between all Swiss geriatric&#xD;
      academic centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the five main goals of this project is to validate an electronic frailty index (eFI)&#xD;
      as a screening tool against a clinical frailty instrument (cFI) (validation study) and the&#xD;
      investigation of the correlation of the two instruments with the important endpoints&#xD;
      in-hospital mortality and length of stay in hospital (association study) is at the core of&#xD;
      the project. For the validation study (4), the investigators will include patients 65 and&#xD;
      older admitted to acute geriatric care at all partnering sites, where both, the cFI and the&#xD;
      eFI is collected. For the validation study (4), the investigators will include only patients&#xD;
      with written project informed consent and consent for subsequent use of the project data (the&#xD;
      investigators will also ask for general consent whenever possible. For the correlation study&#xD;
      (5) regarding the cFI and the 2 outcomes. The same requirements apply as for the validation&#xD;
      study (4). For the association study (5) regarding the eFI screening tool, the investigators&#xD;
      will utilize data from all patients age 65 and older admitted to acute care at all partnering&#xD;
      sites. For the eFI, the investigators will only include participants with available written&#xD;
      general consent for further use of routinely collected health data, or established permission&#xD;
      for use in exceptional cases by an ethics committee (HRA Art. 34).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to time constraints and great complexity of the local integration of the clinical frailty&#xD;
      instrument (cFI) as a reference measure at the five different clinic information systems, the&#xD;
      investigators will only integrate the cFI into the primary system at University Hospital&#xD;
      Zurich (USZ) during the three-year duration of the project. At all other partner sites, an&#xD;
      electronic case report form in REDCap will be in place for data entry of the cFI assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the investigators will categorize the collection of data for the clinical Frailty&#xD;
      Instrument (cFI) and the electronic Frailty Index (eFI) screening tool in geriatric&#xD;
      inpatients 65 years and older (validation study plus correlation study) at all sites as a&#xD;
      category A research project (not a clinical trial) with only minimal risks at all partner&#xD;
      sites and the collection of the eFI screening tool in all other acute care patients 65 years&#xD;
      and older as a further use of non-genetic personal health data in patients where a general&#xD;
      consent is available.&#xD;
