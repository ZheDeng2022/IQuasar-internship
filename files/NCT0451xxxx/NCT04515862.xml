      H1: &quot;Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Status&quot; is higher in mothers who received postnatal&#xD;
      hospital-based breastfeeding group training compared to the control group receiving routine&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: The level of knowledge obtained according to the &quot;Pre-test Post-test Question Form&quot; in&#xD;
      mothers who received postnatal hospital-based breastfeeding group training is higher than&#xD;
      before the education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: The status of starting and successfully continuing breastfeeding is higher in mothers who&#xD;
      received postnatal hospital-based breastfeeding group training compared to the control group&#xD;
      who received routine care.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study was applied to mothers who gave birth at a time when they felt well after being taken to their postnatal room. First, the mothers who met the inclusion criteria were informed, after obtaining written consent, the mothers were randomized using a random number table and then assigned to the intervention and control groups.&#xD;
All mothers were asked to fill in the breastfeeding self-efficacy scale form together with the questionnaire before the intervention. Later, a training program was conducted in the hospital with the mothers in the intervention group.&#xD;
In the data collection phase of the study, 1180 women were evaluated in terms of sampling criteria. 1152 women (who did not meet the criteria or refused to participate) were excluded from the study. 90 randomized women were divided into two groups as intervention and control group. During the follow-up, 5 women in the intervention group and 5 women in the control group were excluded from the study.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>twelve weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scale was developed by Cindy-Lee Dennis to measure breastfeeding competence and consists of 2 subscales and 33 items. The Turkish validity and reliability of the breastfeeding proficiency scale was made by Ekşioğlu and Çeber (2011). Breastfeeding self-efficacy increases as the total score increases in the 5-point Likert-type scale with a Cronbach Alpha coefficient of 0.91. The lowest score is 33, the highest score is 165.</description>

    <description>It is a question form consisting of 25 questions in order to evaluate the knowledge about breastfeeding and breast milk before and after the training. The first application was done before the training and the second application was carried out in the 12th week.</description>
