  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis and pathophysiology of sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction remain unknown. This&#xD;
      registry is to evaluate characteristics of sepsis patients by multi-modalities imaging,&#xD;
      including echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging in 300 patients in 5&#xD;
      sites. Subjects will be followed up to 2 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20-30 million patients worldwide suffer from sepsis every year, which is&#xD;
      increasing at the rate of 8% to 13% per year. It is possible that sepsis progress to multiple&#xD;
      organ dysfunction in the early stage, with a fatality of 30% to 60%. Myocardium is one of the&#xD;
      most vulnerable tissue under the abnormal 'inflammation storm'.Cardiac dysfunction is one of&#xD;
      the important predictors for mortality of sepsis.Patients with myocardial depression have an&#xD;
      apparently higher mortality rate (70%) as compared with septic patients without cardiac&#xD;
      impairment (20%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although several trials had explored the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis-induced cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction, the effective characteristic depict and effective therapy remain incompletely&#xD;
      understand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, observational registry study of sepsis&#xD;
      patients that undergo multi-modality imaging.&#xD;
