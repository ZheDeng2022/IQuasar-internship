  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of caffeine on appetite and body weight is controversial. Mostly epidemiological&#xD;
      studies exist that show either a negative effect (reduction of appetite and body weight) or&#xD;
      no effect. In this trial we are going to study the results of the consumption of 5mgr/kgr&#xD;
      body weight of caffeine on appetite, food consumption and hormones ghrelin, asprosin, leptin&#xD;
      and pancreatic polypeptide in relation to gene polymorphisms that affect caffeine metabolism&#xD;
      and body weight. Seventy subjects will participate in a cross sectional study consisting of&#xD;
      two trials (with or without the consumption of caffeine) in order to study the aforementioned&#xD;
      parameters. Differences of total calories consumption between fast metabolizers of caffeine&#xD;
      and the rest of the participants is the primary outcome.&#xD;

      In more detail, participants will be recruited through local advertisements in the university&#xD;
      campus so that to be of normal weight (BMI&lt;25) and apparently healthy. Smokers, special&#xD;
      population groups, i.e. athletes, pregnant women etc., those having a chronic or acute&#xD;
      disease and those on medication will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol. Each volunteer will take part in 2 trials (with 7days interval between&#xD;
      them) in a random order (using a random-number table). Female participants will be on the&#xD;
      follicular phase of their menstrual cycle during the experiments to avoid variability in&#xD;
      appetite [doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2018.01.029.]. The week preceding each experimental day,&#xD;
      participants will be instructed to abstain from any caffeine. Furthermore, the day preceding&#xD;
      each experimental day participants will be instructed to abstain from alcohol source and&#xD;
      physical exercise, to get enough sleep (~7 h) and to come to the lab after an overnight fast&#xD;
      of 10 h. Furthermore, the days before the experiment, volunteers will be asked to consume&#xD;
      similar foods and quantities, keeping more or less constant eating patterns. Participants&#xD;
      will arrive at the lab in the morning 9 am after an overnight fast of 10 h. They will consume&#xD;
      a breakfast snack along with one of the three experimental drinks within 5 min. The snack&#xD;
      will consist of 1 slice of white bread, 5 g of butter and 10 g of white sugar, providing 142&#xD;
      kcal (6.5% of energy from proteins, 62.5% from carbohydrates and 31.0% from lipids). The&#xD;
      experimental drinks will be either (a) 200 mL of instant coffee providing 5 mg caffeine/kg&#xD;
      body weight or (b) 200 mL of water (Control). After a 3-h period, participants will be&#xD;
      offered an ad libitum lunch meal from a buffet, consisting of common Greek diet foods (pasta,&#xD;
      tomato sauce, beef, salad, cheese, yogurt, fruit and juice). They will be instructed to&#xD;
      consume as much food as they desire until they feel satiated, within 30 min. Researchers will&#xD;
      record the exact amount of food consumed by weighting the foods that will be chosen and their&#xD;
      remnants. In addition, a detailed recording of the foods participants are going to consume&#xD;
      later in the evening will be performed from a registered dietician through recall&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular and biochemical parameters that are going to be recorded with the utilization of&#xD;
      standardized generally accepted protocols are blood pressure, body weight and other&#xD;
      anthropometric parameters, blood levels of ghrelin, asprosin, leptin, pancreatic polypeptide,&#xD;
      insulin and glucose, and genetic markers that are related to caffeine metabolism (CYP1A2&#xD;
      rs2069514 και CYP1A2 rs762251), as well as to an obesity genetic risk score (32SNPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary outcomes Based on genotype data, participants will be categorized as&#xD;
      fast, medium and slow metabolizers of caffeine. For sample size calculation differences of&#xD;
      total calories consumptions between groups will be utilized as primary outcome. More&#xD;
      specifically, since a small participation of slow metabolizers are expected, these subjects&#xD;
      will be grouped together with medium metabolizers. A difference of total calories consumption&#xD;
      that exceeds 20% between the two groups is considered clinically significant. Taking into&#xD;
      account an attrition rate of 10% between the two trials (caffeine and control) a total of&#xD;
      about 70 participants are required for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates and lipids) consumption, responses on visual analog&#xD;
      scales for satiety and appetite, hormones concentrations will be studied as secondary&#xD;
      outcomes&#xD;
