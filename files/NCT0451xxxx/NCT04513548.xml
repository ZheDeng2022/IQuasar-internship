  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the mechanism of action for ligelizumab (QGE031)&#xD;
      treatment in patients with chronic urticaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two parts. The study population will consist of approximately 68 male and&#xD;
      female healthy volunteers and patients. In Part 1, approximately 20 healthy volunteers and&#xD;
      patients with chornic urticaria will be enrolled. In Part 2 approximately 48 patients with&#xD;
      chronic urticaria (spontaneous chronic urticaria, cholinergic urticaria or cold urticaria).&#xD;
      Part 1 consists of a screening period up 2 weeks and a visit with skin tests; there is no&#xD;
      treatment taken in Part 1. Part 2 is randomized, subject, investigator and sponsor blinded.&#xD;
      It consists of a screening period up to 4 weeks, a 16 week treatment period and a 12-week&#xD;
      follow-up period after last treatment. A follow-up call at Week 32 will be performed via&#xD;
      telephone.&#xD;

    <measure>Part 1: Wheal and erythema size after skin prick test with several different ciprofloxacin and icatibant concentrations.</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Size of the wheal and erythema in mm will be measured after the skin prick and intradermal tests are performed. Different dilution steps will be applied (to differentiate Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria patients and healthy controls) for ciprofloxacin and icatibant to determine the conditions to be used in Part 2.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 2: Change in wheal size after challenge procedure from Day 1 (pre-dose) to week 16.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Size of wheal in mm2 after skin prick test and autologous serum skin test will be measured.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, Week 24, Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The Urticaria Control Test (UCT) is a questionnaire that assesses the extent of the disease control over the previous 4 weeks. It consists of 4 questions, each rated from 0 to 4 points. Subsequently, the scores for all 4 questions are summed up. The minimum and maximum UCT scores are 0 and 16, with 12 points or higher indicating controlled disease, and 16 points indicating complete disease control.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 2: Weekly Urticaria Activity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study (to 28 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) patients: The Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) is evaluated in the screening period and throughout the study. It records each morning and evening on a daily basis symptoms of itch and hives into a patient diary. The UAS is a composite score with numeric severity intensity ratings on a scale of 0 - 3 for the number of wheals (hives) and the itch intensity. The UAS7 is the sum of the daily UAS scores over 7 days. UAS7 values range from 0 to 42, with higher values indicate higher disease activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 2: Cholinergic Urticaria Activity score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>Cholinergic urticaria patients: Cholinergic Urticaria Activity score (CholUAS) is a questionnaire that records each evening on a daily basis symptoms of itch and hives and the general assessment of disease severity into a patient diary. The CholUAS is a composite score with numeric ratings on a scale of 0 - 3 for the intensity of wheals (hives), the itch intensity, and the overall assessment of the disease severity. The total score is a sum of scores multiplied with the score for the trigger. The CholUAS7 is the sum of the daily CholUAS scores over 7 days. Higher values indicate a higher disease activity.</description>

    <description>CSU patients: The Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life questionnaire (CU-Q2oL) is a questionnaire that measures the relative burden of chronic urticaria on subjective well-being. It consists of 23 questions in 3 domains (symptoms, general impairment, difficulties and problems due to urticaria). with a total score of 0 to 100 %. Higher scores indicate higher impairment in quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1, Week 16, Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>CSU patients with angioedema: Angioedema Control Test (AECT) is a questionnaire that assesses the extent of the symptom control (angioedema). It consists of 4 questions, each rated from 0 to 4 points. Subsequently, the scores for all 4 questions are summed up. The minimum and maximum AECT scores are 0 and 16, with 10 points or higher indicating controlled disease, and 16 points indicating complete disease control.</description>

    <description>Cholinergic patients: The Cholinergic Urticaria Quality of Life questionnaire (Chol-Q2oL) is a questionnaire that measures the relative burden of cholinergic urticaria on subjective well-being. The questionnaire consists of 28 items, each item being scored between 0 and 4. Higher scores indicate higher impairment in quality of life.</description>
