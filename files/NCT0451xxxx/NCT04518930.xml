  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized control trial, in which ninety women will be conveniently selected but&#xD;
      their distribution in a groups will be randomized according to a predetermined randomization&#xD;
      list in chronological sequence of inclusion. A three parallel groups, two experimental and&#xD;
      one control (labeled A, B and C respectively) will be provided with the same details menu for&#xD;
      seven days in except the second snack, depending on their body mass index (BMI); women with&#xD;
      BMI 25-30 kg/m² will be provided 1300 calories diet and for women with BMI above 30 kg/m²,&#xD;
      1500 calories diet will be provided; in which high protein snack (Plain Greek yogurts) will&#xD;
      be provided to the first experimental group (A), high fat snack (peanuts) to the second&#xD;
      experimental group (B) and second snack (Plain Greek yogurt or peanuts) will be removed to&#xD;
      the control group (C) (Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The first experimental group (A) will consume (33) g (200) calories of roasted, not&#xD;
           salted peanuts after-lunch as snack.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second experimental group (B) will consume (148) g (200) calories of Plain Greek&#xD;
           yogurt after-lunch as snack.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The control group (C) will consume isoenergetic/equi protein regular three main meals&#xD;
           with the first snack only.&#xD;

      Subjects will be asked to rate their perceptions of hunger. Appetite sensation will be&#xD;
      measured using validated visual analog scale (VAS) questionnaire, which provides a&#xD;
      quantifiable objective measure translated from subjective sensations. VAS is self-report&#xD;
      methodology to assess subjective appetite sensation Each VAS consists of a 100 mm horizontal&#xD;
      line, where 0 mm represents sensation not felt at all, while 100 mm sensation felt as the&#xD;
      greatest. Participants were asked to place a vertical mark on the 100 mm line to indicate how&#xD;
      they feel at testing time (0, 30, 60, and 120 min after the second snack consumption).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to the nutrition clinic at 6:00 pm, upon arrival blood samples&#xD;
      will be obtained from each women, intravenous blood samples will be obtained by a trained&#xD;
      health care professional (medical laboratory technician) by a trained health care&#xD;
      professional using 5 ml capacity syringes from a forearm vein from each woman; one sample&#xD;
      will be obtained at the first day of the study at 6:00 pm after one-hour of taking the second&#xD;
      snack for group A and B and at same time for group C and another sample will be obtained at&#xD;
      the seventh day of the study at the same manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blood samples will be analyzed in approved medical laboratory to measure appetite&#xD;
      hormones; cholecystokinin, peptide YY, glucagon like peptide-1, and ghrelin on addition to&#xD;
      insulin. Two results of each test will be obtained for each woman to observe the change in&#xD;
      both results and to study the effect of high protein vs. high fat on appetite hormones to&#xD;
      control satiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Package for Social Science software (SPSS, version 22.0, 2013) will used to&#xD;
      perform the statistical analysis. Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to evaluate VAS scores&#xD;
      and hormones' concentration with time and treatment as factors. Some of data and social&#xD;
      demographic data will be categorical.&#xD;
