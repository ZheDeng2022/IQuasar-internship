  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), such as flushes, sweating, and sleep disturbances, are experienced&#xD;
      by up to 80% of women during the menopausal transition. Night sweats, which are hot flushes&#xD;
      that occur at night, can be particularly bothersome in women and contribute to disturbed&#xD;
      sleep. These symptoms occur mainly during the 1-3 years prior to menopause (late&#xD;
      perimenopause) and early menopause (~4 years after menstruation ceases). Many women look to&#xD;
      supplements for the management of menopausal symptoms. Soy isoflavones and their metabolites&#xD;
      are one category of dietary supplements that have been extensively studied for the management&#xD;
      of VMS. The most active soy isoflavone is S-equol, which is not found directly in soy, but&#xD;
      rather is the metabolite that is produced by gut microflora from consumption of the soy&#xD;
      isoflavone daidzein. However, only 20-30% of US women are actually able to produce S-equol&#xD;
      from the consumption of daidzein. EquelleÂ® is a currently available dietary supplement that&#xD;
      has S-equol as its active component, which allows the delivery of the active soy isoflavone&#xD;
      metabolite directly without dependence on the gut microflora metabolism. The intention of&#xD;
      this study is to assess the effect of a product containing S-equol on the management of VMS&#xD;
      in normally healthy women.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel study, which will include a&#xD;
      screening visit (Visit 1; week -3), a 2-week run-in period for baseline determination and&#xD;
      assessment of placebo response (Visit 2; week -2; and Visit 3; week -1), one baseline visit&#xD;
      (Visit 4; week 0), and three test visits (Visits 5, 6, and 7; weeks 4, 8, and 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 1 (week -3), after subjects have provided informed consent, medical history will be&#xD;
      reviewed, and clinic visit procedures will be performed, including assessments of&#xD;
      prior/current medication/supplement use, evaluations of inclusion/exclusion criteria, and a&#xD;
      last menses query. Fasting (10-14 h) blood samples will be collected for assessment of FSH&#xD;
      and estradiol levels. The Soy Food Frequency Questionnaire will be administered and subjects&#xD;
      will be instructed to maintain their habitual diets (with the exception of avoiding soy&#xD;
      foods) and physical activity patterns throughout the study period. Additionally, subjects&#xD;
      will be dispensed the Insomnia Severity Index Questionnaire (ISIQ) and the VMS Diary to&#xD;
      assess insomnia and VMS, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 2 (week -2), eligible subjects will be instructed to start the run-in placebo&#xD;
      product for two weeks. Subjects will be also instructed to continue daily recording in the&#xD;
      VMS Diary. At Visit 3 (week -1), the VMS Diary will be collected/reviewed to assess response&#xD;
      to the run-in placebo product. Subjects who continue to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be allowed to continue with the study and will be dispensed a sleep tracking device to&#xD;
      wear for sleep/wake pattern evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 4 (week 0), eligible subjects will be randomized to one of the study products&#xD;
      (Active or Placebo) and instructed to consume with water for 12 weeks. Additionally, the&#xD;
      Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), RAND-36 Questionnaire, Profile of Mood States (POMS),&#xD;
      Day-to-Day Impact of Vaginal Aging Questionnaire (DIVQ), Chalder Fatigue Scale, and&#xD;
      Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) Questionnaire will be administered. The VMS Diary&#xD;
      and ISIQ will be collected and reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visits 5 and 6 (weeks 4 and 8), the VMS Diary and ISIQ will be collected/reviewed, and the&#xD;
      PSQI and MENQOL will be administered. Subjects will return to the clinic prior to Visit 7&#xD;
      (week 12) to receive the sleep tracking device to wear for sleep/wake pattern evaluation one&#xD;
      week (7 d) prior to Visit 7 (week 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 7 (week 12), the VMS Diary and ISIQ will be collected and reviewed. The PSQI,&#xD;
      RAND-36, POMS, DIVQ, Chalder Fatigue Scale, and MENQOL will be administered and study product&#xD;
      will be collected/reviewed, and compliance will be determined. Additionally, the sleep&#xD;
      tracker will be collected, and data will be downloaded for evaluation.&#xD;

             syndrome, celiac disease, history of gastric bypass surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has a history of estrogen-dependent neoplasia, atypical ductual hyperplasia of&#xD;
             the breast, or undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.&#xD;

             modulator, testosterone, or estrogen/testosterone within 30 d prior to Visit 1 (week&#xD;
             -3).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject has used any prescription or over-the-counter products/supplements (e.g., soy&#xD;
             products, herbal supplements) that have potential to alter progesterone or estrogen&#xD;
             activity or is being used to treat VMS within 30 d prior to Visit 1 (week -3).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject has self-described extreme or irregular dietary habits, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Clinical Investigator or has been diagnosed with an eating disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subject has elective hospitalizations planned (e.g., elective cosmetic procedures)&#xD;
             during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject has been exposed to any non-registered drug product or has participated in&#xD;

             strong potential for alcohol or substance abuse. Alcohol abuse is defined as &gt;14&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Individual has a condition the Clinical Investigator believes would interfere with his&#xD;
             ability to provide informed consent, comply with the study protocol, which might&#xD;
             confound the interpretation of the study results, or put the subject at undue risk.&#xD;
