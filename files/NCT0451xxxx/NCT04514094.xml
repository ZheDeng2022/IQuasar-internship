  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the biannual application of 38%&#xD;
      silver diamine fluoride in arresting early childhood caries when compared to atraumatic&#xD;
      restorative treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Owing to the virulent nature of early childhood caries (ECC) and its consequences if left&#xD;
      untreated, immediate intervention is indicated to control the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barriers to intervention as young age, uncooperative patient behavior and lack of access to&#xD;
      dental care are however, very common. The use of silver diamine fluoride as an anticaries&#xD;
      agent is of growing popularity worldwide due to its promising results, safety of use, ease of&#xD;
      application and relatively low cost. Further research is still required in order to provide&#xD;
      evidence-based recommendations regarding the use of SDF in arresting early childhood caries.&#xD;
      Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of biannual application of 38% silver diamine fluoride&#xD;
      in arresting early childhood caries when compared to atraumatic restorative treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Gross debris will be removed with cotton pellets to allow better SDF contact with denatured dentin.&#xD;
Cotton rolls will be used to protect surrounding gingival tissues and mucous membranes to avoid pigmentation or irritation.&#xD;
Affected tooth surfaces will be dried with a gentle flow of air.&#xD;
1-2 drops only of SDF will be used for the whole visit.&#xD;
SDF will then be directly applied to affected tooth surfaces only using a micro sponge brush.&#xD;
At least one minute will be needed to allow drying of SDF.&#xD;
Excess SDF will finally be removed with cotton rolls to minimize systemic absorption.&#xD;
When possible, isolation will be continued for up to three minutes.&#xD;
After 2-4 weeks: reapplication will be done only to lesions that do not appear arrested (dark and hard).</description>

    <description>Caries removal by hand instruments with care not to expose the pulp.&#xD;
Maximum excavation from the periphery of lesions will be done, to minimize leakage at the restoration margins.&#xD;
Cotton roll isolation will then be carried out.&#xD;
Cavities will be restored by glass ionomer cement.&#xD;
Hand pressure should be applied by a gloved and petroleum jelly coated finger, then, excess material will be removed.</description>

    <description>SDF promotes enamel and dentin remineralization, as well as inhibit the growth of cariogenic bacteria. the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved SDF as a device for reducing tooth sensitivity in the USA.</description>

    <intervention_name>ART</intervention_name>
    <description>The ART technique involves caries excavation by hand instruments only with care to avoid pulp exposure. Such excavation is mainly from the periphery of the lesion to achieve a good seal of the restoration and minimize leakage. The tooth is then restored by glass ionomer cement.</description>
