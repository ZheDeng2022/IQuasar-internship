  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of a low glycemic load dietary&#xD;
      intervention in adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) in a rigorous feeding study.&#xD;
      Specific emphasis will be placed on changes in weight, body composition, and glycemic&#xD;
      measures obtained via continuous glucose monitor (CGM) usage.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-pulmonary complications of cystic fibrosis (CF) are becoming increasingly prevalent with&#xD;
      the changing landscape of CF care. CF related diabetes mellitus (CFRD) and CF related&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) complications have significant effects on morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Treatment options are limited to insulin therapy for CFRD and symptom control for most GI&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMI is a well-established marker of morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. Many&#xD;
      patients consume a high carbohydrate intake to meet their increase caloric needs, potentially&#xD;
      leading to complications including post-prandial hyperglycemia, increased inflammation, and&#xD;
      abnormal GI motility. Dietary recommendations for children and adults with CF are limited and&#xD;
      based entirely on consensus and expert opinion. As patients with CF live longer with highly&#xD;
      effective modulator therapy, it is important to understand the effects of dietary composition&#xD;
      on short and long-term endocrine, GI, and pulmonary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a prospective, open-label pilot study in adults with CF and&#xD;
      impaired glucose tolerance or indeterminate glycemia to establish the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of a low glycemic load (LGL) diet. Subjects will initially follow their standard diet for a&#xD;
      2-week run-in period, then transition to a LGL diet provided by a food delivery service for&#xD;
      the remaining 8 weeks. The investigators will also investigate potential short-term outcomes&#xD;
      of dietary carbohydrate manipulation, including glycemic variability measured by continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitor (CGM), body composition via DXA, GI symptoms, and quality of life measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a diet lower in carbohydrate content will be safe,&#xD;
      tolerable, and associated with weight maintenance or gain, and that a LGL diet will result in&#xD;
      decreased glycemic variability via CGM, improved GI symptoms, increased lean to fat mass&#xD;
      ratio, and improved quality of life measures over an 8-week period.&#xD;
