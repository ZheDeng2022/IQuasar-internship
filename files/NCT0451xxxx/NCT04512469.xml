      Study Design: Single-blinded, randomized, prospective clinical trial. Study Population:&#xD;
      End-stage liver disease patients' candidates for liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures: Consenting patients will be divided into two matched groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CONTROL group - receiving a standard running fascial closure with PDS suture&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. TREATMENT group - receiving a standard running fascial closure with PDS suture PLUS a&#xD;
           low molecular weight mesh. The mesh will be secured to the fascia extending 3 cm from&#xD;
           the incisional site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no modifications to routine post-operative wound care in both groups. However,&#xD;
      the treatment group will have an additional drain placed at the incision site compared to the&#xD;
      control group to reduce the risk of a seroma from placement of the mesh. Wound dressing will&#xD;
      be removed on post-op day 2 and the wound will be assessed. Re-application of the dressing&#xD;
      will occur thereafter until proper healing of the incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An abdominal ultrasound will be done on all study participants at the 1- and 2-year mark&#xD;
      postoperatively to look for objective evidence of a ventral incisional hernia. A CT scan will&#xD;
      be performed if the abdominal ultrasound findings are inconclusive.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An incisional hernia is a common complication of abdominal surgery with an incidence of&#xD;
      4-20%. Liver transplant patients represent a unique cohort of surgical patients with&#xD;
      immediate immune suppression post-operatively. It is presumed that this immune suppression&#xD;
      accompanied by significant co-morbidities have led to high incisional ventral hernia rates&#xD;
      between 4.9%-34.3%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent 2018 retrospective review of 1044 liver transplant patients identified age &gt;55, high&#xD;
      BMI &gt; 25, and immediate rejection were significant risk factors contributing to herniation.&#xD;
      However, previously concerning considerations including gender, diagnosis, diabetes,&#xD;
      Child-Pugh score, MELD score, donor type, hepato-renal syndrome, varix bleeding, ascites,&#xD;
      hepatic encephalopathy, ventilator use, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), or bile leak&#xD;
      were not identified as significant risk factors. Moreover, the mortality for chronic liver&#xD;
      disease patients for elective hernia repair is 3.7% at 90 days and morbidity is 27%. Emergent&#xD;
      hernia repair led to 10% 90-day mortality with 60% morbidity. The high incidence of&#xD;
      herniation represents a common problem with significant morbidity and mortality post liver&#xD;
      transplantation thereby requiring investigating a new preventative solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent retrospective trial in the colorectal literature identified an institutional&#xD;
      incidence of incisional hernia for colorectal patients of 39.9%. They recognized two&#xD;
      high-risk populations, obese, and non-obese with a combination of several secondary risk&#xD;
      factors. A follow-up prospective cohort study separated all colorectal patients undergoing&#xD;
      laparotomy to standardized running PDS closure versus those with BMI&gt;29 (the median in the&#xD;
      prior study) and those BMI &lt;29 with &gt;=2 risk factors to include standard closure with an&#xD;
      on-lay Ultrapro partially absorb-able mesh covering 3 cm adjacent to the incision placed with&#xD;
      double down facial staples followed by a subcutaneous drain. The reported risk factors&#xD;
      included BMI, smoking, serum creatinine, hemoglobin, serum albumin, COPD diabetes, immune&#xD;
      suppression with steroids or radiation/chemotherapy, and previous midline laparotomy. The&#xD;
      results revealed a decrease in the incisional hernia rate from 43.9% to 10% (P=0.0001). This&#xD;
      study also concluded the treatment was cost effective and safe.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The research coordinators will identify patients diagnosed with end-stage liver disease who are candidates for liver transplantation for study eligibility (see inclusion and exclusion criteria). Participants will be randomly selected to be included in one of two groups: the control or treatment group. The control group will undergo standard running fascial closure with PDS while the treatment group will undergo this closure plus a low molecular weight mesh extending 3 cm from the fascial incision.&#xD;
There will be no alteration to this standard of care schedule for this clinical trial. Data will be collected at every 12-month intervals to rule out clinical evidence of a hernia. The presence of a hernia will be assessed via clinical examination and abdominal ultrasound imaging. If findings from the abdominal ultrasound are inconclusive, a non-contrast CT scan will be performed. The study will end when either the primary or secondary outcomes are reached.</intervention_model_description>
