    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experience Grade 3 or Higher Adverse Events That Occur at or Before Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Primary outcome is met if any participants experience a grade 3 or higher event prior to Week 24. A grade 3 AE would constitute as &quot;severe&quot;. Grading was following using CTCAE v 4.03.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Grade 3 (Severe) or Higher Adverse Events That Occur Throughout the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12, 24, 36, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) assessed throughout the study ( 48 weeks). A grade 3 AE would constitute as &quot;severe&quot;. Grading was following using CTCAE v 4.03.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Grade 2 (Moderate) or Higher Adverse Events That Occur Throughout the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12, 24, 36, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>Grade 2 or higher assessed 12 weeks apart. Grade 2 AEs are determined as &quot; moderate&quot;. Grading was performed following CTCAE v 4.03 guidance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Provisional American College of Rheumatology Combined Response Index (CRISS) Systemic Sclerosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12, 24, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>CRISS components included the following domains: modified Rodnan skin score, forced vital capacity percent predicted, Physician Global Assessment, Patient Global Assessment, and Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability-Index. An algorithm determines the predicted probability of improvement from baseline by incorporating change in the mRSS, FVC percent predicted, Physician and Patient Global Assessments, and HAQ-DI. The outcome is a continuous variable between 0.0 and 1.0 (0 - 100%). A cut-off at 0.6 in the predicted probability of being improved has yielded the smallest misclassification error. Subjects are not considered improved if, between Visit 1 and 6, they develop new: 1) renal crisis; 2) decline in FVC% predicted by 15% (relative) from baseline and confirmed after 1 month; or 3) left ventricular failure (systolic ejection fraction &lt; 45%) or pulmonary artery hypertension. Higher CRISS scores indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Scleroderma Clinical Trials Consortium Damage Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24, 48</time_frame>
    <description>A damage Index (DI) in systemic sclerosis, including musculoskeletal and skin, vascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory and cardiovascular damage caused by SSc.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12, 24, 36, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) is a measure of skin thickness. Skin thickness in 17 anatomic areas was rated on a 0-3 scale and scores are summed to obtain the mRSS (range from 0 - 51), with higher mRSS scores indicating worse disease activity</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Skin Thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24, 48</time_frame>
    <description>The skin thickness of fingers and palms would be measured by high frequency echo. detector.</description>
