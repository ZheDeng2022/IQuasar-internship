      Aim of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to establish:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether noradrenaline (NA) infusion has a significant effect on coagulation and&#xD;
           fibrinolysis in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether disruption of haemostasis can be recorded with a computerized tomography (CT)&#xD;
           scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether there is a significant difference between the values of haemostasis parameters&#xD;
           in the internal jugular vein and the radialis artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In the early stage of treatment (1-3 hours), an increased formation of thrombin occurs&#xD;
           in patients with severe isolated TBI that are treated with NA; consequently, platelet&#xD;
           use increases in comparison with patients who don't need NA, as do coagulation factors&#xD;
           and hyperfibrinolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The concentration of NA correlates with thrombin formation and the correlation is&#xD;
           stronger in higher doses of NA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Thrombin formation will decrease more slowly in the group that will receive NA therapy&#xD;
           in comparison to the group that will not receive NA therapy.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The research shall be carried out at the Department of Anaesthetics&#xD;
      and Surgical Intensive Care/Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at the University Medical Centre&#xD;
      Ljubljana and will begin once it is approved by the Slovenian National Medical Ethics&#xD;
      Committee. Patients will be included in the research once the informed consent form is signed&#xD;
      by their relatives or their legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and the course of the study The research study will focus on 60 consecutive patients&#xD;
      with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) hospitalised at the emergency unit's ICU, who will&#xD;
      be treated according to the Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines, will undergo a&#xD;
      computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head, and will have been implanted with an electrode&#xD;
      for monitoring intracranial pressure (ICP). Both female and male patients, age 18 to 80, with&#xD;
      Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ≤ 8 and Head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) ≥ 3 shall be included in&#xD;
      the study. Patients with any kind of extracranial injury, patients receiving anticoagulation&#xD;
      or anti aggregation therapy, patients with a known neurological, haematological, malign or&#xD;
      liver disease, patients with an infection and after a cardiac arrest, after craniotomy,&#xD;
      patients that have received transfusion of concentrated erythrocytes (&gt; 1 bag) and/or fresh&#xD;
      frozen plasma, thrombocyte plasma, patients with a body temperature of &lt; 35°C and pregnant&#xD;
      women will all be excluded from the study, as will be those cases where it will be impossible&#xD;
      to perform targeted tests in the expected time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the ICU, patients will receive treatment according to the guidelines for the treatment of&#xD;
      severe traumatic brain injury. All patients will be sedated with midazolam, they will receive&#xD;
      analgesia with fentanyl, and when required considering the level of ICP, will also receive a&#xD;
      2% propofol infusion. They will all be mechanically ventilated. A non-heparinized central&#xD;
      venous catheter and an artery catheter will both be routinely inserted in all cases. Blood&#xD;
      samples for the study will be taken from the internal jugular vein with a singular puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic blood pressure, heart rate, central body temperature, peripheral blood oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (SpO2), ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and bispectral index (BIS) of the&#xD;
      depth of anaesthesia will be monitored at all times. Pupillary response and depth of sedation&#xD;
      using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) will be performed once per hour. Hydration&#xD;
      will be estimated with stroke volume variation (SVV) one or twice per day. Patients whose CPP&#xD;
      will not meet the desired value (70 mmHg) will receive systemic intravenous infusion of NA&#xD;
      solution (0.16 mg/ml) in the dosage required to meet the target CPP. Another CT scan will be&#xD;
      performed 12 to 24 hours after injury and after sudden deterioration in health condition, if&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken daily from the artery catheter to determine the values of&#xD;
      electrolytes, glucose, number of leukocytes and haemogram, number of thrombocytes all of&#xD;
      which are routinely performed on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the periods of 1-3, 6, 12 and 24 hours after injury, a member of the research staff will&#xD;
      collect a blood sample from the patient with a severe TBI via an arterial catheter in order&#xD;
      to determine: the level of endogenous NA or of total, endogenous and exogenous NA, if the&#xD;
      patient will have received continuous NA infusion, the number of thrombocytes, prothrombin&#xD;
      time/international normalized ration (PT/INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT),&#xD;
      fibrinogen, antithrombin (AT), D-dimer, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) test results,&#xD;
      platelet function with aggregometry (Multiplate), lactate level, pH balance, gas analysis&#xD;
      (PaO2, PaCO2), HCO3, base deficit and arterial blood oxygen saturation (SaO2). Venipuncture&#xD;
      shall be performed on patients with severe TBI in the periods of 1-3, 6, 12 and 24 hours&#xD;
      after injury by a member of the research staff to collect a blood sample from the jugular&#xD;
      vein in order to determine: the level of endogenous NA or of total, endogenous and exogenous&#xD;
      NA, if the patient will have received continuous NA infusion, number of thrombocytes, PT/INR,&#xD;
      aPTT, fibrinogen, tissue factor (TF), AT, thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT); D-dimer,&#xD;
      tissue-plasminogen activator antigen (t-PAAg), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen&#xD;
      (PAI-1Ag), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity (PAI-1Act), plasmin-antiplasmin complex&#xD;
      (PAP), plasminogen activity; protein C antigen (PCAg), syndecan-1 (SDC-1), rotational&#xD;
      thromboelastometry (ROTEM) test results, platelet function with aggregometry (Multiplate). In&#xD;
      patients who will require an infusion of NA within 1-3 hours after hemostasis tests have&#xD;
      already been taken, the NA level will be determine again 30 minutes after the infusion set,&#xD;
      and all mentioned hemostasis tests from the internal jugular vein and arterial catheter will&#xD;
      be re-controlled. CT will be repeated 12 and 24 hours after the injury and if necessary in&#xD;
      the case of a sudden worsening of the clinical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with severe TBI will be divided into two groups. Group A for patients that will need&#xD;
      an infusion of NA solution to meet the desired CPP, and Group B for patients that will not&#xD;
      receive NA infusion. Group A will be further divided into three sub-groups: A1 for patients&#xD;
      that will receive NA in the dose of 0.06-0.12 μg/kg/min, A2 for patients that will receive a&#xD;
      dose of 0.13-0.2 μg/kg/min, and A3 for patients that will receive a dose of NA &gt; 0.2&#xD;
      μg/kg/min. Absolute values of individual laboratory variables in different time intervals&#xD;
      (1-3, 6, 12, 24 hours after injury) will be compared between Groups A and B, between&#xD;
      sub-group A1 and B, A2 and B, and A3 and B; and between sub-groups A1, A2 and A3.&#xD;
