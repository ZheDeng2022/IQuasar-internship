  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a cross-sectional study that wishes to investigate whether there is an&#xD;
      increased incidence of sarcopenia in patients with chronic kidney disease compared to the&#xD;
      Danish background population. A possible association between sarcopenia and fall, as well as&#xD;
      the incidence of osteoporosis in patients with chronic kidney disease will also be described.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is a condition diagnosed from different clinical findings such as low muscle mass,&#xD;
      low muscle strength and possibly also poor physical performance. In the general population,&#xD;
      the risk of fall and bone fracture increases, when sarcopenia is also present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenia is known to occur in patients with chronic kidney disease, but whether, and if so,&#xD;
      how this differs from the incidence in patients without kidney disease has not previously&#xD;
      been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic kidney disease have a 3 times higher risk of bone fracture compared to&#xD;
      the Danish background population, and they also have an increased risk of falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between sarcopenia, risk of falls and osteoporosis in patients with kidney&#xD;
      disease is until now sparsely described, and because of this, the investigators want to&#xD;
      explore this further in this cross-sectional study.&#xD;
