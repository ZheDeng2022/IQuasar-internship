  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial studying the use of vaginal cleansing with chlorhexidine&#xD;
      gluconate for pregnant women with PPROM (preterm pre labor rupture of membranes). The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be pregnancy latency. Secondary outcomes will include various maternal and&#xD;
      neonatal outcomes, and inflammatory markers from maternal blood, amniotic fluid, fetal cord&#xD;
      blood and placental analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial, including pregnant women &gt; 18 years old with early onset PPROM&#xD;
      occurring between the time of peri-viability through the early third trimester (20 weeks 0&#xD;
      days - 33 weeks 0 days) at Albany Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will be consented by a physician member of the research team on labor and delivery&#xD;
      after clinical diagnosis of PPROM. Participation will be completely voluntary and not impact&#xD;
      routine prenatal care for PPROM, which may include but not be limited to hospital admission,&#xD;
      standard latency antibiotics, NICU consultation, fetal growth ultrasounds, fetal monitoring,&#xD;
      and delivery will be based on physician assessment and not impacted by this study.&#xD;
      Participation in the study will involve prospective data collection on maternal, fetal, and&#xD;
      neonatal characteristics, randomization into a control and treatment group, collection of&#xD;
      maternal serum, fetal cord blood and vaginal fluid. Subjects will be randomized into control&#xD;
      and treatment groups via block randomization. Exclusions will include any contraindications&#xD;
      to expectant management for PPROM noted at the time on admission, such as preterm labor,&#xD;
      chorioamnionitis, maternal sepsis and fetal distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time commitment for each subject will include the time from diagnosis of PPROM until&#xD;
      their delivery. Although outcome measures will be collected from each neonate, no further&#xD;
      participation from subjects will be required after time of their delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group: Women diagnosed with PPROM (20 - 33 weeks) randomized to the treatment group&#xD;
      will undergo vaginal cleansing with chlorhexidine gluconate within 24 hours of their&#xD;
      diagnosis. This specific procedure will only be done once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaginal cleansing procedure will be performed by a single investigator, Dr. Cagino, to&#xD;
      ensure consistency. The patient will be examined in dorsal lithotomy position with a standard&#xD;
      speculum. A sterile 2x2 gauze placed on ringed forceps will be soaked in sterile 2%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine gluconate in&#xD;
&#xD;
      aqueous solution (all available on labor and delivery). Only the rough volume of 2%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine gluconate required to soak the small sterile gauze will be used. This soaked&#xD;
      gauze will be used to carefully wipe the vaginal mucosa of the vaginal vault. No pooling of&#xD;
      chlorhexidine will be left in the vaginal vault. The chlorhexidine solution will not be&#xD;
      applied to the cervix or cervical os. The chlorhexidine solution will not be applied directly&#xD;
      to the fetus in any way. If a fetal part is visualized at time of exam, the patient will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Otherwise, standard care for PPROM among women in this group will not change. This group will&#xD;
      be expectantly managed until the time of delivery, which will be based on physician&#xD;
      assessment. Delivery decisions for women with preterm labor or infection will be based on&#xD;
      physician assessment only and will not be influenced by their involvement in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: Women diagnosed with PPROM (20 - 33 weeks) randomized to the control group&#xD;
      will undergo standard care for PPROM. This group will be expectantly managed until the time&#xD;
      of delivery, which will be based on physician assessment. Data will be collected from both&#xD;
      the patient and neonate (please see the collection sheet for further information).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Serial antepartum CBC - admission, day 7, delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postpartum CBC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical chorioamnionitis (as defined by treating clinician discretion and requiring&#xD;
           treatment with antibiotics and/or delivery)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Histologic chorioamnionitis (based on placental pathology)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maternal sepsis (as defined by treating clinician discretion)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Culture proven&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Presumed sepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Composite neonatal morbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neonatal death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fetal demise&#xD;
&#xD;
      A power analysis was performed based on the mean latency of 18 days (SD 10 days) in patients&#xD;
      who remained pregnant at least 7 days following PPROM at AMC. In order to detect a&#xD;
      prolongation in latency by at least 10 days in the treatment group, an effect size of 1, with&#xD;
      a power 0.8 and alpha 0.05, 17 subjects in each study group are needed. A study duration of&#xD;
      1.5 to 2 years to complete enrollment, data collection and analysis is anticipated.&#xD;
