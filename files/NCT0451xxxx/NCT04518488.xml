  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is about preparing people with cancerous tumours, soft-tissue sarcoma (STS), in&#xD;
      the leg to recover more quickly from surgery. Prehabilitation or &quot;surgery school&quot; is done&#xD;
      before surgery while undergoing other cancer-related treatments. To test this idea, two&#xD;
      groups will be formed. One group will have the prehabilitation program and the other group&#xD;
      will have the same amount of attention from the research team who will visit them at the time&#xD;
      of the radiotherapy sessions to provide support and any information they may need.The results&#xD;
      of the study will indicate whether it is a good idea to conduct a bigger study that would&#xD;
      involve many centres in Canada.&#xD;

      This study is about preparing people with cancerous tumours, soft-tissue sarcoma (STS), in&#xD;
      the leg to recover more quickly from surgery. Prehabilitation or &quot;surgery school&quot; is done&#xD;
      before surgery while undergoing other cancer-related treatments. The tumour can be anywhere&#xD;
      in the leg so exercises must be specially designed for each person. This process is novel and&#xD;
      therefore has to be tested to see if it is practical and if it helps people recovery more&#xD;
      quickly. To test this idea, two groups will be formed. One group will have the&#xD;
      prehabilitation program and the other group will have the same amount of attention from the&#xD;
      research team who will visit them at the time of the radiotherapy sessions to provide support&#xD;
      and any information they may need. Assessments of how well participants can do basic&#xD;
      activities of daily living will be assessed at study entry, just prior to surgery and then at&#xD;
      2, 6 and 12 weeks after surgery. Other measures of recovery will be distance covered while&#xD;
      walking for six minutes, quality of the walking, and how quickly participants can walk&#xD;
      outdoors for 1000 steps, and then 3000, 5000 and 9000. The investigators will ask&#xD;
      participants which of these outcome measures they think best reflected their recovery and&#xD;
      why. The investigators will also assess whether people were willing to enter the study and&#xD;
      complete all the processes required. The results of the study will indicate whether it is a&#xD;
      good idea to conduct a bigger study that would involve many centres in Canada.&#xD;
