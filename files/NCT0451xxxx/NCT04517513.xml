  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our objective is to establish a natural population cohort in East China based on the latest&#xD;
      scientific researches, preliminary findings of the project team, and a close cooperation&#xD;
      model of the Specialist Medical Consortium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, we will focus on the information and management status of high-risk, single-patient,&#xD;
      and co-occurring patient groups of cardio cerebral diseases such as coronary heart disease&#xD;
      and stroke. We plan to integrate the questionnaire data and sample database information into&#xD;
      the cardio-cerebral &quot;co-prevention and management&quot; information platform, in order to&#xD;
      establish a cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease management system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, we aim to develop a new risk prediction model for heart and brain diseases based on&#xD;
      the big data platform, lead the establishment of the &quot;co-prevention and management&quot;&#xD;
      innovation management model for cardio cerebral diseases, and explore an integrated and&#xD;
      innovative health management model for the prevention and treatment of cardio cerebral&#xD;
      diseases for China.&#xD;

      The research is based on a combination of retrospective, cross-sectional, and prospective&#xD;
      cohort studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the retrospective cohort study collects historical information of the studied&#xD;
      cohort from 2014 to 2018 from secondary medical units, residents' community health service&#xD;
      centers, emergency departments, and their health records. Patients' past diseases such as&#xD;
      hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, information on the&#xD;
      history of drug use, and lifestyle (if any) are collected and sorted out. Moreover,&#xD;
      information on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and death among members of the&#xD;
      cohort is collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cross-sectional study builds on the baseline research conducts during 2019-2020.&#xD;
      Specifically, baseline research contains the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Epidemiological survey: Design the Cardio-Cerebrovascular Disease Prevention and Control&#xD;
           Questionnaire in accordance with the principles and requirements of the cohort study. On&#xD;
           the premise of informed notification, data are collected through face-to-face interviews&#xD;
           between the studied cohort and investigators who signed the informed consent and&#xD;
           received uniform training. Quality control staff will review the questionnaire for&#xD;
           quality control. The main content includes demographic sociology, lifestyle, physical&#xD;
           exercise, daily eating habits, usage of dietary supplements, personal and family medical&#xD;
           history, psychological assessment, and female fertility history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physical examination: the examination is performed by the clinical professional&#xD;
           physician in the health service center. The examination content includes height, weight,&#xD;
           blood pressure, hearing, vision, internal surgery, body fat composition (optional),&#xD;
           chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, B-ultrasound, carotid ultrasound (optional), and&#xD;
           other imaging examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical biochemical test: fasting blood collection should be performed by all&#xD;
           individuals upon their enrollment. The blood samples collected are tested for&#xD;
           biochemistry, liver and kidney function, blood lipid analysis, and electrolyte analysis&#xD;
           in accordance with clinical testing requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Biological specimen collection: collect 10ml ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid blood&#xD;
           samples using a health checkup, then send them to renji sample bank for separation&#xD;
           within 2 hours, and store in -80℃ ultra-low temperature refrigerator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, the prospective study will be conducted from 2020 to 2025. Through annual active&#xD;
      (phone, face-to-face interview, etc.) and passive follow-ups, we track the health status of&#xD;
      the cohort including cardio-cerebral vascular disease occurrence, death, migration, etc.,&#xD;
      collect data that matches its baseline value, analyze the morbidity and mortality of the&#xD;
      cohort population, and grasp the morbidity, the order of the diseases, mortality, and order&#xD;
      of the cause of death for each disease, especially the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
