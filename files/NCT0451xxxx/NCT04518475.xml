      This multicenter randomized, open-label study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      eltrombopag combining rituximab with eltrombopag in China adult ITP patients .This study was&#xD;
      be conducted in adult ITP patients who had not responded to or had relapsed after previous&#xD;
      treatment of ITP, including first line therapy and /or splenectomy.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag&#xD;
      combining rituximab treating previously treated ITP patients compared to eltrombopag. The&#xD;
      secondary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of eltrombopag combining rituximab in ITP&#xD;
      patients with positive autoantibody compared to eltrombopag .In addition, health-related&#xD;
      quality of life (HRQoL) measure was assessed in all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      224 eligible subjects were randomized to either eltrombopag combining rituximab or&#xD;
      eltrombopag treatment in 1:1 ratio. 112 enrolled patients are randomly picked up to take&#xD;
      eltrombopag combining with rituximab at the indicated dose. 112 enrolled patients are&#xD;
      randomly picked up to take eltrombopag at the indicated dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial dose of eltrombopag administration was an oral 75 mg once daily in all&#xD;
      participants .The dose of eltrombopag was adjusted according to the subject platelet count&#xD;
      during the period from week 1 to week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in eltrombopag combining rituximab treatment group received single dose infusion of&#xD;
      rituximab 375 mg/m(2) within 14 days after enrollment.&#xD;
