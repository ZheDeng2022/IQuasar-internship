  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social emotional competence is instrumental to children's health and development. The&#xD;
      preschool edition of Promoting Alternative THinking Strategies (PATHS®) intervention was&#xD;
      tested in this study. PATHS® is a universal teacher implemented, and school-based&#xD;
      intervention. In the first years of this study, PATHS® which was originally developed in the&#xD;
      United States was adapted for a Swedish preschool context according to a theoretical model&#xD;
      for intervention cultural adaptation entitled the Planned Intervention Adaptation (PIA)&#xD;
      protocol. After the cultural adaptation process, a two-wave pre-posttest randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of PsPATHS was conducted with Swedish preschool aged children.&#xD;
      Implementation data were collected and outcome evaluation results are being finalized at the&#xD;
      time that this protocol is being submitted in August 2020.&#xD;

      Social emotional competence is instrumental to children's health and development. The&#xD;
      preschool edition of Promoting Alternative THinking Strategies (PATHS®) intervention was&#xD;
      tested in this study. PATHS® is a universal teacher implemented, and school-based&#xD;
      intervention that aims to give preschool children a strategically timed boost in social&#xD;
      emotional competence. Specifically, PATHS® encourages the use of interactive techniques to&#xD;
      bolster children's ability to self-regulate, increase their adeptness at social cognitive&#xD;
      problem solving, as well as to gain insight into their emotions and emotions of others. In&#xD;
      the first years of this study, PATHS® which was originally developed in the United States was&#xD;
      adapted for a Swedish preschool context according to a theoretical model for intervention&#xD;
      cultural adaptation entitled the Planned Intervention Adaptation (PIA) protocol. PIA calls&#xD;
      for specific small-scale research studies that guide the cultural adaptation of an imported&#xD;
      intervention. After the cultural adaptation process, a two-wave pre-posttest randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of PsPATHS was conducted with Swedish preschool aged children. The main&#xD;
      study, which this protocol documents was a two-wave pre to posttest, cluster randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial with multi-method and informant assessment (N = 285 four and five-year-old&#xD;
      Swedish children; 145 wait-list control and 140 intervention). Implementation data were&#xD;
      collected and outcome evaluation results are being finalized at the time that this protocol&#xD;
      is being submitted in August 2020.&#xD;
