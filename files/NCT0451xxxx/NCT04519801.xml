    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the proposed research is to conduct a prospective, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to investigate whether the addition of BFR therapy to standard&#xD;
      post-operative rehabilitation regimen significantly improves clinical outcomes following&#xD;
      anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) standardized with respect to both surgical&#xD;
      technique and graft selection. Patients indicated for ACLR will be screened and offered&#xD;
      enrollment into this prospective, randomized controlled trial. MRI of bilateral thighs will&#xD;
      be performed within 7 days of ACLR. Patients will be randomized to either REHAB or REHAB +&#xD;
      BFR (study intervention) using a block randomization scheme. Patients will undergo repeat MRI&#xD;
      of bilateral thighs at 16 weeks and 52 weeks post-operatively (primary outcome measure.)&#xD;
      Patient reported outcome (PRO) instruments will be administered pre-operatively to establish&#xD;
      pre-operative debility related to ACL injury and subsequently after ACLR at 24 weeks, 36&#xD;
      weeks, and 52 weeks post-operative (secondary outcome measures).&#xD;

      The overall objective of the proposed research is to conduct a prospective, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to investigate whether the addition of BFR therapy to standard&#xD;
      post-operative rehabilitation regimen significantly improves clinical outcomes following ACLR&#xD;
      standardized with respect to both surgical technique and graft selection. The investigator's&#xD;
      central hypothesis is that the addition of BFR therapy has the potential to accelerate&#xD;
      surgical recovery, expedite return-to-duty, and maximize medical readiness following ACLR. In&#xD;
      the proposed trial validated patient reported outcome measures will be used to assess for&#xD;
      functional clinical improvement, while quadriceps musculature cross sectional area (CSA) as&#xD;
      measured on MRI will be used to quantify the effect of therapy on quadriceps strength. The&#xD;
      rationale for using this modality is based upon the fact that the measurement of quadriceps&#xD;
      CSA and muscle volume as surrogates for overall quadriceps function is well described, and a&#xD;
      number of studies have convincingly demonstrated positive correlations between these&#xD;
      parameters and quadriceps strength4, 17. However, in spite of these reports, the acceptance&#xD;
      acknowledging MRI as a surrogate for quadriceps strength remains limited. Therefore,&#xD;
      isokinetic and isometric quadriceps strength of both the operative and non-operative knee&#xD;
      extensors (quadriceps) will be measured post-operatively at approximately 6 months and 9&#xD;
      months post operatively. MRI of bilateral thighs will be performed immediately prior to ACLR&#xD;
      to establish a baseline CSA in the operative and non-operative lower extremity. Then a repeat&#xD;
      MRI will be performed immediately following the conclusion of a standardized 16-week&#xD;
      post-operative rehabilitation regimen among patients randomized to either a standard&#xD;
      rehabilitation regimen (REHAB) or a rehabilitation regimen with BFR (REHAB + BFR.) Finally,&#xD;
      MRI will be repeated at 52 weeks post-operative to examine for latent changes in CSA once&#xD;
      patients have been returned to unrestricted physical activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: To determine if the addition of BFR therapy to a standard post-operative&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocol increases quadriceps muscle cross sectional area and volume after&#xD;
      ACLR as measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The addition of BFR therapy to a standard post-operative rehabilitation regimen&#xD;
      following ACLR will increase quadriceps muscle CSA and volume when compared to a standard&#xD;
      post-operative rehabilitation regimen measured at 16 weeks post-operative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: To determine if any observed increases in quadriceps muscle CSA and volume are&#xD;
      sustained beyond the cessation of BFR therapy at 16-weeks post-operative by performing repeat&#xD;
      MRI at 52 weeks post-operative&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Observed increases in quadriceps muscle CSA and volume will be sustained beyond&#xD;
      the cessation of BFR therapy at 52 weeks post-operative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 3: To determine if CSA measurements obtained by MRI reliably predict knee extensor&#xD;
      strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: CSA measurements obtained by MRI reliably predict knee extensor strength as&#xD;
      measured by isokinetic and isometric testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 4: To determine if the addition of BFR therapy to a standard post-operative&#xD;
      rehabilitation regimen following ACLR results in significantly improved functional outcomes&#xD;
      when compared to a standard post-operative rehabilitation regimen at 24, 36, and 52 weeks&#xD;
      post-operative using patient reported outcomes (PRO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The addition of BFR therapy to a standard post-operative rehabilitation regimen&#xD;
      following ACLR will result in significantly improved PRO when compared to a standard&#xD;
      post-operative rehabilitation regimen at 24, 36, and 52-weeks post-operative.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3, 6, and 12 months post-operative clinical follow-up appointments</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity that has been frequently reported among adults. The simplest VAS is represented as a horizontal 10 cm line. The ends are defined as the extreme limits of parameter being measured (e.g. pain) oriented from the left (worst) to the right (best.) Patients are asked mark their perceived level of pain on the horizontal line. The VAS score is determined by measuring in mm from the left hand end of the horizontal line to where the patient marks. A higher score represents greater pain intensity.</description>

    <description>Comprised of 8 items (limp, support, locking, instability, pain, swelling, stair climbing, squatting), which patients are asked a series of questions to characterize their experiences with respect to each of these 8 items.

    <measure>Patient Reported Outcome - International Knee Documentation Committee Form (IKDC)</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, and 12 months post-operative clinical follow-up appointments</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire is broken down into three categories: symptoms, sports activity, and knee function. The symptoms subscale focuses on an assessment of pain, stiffness, swelling, and the sensation of &quot;giving-way&quot; of the knee. The sports activity subscale focuses on completion of tasks such as going up and down stairs, rising from a seated position, squatting, and jumping. The knee function subscale asks the respondent to characterize their knee at present versus prior to injury. The IKDC is scored out of 100 points, with a score of 100 representing optimal knee function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported Outcome - Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, and 12 months post-operative clinical follow-up appointments</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS is a comprehensive scoring system that evaluates both short and long-term consequence of knee injury. It is comprised of 42 items, which are scored separately in 5 subscales (pain (9 items), other symptoms (7 items), function in daily living (17 items), function in sport and recreation (5 items), and knee-related quality of life (5 items).) Among the strengths of the KOOS as a PRO is its inclusion of two different subscales for physical function relating to daily life, sport, and recreation. A score of 100 represents no knee symptoms, which is then converted to a percentage score to characterize a patient's overall satisfaction with their knee function.</description>
