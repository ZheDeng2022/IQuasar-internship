  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with glioblastoma have impaired cognitive function, autonomy, and quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical situation, combined with a limited life expectancy, makes the preservation of&#xD;
      quality of life a major objective, in a supportive environment that respects family&#xD;
      integration. This is especially true since there is an established relationship between&#xD;
      health-related quality of life, as measured by questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, and despite the lack of impact on overall survival, improving quality of&#xD;
      life becomes a priority objective in recent Phase III trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of introducing early accompaniment in GBM should be assessed in the&#xD;
      diagnostic and therapeutic announcement environment. In order to measure the expected impact&#xD;
      as favorable in the patient and his family, a broad survey of the classic domains of quality&#xD;
      of life and more specifically dedicated to neurological symptomatology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      glioblastomas are the most common primary malignant tumours of the central nervous&#xD;
      system.They represent about 2000 new cases per year in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite active treatments including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, patient survival&#xD;
      is limited without possible cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients with glioblastoma have impaired cognitive function, autonomy, and quality of&#xD;
      life. Exploration of verbal memory in these patients shows that its deterioration is&#xD;
      correlated with a more unfavourable prognosis, after adjustment with other usual prognostic&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical situation, combined with a limited life expectancy, makes the preservation of&#xD;
      quality of life a major objective, in a supportive environment that respects family&#xD;
      integration. This is especially true since there is an established relationship between&#xD;
