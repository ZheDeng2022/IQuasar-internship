  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to facilitate the recognition and early management of Immune&#xD;
      Related Adverse Events (irAEs) experienced by cancer patients taking immunotherapy. This is&#xD;
      done through the development of a web-based platform in which patients receive valuable&#xD;
      education about irAEs, patients' irAEs are routinely monitored, patient reported irAEs are&#xD;
      embedded into patient clinical care, and patient-provider communication and prompt management&#xD;
      of irAEs is facilitated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention component includes access to the web-based platform, routine monitoring of&#xD;
      irAEs every week for twelve weeks and then bi-weekly for an additional eight weeks, and&#xD;
      messages to healthcare providers and patients if a reported irAE is deemed severe enough that&#xD;
      it warrants provider attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomized into either an intervention group (described above) or a control&#xD;
      group, in which their irAEs are monitored once after a twelve week interval and again after&#xD;
      an additional eight weeks. Additionally, both intervention and control participants complete&#xD;
      three assessments: baseline (at the beginning of the research study), 12-week follow-up, and&#xD;
      20-week follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Experiencing adverse events can compromise the clinical benefit of a cancer treatment, and&#xD;
      may go undetected by clinicians. Specific to checkpoint inhibitors, Immune Related Adverse&#xD;
      Events (irAEs) include symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, skin reactions, nausea or&#xD;
      vomiting, diarrhea as well as colitis, liver toxicities, and endocrinopathies. A systematic&#xD;
      review for 50 clinical trials with a total of 5,071 patients receiving immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors revealed that grade 3 or 4 irAEs were present in up to 66% of patients. In&#xD;
      general, if irAEs are detected quickly, they are reversible and manageable with&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy. However, severe or life-threatening irAEs may lead to&#xD;
      discontinuation of the checkpoint inhibitor, which can lead to cancer progression and&#xD;
      ultimately patient mortality. Therefore, prompt recognition and management of irAEs before&#xD;
      they become severe can prevent irAEs that may be life-threatening as well as prevent&#xD;
      discontinuation of checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Web-based interventions provide flexibility and overcome many obstacles to accessibility for&#xD;
      patients who may not be able to meet at a certain location due to disease-related physical&#xD;
      limitations or logistical limitations. Specific to cancer, web-based interventions have&#xD;
      demonstrated efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms, distress, and improved functional&#xD;
      well-being among patients with cancer. Finally, web based platforms are useful for monitoring&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes and linking outcomes to providers. Overall, web-based monitoring&#xD;
      and embedding of patient-reported adverse events into clinical care can improve cancer&#xD;
      outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, no study has established the efficacy of a platform&#xD;
      that links patient-reported irAEs to oncology providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary outcome will measure the feasibility of the digital health program,&#xD;
      ImmunOncoTool. Our secondary outcome will be the preliminary intended effects of&#xD;
      ImmunOncoTool which will be assessed through endpoints such as clinician response and time to&#xD;
      clinician response of patient-reported irAEs, number and length of unscheduled breaks in&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor treatment and discontinuation of checkpoint inhibitor treatment, length&#xD;
      of time spent managing any irAEs, provider reported irAEs, and concurrence between&#xD;
      patientreported irAE and provider reported irAEs as these factors may explain the effect of&#xD;
      ImmunOncoTool on improved clinical outcomes.&#xD;

    <measure>Demand of ImmunOncoTool: Recruitment Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We assess demand of the ImmunOncoTool application through study recruitment. Based on previous psychosocial and behavioral studies in oncology, an 80% recruitment rate is considered an adequate level of demand.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Demand of ImmunOncoTool: Retention Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Another way we assess demand of the ImmunOncoTool application is through participant retention. Based on previous psychosocial and behavioral studies in oncology, an 80% retention rate is considered an adequate level of demand.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of ImmunOncoTool</measure>
    <time_frame>T2 (immediately following 12 week intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>To assess acceptability, all participants are asked to complete an exit interview on ImmunOncoTool. This interview assesses usefulness, satisfaction, learnability and usability of the application. This exit interview was synthesized from validated measures assessing eHealth intervention feasibility, and was adapted for our study to better fit our target population and our application design. Above average scores on the questionnaire are considered acceptable. The satisfaction questionnaire is administered over the phone immediately following the 12 week intervention.</description>
