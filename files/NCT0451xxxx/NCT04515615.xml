    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single arm, multi-center phase II clinical trial. The primary&#xD;
      study objective is to evaluate the safety of tegafur gimeracil oteracil potassium capsule&#xD;
      plus oxaliplatin and Camrelizumab as adjuvant therapy in stage III gastric cancer, including&#xD;
      the incidences and types of adverse events. The secondary study objective is to observe and&#xD;
      evaluate the disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) and treatment completion&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;

      1. Study population: participants with stage III gastric cancer confirmed by postoperative&#xD;
           pathology according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) / Union for&#xD;
           International Cancer Control (UICC) 8th Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) staging&#xD;
           classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sample size: single arm design was used in this study and 52 participants were estimated&#xD;
           to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research content: In this study, within 4-6 weeks after the completion of the operation,&#xD;
           the participants were selected and qualified for this study, and were scheduled to&#xD;
           receive 200mg camrelizumab once intravenous infusion on the first day (q3w), then&#xD;
           130mg/m^2 oxaliplatin on the first day (q3w), and tegafur gimeracil oteracil potassium&#xD;
           capsule was taken as follow: surface area is less than 1.25, 80mg per day, twice a day;&#xD;
           ≥1.25 ~ &lt;1.5, 100mg per day, twice a day; ≥1.5, 120mg per day, twice a day, and oral&#xD;
           administration for 1-14 days every 3 weeks. Three weeks as a course of treatment, a&#xD;
           total of 8 courses, after treatment, safety visit and survival follow-up will be carried&#xD;
           out. A total of 3 years follow-up time is scheduled since the first medication, and the&#xD;
           frequency is once every 3-6 months within 2 years, and once every 6-12 months for the&#xD;
           third year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Adverse events (AEs) management: To minimize the risk of AEs, the investigators will&#xD;
           monitor carefully to determine whether or not they are within the expected range. The&#xD;
           degree of AEs is evaluated according to The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology&#xD;
           Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE v 4.0). Investigators will also conduct a&#xD;
           thorough examination and adopt an appropriate system to take any necessary measures to&#xD;
           deal with AEs.&#xD;
