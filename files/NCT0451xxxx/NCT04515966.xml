  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is caused by compression of a nerve called the median nerve as&#xD;
      it travels through a narrow tunnel within the wrist on its way to the hand. Compression of&#xD;
      the median nerve causes numbness, tingling, pain and weakness of the hand and fingers. CTS is&#xD;
      usually treated with rest or a change in the activity level. It can also be treated with a&#xD;
      splint that limits bending of the hand and wrist. Other treatments include a steroid&#xD;
      injection near the median nerve. Surgery can be performed if the symptoms are severe or&#xD;
      persistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compression of the median nerve can cause swelling that may be observed with ultrasound of&#xD;
      the wrist. Ultrasound can also be used to help guide the needle to inject the steroid&#xD;
      solution in close proximity to the median nerve while avoiding injury to the nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to compare the effectiveness of a splint and an ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      steroid injection in the treatment of mild to moderate CTS. Individuals with CTS who agree to&#xD;
      participate, will be randomly assigned to two groups. One group will be treated with a splint&#xD;
      and the other with a steroid injection performed under ultrasound guidance. The severity of&#xD;
      CTS symptoms will be determined prior to beginning the study and also at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6&#xD;
      months and 1 year following each of the two treatment interventions. The median nerve size&#xD;
      (diameter) will be measured in all participants prior to beginning the study and also&#xD;
      following both treatment interventions at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the study, the investigators will determine which of the two treatments,&#xD;
      splint or steroid injection, is more effective in alleviating CTS symptoms. The investigators&#xD;
      will also determine if either or both treatments result in a change in swelling of the median&#xD;
      nerve as measured by ultrasound.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine which of two commonly used therapeutic interventions&#xD;
      for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), steroid injection or wrist splint, is more&#xD;
      effective in alleviating symptoms. The protocol has been approved by the Medical Research&#xD;
      Committee and by the Institutional Review Board, Mercy Health, Youngstown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The steroid injection will be administered under ultrasound guidance to ensure proper&#xD;
      placement of the needle in close proximity to the median nerve within the carpal tunnel and&#xD;
      to minimize the risk of direct trauma to the nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates for the study will be individuals with CTS presenting to primary care offices&#xD;
      located in the Boardman, Ohio area. Following a detailed explanation of the study purpose and&#xD;
      protocol, those individuals who agree to participate will be asked to sign an informed&#xD;
      consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete history and physical examination will be performed on all participants to confirm&#xD;
      the diagnosis. Additionally, baseline ultrasound measurement of the median nerve&#xD;
      cross-sectional area within the carpal tunnel will be performed on all participants. The&#xD;
      diagnosis of CTS will be made on clinical grounds, and the CTS-6 evaluation tool will also be&#xD;
      used in the diagnostic evaluation. A score above 12 will be considered consistent with CTS.&#xD;
      Participants with moderately severe CTS will undergo a nerve conduction study to confirm the&#xD;
      diagnosis and exclude early signs of denervation which may require surgical decompression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into two groups of thirty-five patients each; those in group&#xD;
      A will undergo ultrasound-guided steroid injection and those in group B will be asked to wear&#xD;
      a standard carpal tunnel splint. Participants will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      intervention group with the use of a computer-generated random sequence of numbers from 1 to&#xD;
      70. The primary investigator (Roy Morcos) will be responsible for maintaining confidential&#xD;
      records in a secure location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injections will be performed by Dr. Morcos and Dr. Dhungana. Dr. Morcos received training&#xD;
      in ultrasonography during a fellowship program and has published on the subject. He has been&#xD;
      performing ultrasound examinations and injections for the past 35 years. Dr. Dhungana is an&#xD;
      orthopedic surgeon with expertise in carpal tunnel steroid injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the participant seated and the forearm supinated, the wrist is slightly dorsiflexed. The&#xD;
      median nerve is identified with real-time ultrasonography and its cross-sectional area&#xD;
      measured. Injection near the median nerve within the carpal tunnel is performed under aseptic&#xD;
      technique and ultrasound guidance, using a 25-gauge needle to minimize discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: A mixture of 0.5 ml of depo-Medrol (methylprednisolone acetate 40mg/ml) and 0.5 mL&#xD;
      of 1% lidocaine will be injected into the carpal tunnel under ultrasound guidance in close&#xD;
      proximity to the median nerve. After completion of the injection, the distal carpal tunnel is&#xD;
      scanned to ensure even injectate distribution within the distal aspect of the carpal tunnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Patients in this group will be advised to wear a standard carpal tunnel splint with&#xD;
      the hand in neutral position. The splint will be provided to all participants. They will be&#xD;
      advised to wear it during the night and most of the time during day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The median nerve cross-sectional area is measured in all patients at baseline, 6 weeks and 3&#xD;
      months following interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up is scheduled 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and one year. At each follow-up visit,&#xD;
      clinical evaluation is obtained using the BCTQ score, which determines the degree of&#xD;
      symptomatic severity and functional recovery. A visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, 0 for no&#xD;
      pain and 10 for severe unbearable pain, will also be obtained. Follow-up will continue for a&#xD;
      year including history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the data using the mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation, and median. For parameter with subset scales and values, box and whisker plots&#xD;
      will be used to show patterns of parameter behavior. Where levels of measures are&#xD;
      appropriate, independent samples t-tests are performed to compare outcomes of each&#xD;
      intervention. Where appropriate, a non-parametric test such as the Mann-Whitney U test, is&#xD;
      used to assess differences of parameter values both over periods of follow up and between two&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measures of effect are as follows: Pain, Symptom severity, Functional disability, Median&#xD;
      nerve diameter, Median nerve cross sectional area. Three of the parameters are from arbitrary&#xD;
      scales consisting of standard questionnaires. Two of the parameters are composite values&#xD;
      derived from scores with differing weightings. Two anatomic measures are based on metric&#xD;
      measurements obtained by ultrasound. All measures will be taken before treatment and at 6&#xD;
      weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months and 1 year. Based on an assumed BCTS Pain Score treatment effect of&#xD;
      1.5 with standard deviation of 3.0 with 2-sided Î± of 0.05 and a power of 0.87, the minimum&#xD;
      required sample size in each study group is 32. Considering loss to follow-up over a period&#xD;
      of one year, the investigators plan to recruit 70 subjects.&#xD;
