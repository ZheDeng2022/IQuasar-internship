  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This partnership between Talkspace and the UW ALACRITY Center will determine how effective&#xD;
      unlimited text-based psychotherapy for depression is when compared to once-a-week&#xD;
      psychotherapy. This study will also determine what the best treatment options are for people&#xD;
      who are not responding well to either unlimited texting or weekly psychotherapy. The results&#xD;
      of this study will be a new product version of message-based care that can tailor&#xD;
      psychotherapy intensity based on the needs of future consumers with depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a fast track SBIR proposal that will (1) test the effectiveness of daily,&#xD;
      message-based psychotherapy (MBP) for depression, compared to traditionally delivered,&#xD;
      video-chat psychotherapy (VCP) and (2) develop an evidence-based treatment sequence for those&#xD;
      who do not respond to either daily MBP or VCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 consists of a pilot study to determine the best incentive model to retain a sample of&#xD;
      people 18 years old and older with depression into a SMART trial. Information from this pilot&#xD;
      will inform the retention strategy for Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 is a 12-week, randomized clinical trial using a SMART design to test the following&#xD;
      aims: 1. Determine the relative effectiveness of daily MBP compared to weekly VCP in treating&#xD;
      symptoms of depression and improving social functioning; 2. For those who fail to respond to&#xD;
      6 weeks of weekly VCP only, determine whether the addition of daily messaging, or a switch to&#xD;
      monthly video-chat plus daily messaging improves depression and functional outcomes; and 3.&#xD;
      For those who fail to respond to 6 weeks of daily MBP, whether the addition of monthly&#xD;
      video-chat or weekly video-chat improves outcomes. Participants will provide data on mood,&#xD;
      activity, and functioning, and we will collect data on use of treatment (texts and sessions),&#xD;
      and working alliance.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Phase 1 will test the effectiveness of two forms of participant retention methods into a SMART (sequential, multiple assignment, randomized). In Phase 1, participants (n=200) will be randomized to an incentive level and then randomized to treatment arms. Phase 2 (n=1000) will be the subsequent SMART design comparing message-based psychotherapy (MBP) to video-chat psychotherapy (VCP) in level 1 and for those who do not respond to care after 6 weeks, those participants will be randomized to either MBP+monthly VCP or MBP+weekly VCP.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sheehan Disability Assessment Scale (SDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline SDS at 6 weeks and 12 weeks after treatment starts</time_frame>
    <description>Phase 2: The SDS will be used as measure of disability/functional status. This is a brief analog disability scale, which uses visual-spatial, numeric and verbal anchors. The scale has been validated in medical and psychiatric populations with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline PHQ-9 at 6 weeks and 12 weeks after treatment starts</time_frame>
    <description>Phase 2: The PHQ-9 consists of 9 depression items and one disability item. Each time is associated with a DMS symptom of depression, which the participant rates whether or not they have experienced the symptom over the last two weeks, with severity rating of 0-3. It is one of the few measures that is brief (it takes less than one minute to give) and has been found to have excellent sensitivity to change over time.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline GAD-7 at 6 weeks and 12 weeks after treatment starts</time_frame>
    <description>Phase 2: To assess for co-occurring anxiety, we will use the GAD-7, a 7- item screener for generalized anxiety. It consists of items related to GAD. Participants rate on a scale of 0-3 how much they have experienced in the last two weeks. The scale is a valid screener for GAD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Expectations about Treatment (TRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Phase 2: Expectations about treatment can influence outcomes. To assess participant expectations, we will administer the Treatment Rationale Scale (TRS), a 4-item scale administered before the 2nd and last session. The scale assesses patient expectations about the success of treatment.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Experience of Care and Health Outcomes Survey (ECHO)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks after treatment starts</time_frame>
    <description>Phase 2: ECHO items assess whether consumers received timely treatment, enough information to support self-management, and were involved in treatment as much as they wanted. ECHO is a reliable instrument with alpha = .85.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Working Alliance Inventory (WAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks after treatment starts</time_frame>
    <description>Phase 2: The WAI is a 12-item measure of therapeutic alliance (relationship between the consumer and therapist or coach). It is a reliable measure of alliance, with alpha = .92.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Tailoring Variable - Clinician-Administered PHQ-9</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks after treatment starts</time_frame>
    <description>Phase 2: To determine whether patients move to level II treatment we will used clinician administered PHQ9 at week 6 of treatment. Anyone falling below a 50% change in baseline PHQ9 scores will be switch to either the Platinum Plan (PP) condition or Ultimate Plan (UP) condition.</description>

    <intervention_name>Video-chat psychotherapy (VCP)</intervention_name>
    <description>Video Chat Only (VCP) consists of weekly psychotherapy appointments that last between 30-45 minutes. These sessions are conducted using Agora, a secure, HIPAA-compliant video conferencing service that is seamlessly integrated into the Talkspace platform application. Therapists will provide evidence-based treatments for depression and anxiety.</description>

    <intervention_name>Message-based psychotherapy (MBP)</intervention_name>
    <description>Message-Based Psychotherapy (MBP) allows patients to chat with an assigned licensed therapist as frequently as they wish. After consumers complete an intake and select a therapist, the consumer can begin chatting with their therapist right away, and as often as they wish. Therapists respond to text within 15 minutes to an hour during office hours, and within 14 hours outside of office hours. Thus, MBP is not fully synchronous. This enables therapists to deliver care to a larger number of patients than is possible under synchronous methods by disentangling the therapist's time from the patient's time to respond. It also has the potential to improve quality as it gives the therapist time to think through the most effective response and intervention. MBP will be based on CBT, PST or IPT intervention strategies.</description>
