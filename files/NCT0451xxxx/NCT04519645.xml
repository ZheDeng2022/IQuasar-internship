      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of lacosamide (LCM) versus an Active&#xD;
      Comparator chosen based on standard of care (StOC) in severe and nonsevere seizure burden&#xD;
      (defined as total minutes of electroencephalographic neonatal seizures (ENS) per hour) in&#xD;
      neonates with seizures that are not adequately controlled with previous anti-epileptic drug&#xD;
      (AED) treatment.&#xD;

    <description>A responder is defined as a study participant who achieved the following reduction in seizure burden without need for rescue medication, compared with the seizure burden measured during the Baseline Period immediately prior to the study medication administration, evaluated for a 2-hour period starting 1 hour after the start of initial treatment:&#xD;
At least 80% reduction of seizure burden in participants who were categorized by the Investigator as having non-severe seizure burden during Baseline OR At least 50% reduction of seizure burden in participants who were categorized by the Investigator as having severe seizure burden during Baseline</description>

    <time_frame>At 24 hours after start of the Treatment Period, compared with Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>For the study participants with nonsevere seizure burden at Baseline (as determined by the Investigator), the numerator is defined as the number of participants with nonsevere seizure burden at Baseline who had no seizures between 23 and 24 hours after the start of the Treatment Period. If less than 30 minutes of interpretable video-EEG are available between 23 and 24 hours after first dose then the response will be determined based on the seizure burden for the most recent 30 minutes of interpretable video-EEG between 20 and 24 hours after the start of the Treatment Period. The 30 minutes of video-EEG does not need to be continuous. If less than 30 minutes of interpretable video-EEG are available between 20 and 24 hours after first dose then seizure freedom at 24 hours will be regarded as missing. This is similarly done for severe burden.</description>

    <measure>Categorized percentage change in seizure burden in the Evaluation video-EEG compared with the Baseline video-EEG</measure>

    <description>The change in seizure burden will be presented in the following categories: (&lt;-25% [worsening], -25% to &lt;25% [no change], 25% to &lt;50%, 50% to &lt;80%, and ≥80%)</description>

    <time_frame>From first administration of study treatment to the End of Safety Follow-up Period (up to Day 42)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study medication, whether or not considered related to the study medication.&#xD;
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study medication.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data from this trial may be requested by qualified researchers six months after product approval in the US and/or Europe, or global development is discontinued, and 18 months after trial completion. Investigators may request access to anonymized individual patient-level data and redacted trial documents which may include: analysis-ready datasets, study protocol, annotated case report form, statistical analysis plan, dataset specifications, and clinical study report. Prior to use of the data, proposals need to be approved by an independent review panel at www.Vivli.org and a signed data sharing agreement will need to be executed. All documents are available in English only, for a prespecified time, typically 12 months, on a password protected portal. This plan may change if the risk of re-identifying trial participants is determined to be too high after the trial is completed; in this case and to protect participants, individual patient-level data would not be made available.</ipd_description>
