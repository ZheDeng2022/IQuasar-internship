      This study is a single-center, non-randomized, open label, no control, prospective clinical&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ex-vivo expanded allogeneic γδT&#xD;
      cells from of a blood-related donor of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Patients. This study&#xD;
      will include the following sequential phases: sign informed consent, γδT cell pre-culture,&#xD;
      screening and registration to the trial, apheresis, γδT cell preparation, treatments and&#xD;
