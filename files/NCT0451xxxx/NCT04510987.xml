  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BAY2433334 is under clinical development for prevention of complications in diseases such as&#xD;
      heart attack, irregular heart beat or stroke which can arise by formation of blood clots&#xD;
      elsewhere in the body and travels through the blood stream to plug another vessel. Renal&#xD;
      impairment which co-occurs in elderly and patients with heart attack, irregular heart beat or&#xD;
      stroke is a common condition in which the kidneys are not filtering the blood as well as they&#xD;
      should. The goal of the study is to learn more about the safety of BAY2433334, how it is&#xD;
      tolerated and the way the body absorbs, distributes and gets rid of the study dug given as a&#xD;
      single oral dose of 25 mg tablet in participants with renal impairment and healthy&#xD;
      participants matched for age-, gender-, and weight.&#xD;

As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014. Interested researchers can use www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com to request access to anonymized patient-level data and supporting documents from clinical studies to conduct research.
