  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In psychiatry, insight refers to the ability of patients to recognize their abnormal mental&#xD;
      experiences and seek treatment actively. Impaired insight is one of the key factors in the&#xD;
      development of schizophrenia, which determines the clinical outcome and functional prognosis.&#xD;
      Based on previous literatures and the applicant's research, the hypothesis was proposed that&#xD;
      the neural circuit of medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)-precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex&#xD;
      (PC/PCC), involving in the self-referential tasks, is the core circuit of impaired insight in&#xD;
      psychosis. This project intends to recruit patients with clinical high-risk for psychosis,&#xD;
      with vary degree of impaired insight, and introduces deep transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (dTMS) to regulate MPFC activity. Meanwhile, reality-monitoring ability under eye movement&#xD;
      tracker will be tested. Furthermore, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to observe&#xD;
      resting-state functional connectivity of MPFC-PC/PCC. This study will provide new evidence&#xD;
      for its precise intervention targets.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will conduct randomized and controlled experimental design, including deep&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) and sham stimulation (SH-dTMS). Each included&#xD;
      participant will be given informed consent and then randomly assigned to different montage of&#xD;
      stimulation. Participants are blind to the dTMS montage. Researchers in this study will&#xD;
      include clinical evaluators, laboratory inspectors, dTMS operators, and statistical analysts.&#xD;
      Before unblinding, each group of researchers will have no access to the information collected&#xD;
      by the other groups. For example, except the dTMS operators, no one knows which stimulus&#xD;
      montage any of the participants receive. The sessions of dTMS will be conducted twice daily&#xD;
      for 5 consecutive days, and twice sessions of a day will be separated by 3 hours at least.&#xD;
      Clinical assessments and laboratory tests will be administered at baseline, at the end of the&#xD;
      last session, and at the three-month node after the end of dTMS treatment. After the&#xD;
      three-month observation, first stage unblinding will be conducted. At this moment, dTMS&#xD;
      operators will provide the groups of A and B, but no corresponding montage, to the&#xD;
      statistical analysts. After analyzing the differences between the two groups, second stage&#xD;
      unblinding will be performed and the results of the clinical trial will be further analyzed&#xD;
      by revealing the corresponding stimulus montage of each group. This study will be implemented&#xD;
      at a single center, the Shanghai Mental Health Center (SMHC).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in clinical insight</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, five days, One month and three month</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical insight will be assessed using SAI. SAI is a semi-structured interview tools including seven items, with a total score of 14, 0-6 for recognition of illness, 0-4 for relabeling of psychotic phenomena, and 0-4 for treatment compliance. Patients, with less than 3 scores on recognition of illness, 2 on relabeling of psychotic phenomena, and 2 on treatment compliance, are considered to be improved on insight.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive insight</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, five days, One month and three month</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive insight will be assessed using BCIS. BCIS, developed by Beck et al., is a self-report questionnaire with 15 items. BCIS includes two subscales: Self-Reflectiveness (SR) and Self-Certainty (SC). The total score of BCIS is calculated from the score of SR minus that of SC, which is referred to as the composite cognitive insight index (CCII). When participants scores 10 or above on CCII, it indicates that they have good cognitive insight.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, One month and three month</time_frame>
    <description>Reality monitoring ability refers to distinguish internally self-generated information from externally-derived information. The test will be carried out by the experimental paradigm of reality monitoring ability.The stimulus materials are easy to be accepted and understood by patients with mental illness.The material consisted of 48 pairs of familiar pictures and was divided into two tests, each consisting of a learning and a testing phase. In the learning phase, 24 pictures will be presented with different combinations of conditions (four combinations of &quot;perceptive/imaginative Ã— left/right&quot; conditions). In the testing phase, one object will be presented and the participants will be asked to decide whether the other paired object is perceptive or imaginative, or whether the image is positioned on the left or right side of the screen.</description>
