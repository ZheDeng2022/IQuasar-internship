      The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sintilimab&#xD;
      for Consolidation Therapy After Radical Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Locally Advanced&#xD;
      Unresectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In China, the incidence of esophageal cancer has declined in recent years, but the mortality&#xD;
      rate has been ranked fourth. Morbidity and mortality were ranked sixth and fourth in all&#xD;
      malignancies, respectively. Therefore, esophageal cancer has always been a major malignant&#xD;
      tumor that threatens the health of our residents.We designed a single-arm, open-label, phase&#xD;
      II trial of Sintilimab for consolidation therapy after radical concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapylocally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sintilimab for consolidation&#xD;
      therapy after radical concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced unresectable&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
