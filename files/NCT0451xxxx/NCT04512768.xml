  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transdiagnostic Internet-delivered Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (ICBT) is an efficacious&#xD;
      treatment option for anxiety and depression; however, not all patients benefit equally and&#xD;
      some leave treatment before program completion. Comorbid symptoms of insomnia are extremely&#xD;
      common among individuals seeking ICBT, yet sleep problems are rarely a primary focus of&#xD;
      treatment in transdiagnostic ICBT despite insomnia being a known risk factor for anxiety and&#xD;
      depression. This trial is designed to test whether an ICBT program for anxiety and depression&#xD;
      can be improved by providing therapy for insomnia alongside the standard transdiagnostic&#xD;
      program. For this randomized controlled trial, patients will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      either the standard ICBT program for anxiety and depression, which includes only brief&#xD;
      supplementary information about sleep (n = 68), or a modified version that includes a lesson&#xD;
      specifically on sleep (n = 132). The sleep lesson will introduce patients to two key&#xD;
      behavioural strategies: sleep restriction and stimulus control, which previous research has&#xD;
      demonstrated are effective at reducing insomnia. Patients will monitor their sleep throughout&#xD;
      treatment and will complete measures of insomnia, anxiety and depression before treatment, at&#xD;
      the end of the 8-week program, and 3 months after program conclusion to allow for a&#xD;
      comparison of patient outcomes and completion rates between conditions. The acceptability of&#xD;
      the new intervention will also be assessed by asking participants to provide feedback on the&#xD;
      new materials and to complete measures of treatment satisfaction and working alliance.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Week 1 (pre-treatment), Week 8 (post-treatment), Week 20 (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in symptoms of panic. The PDSS is a 7-item measure of common symptoms of panic disorder. Respondents answer each item on a 0-4 scale, producing a total score between 0 and 28.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 1 (pre-treatment), Week 8 (post-treatment), Week 20 (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in subjective disability ratings. The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) is a brief three item measure that asks respondents to rate how much their functioning has been impacted in three domains: social function, home functioning, and work functioning. With each item rated out of 10, the scale produces as maximum score of 30, indicating maximum disability.</description>

Patients will also be asked whether they would recommend the treatment to others. Patients will then complete the Working Alliance Inventory-Short a 12-item measure of the therapeutic alliance.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transdiagnostic Internet-delivered Cognitive Behaviour Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>All participants receive an 8-week transdiagnostic course for anxiety and depression called The Wellbeing Course, originally developed by Macquarie University, Australia. The course is comprised of 5 lessons, beginning with psychoeducation and an introduction to the cognitive behavioural model, and then introducing key skills for managing anxiety and depression, including thought challenging, de-arousal strategies, graded exposure, behavioural activation, and relapse prevention. The course also includes supplementary resources that briefly provide information on related common concerns, such as managing worry, communication, assertiveness, problem solving, and a brief resource on sleep that provides limited psychoeducation and sleep hygiene information. Participants receive weekly brief therapist support via secure message or telephone from qualified counselors (social workers, psychologists).</description>

    <intervention_name>Brief Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Insomnia</intervention_name>
    <description>A new sleep lesson will replace the existing resource, developed using a patient-oriented process, that provides information and skills to aid with insomnia. The sleep lesson includes psychoeducation on the nature of sleep problems and factors that affect sleep, such as circadian rhythm. Two key behavioural strategies are introduced: sleep restriction, which requires the patient to avoid napping and sleep on a strict schedule for several weeks until they begin to feel naturally sleepy at night; and stimulus control, which asks the participant to only spend time in bed when prepared to sleep and avoid other activities (e.g., work, TV) in bed. Patients will record how much they sleep each night and provide ratings of sleep quality and fatigue each week. Therapists will support patients in adjusting their sleep schedule. Patients are encouraged to apply skills they learn during the Wellbeing Course to sleep problems, for example, by applying thought challenging to beliefs about sleep.</description>
