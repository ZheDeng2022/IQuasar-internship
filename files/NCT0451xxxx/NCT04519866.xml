  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) is a chronic disease that causes severe disability and poor&#xD;
      quality of life. Current treatment options are limited and there are still significant&#xD;
      non-responders to current western medications. Manual acupuncture has been shown to reduce&#xD;
      pain in patients with AxSpA. There have been reports of electroacupuncture demonstrating more&#xD;
      sustained pain relief. Therefore, the investigators aim to determine the clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of electroacupuncture as compared to manual&#xD;
      acupuncture for patients with AxSpA through a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with active axial spondyloarthritis despite non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
      (NSAIDs) or biologics, will be randomly allocated to receive electroacupuncture or manual&#xD;
      acupuncture on a 1:1 basis via random permuted block randomization. All patients will receive&#xD;
      their standard of care (drug therapy and physiotherapy) as background therapy. This study&#xD;
      will not be investigating any therapeutic or medicinal products (drugs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome would be the mean difference in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity&#xD;
      Index (BASDAI) score between the 2 groups over 12 weeks (as assessed at weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, 12)&#xD;
      adjusted for baseline covariate and other potential confounders. Patients will be followed up&#xD;
      for BASDAI, other clinical, quality of life (QoL), economic outcomes as well as Traditional&#xD;
      Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndrome scores over time for secondary and exploratory outcomes. A&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed. Adverse events will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that electroacupuncture may result in better disease activity&#xD;
      control in patients with AxSpA as compared to manual acupuncture over 12 weeks, while&#xD;
      secondary hypothesis is that electroacupuncture may result in greater improvements in other&#xD;
      clinical and quality of life outcomes as compared to those receiving manual acupuncture over&#xD;
      24 weeks. The investigators also hypothesize that there is no difference in safety between&#xD;
      both arms.&#xD;

    <description>Manual acupuncture (see procedures below) will be administered first to obtain the &quot;de qi&quot; sensation. After &quot;de qi&quot; is obtained, the electroacupuncture unit will be connected to 1-3 pairs of acupoints. Current intensity used will be based on the tolerance of each patient. Needles with electrical stimulation will be retained for 30 min.&#xD;
Main acupoints will be Jingjin points (meridian sinews) along the Bladder meridian of Foot - Taiyang, such as Shenshuci, as well as Jingjin points (meridian sinews) at transverse process from L2 to L4, iliac crest and spinous process from S1 to S4. Secondary acupoints will also be selected based on patients' syndromes and symptoms.</description>

    <description>After disinfecting the acupuncture points, acupuncture will be performed with the patient lying prone. Depending on the acupuncture points, 0.25mm X 25-75 mm sterile acupuncture needle will be used. Needles will be inserted 10-50 mm and either rotating manipulation or lifting-thrusting manipulation will be used to achieve &quot;de qi&quot; (a compositional sensation including soreness, numbness, distention and heaviness).&#xD;
Acupoints used will be similar to those mentioned for electroacupuncture (see above).</description>
