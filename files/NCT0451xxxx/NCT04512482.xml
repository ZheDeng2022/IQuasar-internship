  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the impact of a bromelain pre-rinse adjunct on oral plaque&#xD;
      removal in orthodontic subjects. The study's null hypothesis states that there is no&#xD;
      statistically significant difference in visual plaque scores among orthodontic subjects with&#xD;
      or without proteolytic enzyme rinse aid.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bromelain, a naturally occurring cysteine protease, from pineapple stalks, is used in food&#xD;
      and medical industries and listed on the FDA's &quot;Generally Recognized As Safe&quot; (GRAS) list. In&#xD;
      vitro bromelain study demonstrated antibacterial effect on oral pathogens. Bromelain was&#xD;
      found to prevent biofilm formation by interfering with bacteria-bacteria adhesion and/or&#xD;
      adhesion to enamel surface. Clinical trials with toothpaste containing bromelain demonstrated&#xD;
      improved plaque and gingivitis scores and extrinsic enamel stain removal capabilities. The&#xD;
      impact of bromelain application prior to traditional mechanisms of plaque removal have not&#xD;
      been clearly evaluated.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Enrolled subjects undergoing orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances will be randomized to receive either the Bromelain rinse or Placebo first and then will be crossed over to receive the opposite intervention. The study will consist of two treatment period (1 day) separated by a washout period of 1 week.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite Plaque Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The composite plaque score refers to the cumulative plaque score of all twelve teeth following the administration of the bromelain and placebo (powdered sugar) solutions. The composite plaque score scale had a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 48. A score of 0 indicated no plaque was observed on the teeth, while a a score of 48 indicated severe plaque on all possible tooth surfaces. A lower plaque score reflects a better outcome, while a higher plaque score a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Subjects were asked to chew a disclosing tablet, swish, and expectorate. Intraoral photographs were obtained. They then received a vial containing 1 gram of bromelain that was reconstituted with 15ml of pineapple juice at 50 degrees F. Subjects swished the solution in their mouth for 2 minutes and then expectorated. Intraoral photographs were obtained. Subjects then received a toothbrush and were asked to brush their teeth for 2 minutes. Intraoral photographs were obtained. The subjects were then given a Waterpik and instructed to use the appliances to clean their teeth and brackets to the best of their ability, for 2 minutes. Intraoral photographs were obtained. After a 1 week washout period, they received the placebo rinse (powdered sugar), following the same protocol and series of intraoral photographs.</description>

        <description>The composite plaque score refers to the cumulative plaque score of all twelve teeth following the administration of the bromelain and placebo (powdered sugar) solutions. The composite plaque score scale had a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 48. A score of 0 indicated no plaque was observed on the teeth, while a a score of 48 indicated severe plaque on all possible tooth surfaces. A lower plaque score reflects a better outcome, while a higher plaque score a worse outcome.</description>
