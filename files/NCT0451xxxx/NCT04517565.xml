  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project the accuracy of a novel, rapid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach to&#xD;
      detect brain abnormalities in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) will be tested; this&#xD;
      new imaging approach, that can create multiple types of MR images in about 5 minutes, without&#xD;
      contrast administration (and sedation even in young children), can be also readily applied in&#xD;
      other pediatric brain disorders in the future. The investigators will also study how advanced&#xD;
      MRI, including susceptibility-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging can detect detailed signs&#xD;
      of brain vascular and neuronal reorganization that helps improve neurological and cognitive&#xD;
      outcome of children and young adults with SWS, who could benefit from targeted interventions&#xD;
      in the future to minimize neurocognitive deficits in affected patients. All enrolled subjects&#xD;
      will undergo advanced brain MRI and neurocognitive evaluation to achieve these goals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will combine advanced neuroimaging with detailed neuro-psychology evaluation,&#xD;
      performed in both children and young adults affected by Sturge-Weber syndrome, in order to&#xD;
      address two main aims, each of them with two research hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1. To determine the accuracy of a novel, rapid MRI approach for detection of early and&#xD;
      advanced SWS brain abnormalities as compared to a standard MRI acquisition (current clinical&#xD;
      standard).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.1. In young children with SWS, rapid MRI using STAGE will detect the presence&#xD;
      and extent of brain involvement with high accuracy when compared to standard MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.2. In children, adolescents, and young adults, rapid MRI using STAGE will have&#xD;
      high accuracy to detect advanced brain vascular and parenchymal abnormalities as compared to&#xD;
      standard MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the detrimental neurocognitive effects of SWS brain involvement are most robust during&#xD;
      the early disease course, early interventions, including preventive antiepileptic treatment&#xD;
      in children with high-risk port-wine birthmark are being considered. This paradigm changing&#xD;
      therapeutic approach would greatly benefit from safe, accurate imaging for rapid screening&#xD;
      not requiring sedation or contrast injection. In this aim, the investigators will evaluate a&#xD;
      recently developed, rapid, multi-echo MRI acquisition protocol (STAGE: Strategically Acquired&#xD;
      Gradient Echo) for its ability to detect early and late SWS-related vascular and brain tissue&#xD;
      abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2. To assess the role of key vascular and neuronal compensatory mechanisms in&#xD;
      neurocognitive outcome in unilateral SWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.1. Extensive ipsilateral deep vein collaterals will protect the SWS-affected&#xD;
      hemisphere as indicated by relatively preserved structural brain integrity and global&#xD;
      neurocognitive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.2. In unilateral SWS, reorganized structural networks in the contralateral&#xD;
      cerebral hemisphere will predict alterations in specific cognitive, motor, language, and&#xD;
      executive functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies revealed two, potentially powerful compensatory mechanisms that may offset the&#xD;
      effects of SWS-related brain injury in unilateral SWS: (i) expanding ipsilateral deep venous&#xD;
      collaterals, and (ii) contralateral brain reorganization associated with preserved verbal&#xD;
      functions at the cost of non-verbal abilities (&quot;crowding&quot; effect) in left-hemispheric SWS.&#xD;
      Here the investigators will use advanced MRI techniques (such as susceptibility-weighted and&#xD;
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based connectome analysis) to evaluate the long-term global&#xD;
      and specific neurocognitive effects of venous vascular remodeling and structural&#xD;
      reorganization, respectively.&#xD;
