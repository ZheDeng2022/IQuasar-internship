      This Cenobamate Expanded Access Program (EAP) is designed to continue providing treatment&#xD;
      with Cenobamate (YKP3089) to patients with partial-onset epilepsy that were enrolled in the&#xD;
      SK Life Science clinical trial YKP3089C013, YKP3089C017 or YKP3089C021.&#xD;

      This Expanded Access Program (EAP) is designed to provide access to an unlicensed drug that&#xD;
      is approved in the United States for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening&#xD;
      condition. This EAP will be sponsored by SK Life Science Inc. and managed by WEP Clinical.&#xD;
      Cenobamate is approved for the treatment of partial onset seizures in adults in United&#xD;
      States. The attached US Label (appendix 1) provides the most recent guidance for use of&#xD;
      cenobamate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this EAP is to continue providing treatment with Cenobamate (YKP3089) to&#xD;
      patients with partial-onset epilepsy that were enrolled in the SK Life Science clinical trial&#xD;
      YKP3089C013, YKP3089C017 or YKP3089C021. Access to Cenobamate under this guideline is&#xD;
      considered a treatment scenario and is not a clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epilepsy is a symptom of a neurological problem that causes sudden, brief seizures. It leads&#xD;
      to an increased risk of injury from accidents, an increased rate of mortality, and has a&#xD;
      significant impact on quality of life. Epilepsy can occur as a result of a neurological&#xD;
      injury, a structural brain lesion, as a part of many systemic medical diseases or may be&#xD;
      generic in origin. The incidence of having epilepsy during a lifetime is between 2-5%.&#xD;
      Available medications control seizures in 50% of patients and decrease seizure incidence in&#xD;
      75%. The remainder continued to have unacceptable number of seizures, side effects, and&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms. The high treatment failure may be the result of inadequate efficacy or&#xD;
      intolerable side effects that lead to poor compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cenobamate is a novel small molecule that is an antiepileptic agent for partial onset&#xD;
      seizures. The precise mechanism by which cenobamate exerts its therapeutic effects in&#xD;
      patients with partial-onset seizures is unknown. Cenobamate has been demonstrated to reduce&#xD;
      repetitive neuronal firing by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium currents. It is also a positive&#xD;
      allosteric modulator of the Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) ion channel.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients currently enrolled in one of the following SK life science studies:&#xD;
             YKP3089C013, YKP3089C017 or YKP3089C021.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient who is currently pregnant and enrolled in one of the following SK life science&#xD;
             studies: YKP3089C013, YKP3089C017 or YKP3089C021 may enter the EAP program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Written informed consent signed by the patient or legal guardian prior to entering the&#xD;
             EAP in accordance with the ICH GCP guidelines. If the written informed consent is&#xD;
             provided by the legal guardian because the patient is unable to do so, a written or&#xD;
             verbal consent from the patient must also be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients that have previously discontinued for any reason from studies YKP3089C013,&#xD;
        YKP3089C017 and YKP3089C021.&#xD;
