  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 40% of patients with PBC have an inadequate response to standard treatment with UDCA,&#xD;
      hence bezafibrate, a PPAR-agonist is being introduced as add-on therapy in these patients.&#xD;
      sCD163, fibrosis markers and bile acid composition are of special interest in PBC. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators will investigate how treatment with bezafibrate influence levels of&#xD;
      macrophage activation markers and fibrosis markers as well as bile acid composition in&#xD;
      patients offered bezafibrate as add-on therapy to UDCA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune cholestatic liver disease characterized by&#xD;
      destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts and progression to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. The&#xD;
      diagnosis of PBC is based on the presence of two of three major criteria; unexplained serum&#xD;
      alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &gt;1.5 times upper normal limit for more than 24 weeks, presence of&#xD;
      anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA), and compatible liver histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is currently the only approved drug used to treat PBC and&#xD;
      patients treated with UDCA have improved survival. In Denmark all PBC patients are offered&#xD;
      UDCA treatment. However, up to 40% of PBC patients may be classified as insufficient&#xD;
      responders to UDCA treatment with male gender, low age, and low Vitamin D level at diagnosis&#xD;
      associated with insufficient response. More precise predictors of insufficient response to&#xD;
      UDCA treatment are important to find as insufficient responders have worse 10-year survival&#xD;
      probability than responders. The high proportion of insufficient responders has fuelled the&#xD;
      search for novel treatment options, including fibrates, budesonide, and obeticholic acid.&#xD;
      Despite response to UDCA treatment, liver transplantation remains the only cure for PBC and&#xD;
      patients with expected survival less than one year are potential candidates for liver&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bezafibrate Bezafibrate is a pan-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist.&#xD;
      For decades, bezafibrate has been prescribed for various indications including&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia. Thus, adverse effects are well described. Recently, a phase 3 trial showed&#xD;
      promising results as an add-on therapy to UDCA in reducing ALP in PBC patients, who had&#xD;
      insufficient response to UDCA alone. Hence, Danish hepatologists are starting to use&#xD;
      bezafibrate as second line, add-on, therapy in PBC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soluble CD163 and fibrosis markers In PBC, inflammation is attributed to an immune response&#xD;
      to mitochondrial autoantigens followed by development of anti-mitochondrial antibodies&#xD;
      (AMAs); and accompanied by inflammation of small bile ducts. The pathogenesis includes both&#xD;
      CD4 and CD8 cells, which in the presence of biliary cells expressing the 2-oxo-dehydrogenase&#xD;
      pathway (PDC-E2) activates macrophages via granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor.&#xD;
      The activated macrophages, together with AMAs, produce a proinflammatory response with&#xD;
      subsequent liver inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, macrophages seem to be involved in PBC&#xD;
      disease severity and progression. The investigators recently showed that the macrophage&#xD;
      activation marker soluble (s)CD163 is associated with long-term prognosis in PBC patients.&#xD;
      Further, the investigators research group have shown increased levels of sCD163 in relation&#xD;
      to liver fibrosis/cirrhosis in patients with chronic viral hepatitis (HBV and HCV),&#xD;
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD/NASH) and alcoholic liver disease (alcoholic&#xD;
      hepatitis and cirrhosis) and liver disease severity including risk of portal hypertension and&#xD;
      development of complications and mortality. Moreover, the investigators also demonstrated&#xD;
      sCD163 is associated with early and long-term prognosis of patients with cirrhosis and&#xD;
      acute-on-chronic liver failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibrosis is a hallmark of liver disease progression and extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover&#xD;
      is a prominent feature of chronic inflammatory liver diseases including PBC. ECM protein&#xD;
      degradation and formation generate fragments reflecting aspects of the tissue turnover&#xD;
      balance when quantified in the blood. PRO-C3 and PRO-C4 reflect type III and IV collagen&#xD;
      formation, whereas C3M and C4M are markers for degradation of type III and IV. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to investigate changes in these fibrosis markers before and after&#xD;
      bezafibrate treatment, to demonstrate if these novel finger print protein biomarkers may be&#xD;
      useful for treatment response in PBC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bile acids In PBC there is intrahepatic accumulation of potentially cytotoxic bile acids&#xD;
      resulting in liver damage. Further the composition of bile acids is changed, resulting in&#xD;
      changes of microbiota and in the integrity of the intestinal wall, potentially allowing an&#xD;
      increased flux of inflammatory metabolites to the liver. Exploration of potential changes in&#xD;
      bile acid profile caused by bezafibrate treatment may improve understanding of the treatment&#xD;
      effects and provide identification of specific treatment targets.&#xD;
