      This study will evaluate the ability of High Velocity Nasal Insufflation [HVNI] next&#xD;
      generation nasal cannula designs to effect ventilation and related physiological responses&#xD;
      relative to the conventional legacy cannula design.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of HVNI next generation nasal cannula&#xD;
      designs to effect ventilation and related physiological responses relative to the current&#xD;
      cannula design, with which there are published clinical outcomes data. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that next generation nasal cannula designs (Prosoft and Unicorn) will be comparable at&#xD;
      relieving patient dyspnea while on HVNI, when compared to the conventional (Legacy) cannula.&#xD;
