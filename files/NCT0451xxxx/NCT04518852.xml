  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death that&#xD;
      ranks sixth in terms of incident cases, with an overall 5 years survival of 18%. Despite a&#xD;
      significant improvement in treatment strategy, the overall survival of HCC remains low due to&#xD;
      high recurrence, progressive liver dysfunction and the high fatality of the disease. Surgical&#xD;
      resection has been applied in a number of patients; however, surgery has been associated with&#xD;
      a high incidence of recurrence (approximately 70% within 5 years). TACE is generally applied&#xD;
      on intermediate-stage HCC. However, TACE is not satisfied with improving overall survival.&#xD;
      Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective treatment for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the overall objective response rate (ORR) of single or sequential therapy is not&#xD;
      satisfied, and the over survival (OS) improvement is not ideal. Therefore, combined therapy&#xD;
      maybe the good choice for patients with advanced HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study focuses on the in-operable, BCLC-B/C HCC patients. Through the combination of&#xD;
      local therapy (TACE), anti-angiogenic therapy (Sorafenib), and immunotherapy (PD-1 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody), it is expected to change the tumor microenvironment, restore the immune response,&#xD;
      strengthen the anti-tumor effect of various treatments, and improve the therapeutic efficacy&#xD;
      in patients with BCLC-B/C HCC.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single arm, single center, open label study. It is estimated that 60 patients&#xD;
      with BCLC-B/C HCC who can not receive radical resection will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial period of subjects includes screening period, treatment period and follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug treatment was 200 mg of PD-1 monoclonal antibody, intravenous infusion on the first&#xD;
      day, every 21 days as a treatment cycle; mesylate sorafenib, 400 mg, oral twice a day,&#xD;
      continuous oral; TACE, the lipiodol + blank microspheres and oxaliplatin (100 mg) +&#xD;
      epirubicin (50 mg) were injected into the hepatic artery by routine procedure, repeated every&#xD;
      4-6 weeks, and administered for according to the physician in charge, TACE treatment cycles.&#xD;
      Treatment continues until the disease progresses, intolerable toxicity occurs, new anti-tumor&#xD;
      treatment is started, informed consent is withdrawn, follow-up is lost, death occurs or&#xD;
      treatment termination is required。 Screening will be performed between days - 21 and - 4.&#xD;
      Informed consent was signed up to 4 weeks prior to the first day of cycle 1 before any&#xD;
      screening procedure or evaluation was performed and the trial was fully explained to each&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline evaluation results must be collected prior to the first trial drug administration&#xD;
      (day 1 of cycle 1). Baseline assessments may be performed between days - 3 and - 1 or on day&#xD;
      1 of cycle 1. If performed within 3 days before the first day of cycle 1, the screening&#xD;
      results can be used as baseline results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tumor imaging was evaluated every 4-6 weeks since the first administration, and every 12&#xD;
      weeks (± 7 days) after 24 weeks. If there are clinical indications for disease progression,&#xD;
      tumor evaluation is more frequent. In the event of disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, the subject's request to discontinue the trial or the subject's withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent, the subject will discontinue the trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the trial treatment is stopped, the treatment visit shall be stopped within 7 days after&#xD;
      the treatment is stopped in order to stop the treatment examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of the treatment period (up to 2 years), subjects who can benefit from the&#xD;
      study drug will continue to study the treatment of the drug until disease progression,&#xD;
      intolerable adverse reactions, withdrawal of intensive care facility (ICF), other anti-tumor&#xD;
      treatment, loss of follow-up, death or termination of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the occurrence of a clinical event, if it is judged by the investigators that it should&#xD;
      be attributed to the progress of the disease and it is unlikely to recover even if the&#xD;
      patient continues to receive treatment, it can be evaluated as clinical deterioration. It is&#xD;
      up to the investigator to discuss and decide whether to continue or stop the treatment for&#xD;
      the subject and record in the study file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, subjects who are still under study treatment can continue to receive&#xD;
      treatment through another extended study or other forms at the discretion of the investigator&#xD;
      if they are stable or relieved in the efficacy evaluation and can tolerate the adverse&#xD;
      reactions.&#xD;
