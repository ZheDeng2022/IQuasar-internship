  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies report changes in food preferences in favor of low energy density foods after&#xD;
      bariatric surgery and changes in scores of liking and desire to eat, as well as changes in&#xD;
      hedonic evaluation certain foods. However, only one study was held in a more realistic&#xD;
      condition of consumption by using real food, looking at some aspects of food preferences and&#xD;
      giving contradictory results. We hypothesise that food preferences are different between&#xD;
      obese people with and without a bariatric surgery. The main objective of this study is to&#xD;
      compare the differences in food quality (proportion of total energy intake from foods with&#xD;
      high energy density versus foods with low energy density), evaluated during a standardized&#xD;
      and validated buffet between adult women with severe complicated or morbid obesity and women&#xD;
      who have undergone bariatric surgery in the last 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>The dietary preferences of people will be collected by a direct measurement of eating behavior in front of a dedicated and standardized ad-libitum buffet.&#xD;
As part of this buffet, 3 dichotomous categories of food will be studied:&#xD;
high / low in fat (HF / LF)&#xD;
high / low in carbohydrates (HC / LC)&#xD;
high / low in protein (HP / LP). During the buffet, participants will be filmed to study their food choices and the microstructure of their meal. We will define food preferences as the relative consumption choices of the food categories studied. We will also collect the time spent at the buffet, the duration of ingestion, the total duration of the meal, the number of bites per minute, the total number of bites and the number of bites by type of food.&#xD;
Weighing's will be carried out before and after consumption in order to determine the total energy intake and the macronutrient intake (proteins, lipids, carbohydrates) of the participants.</description>
