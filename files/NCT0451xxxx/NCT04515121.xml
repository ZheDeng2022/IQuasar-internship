  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial electrical stimulation (tCES) is a non-invasive and safe treatment, which uses a&#xD;
      low direct current or alternating current to change the excitability of the cerebral cortex.&#xD;
      The tCES has been applied in clinical trials related to rehabilitation research in recent&#xD;
      years, and the safety and effectiveness have also been established. However, the existing&#xD;
      tCES products effect on the whole brain networks and lack special waveforms. We developed a&#xD;
      wearable high-definition tCES (HD-tCES) with special waveforms. This novel stimulation system&#xD;
      will result in more precise and focal stimulation of selected brain regions with special&#xD;
      waveforms to display better neuromodulation performance. In this study, we will preliminarily&#xD;
      examine the effects and safety of the HD-tCES on lower extremity in patients with stroke. We&#xD;
      expect that the HD-tCES combined with the lower extremity rehabilitation can shorten the&#xD;
      duration of rehabilitative periods, improve stroke patients' activity of daily living, reduce&#xD;
      the care burden of patients' family, and subsequently decrease the cost of health care&#xD;
      insurance.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment lower extremity scale (FMA-LE) after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (within 7 days ahead to the 1st intervention session) and after 4-week intervention (within 7 days after the last intervention session)</time_frame>
    <description>The FMA-LE assesses motor functioning of lower extremity. Each movement is estimated by a 3-point scale (0-1-2). The total score of the FMA-LE is 34, and a higher score indicates that the patient has better movement ability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (within 7 days ahead to the 1st intervention session) and after 4-week intervention (within 7 days after the last intervention session)</time_frame>
    <description>The BBS is used to objectively determine a patient's ability to safely balance during a series of predetermined tasks. It contains 14 items with each item consisting of a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4. A higher score indicates that the patient has better balance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (within 7 days ahead to the 1st intervention session) and after 4-week intervention (within 7 days after the last intervention session)</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG assesses a patient's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance. It measures the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Gait Evaluation after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (within 7 days ahead to the 1st intervention session) and after 4-week intervention (within 7 days after the last intervention session)</time_frame>
    <description>The Gait Evaluation includes cadence, stride duration, stride length, and velocity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (within 7 days ahead to the 1st intervention session) and after 4-week intervention (within 7 days after the last intervention session)</time_frame>
    <description>The MAS is commonly used in clinical practice for grading spasticity. The MAS is rated on a 6-point scale (0, 1, 1+, 2, 3, 4), and a higher score indicates that the patient has higher muscle tension. The muscles being assessed include hip flexor, hip extensor, knee flexor, knee extensor, ankle dorsiflexor, and ankle plantarflexor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline motor evoked potential (MEP) after intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (within 7 days ahead to the 1st intervention session) and after 4-week intervention (within 7 days after the last intervention session)</time_frame>
    <description>The MEP elicited in peripheral muscles by transcranial magnetic stimulation over motor cortex is one of the hallmark measures for non-invasive quantification of cortical excitability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 10 minutes after each intervention session (a total of 12 sessions, 3 sessions/week, lasting 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately after each HD-tCES stimulation, the patient will be questioned about eventual side effect.</description>

    <description>The high definition transcranial electrical stimulation was applied using a 1*4 ring electrode configuration. The anodal electrode was placed on the ipsilesional C1/C2, and the remaining 4 cathodal electrodes were placed in a radius of approximately 7.5 cm from anode (Cz, F3, T7, and P3 on the left hemisphere or Cz, F4, T8, and P4 on the right hemisphere). HD-tCES will be applied for 20 minutes at an intensity of 1.0 mA direct current stimulation and a specific-added waveform each time, 3 times a week, lasting for 4 weeks.</description>
