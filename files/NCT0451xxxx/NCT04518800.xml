      A prospective, open, single-arm clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      jinyouli（PEG-rhG-CSF） in the first-line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer with&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel combined with S-1.Chemotherapy regimen: (1) chemotherapy: nab-paclitaxel,&#xD;
      260mg/m2, intravenous infusion for 30 minutes, D1, Q3W. S-1, 80-120mg, PO BID, D1-14, Q3W.&#xD;
      (2) patients who met the eligibility criteria were given jinyouli injections 24 hours after&#xD;
      the end of intravenous infusion of nab-paclitaxel during the treatment period.&#xD;
