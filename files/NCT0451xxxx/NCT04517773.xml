      In France, the notion of autonomy concerning the patient's place in the healthcare system has&#xD;
      been written into legal texts for several years (Loi Kouchner, 2002; Loi Leonetti, 2005; Loi&#xD;
      Leonetti-Claeys, 2016, etc.) . In addition,government policies are trying to adapt a strategy&#xD;
      for transforming the health system. One of the priorities is to place &quot;the patient at the&#xD;
      heart of the system &quot;. This orientation of positioning the patient at the center of the&#xD;
      healthcare system taken by the Government, proves the importance of a contemporary reflection&#xD;
      on the subject of the patient's autonomy. This notion is also fully recognized in our society&#xD;
      and in the medical field by caregivers. Indeed, it constitutes a fundamental right of respect&#xD;
      for the patient to decide for himself - in particular at the level of his health - what seems&#xD;
      to be suitable, his therapeutic plan, his care, etc. However, the notion of autonomy is&#xD;
      polysemous and complex. There is no unambiguous definition given the existence of plural&#xD;
      conceptions of autonomy, especially in the field of psychology. Thus, through the literature,&#xD;
      it can be understood as a psychological state, a personality variable, an attitude, a value,&#xD;
      even a standard (Auzoult, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given its omnipresence in public health, legislative, ethical, institutional as well as among&#xD;
      caregivers, the investigators assume in our study that autonomy could be the object of social&#xD;
      valuation and thus be understood as a shared norm. and conveyed. (Dubois &amp; Beauvois, 2002).&#xD;
      Norms are defined in particular as &quot;cultural rules which guide behavior in a society&quot; (Ross,&#xD;
      1973). In this perspective, the investigators can rely on the results of the work of Sonia&#xD;
      Hadj Cherif's thesis on the &quot;representation of the autonomous patient in decision-making in&#xD;
      the context of recurrence&quot;. In this questionnaire survey of physicians practicing in&#xD;
      oncology, the participants were asked to perform a verbal association task inviting them to&#xD;
      evoke the 5 words or expressions that came to their mind following the inductive word&#xD;
      &quot;autonomous patient&quot;. The most salient elements associated with autonomy were: a good general&#xD;
      state, management of daily life, valid, capacity for comprehension, hygiene, cognitive&#xD;
      capacities preserved, movement, etc., thus representing the &quot;autonomous patient&quot; as a patient&#xD;
      with all of his physical, motor and intellectual capacities. It is thus a functional autonomy&#xD;
      in which the recognition of the patient depends first of all on his capacity to act and to&#xD;
      do, which seems to prevail in medical discourse. Based on these findings, it would be&#xD;
      interesting to study the autonomy perceived by the patient himself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, in our research, we will build a questionnaire intended for patients, the first&#xD;
      part of which will be composed of a series of questions relating to the most significant&#xD;
      associated words and their associated values for each patient to define his own&#xD;
      representation of the &quot;autonomous patient&quot;. The second part of the questionnaire will consist&#xD;
      of three sub-questionnaires including items relating to patient autonomy. The items of these&#xD;
      three questionnaires will be identical in all respects. Only the instruction requested from&#xD;
      the patient will differ. In fact, patients will first of all be asked to respond as&#xD;
      authentically as possible in order to situate their own perceived autonomy . Secondly, they&#xD;
      will have to respond with a fictitious perspective of giving their doctor a favorable image&#xD;
      of themselves. Finally, as a last step, they will have to give an unfavorable image of&#xD;
      themselves to their doctor. These questionnaires will allow us to know whether cancer&#xD;
      patients use different self-presentation strategies depending on whether they present to&#xD;
      themselves, or to their doctor.&#xD;
