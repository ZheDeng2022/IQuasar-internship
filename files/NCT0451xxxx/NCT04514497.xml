      This phase I trial investigates the side effects and best dose of BAY 1895344 when given&#xD;
      together with usual chemotherapy (irinotecan or topotecan) in treating patients with solid&#xD;
      tumors that have spread to other places in the body (advanced), with a specific focus on&#xD;
      small cell lung cancer, poorly differentiated neuroendocrine cancer, and pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
      BAY 1895344 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Chemotherapy drugs, such as irinotecan and topotecan, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,&#xD;
      or by stopping them from spreading. Adding BAY 1895344 to irinotecan or topotecan may help to&#xD;
      slow the growth of tumors for longer than seen with those drugs alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess safety and tolerability of each of the elimusertib (BAY 1895344) plus&#xD;
      topoisomerase 1 (top1) inhibitor (irinotecan hydrochloride [irinotecan] or topotecan&#xD;
      hydrochloride [topotecan]) combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of each of&#xD;
      the combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To estimate objective response rate (ORR),&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and duration of response (DOR) in&#xD;
      patients treated with each combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of BAY 1895344 plus each top1&#xD;
      inhibitor (irinotecan or topotecan) when used in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate changes in pharmacodynamic (PD) markers of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage&#xD;
      (gamma-H2AX, phosphorylated [p]S343-NBS1) elicited by each combination from on-treatment&#xD;
      tumor biopsies (in dose expansion cohorts only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate response outcomes (ORR, PFS, OS, DOR) in study patients by tumor ataxia&#xD;
      telangiectasia mutated (ATM) expression loss (assessed by immunohistochemistry [IHC]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate response outcomes (ORR, PFS, OS, DOR) in study patients with tumor DNA damage&#xD;
      response (DDR) mutations (assessed by whole exome sequencing [WES], ribonucleic acid [RNA]&#xD;
      sequencing [RNA Seq], and circulating tumor DNA [ctDNA] analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I: Patients receive elimusertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1 and 2 and&#xD;
      irinotecan intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 14 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II: Patients receive topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 and elimusertib PO BID&#xD;
      on days 2 and 5. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for up to 6 months.&#xD;

             eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of BAY 1895344 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because DNA-damage response inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in&#xD;
             this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation and for 6&#xD;
             months after completion of BAY 1895344 administration. Should a woman become pregnant&#xD;
             or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study,&#xD;
             she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this&#xD;
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of BAY 1895344&#xD;
             administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document. Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC)&#xD;
             who have a legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will&#xD;
             also be eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The investigator(s) must state a medical or scientific reason if patients who have&#xD;
             brain metastases will be excluded from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to BAY 1895334 or other agents used in study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are substrates of CYP3A4 with a&#xD;
             narrow therapeutic window, or strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible, if&#xD;
             they cannot be transferred to alternative medication. Because the lists of these&#xD;
             agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a&#xD;
             frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent&#xD;
             procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other&#xD;
             agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is&#xD;
             considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because BAY 1895344 is agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with BAY 18953354, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with BAY 18953354. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used&#xD;
             in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an uncontrolled infection requiring IV antibiotics will not be eligible&#xD;
             to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have previously been treated with any of the study compounds will not be&#xD;
             eligible to participate in the study&#xD;
