  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proposed study, the investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of lipoic&#xD;
      acid in treatment of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The study will recruit 150 AD&#xD;
      patients, and then these patients will be randomized to lipoic acid group or control group&#xD;
      (75 patients per arm) for 6 courses for about 5 months. Clinical assessment will be done at&#xD;
      screen/baseline, 3th course and 6th course. The specific aims are to compare lipoic acid&#xD;
      versus control on: motor function and disease progression. During the study period, clinical&#xD;
      effect index will be recorded, including bulbar function, motor function, respiratory&#xD;
      function, and safety index including blood and urine routine, liver and kidney function,&#xD;
      coagulation function.&#xD;

      course and 6th course. The specific aims are to compare lipoic acid versus placebo on: (1)&#xD;
      Lipoic acid could improve the motor function, delay the disease progression and extend&#xD;
      survival time in patients with ALS, measured by the ALSFRS-R Scale, ROADS Scale, upper motor&#xD;
      neuron Scale, Muscle strength Scale and Electromyography; (2) Lung function will be collected&#xD;
      to prove the hypothesis lipoic acid may help respiratory function. (3) Safety index including&#xD;
      blood and urine routine, liver and kidney function, coagulation index will be recorded.&#xD;
