    <textblock>
      This clinical study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of CCT303-406 CAR modified&#xD;
      autologous T cells (CCT303-406) in subjects with relapsed or refractory stage IV metastatic&#xD;
      HER2-positive solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label, dose escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      preliminary therapeutic efficacy of CCT303-406 cells in adult subjects with HER2 positive&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory stage IV metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that meet inclusion criteria with positive biopsy HER2 (IHC 3+ in ≥50% tumor cells)&#xD;
      will receive CCT303-406 according to the 3+3 dose escalation design.&#xD;
