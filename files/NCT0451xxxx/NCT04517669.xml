        This study will enroll approximately 500 patients from rheumatologists and/or PsA&#xD;
        specialist centers in 10 countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France,&#xD;
        Israel, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland) over an enrollment period of 12&#xD;
        months. The above list of countries are anticipated to participate in this study, however&#xD;
        additional countries may be included at a later time. Each patient will have up to 12&#xD;
        months of follow-up for a total study duration of 24 months. Consecutive patients attending&#xD;
        a routine clinical visit will be invited to participate if they meet the eligibility&#xD;
        criteria for the study and are to start on treatment with tofacitinib for active PsA.&#xD;
