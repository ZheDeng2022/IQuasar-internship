  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the country, surpassing deaths caused by&#xD;
      colorectal, prostate and breast cancers combined. Veterans are at higher risk of lung cancer&#xD;
      due to the higher rate of smoking and environmental toxin exposures. The lack of effective&#xD;
      therapy for lung cancer provides the impetus to search for alternative, safe, and effective&#xD;
      treatment agents to improve treatment strategy against lung cancer, enhance the probability&#xD;
      of a cure and reduce recurrence. Based on encouraging preclinical and clinical findings from&#xD;
      an early phase I lung cancer prevention study, using a special formulation of a standardized&#xD;
      grape seed extract with enhanced absorption called leucoselect phytosome (LP), the purpose of&#xD;
      this new CSR&amp;D Merit Review project is to evaluate the potential usefulness of LP for&#xD;
      pre-surgical treatment of early stage lung cancer patients in a phase IIa clinical trial.&#xD;
      Findings from this study may set the stage for larger, confirmatory trials in the near&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a phase IIa, single arm study using 2-3 weeks of oral LP&#xD;
      treatment for 30 early stage I and II lung cancer patients before surgical resection of their&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: Patients who have suspected early stage lung cancer will be recruited from&#xD;
      Pulmonary and Thoracic Surgery clinics prior to diagnostic biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent, which includes allowing the investigators to collect and store&#xD;
      some of the samples from the clinical diagnostic procedures as pretreatment samples, such as&#xD;
      bronchoscopy, needle aspirations, etc., subject will be screened with history and physical&#xD;
      examination (H &amp; P), respiratory/general health questionnaires, food frequency&#xD;
      self-assessment questionnaires, review of medical records, including radiographic imaging&#xD;
      data, pulmonary function test (PFT), 12-lead EKG, clinical labs (complete blood chemistry&#xD;
      panel, blood cell counts, PT, PTT). Most of these diagnostic tests will have already been&#xD;
      obtained as a part of the clinical work up. However, new blood tests will be obtained if the&#xD;
      last results were over 3 months ago). Blood samples and urine samples will be collected for&#xD;
      research. Serum cotinine will be obtained to ascertain smoking status. A portion of the&#xD;
      biospecimens (blood, urine, diagnostic samples) collected will be kept for future research at&#xD;
      the NMVAHCS in an approved repository. A pregnancy test will be done for a woman who is able&#xD;
      to have children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: (treatment with study medication). If stage I or II lung cancer is diagnosed&#xD;
      from standard clinical practice, the qualified subject will be enrolled into the intervention&#xD;
      study to receive 2-3 weeks of LP, taken by mouth once a day, until the lung cancer surgery.&#xD;
      At the time of surgery, serial clinical samples, including bronchoscopic and various&#xD;
      surgically resected tissues, blood and urine will be collected as post-treatment samples.&#xD;
      Pre- and post-treatment samples will be compared to assess how well oral LP has been&#xD;
      absorbed, and whether or not there are encouraging anti-cancer changes occurring in the cells&#xD;
      and molecules in response to the LP treatment. Once enrolled for intervention, all subjects&#xD;
      will be monitored with weekly phone follow up, the safety of LP will be monitored weekly&#xD;
      using standard reporting tools (including the NCI common terminology criteria for adverse&#xD;
      events Version 5.0 and adverse reaction questionnaires), as well as pre-surgery H&amp;P and blood&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up: Post-surgery phone follow up will occur at 3-4 weeks, 6 months and annually for up&#xD;
      to 4 years.&#xD;
