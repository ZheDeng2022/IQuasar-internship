      This study evaluates if the combination of thermotherapy (one application, 50⁰C for 30&quot;) and&#xD;
      3 weeks of miltefosine is safe and have a comparable cure rate with the current recommended&#xD;
      first line treatments comprising meglumine antimoniate for 3 weeks or miltefosine monotherapy&#xD;
      for 4 weeks, for the treatment of uncomplicated cutaneous leishmaniasis cases in the New&#xD;
      World.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, open label, multi-centre, non-inferiority study aims to compare that the&#xD;
      combination of thermotherapy (one application, 50⁰C for 30&quot;) and 3 weeks of miltefosine (2.5&#xD;
      mg/kg/day for 21 days orally) (here after referred to as combination), is non-inferior to the&#xD;
      current recommended first line treatments, meglumine antimoniate (20 mg/kg/day for 20 days&#xD;
      parenterally) or miltefosine monotherapy (2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days orally), for&#xD;
      uncomplicated CL cases in the New World.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the non-inferior efficacy of the combination in comparison to the standard&#xD;
      first line treatment (meglumine antimoniate) and/or to miltefosine monotherapy as measured by&#xD;
      the percentage of patients with initial clinical cure at Day 90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the proportion of patients who show clinical improvement at D90 (have more or&#xD;
           equal of 75% and less than 100% re-epithelization) and achieve 100% re-epithelization at&#xD;
           D105 (late responders).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the proportion of relapses at D180.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety and tolerability profile for each regimen (percentage of treatment&#xD;
           discontinuation, frequency and severity, causality with each study drug and seriousness&#xD;
           of Adverse Events (AEs)).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the time to achieve 100% re-epithelialization/ flattening of ulcerated/ non&#xD;
           ulcerated lesions by Leishmania species.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A computer-generated randomization code will be used for patient treatment allocation to one&#xD;
      of the three arms indicated and utilizing a 1:1:1 allocation ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to the combination treatment will start treatment at Day 1 and have a&#xD;
      follow-up visit on 24 hours to assess safety of thermotherapy. Hereafter, these patients are&#xD;
      required to return at Days 7, 14, 21, 45, 63, 90, 105 (late responders only) and 180 after&#xD;
      the beginning of treatment to assess safety and efficacy.In Brazil, women of childbearing&#xD;
      potential are required to also return on D120 and D150 to perform blood pregnancy tests.&#xD;
      Women with irregular menstrual cycle, should return for blood pregnancy tests every two weeks&#xD;
      until D150.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to the meglumine antimoniate treatment are required to come at Days 1, 7,&#xD;
      14, 21, 45, 63, 90, 105 (late responders only) and 180 after the beginning of treatment to&#xD;
      assess safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to the miltefosine monotherapy are required to come at Days 1, 7, 14, 21,&#xD;
      28, 45, 63, 90, 105 (late responders only) and 180 after the beginning of treatment to assess&#xD;
      safety and efficacy. In Brazil, women of childbearing potential are required to also return&#xD;
      on D120 and D150 to perform blood pregnancy tests. Women with irregular menstrual cycle,&#xD;
      should return for blood pregnancy tests every two weeks until D150.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have 100% re-epithelization at D90 are declared cured and appointed to come to&#xD;
      their D180 assessment. If at D90 re-epithelization of the ulcer(s) is more or equal to 75%&#xD;
      but less than 100%, patients will be defined as having clinical improvement and will be asked&#xD;
      to return to D105 for a late responder assessment.&#xD;
