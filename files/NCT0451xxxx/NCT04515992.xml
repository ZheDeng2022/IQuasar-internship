  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise has been shown to be effective at improving fitness, as well as markers of glucose&#xD;
      tolerance and control, in persons with type 2 diabetes. Recently, several investigations have&#xD;
      demonstrated that improvements are realized by patients with high intensity interval exercise&#xD;
      which is characterized by periods of vigorous exercise alternated by periods of moderate&#xD;
      exercise. Typical interval training sessions require significantly less time to complete than&#xD;
      traditional modes of exercise wherein moderate intensity activity is sustained for some time.&#xD;
      This may be especially beneficial to those with type 2 diabetes, as lack of time is a&#xD;
      frequently cited reason for not engaging in regular exercise. Bodyweight circuit training&#xD;
      carries the potential to similarly improve health and metabolic function in persons with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes, and may do so with even a smaller accumulation of exercise because this type of&#xD;
      exercise involves a greater percentage of the trainee's muscle mass compared with common&#xD;
      forms of interval training (e.g., treadmill or cycle exercise). The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to quantify the effects of 3-4 sessions per week of bodyweight circuit training sustained for&#xD;
      5-10 minutes per session on health-related physical fitness and glucose tolerance/control in&#xD;
      people with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

    <description>The at home HIBC intervention program involved the use of both bodyweight and suspension training equipment (TRX® Fit System) with modified movements. The TRX® system was used to modify squats and rows while attached to the top of a door frame.</description>

    <description>HIBC Exercise Protocol- The HIBC circuit repetition and order is as follows: modified squats (10 repetitions), modified rows (5 repetitions), crunches (10 repetitions), and modified push-ups (5 repetitions). The exercise sessions involved repeating a series of repetitions of each movement in sequence, and completing as many sequences as possible in good form in the time allotted for the exercise (initially, 5 minutes). Participants were instructed to complete three sessions per week and documented the number of cycles completed. After 3 weeks of consistent training, participants were asked to add a 4th session each week as tolerated. Initially, the HIBC sessions were 5 minutes long, and the duration of the sessions were increased by one minute each week as tolerated beginning in week four, peaking at 10-minutes per session as early as the eighth week of training. Session duration was capped at 10 minutes.</description>
