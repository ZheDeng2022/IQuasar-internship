  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Classical ballet is a type of high performance dance that requires great effort and extreme&#xD;
      joint positions by its dancers, not to mention a precise control of the ankle joint when on&#xD;
      pointe position. Ballet dancers excessively dorsiflex, and especially plantar flex the ankle,&#xD;
      which predisposes anterior displacement of the talus, possibly causing mobility restrictions&#xD;
      of the tibiotarsal articulation and making it difficult and painful to move the ankle while&#xD;
      dancing. The Thrust technique of tibiotarsal joint is a manipulation that aim to improve&#xD;
      mobility and articular function through a high-speed and short-range movement. The purpose of&#xD;
      the study is to verify the effect of the Thrust technique of tibiotarsal joint on the pain&#xD;
      symptomatology in classical ballet dancers. Ballerinas included in the study presented pain&#xD;
      in the ankle when dancing classical ballet, tenderness to palpation in the anterior and&#xD;
      posterior tibiotarsal articulation, and dysfunction after compression of the tibiotarsal&#xD;
      articulation. The sample consisted of 20 ballerinas, out of which 10 were subjected to&#xD;
      manipulation (IG) and 10 formed the control group (CG). Algic symptomatology in classical&#xD;
      ballet dance was assessed after some practice with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). After&#xD;
      that, an algometer was used to quantify the threshold of pain in the anterior and posterior&#xD;
      ankle joint that presented restrictions in mobility. The Tug technique was performed in the&#xD;
      tibiotarsal articulation in the IG, and in the CG it was simulated. The threshold of pain in&#xD;
      the anterior and posterior tibiotalar joint was measured again immediately after the&#xD;
      intervention or simulation. The ballerinas were reassessed using algometry and the Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Scale (VAS) one week after the manipulation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial of quantitative character, realized in a classical ballet&#xD;
      school in Teresina, Piauí, Brazil, from June to October 2017. The present research was&#xD;
      approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of State University of Piauí. The participants&#xD;
      or their guardians signed the Term of Free and Informed Consent in accordance with Resolution&#xD;
      466/12 of the National Health Council (CNS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Random randomization in two groups (n=10, each) happens through drawing lots, with the&#xD;
      intervention group (GI) submitted to the thrust technique of the tibiotarsal joint for&#xD;
      decoaptation of this joint, and the control group (GC), to its simulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The instruments used to data collect from the study were: (1) Visual Analog Scale (VAS), a&#xD;
      scale that quantifies the intensity of pain through punctuated values, at one extreme of 0,&#xD;
      indicating &quot;no pain&quot;, to 10, pointing an &quot;maximum pain&quot; 19; (2) Digital algometer (Wagner&#xD;
      Instuments®) with a capacity of ten kilograms-force (kgf) and compression deformation of 10&#xD;
      cm, to evaluate the threshold of painful pressure; (3) Questionnaire, developed by the&#xD;
      researchers, relating to personal and anthropometric data and related to the ballet practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection was carried out in an evaluation room at the ballet school, after the&#xD;
      dancers had participated of the classical dance, by a research assistant that was blind to&#xD;
      conditions for treatment. The evaluation of the dysfunction in compression of tibiotarsis and&#xD;
      the osteopathic manipulation were performed by an experienced osteopath and familiarized with&#xD;
      the technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the presence of tibiotarsal compression dysfunction in dancers who presented&#xD;
      pain during dancing and on palpation at the anterior and posterior tibiotalar joint, the&#xD;
      tibiotarsal coaptation and decoaptation test was performed20 (Figure 01): the participants&#xD;
      were positioned in dorsal decubitus, already the osteopath, with the internal hand slipped&#xD;
      the pinky finger on the medial edge of the foot to the talus neck, the other fingers on the&#xD;
      dorsum of the foot and the thumbs on the sole of the foot, the ankle of the dancer was kept&#xD;
      in slight inversion and plantar flexion, the therapist flexed his knees, until his forearms&#xD;
      stay in the same level as the lower limbs of the participant. Shortly after tractioned and&#xD;
      related the joint to perceive if there articulation mobility, or if the joint was fixed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VAS was used to weighting (evaluate) the effects on pre and post-test of the osteopathic&#xD;
      manipulation, and the algometer checked quantitatively. The points measured by this&#xD;
      instrument were the anterior and posterior tibiotalar joint. Before the evaluation, the&#xD;
      dancers were submitted to familiarity with the equipment in the triceps surae, in which they&#xD;
      were orientated to inform when the pressure would become a painful sensation. In the&#xD;
      assessment, the algometer was positioned perpendicularly at the aforementioned points (Figure&#xD;
      01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GI dancers, submitted to tibiotarsal thrust manipulation (Figure 02), were positioned in&#xD;
      dorsal decubitus position with the heel outside the stretcher. The osteopath positioned in a&#xD;
      lateral feint, inflected knees and forearms in the same plane as the participant's leg. With&#xD;
      the internal hand slipped the pinky finger on the medial edge of the foot to the talus neck,&#xD;
      the other fingers on the dorsum of the foot and the thumbs controlling the first metatarsus.&#xD;
      The position of the talus in relation to the tibia was corrected, initially by placing the&#xD;
      foot in eversion and then in dorsal flexion. The osteopath left the body weight behind,&#xD;
      causing a traction in the joint. The thrust consisted of a impulse of high speed and low&#xD;
      amplitude impulse in a caudal direction, closing the elbows20. The technique was performed&#xD;
      until the obtainment (achieved) the joint noise only in the restricted foot, and only one&#xD;
      service was performed. After one week, a reassessment of the painful sensation after the&#xD;
      dance was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the CG was performed the simulation of the technique, with the participants and the&#xD;
      osteopath positioned in the same way as the IG, however there was no reproduction of joint&#xD;
      noise.&#xD;
