  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the effect of diverting the children's attention to a&#xD;
      different point during phlebotomy which is an invasive procedure with acute pain. This is a&#xD;
      randomized controlled experimental study. The study was conducted with two groups: the&#xD;
      intervention group (n=127) and the control group (n=129). The control group was applied to&#xD;
      standard phlebotomy procedures. In contrast, the intervention group had a piece of equipment&#xD;
      that looks like a blood tube in front of them during the phlebotomy process to divert their&#xD;
      attention from the phlebotomy process to the equipment.&#xD;

      The equipment used for the intervention group was designed and developed by the researchers&#xD;
      with the project support of TÜBİTAK BİDEB 2209A in 2016. It is an equipment that looks like a&#xD;
      blood tube with a fixed arm on the right and a moving arm on the left with a total height of&#xD;
      80 cm. It has some answers to common questions of parents as well as the key concerns of the&#xD;
      children &quot; Will it hurt me?&quot;&#xD;

    <time_frame>Twice ( Immediately after the procedure and 14 days after the procedure)</time_frame>
    <description>Children's Fear Scale is an instrument with five different face images changing from neutral (0= no fear) to most scared (4= with the most fear) to evaluate the scare level of the children during the procedure.</description>

    <measure>Revised Face Pain Scale (FPS-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Twice ( During the procedure and 5-10 minutes after the procedure)</time_frame>
    <description>The FPS-R is a scale to measure how children feel in their inner world than how their faces look. It is designed on the widely accepted 0-to-10 metric according to the chosen face. &quot;0&quot; equals &quot;No pain&quot; and &quot;10&quot; equals &quot;Very much pain.&quot;</description>

    <description>The intervention group had equipment that looks like a blood tube in front of them during the blood collection process to divert their attention from the blood collection process to the equipment. This equipment was with a fixed arm on the right and a moving arm on the left with a total height of 80 cm as well as a red light-emitting diode(LED) to stimulate the blood collection. It had some answers to common questions of parents as well as the key concerns of the children like &quot; Will it hurt me?&quot;. The equipment was made a musical device by loading the most popular children's songs into its database.</description>

    <description>The equipment was placed in an area where the children would be able to see easily during the blood collection process. It was turned on as soon as the children sat on to the chair where the process would take place to divert the focus of the children at the equipment.</description>
