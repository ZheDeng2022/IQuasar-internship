  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study focuses on adult persons living with HIV in the New York City and Newark,&#xD;
      New Jersey metropolitan areas who are not highly adherent to HIV medication and who do not&#xD;
      evidence undetectable HIV viral load (the ultimate goal of HIV treatment). Those who have not&#xD;
      decided whether they wish to take HIV medications are invited to enroll. The study uses&#xD;
      technology, is grounded in principles of behavioral economics, and uses the multiphase&#xD;
      optimization strategy (MOST) to examine the acceptability, feasibility, and evidence of&#xD;
      efficacy of three intervention components. The components are intended to increase rates of&#xD;
      HIV viral suppression in the sample. The three components are: prizes for viral suppression&#xD;
      (fixed compensation [$275] or lottery prizes [up to $500]), text messages and quiz questions&#xD;
      that generate points to earn prizes (to foster engagement), and counseling sessions grounded&#xD;
      in the motivational interviewing approach to help participants articulate goals with respect&#xD;
      to health and viral suppression, identify and resolve barriers to HIV medication use, and&#xD;
      build motivation for viral suppression. Participants are assessed at baseline and then 5- and&#xD;
      8-months later.&#xD;

      The present study focuses on adult persons living with HIV who are not highly adherent to HIV&#xD;
      medication and who do not evidence undetectable HIV viral load (the ultimate goal of HIV&#xD;
      treatment). The study uses technology, is grounded in principles of behavioral economics, and&#xD;
      uses the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) to examine the acceptability, feasibility,&#xD;
      and evidence of efficacy of three intervention components. The components are intended to&#xD;
      increase rates of HIV viral suppression in the sample. All participants receive a core&#xD;
      intervention comprised of referrals to care and case management. The three components are:&#xD;
      compensation for viral suppression (fixed compensation or lottery-type prizes), weekly text&#xD;
      messages and quiz questions (TMQQ) for 21 weeks that generate points to earn compensation (to&#xD;
      foster engagement), and three counseling sessions grounded in the motivational interviewing&#xD;
      (MI) approach to help participants articulate goals with respect to health and viral&#xD;
      suppression, identify and resolve barriers to HIV medication use, and build motivation for&#xD;
      viral suppression. We have previously tested variations of these components together as a&#xD;
      &quot;packaged&quot; intervention and found high acceptability, feasibility, and evidence of efficacy.&#xD;
      We now seek to understand this approach with more precision by testing the effects of&#xD;
      individual components using MOST. The components will be tested in a factorial design with 8&#xD;
      intervention conditions. Consistent with the factorial design, each condition will comprise a&#xD;
      unique combination of components. Each condition includes at least one component.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited by a proven hybrid strategy that includes peer recruitment,&#xD;
      ads placed in a free newspaper, and direct recruitment from an NYU Recruitment Registry&#xD;
      managed by Dr. Gwadz. Participants will be screened for eligibility and a total of 80 adult&#xD;
      persons living with HIV and with detectable HIV viral load will be enrolled in the study and&#xD;
      randomly assigned to an intervention condition. Participants will be assessed at baseline and&#xD;
      5- and 8-months post-baseline with a structured assessment battery. A subset will receive&#xD;
      in-depth interviews. The primary outcome is viral suppression. This is a pilot study. It is&#xD;
      not powered for efficacy but we will examine evidence of efficacy. All study activities can&#xD;
      be carried out in a virtual format, and we can switch to in-person contact for screening,&#xD;
      assessment, and some components when appropriate. In-person activities would be conducted at&#xD;
      the New York University Silver field site in Manhattan. The study is funded through the&#xD;
      Constance and Martin Silver Artificial Intelligence and Social Impact Fund at the New York&#xD;
      University Silver School of Social Work.&#xD;
