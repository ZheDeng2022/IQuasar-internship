  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is Phase 2, open label, multi-center study to assess safety and efficacy of vactosertib&#xD;
      in combination with pembrolizumab as 1st line treatment for subjects with advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic, PD-L1 positive, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not previously&#xD;
      received systemic therapy for advanced disease and in whom EGFR, ALK, BRAF, ROS1-directed&#xD;
      therapy is not indicated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 55 NSCLC subjects with PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥ 1% are expected to&#xD;
      be enrolled in this study. Subjects' TPS will be determined by PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay&#xD;
      performed according to local laboratory regulations prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who received adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy are permitted onto the study if the&#xD;
      therapy was completed at least 12 months prior to the development of metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Vactosertib 300 mg orally (PO) BID for 5 days with 2 days off period (5 days on/2days off)&#xD;
      and pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on Day 1 of every 3-week cycle (Q3W).&#xD;
