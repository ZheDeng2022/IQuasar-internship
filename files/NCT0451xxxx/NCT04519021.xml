      A web-based descriptive survey was conducted among doctors with regular interaction with gout&#xD;
      patients. The questionnaire comprised of 38 multiple choice questions; 9 questions for&#xD;
      demographic data, 8, 11 and 10 questions each for knowledge, attitude and practice,&#xD;
      respectively. Simple descriptive statistics were used to describe the correct responses.&#xD;

      Objective To understand the knowledge, attitude and treatment practices of gout among doctors&#xD;
      who regularly interacted with gout patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Study population: Physicians (including practicing medical graduates,&#xD;
      post-graduates in internal medicine, family medicine) and orthopedic surgeons were selected&#xD;
      randomly from the list of data from the Nepal Medical Council registry. All internists with&#xD;
      valid email ID on the registry of the &quot;society of internal medicine of Nepal&quot; (SIMON) were&#xD;
      included. Also, a list of MBBS graduates, family medicine and orthopedic practitioners&#xD;
      working in the peripheral set-up of Nepal was obtained and a random selection with&#xD;
      computer-generated random number table based on council registration number was made for&#xD;
      enrollment into the survey. Estimating a response rate of 30%, a total of 1200 clinicians&#xD;
      were selected based on their council registration number for the invitation to participate in&#xD;
      the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey instrument: A standardized questionnaire was designed by a 3-member committee of NRA&#xD;
      focusing on the areas of knowledge, attitude and practice of gout with 9 questions pertaining&#xD;
      to demographic parameters, 8 to knowledge about the disease, 11 to attitude and 10 to&#xD;
      practice behaviors [tables 1-4]. The questions were designed as multiple-choice questions&#xD;
      (MCQ) to be marked by the respondent. Few questions had the provision of selecting more than&#xD;
      1 options. Open- ended questions were avoided to save the time of the respondents and thus&#xD;
      reduce the attrition rates[10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: An email containing a letter of invitation for participation was sent to each of&#xD;
      the selected participant. It mentioned why they were receiving the email, the objectives of&#xD;
      the survey, the assurance of anonymity and confidentiality and a total answering time of less&#xD;
      than 5 minutes for encouraging participation. A link to the Google-form was attached in the&#xD;
      mail itself and a mention was made on the implied consent for participation in clicking the&#xD;
      link. A reminder email was sent after 1 week to all irrespective of whether they had&#xD;
      responded earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platform: A web-based platform was chosen with the use of Google-forms which was compatible&#xD;
      and user friendly to both browser and mobile users and to both iOS and Android users.&#xD;
      Multiple entries from the same email link were blocked. Web-based platform was chosen over&#xD;
      email survey because it provides the ability to transfer survey responses directly into a&#xD;
      database, eliminating transcription errors and preventing survey alteration by the survey&#xD;
      respondent and most importantly maintaining confidentiality and anonymity of respondents[11].&#xD;
      The answers were collected anonymously in an excel sheet at the main server for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Simple descriptive statistics were used to describe the frequency or&#xD;
      correct responses. Chi-square test was performed to assess the difference in knowledge,&#xD;
      attitude, and practices between clinicians with different medical qualifications. Analysis&#xD;
      was done using SPSS version 21 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
