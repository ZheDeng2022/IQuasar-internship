  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related hearing loss, presbycusis, affects up to 50% of American adults. There are two&#xD;
      main causes for presbycusis: 1) Progressive death of hair cells in the inner ear, and 2)&#xD;
      Central hearing loss, or the reduced ability to decipher the sound source of interest from&#xD;
      other competing sounds in a multi-source complex environment. The first cause is better&#xD;
      understood and treatment options, such as hearing aids and cochlear implants, are available.&#xD;
      However, central hearing loss is not as well understood and there is not a treatment&#xD;
      available at this time. This study aims to advance our understanding of central hearing loss&#xD;
      by evaluating the abilities of younger and older listeners in two primary outcome measures:&#xD;
      to 1) neurologically process sound stimuli and 2) focus on conversational speech in the&#xD;
      presence of spatially-separated competing background noise. A test using Auditory Brainstem&#xD;
      Responses (ABR) will be used to evaluate the brain's response to clicking sounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess all waveform data, but will focus particularly on wave III. Sentence&#xD;
      in noise tests will be used to assess each subject's ability to process speech in noisy&#xD;
      situations. Both the ABR and sentence in noise tests are non-invasive and are commonly used&#xD;
      in audiology practices to diagnosis and treat a variety of audiological pathologies.&#xD;

          2. Subjects exhibiting no poorer than a mild hearing loss, defined as hearing thresholds&#xD;
             no worse than 40dBHL at any test frequency 250-4000 Hz based on pure tone audiometry&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects scoring 26 or higher on a screening measure of cognitive status (Montreal&#xD;
