             immunosuppressive drugs).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;

&#xD;
         20. The participant has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or&#xD;
             laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with&#xD;

&#xD;
             Note: The degree of tumor invasion/infiltration of major blood vessels (e.g. carotid&#xD;
             artery) should be considered because of the potential risk of severe hemorrhage&#xD;
