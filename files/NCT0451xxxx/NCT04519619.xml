  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, multi-center and post-authorization safety study that&#xD;
      includes patients with a diagnosis of Neovascular Glaucoma. The investigator will have made&#xD;
      the decision to use Eylea for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess safety and effectiveness of Eylea using in real&#xD;
      clinical practice. Patients will be followed for a time period of 6 months from start of&#xD;
      Eylea treatment or until it is no longer possible (e.g. lost to follow-up). In total, 480&#xD;
      patients will be recruited. For each patient, data are collected as defined in the electronic&#xD;
      case report form (eCRF) at the initial visit, follow-up visit and final visit, either by&#xD;
      routine clinical visits (as per investigators routine practice).&#xD;

        Participants with a diagnosis of NVG will be enrolled after the decision for treatment with&#xD;
        Aflibercept (AFL) has been made by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who have been prescribed AFL for a medically appropriate use will be eligible&#xD;
        to be enrolled. Indications and contraindications according to the local market&#xD;
        authorization should be carefully considered.&#xD;
