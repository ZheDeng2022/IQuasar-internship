  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a category 3 human study, prospective, comparative, in parallel groups. A comparative&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative analysis of several markers in 250 samples is proposed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The assumption is that researchers can engineer synthetic metabolic and genetic networks to&#xD;
      expand the panel of molecules that are currently known to be detected by natural systems. The&#xD;
      investigators also hypothesize synthetic metabolic and genetic networks can be tuned for&#xD;
      decisions making and in particular to diagnose diseases from biomarkers detections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project proposes for the first time a hybrid analogue / digital solution for the&#xD;
      multiplexed detection of biomarkers using bacterial and paper-based biosensors. Biosensors&#xD;
      can be designed using analog or digital devices. Digital devices in synthetic and natural&#xD;
      systems are noise-resistant and useful for decision-making. Analog devices are useful for&#xD;
      signal transmission and processing. Here the investigators take advantage of signal&#xD;
      transmission and processing via analog transducers and adders, and then decision-making via&#xD;
      genetic switches. Such a hybrid analogue / digital approach has not yet been developed for&#xD;
      biosensing. Another novelty of the project is to use synthetic metabolic pathways to develop&#xD;
      analog devices. The advantage in term of treatment, for example, consists in the fact that&#xD;
      the speed of enzymatic reactions in an analog adder far exceeds the speed of gene expression&#xD;
      required to create a genetic logic matrix; it becomes even more pronounced when the devices&#xD;
      are connected in series. The methodology will be illustrated for the detection of biomarkers&#xD;
      of prostate tumors, but it is broad enough to be applicable to other diagnoses. The choice to&#xD;
      develop biosensors for prostate disease is of practical relevance since the current screening&#xD;
      strategy (based on PSA measurement) can lead to overdiagnosis and cannot differentiate&#xD;
      between patients with aggressive tumors and those with an indolent illness.This study propose&#xD;
      to mainly develop a bacterial and paper-based biosensor system&#xD;
