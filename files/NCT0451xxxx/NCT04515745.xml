  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Starting in 2001, the Look AHEAD study randomized patients with type 2 diabetes to an&#xD;
      intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss versus a control group&#xD;
      receiving diabetes education (&quot;Diabetes Support and Education&quot;). The ILI successfully reduced&#xD;
      weight, improved diabetes control, and functional status, among other outcomes. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators will compare participation in federal disability insurance programs&#xD;
      between the ILI and the control group during and after the intervention period (2001-2017).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Starting in 2001, the Look AHEAD study randomized 5145 patients with type 2 diabetes to an&#xD;
      intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss versus a control group&#xD;
      receiving diabetes education (&quot;Diabetes Support and Education&quot;).The Look AHEAD study tested&#xD;
      whether participants with type 2 diabetes assigned to an intensive lifestyle intervention&#xD;
      (ILI) for weight loss exhibited reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      relative to a control group receiving usual care and diabetes support and education. During&#xD;
      the 12-year intervention period, the ILI led to persistent reductions in weight, waist&#xD;
      circumference, and hemoglobin A1c and improvements in physical fitness, among other clinical&#xD;
      benefits. After the conclusion of the intervention in 2012, participants were consented to be&#xD;
      linked with administrative data. The investigators attempted to link 3188 consenting&#xD;
      participants with Social Security Administration databases. Of these, the investigators were&#xD;
      able to successfully link 3093 participants. In this study, the investigators will compare&#xD;
      participation in federal disability insurance programs including Social Security Disability&#xD;
      Insurance (SSDI) and disability-related Supplemental Security Income (SSI) between the linked&#xD;
      ILI and the control group during and after the intervention period (2001-2017). The&#xD;
      investigators will investigate ILI-versus-control differences in whether participants ever&#xD;
      applied or received benefits from SSDI and SSI. The investigators will also investigate&#xD;
      ILI-versus-control differences in applications and benefit receipt in each year after&#xD;
      randomization, relative to a pre-randomization assessment period. The investigators will use&#xD;
      both multivariate regression controlling for baseline participant characteristics and clinic&#xD;
      site and also survival analyses that estimate whether the time until SSDI or SSI application&#xD;
      or benefit receipt differs between the ILI and control groups.&#xD;
