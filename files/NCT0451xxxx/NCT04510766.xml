    <textblock>
      Single center, two-parts pilot, prospective study to assess the role of molecular tumor&#xD;
      profiling in supporting patient enrollment in early phase clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: patients with solid tumors or lymphomas (n=40) who are potential candidates for early&#xD;
      phase clinical trials will be offered to have their more recent archival tumor tissue&#xD;
      analyzed for the presence of somatic genomic alterations with the pan-cancer NGS Ion&#xD;
      TorrentTM OncomineTM Comprehensive Assay v3 platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: patients who have been enrolled in early phase clinical trials (estimated number:&#xD;
      16-18) will have their archival tumor tissue assessed with HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker&#xD;
      Panel Assay for RNA-Seq to explore gene expression signatures and blood collected and stored&#xD;
      to create a repository of samples (¨liquid biopsy¨) for future research with the aim to&#xD;
      investigate the mutational profile of ctDNA at baseline and the acquisition of new mutations&#xD;
      at the time of disease progression as a consequence of treatment exposure.&#xD;

    <description>Upon confirmation of the suitability for NGS analysis of the selected tumor sample, tumor DNA will be extracted and molecular profile will be performed using the pan-cancer NGS Ion TorrentTM OncomineTM Comprehensive Assay v3 according to manufacturer's instructions</description>

    <description>FFPE tumor archival tissue will be used to perform RNA-Seq with NGS HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel Assay using the HTG machine following the manufacture's protocol. Blood samples for &quot;liquid biopsy&quot; will be collected at two time points: 1) Any time after enrollment in an early clinical trial and before starting the investigational agent&#xD;
(1 x 10 ml blood sample in EDTA tube as source of normal DNA for comparative analysis; 2 x 10 ml blood samples in cell-free DNA BCT Tubes for ctDNA collection; 2) At the time of radiological or clinical tumor progression (2 x 10 ml blood samples in cell-free DNA BCT Tubes for ctDNA collection). Blood samples will be collected and stored to create a biobank of &quot;liquid biopsy&quot; for future analysis.</description>
