  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are limited data regarding the burden of hyperkalaemia in patients attending emergency&#xD;
      departments (ED) or who are hospitalised (excluding those already receiving dialysis).&#xD;
      Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) are of prognostic benefit in patients&#xD;
      with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and post myocardial infarction (MI)&#xD;
      left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and as such should be continued wherever&#xD;
      possible for these indications. These drugs may contribute to elevation in serum potassium&#xD;
      and hyperkalaemia may lead to a reduction in dose or complete withdrawal of RAASi. Yet it&#xD;
      remains unknown how common this happens in standard clinical practice. Inappropriate&#xD;
      discontinuation of RAASi in such patients may lead to adverse clinical outcomes. If patients&#xD;
      have hyperkalaemia that limits the use of RAASi, they may be candidates for new potassium&#xD;
      binders that could facilitate their continued use.&#xD;

      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an adult population of patients who are hospitalised or attending the emergency department&#xD;
      (and not receiving dialysis) with hyperkalaemia:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How does hyperkalaemia impact on RAASi therapy and does this vary according to the&#xD;
           clinical indication for the drug(s)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the demographics, co-morbidities and drug history for patients presenting with&#xD;
           hyperkalaemia?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is the frequency of subsequent hospitalisations and mortality rate in a cohort of&#xD;
           patients presenting with hyperkalaemia at 12 months?&#xD;
