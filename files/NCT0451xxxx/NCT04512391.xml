    <textblock>
      Erector spinae plane block(ESPB), which is firstly used for thoracic neuropathic pain, is&#xD;
      newly developed and highly promising fascial plane block for providing postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia for a great deal of surgeries including breast surgery. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      study efficacy of ESPB for patients who undergone breast cancer surgery and is expected to&#xD;
      benefit from opioid-sparing effect of this technique.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, single-center clinical trial to evaluate analgesic efficacy of&#xD;
      Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) after breast cancer surgery. Participant's demographics and&#xD;
      medical history, type and extent of surgery, systemic opioid and non-opioid analgesic&#xD;
      consumptions, hemodynamic variables and adverse events during and first 24 hours after&#xD;
      surgery. After operation, pain scores at first 24 hours, 1., 3., and 6. month will be&#xD;
      obtanied from surgical ward and pain clinic registires. patient controlled analgesia device&#xD;
      usage history will be obtained from device database at our clinic.&#xD;

    <measure>Opioid Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>First 24 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>all patients were given 0.05 mg/kg morphine iv and 1 gr paracetamol 30 minutes before end of surgery and in the recovery room, a patient- controlled analgesia device containing morphine 0.5 mg/ml, set to deliver a 1mg bolus dose of morphine with an 10 min lockout time. Total morphine consumption during the 24 hours postoperative period will recorded at 5 times intervals ( 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 hours).</description>

    <measure>Verbal Analog Pain Scores on rest and movement</measure>
    <time_frame>First 24 hours after surgery, at 1., 3., 6. month</time_frame>
    <description>A Research assistant, blinded to the group allocation, interviewed patients and collected data at 5 times intervals ( 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, hours) in the 24 hours postoperatively. Patients were asked to rate their pain using verbal analog scale, where 0= no pain and 10= worst pain possible.</description>

    <intervention_name>Ultrasound guided Erector Spinae Plane Block (ESPB)</intervention_name>
    <description>Ultrasound guided ESPB is applied at T4 vertebrae level, 3 cm lateral to mid-line where transverse process lies. After identification of transverse process, needle is advanced in plane and real time visualisation on ultrasound screen. When bonny contact is encountered, normal saline is injected for verification of placement, then, 25 ml %0,25 bupivacaine is injected plane between transverse process and erector spinae muscles.</description>
