    <textblock>
      Healthcare for older adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) is burdensome and of&#xD;
      uncertain benefit, resulting in unwanted and unhelpful care. Patient Priorities Care (PPC) is&#xD;
      an approach that aligns care with patients' health priorities (i.e. the health outcomes most&#xD;
      desired given the healthcare each is willing and able to receive). PPC offers the opportunity&#xD;
      to increase value by improving both outputs (desired health outcomes) and inputs (healthcare&#xD;
      preferences) for these major users of healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will employ a quasi-experimental, usual care (UC) group design, involving 2 primary care&#xD;
      sites (1 PPC and 1 UC. Patients are assigned to intervention or usual care arms based on&#xD;
      their primary care practice location. We will use analytic techniques (e.g., inverse&#xD;
      propensity score weighting) designed to reduce selection bias and balance PPC and UC sites in&#xD;
      terms of baseline characteristics. Data collection will occur through quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative interviews and health encounter information in the Electric Health Record(EHR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Priorities Care requires the elicitation and documentation of patient health outcome&#xD;
      goals and care preferences and the alignment of clinical care with goals and priorities to&#xD;
      achieve patients' health outcome goals and reduce the burden of multi-morbidity. Participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the Patient Priorities Care Program and speak with a trained health&#xD;
      priorities facilitator to elicit their healthcare preferences and health outcome goals, which&#xD;
      together constitute their health priorities. This information will be documented, entered&#xD;
      into the EHR, and shared with the clinicians who will then use the Patient Priorities Care&#xD;
      approach with patients to inform and guide treatment decisions. Patients will participate in&#xD;
      the program and be followed for up to one year from the health priorities identification&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the value of PPC, comparable primary care sites within the Cleveland Clinic will&#xD;
      be assigned to PPC or Usual care (UC). Clinicians and staff at the PPC site will be trained&#xD;
      to identify and align decision-making with the health priorities of older adults with MCCs.&#xD;
      Value will be compared using patient and provider-reported outcomes, healthcare utilization,&#xD;
      and possibly costs at PPC and UC sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of our work is to implement and evaluate this approach to care for older&#xD;
      adults with multiple chronic conditions that focuses on what matters most to them and is less&#xD;
      fragmented and burdensome, resulting in better quality and outcomes at lower cost. This study&#xD;
      will focus on evaluating practice change at test sites at the Cleveland Clinic.&#xD;

    <description>Patient Priorities Care requires the elicitation and documentation of patient health outcome goals and care preferences and the alignment of clinical care with health goals and healthcare preferences (collectively referred to as health priorities). Participants will be contacted by a trained priorities facilitator in-person or over the phone to elicit their health priorities.

    <description>Patient Priorities Care (PPC) is an innovative approach to shared decision-making that draws from existing professional training.&#xD;
PPC requires the elicitation and documentation of patient health outcome goals and care preferences and the alignment of clinical care with health goals and healthcare preferences. This information will be collected and documented in the EHR by facilitators and shared with the clinicians who will then use the PPC approach with patients to inform and guide treatment decisions.&#xD;
The PCPs will be trained in decisional strategies that have been shown to help align care with patients' health priorities. While encouraged to use these decisional strategies, PCPs will be free to make the recommendations they feel most appropriate for each patient.&#xD;
This intervention has been developed to be integrated seamlessly into usual care.</description>
