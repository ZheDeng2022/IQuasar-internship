  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hormone therapy is used to treat women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitor (AI) is administered after menopause. AI therapy has been proven to be&#xD;
      effective in improving the disease-free survival rate, decreasing the recurrence rates and a&#xD;
      lower incidence of contralateral breast cancer. However, arthralgia frequently reported as an&#xD;
      important adverse event of AI therapy and sometimes resulted in noncompliance with AI&#xD;
      therapy. The prevalence of AI induced arthralgia rates ranged from 20 to 74%. Inadequately&#xD;
      managed AI induced arthralgia remains a major unmet need in oncology practice in breast&#xD;
      cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to conduct a crossover designed pragmatic clinical trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture versus NSAID (Diclofenac) for the management of&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitor induced arthralgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third group was set to use non-steroidal analgesics plus acupuncture to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of joint pain.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire covering demographic information and reproductive history. At baseline and at 4, 6 and 10 weeks, self-administered questionnaires including the 10mm visual analogue scales. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at the 4 weeks after the end of intervention.&#xD;
According to statistically estimation, we compare the changes between three subgroups and hypothesize 20% difference as significant effect after intervention. We use ANOVA to calculate the sample size with an alpha of 0.05 as significance level, approximately 80% power and 20% drop-out rate. The trial will enroll 145 participants.</description>

    <description>Patients who were diagnosed as breast cancer and met the inclusion criteria will be recruited and randomly assigned to acupuncture group or drug (NSAIDs) group. After each subgroup completing the 4 weeks intervention, all the participants were enter washout period lasting 2 weeks to eliminate the effect of the previous treatment. Crossover was held after washout period and made the patients to have the other treatment in the following 4 weeks. After receiving the case, the third group recorded the pain indicators for the first month, followed by a one-month trial- combination of acupuncture and NSAID treatment, and then followed up for another month after stopping.</description>
