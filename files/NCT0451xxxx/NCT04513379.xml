  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TB is the most common cause of death in patients with HIV worldwide. Rifampicin [RIF] is the&#xD;
      cornerstone of anti-TB therapy. Current guideline recommend efavirenz (EFV) 600mg per day as&#xD;
      the first of choice for HIV/TB co-infection. Co-administration of EFV with RIF decrease the&#xD;
      plasma concentration of EFV. Because of better safety profiles, EFV 400mg has replaced the&#xD;
      EFV 600mg as the first-line antiretroviral therapy in people living with HIV. However, the&#xD;
      efficacy of EFV 400mg when co-administrated with RIF in HIV/TB co-infection is unclear. This&#xD;
      study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EFV 400mg versus EFV 600mg in HIV/TB&#xD;
      co-infected patients receiving RIF based anti-TB therapy.&#xD;
