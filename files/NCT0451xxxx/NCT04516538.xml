  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with multiple deteriorations of the neuromuscular system. Given the&#xD;
      increase in life expectancy, the investigators can now distinguish old adults (&gt;60 years old)&#xD;
      who conserve their neuromuscular capacities with regular physical activity and very old&#xD;
      adults (&gt;80 years old) who suffer from an inexorable decline, even if the number of&#xD;
      octogenarians and their quality of life are progressively increasing. However, the most part&#xD;
      of the literature on fatigue and neuromuscular capacity with aging focused on isometric&#xD;
      tasks. The results showed a significant decrease in maximal force production capacity and a&#xD;
      greater resistance to fatigue for old people compared to the young population. When fatigue&#xD;
      is induced trough dynamic contractions, greater fatigability was observed in old adults&#xD;
      compared to young adults. Investigations performed on the population aged over 80 years old&#xD;
      are rare, showing greater fatigability in octogenarians than old men (aged 60-80 years old)&#xD;
      during isometric tasks. The knowledge about the effects of dynamic contractions in this&#xD;
      population are limited, and performed uniquely in single leg isokinetic mode. Evaluations&#xD;
      that require the use of both legs and higher muscle mass involved in the task&#xD;
      (cycloergometer) are needed. Understanding neuromuscular fatigue and fatigability across&#xD;
      different exercise modalities is necessary to set adapted physical activity programs aimed to&#xD;
      maintain autonomy in older individuals.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Isokinetic Body weight-based quadriceps intermittent fatigue test (BW-QIF Test)</intervention_name>
    <description>The BW-QIF test is an interval incremental contraction test including blocks of discontinuous 100-s effort. Neuromuscular evaluation of the knee extensors between blocks (duration 25 s) includes one maximal voluntary contraction, one contraction at the 60% of the actual maximal force and at the 80% of the actual maximal force. During each contraction, transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex will be delivered to assess corticospinal voluntary activation (central fatigue). Single-twitch electrical stimulations will be delivered on the femoral nerve during the maximal voluntary contraction and at rest to evaluate peripheral fatigue.&#xD;
The isokinetic BW-QIF test blocks consist in 100 contractions at 120° deg.s-1 and 60° of range of motion (0.5-s contraction /0.5-s rest).</description>
