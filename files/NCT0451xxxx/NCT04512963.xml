      PRG-PRO-001 is a Phase I, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-Controlled, Single Ascending Dose&#xD;
      (SAD) Study including a food interaction study, followed by a Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD)&#xD;
      Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamic Profile of&#xD;
      Progerinin in Healthy Volunteers. This is a first-in-human study. The study aims to determine&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of Progerinin after single and multiple doses in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Progerinin after single and multiple&#xD;
      dose administrations in healthy volunteers.&#xD;

      PRG Science &amp; Technology Co., Ltd. (PRG S&amp;T) is developing Progerinin (SLC-D011) for the&#xD;
      treatment of the rare aging diseases Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) and Werner&#xD;
      Syndrome (WS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progerin, an abnormal splice variant of the inner nuclear membrane protein lamin A is&#xD;
      implicated in the pathology of HGPS and WS. It is believed that the extremely strong binding&#xD;
      between lamin A and progerin is responsible for the nuclear abnormality phenotype observed in&#xD;
      HGPS. WS is caused by functional defect of WRN, RecQ4L DNA helicase and rapid accumulation of&#xD;
      progerin in WRN deficient condition is thought to be the cause of premature aging in WS. PRG&#xD;
      S&amp;T has shown that Progerinin binds specifically to progerin reduces its expression in both&#xD;
      HGPS and WS cells, Progerinin further prevents progerin-lamin A in HGPS cells. In a progeria&#xD;
      mouse model (LmnaG609G/G609G), treatment with Progerinin via intraperitoneal (i.p) injection&#xD;
      (20 mg/kg, twice per week) could increase the body weight and extend the life span of&#xD;
      LmnaG609G/G609G mice up to 21 weeks. In the LmnaG609G/+ mouse model, improved morphology such&#xD;
      as status of coat hair and body size, increased body weight and extended life span for about&#xD;
      16 weeks was noted following Progerinin treatment. In addition, Progerinin can suppress&#xD;
      muscle weakness including the heart muscle. Safety pharmacology studies did not indicate any&#xD;
      Progerinin-related effects on vital organs and systems including respiratory, cardiovascular&#xD;
      and central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to studies in the disease states, this study PRG-PRO-001, an initial first-in-human&#xD;
      study, will be conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of Progerinin. PRG-PRO-001 is a Phase I, Randomized, Double-blind,&#xD;
      Placebo-Controlled, Single Ascending Dose (SAD) Study including a food interaction study,&#xD;
      followed by a Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability,&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamic Profile of Progerinin in Healthy Volunteers. This is a&#xD;
      first-in-human study. The study aims to determine the safety and tolerability of Progerinin&#xD;
      after single and multiple doses in healthy volunteers and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK) of Progerinin after single and multiple dose administrations in healthy volunteers. The&#xD;
      estimated enrollment is around 56 healthy volunteers, with 40 subjects estimated for the SAD&#xD;
      phase and 16 subjects for the MAD Phase at one site in the USA.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>SAD Phase including Food Interaction:&#xD;
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating study in healthy volunteers. Participants will be assigned to 1 of up to 6 cohorts and will be randomized within each cohort to Progerinin or placebo at 3:1 ratio.&#xD;
Following the completion of the SAD phase, if study stopping criteria (SSC) is not met, then participants in cohort 5 and 6 will cross-over to the fed part of the study following a 7 day washout period. If SSC is achieved in the SAD phase, then the previous dose will be in the Food Interaction phase.&#xD;
MAD Phase:&#xD;
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating study in healthy volunteers. If SSC is not met in the SAD phase, then participants will be assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts and will be randomized within each cohort to Progerinin or placebo at 3:1 ratio. If SSC is achieved in the SAD phase, then the previous two doses will be used as the 2 cohorts in the MAD phase.</intervention_model_description>
