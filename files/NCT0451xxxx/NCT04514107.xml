      This study is a cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT) to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti mosquito release in reducing the burden of arbovirus (ARBV)&#xD;
      infection in Brazil over three years. Children aged 6-11 years will be enrolled from 58&#xD;
      clusters within Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and each cluster will comprise a school catchment&#xD;
      area, and surrounding buffer. Every effort will be made to enroll the target of 60&#xD;
      participants into every cluster. Clusters will be randomized to expose all enrolled children&#xD;
      within the cluster to vector control efforts recommended by the Brazilian National Dengue&#xD;
      Control Program (PNCD) or a combination of vector control efforts recommended by PNCD and the&#xD;
      release of Wolbachia-infected A. aegypti mosquitoes. The release of Wolbachia-infected&#xD;
      mosquitoes will be determined and carried out by unblinded study personnel, and the&#xD;
      prevalence of the Wolbachia-infected mosquito population in each cluster will be monitored&#xD;
      throughout the study. Blood samples from participants will be obtained at baseline before the&#xD;
      implementation of the strategies and during the low transmission season. Thereafter, annual&#xD;
      samples will be collected after each transmission season for three seasons in the same time&#xD;
      range. Samples will be tested for ARBV infection to determine transmission rates for each&#xD;
      cluster. The primary hypothesis of this trial is that the introgression of Wolbachia-infected&#xD;
      mosquitoes into local A. aegypti populations will lead to a decrease in human infection of&#xD;
      dengue virus, zika virus, and/or chikungunya virus (collectively referred to as ARBV) in&#xD;
      intervention clusters. The primary objective is to evaluate whether release of&#xD;
      Wolbachia-infected A. aegypti mosquitoes plus standard Aedes vector control measures reduces&#xD;
      the sero-incidence of ARBV infection compared to standard Aedes vector control measures&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;

      This study is a cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT) to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti mosquito release in reducing the burden of arbovirus (ARBV)&#xD;
      infection in Brazil over three years. Children aged 6-11 years will be enrolled from 58&#xD;
      clusters within Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and each cluster will comprise a school catchment&#xD;
      area, and surrounding buffer. The study will aim to enroll 60 participants per cluster and is&#xD;
      powered on the premise that at least 48 participants per cluster (calculations are based on a&#xD;
      significance threshold of 0.05, power of 80%) will complete the trial. Clusters will be&#xD;
      randomized to expose all enrolled children within the cluster to vector control efforts&#xD;
      recommended by the Brazilian National Dengue Control Program (PNCD) or a combination of&#xD;
      vector control efforts recommended by PNCD and the release of Wolbachia-infected A. aegypti&#xD;
      mosquitoes. The release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes will be determined and carried out&#xD;
      by unblinded study personnel, and the prevalence of the Wolbachia-infected mosquito&#xD;
      population in each cluster will be monitored throughout the study. Blood samples from&#xD;
      participants will be obtained at baseline before the implementation of the strategies and&#xD;
      during the low transmission season. Thereafter, annual samples will be collected after each&#xD;
      transmission season for three seasons in the same time range. Samples will be tested for ARBV&#xD;
      infection to determine transmission rates for each cluster. The primary hypothesis of this&#xD;
      trial is that the introgression of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes into local A. aegypti&#xD;
      populations will lead to a decrease in human infection of dengue virus, zika virus, and/or&#xD;
      chikungunya virus (collectively referred to as arbovirus ( ARBV)) in intervention clusters.&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate whether release of Wolbachia-infected A. aegypti&#xD;
      mosquitoes plus standard Aedes vector control measures reduces the sero-incidence of&#xD;
      arbovirus (ARBV) infection compared to standard Aedes vector control measures alone. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are (1) to evaluate whether release of Wolbachia-infected A. aegypti&#xD;
      mosquitoes plus standard Aedes vector control measures reduces the sero-incidence rate of&#xD;
      arbovirus (ARBV) infection, inferred from model-based reconstruction of serological dynamics&#xD;
      compared to standard Aedes vector control measures alone; (2) to evaluate whether release of&#xD;
      Wolbachia-infected A. aegypti mosquitoes plus standard Aedes vector control measures reduces&#xD;
      the sero-incidence of flavivirus or chikungunya virus infection amongst individuals who are&#xD;
      seronegative to each of these families of viruses, respectively, at study entry, compared to&#xD;
      standard Aedes vector control measures alone; (3) To evaluate whether release of&#xD;
      Wolbachia-infected A. aegypti mosquitoes plus standard Aedes vector control measures reduces&#xD;
      the overall sero-incidence of flavivirus (dengue virus + zika virus) infection; (4) to&#xD;
      evaluate whether release of Wolbachia-infected A. aegypti mosquitoes plus standard Aedes&#xD;
      vector control measures reduces the sero-incidence of dengue virus infection; (5) to evaluate&#xD;
      whether release of Wolbachia-infected A. aegypti mosquitoes plus standard Aedes vector&#xD;
      control measures reduces the sero-incidence of zika virus infection; (6) to evaluate whether&#xD;
      release of Wolbachia-infected A. aegypti mosquitoes plus standard Aedes vector control&#xD;
      measures reduces the sero-incidence of chikungunya virus infection among those who are&#xD;
      chikungunya virus infection seronagative at baseline; (7) to evaluate whether release of&#xD;
      Wolbachia-infected A. aegypti mosquitoes plus standard Aedes vector control measures reduces&#xD;
      the sero-incidence of infection with a dengue virus serotype amongst individuals who are&#xD;
      seropositive to another dengue virus serotype(s) at study entry, compared to standard Aedes&#xD;
      vector control measures alone; (8) to evaluate the extent to which Wolbachia-infected A.&#xD;
      aegypti mosquitoes replace uninfected adult A. aegypti in intervention clusters; and (9) to&#xD;
      evaluate the contamination of control clusters by Wolbachia-infected A. aegypti mosquitoes&#xD;
      released in intervention clusters.&#xD;
