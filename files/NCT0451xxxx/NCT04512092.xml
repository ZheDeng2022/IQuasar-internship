  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial aims to improve the quality of the care provided in residential youth&#xD;
      care, through a Compassionate Mind Training (CMT-C) program targeted to caregivers. The&#xD;
      promotion of an affiliative mentality of caring, warmth and affection in the residential care&#xD;
      setting is operationalized through the development of a compassionate-self and compassionate&#xD;
      care skills. A cluster randomized trial with a control group was carried out in order to test&#xD;
      the efficacy of a 12-session Compassionate Mind Training Program to caregivers of residential&#xD;
      youth care in increasing compassion, self-compassion, social safeness, emotional climate,&#xD;
      empathy, emotion regulation, satisfaction with life, and resiliency and in reducing&#xD;
      self-criticism, fears of compassion as well as stress, burnout, anxiety and depression.&#xD;
      Youths in residential care were also assessed as informants, thought self-reported&#xD;
      questionnaires on current experiences of warmth and safeness, social safeness, emotional&#xD;
      climate, positive and negative affect. The organizational impact was assessed via focus&#xD;
      groups. It is hypothesized that the CMT-C would produce significant improvements in outcome&#xD;
      measures, when comparing caregivers who receive the CMT-C with those in the control group. It&#xD;
      is expected that after the training, caregivers will present a greater sensibility to their&#xD;
      own and others suffering and motivation to relieve it, exhibiting and experiencing empathic&#xD;
      responses. Consequently, it is also expected that youths in care perceive more warmth and&#xD;
      safeness experiences with caregivers and a more secure and safe emotional climate in the&#xD;
      residential care home.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Cluster Randomized Trial with a control group carried out in twelve Portuguese&#xD;
      Residential Youth Care facilities. It aimed to test the efficacy of a group-based&#xD;
      Compassionate Mind Training program (CMT-C) targeted to caregivers, in promoting significant&#xD;
      changes both in caregivers and adolescents in residential youth care. This trial was carried&#xD;
      out in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the&#xD;
      applicable national laws and regulations. The ethics committee of the Faculty of Psychology&#xD;
      and Educational Sciences of the University of Coimbra approved the study's procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since CMT-C is targeted for residential care homes' (RCH) teams, for practical reasons (to&#xD;
      maximize time and human resources) and to avoid contamination, the unit of randomization was&#xD;
      the RCH (i.e., cluster), hence a cluster randomized design was followed according CONSORT&#xD;
      guidelines. From the 32 RCH within the Centre region of Portugal, 19 RCH obeying to cluster&#xD;
      eligibility criteria were invited to participate. Twelve RCH agreed to enter the trial. Their&#xD;
      caregivers and adolescents, who were eligible for the study, were informed of the goals and&#xD;
      procedures of this research, and invited to voluntarily participate. No incentives were&#xD;
      offered for participation. Written informed consent were sought at the cluster level (from&#xD;
      the board of each RCH), and at the individual level to caregivers and adolescents (and their&#xD;
      legal guardians), before the randomization occurred. Adolescents aged between 14 and 16 YO,&#xD;
      gave informed assent, while the older than 16 YO will give written informed consent. A&#xD;
      written informed consent was also gathered from guardians/legal representatives of all&#xD;
      adolescent participants under 18 YO. The anonymity of all participants responses was&#xD;
      guaranteed, with the use of respondent-specific codes, which were also used to link the data&#xD;
      from one time point to the other. Data was collectively collected in each RCH with the&#xD;
      presence of an independent researcher, in order to answer any questions and ensure&#xD;
      confidentiality. All participants (caregivers and adolescents) were assessed through&#xD;
      self-report measures 5 times across 12 months. Specifically, participants were assessed 3&#xD;
      months before the beginning of the CMT-C (Baseline 0 - time 0), before the first session of&#xD;
      the program (baseline 1 - time 1), right after its terminus (i.e., post-treatment assessment&#xD;
      - time 2), and 3 and 6 months after intervention terminus (follow-up 1 and 2 - time 3 and&#xD;
      time 4). Participants in the control group were assessed with the same time intervals as&#xD;
      those in intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first baseline assessment, a computer-generated randomization was conducted at the&#xD;
      cluster level, following a completely randomized design. Each RCH (i.e., cluster) was&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two conditions: CMT-C and control group. Six RCH were allocated&#xD;
      in the experimental group and received the TMC for caregivers, the remaining 6 constituted&#xD;
      the control group. Caregivers in the treatment group attended the CMT-C for about 12 weeks.&#xD;
      The CMT-C consisted of twelve, 2.5-hr weekly group sessions, delivered in each RCH to a group&#xD;
      of 7 to 10 participants. Caregivers in the control group did not received any mind training&#xD;
      or group intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After post-treatment assessments, focus groups were carried out with the caregivers allocated&#xD;
      in the CMT-C group, in order to enrich understanding about the participants' experience with&#xD;
      the intervention and their perception of change at 3 different levels (individual,&#xD;
      interindividual and organizational).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment integrity were ensured through: a) specific treatment manuals; b) direct training&#xD;
      of the therapist; c) supervision; and d) assessment of adherence and competence through an&#xD;
      integrity rating scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment effects will be analyzed following an intention-to-treat analysis using Latent&#xD;
      Growth Curve Models (LGCM). The intercept (i.e., initial status) and slope (i.e., change over&#xD;
      time) will be modeled as latent variables from longitudinal data (T0 to T4). Per-protocol&#xD;
      analysis will also be carried out to investigate treatment effects in completers. Moderator&#xD;
      (e.g., clusters) effects will also be tested with Conditional LGCM, and will be included as&#xD;
      predictors of change over time in the outcome measures. Nested qualitative evaluation with&#xD;
      thematic analysis will be carried out after the last follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>Caregivers reported on the Compassion Scale (CS; Pommier, 2011; Portuguese version by Sousa, Castilho, Vieira, Vagos, &amp; Rijo, 2017). The CS is a 24-item self-report scale that measures compassion for others. Participants answered each item according to how frequently they feel and act towards others, using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = almost never, to 5 = almost always). In the Portuguese version, a CFA revealed the existence of six subscales and two higher-order factors: Compassion (comprising the positive subscales: Kindness, Common Humanity, Mindfulness) and Disconnectedness (comprising the negative subscales: Indifference, Separation and Disengagement), which represent a positive and a negative valence of compassion.</description>

    <description>CMT-C is a 12-session group program, each lasting about 2,5 hours, which run on a weekly basis. The program is organized across 3 modules: 1) Our mind according to a compassion-based approach (to provide insight into the evolved and socially shaped mind and the affect regulation systems); 2) Compassionate mind training (understanding and cultivating the attributes and competencies of compassion in its three flows, and addressing its fears); and 3) final session (revising key information and practices and its application to the RCH practices/routines). Its sessions have the following structure: 1) Check-in (grounding exercise, reviewing the previous session, sharing the weekly practice); 2) Exploration of the session theme (psychoeducation and experiential practices followed by group opportunities for share experiences and discussion); 3) Check-out (session summary and application to the self, youths and RCH practices, weekly practice challenge, session evaluation, session take-off).</description>
