  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this is to evaluate the effect of proton pump inhibitor (rabeprazole) and the&#xD;
      effect of a CYP3A inducer (rifampin) on the pharmacokinetics of Surufatinib.&#xD;

      This study will be a single center, open-label, 2 part, 2 period fixed-sequence crossover&#xD;
      study to be conducted with 28 healthy male and female subjects (part A and part B). Subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled in either part A or part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A, subjects will be administered surufatinib alone in treatment Period 1 and&#xD;
      co-administered with rabeprazole in treatment Period 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B, subjects will be administered surufatinib alone in treatment Period 1 and&#xD;
      co-administered with rifampin in treatment Period 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK samples will be collected through out both study periods.Subjects will be confined in the&#xD;
      clinic from check-in on Day -1 through the end-of study visit on Day 15 (part A) and Day 16&#xD;
      (part B).&#xD;
