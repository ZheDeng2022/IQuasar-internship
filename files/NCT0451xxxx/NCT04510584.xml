  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to look at the combination of the drugs atezolizumab and bevacizumab&#xD;
      as a maintenance treatment (treatment given after the main treatment to keep the cancer from&#xD;
      coming back or worsening) following standard therapy in patients with high grade ovarian,&#xD;
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer with a mutation (change) in a gene called TP53.&#xD;
      Genes are molecules in the body that are made up of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and control&#xD;
      how the body's cells behave.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atezolizumab and bevacizumab are a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies are&#xD;
      proteins that are naturally found in the blood stream that fight infections. A monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody is a special kind of antibody that is created in a laboratory that seeks out&#xD;
      specific proteins in the body that may be involved in cancers to stop tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When tumor cells start to die, broken down pieces of the tumor's DNA gets released into the&#xD;
      blood stream, called circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Looking at ctDNA may be useful in&#xD;
      determining whether the cancer is responding to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to see whether looking at tumor DNA circulating in the&#xD;
      bloodstream can help to determine which patients may respond to atezolizumab and bevacizumab&#xD;
      and whether this drug combination is useful, when given as a maintenance treatment for&#xD;
      patients with TP53 mutant ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
