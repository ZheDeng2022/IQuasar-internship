    <textblock>
      This study consists of both single and multiple ascending doses in healthy subjects and in&#xD;
      subjects with cholestatic or uremic pruritus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 48 healthy subjects will receive a single dose of EP547 or placebo. There will be a&#xD;
      screening period of up to 28 days prior to the first dose, and a follow up visit 7 days after&#xD;
      dosing is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 healthy subjects will receive multiple doses of EP547 or placebo for 7 days. There will be&#xD;
      a screening period of up to 28 days prior to the first dose, and a follow up visit 7 days and&#xD;
      then 14 days after dosing is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 subjects with cholestatic disease will receive a single dose of EP547. There will be a&#xD;
      screening period of up to 28 days prior to the first dose, and a follow up visit 7 days after&#xD;
      dosing is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 16 subjects with cholestatic pruritus will receive multiple doses of EP547 or placebo&#xD;
      for 7 days. There will be a screening period of up to 28 days prior to the first dose, and a&#xD;
      follow up visit 7 days and then 14 days after dosing is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 subjects with uremic disease will receive a single dose of EP547. There will be a screening&#xD;
      period of up to 28 days prior to the first dose, and a follow up visit 7 days after dosing is&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 16 subjects with uremic pruritus will receive multiple doses of EP547 or placebo for 7&#xD;
      days. There will be a screening period of up to 28 days prior to the first dose, and a follow&#xD;
      up visit 7 days and then 14 days after dosing is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 healthy subjects will receive two doses of EP547 under fasted or fed condition.&#xD;
