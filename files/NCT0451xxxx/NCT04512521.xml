    <textblock>
      Patients with severe eosinophilic asthma will be placed on biologics if they continue to be&#xD;
      uncontrolled despite maximized inhalation therapy or if they are only controlled under oral&#xD;
      corticosteroids. Among biologics, 80% of patients respond to treatment and improve&#xD;
      clinically, but approximately 20% are non-responders and up to date no established predictive&#xD;
      factors for treatment response exist. Among the responders, about 30% respond very well&#xD;
      (so-called super responders), the rest shows moderate improvements. As the lung function, one&#xD;
      main criterion to evaluate treatment response improves in most patients with delay, the&#xD;
      response (or non-response) to treatment can only be reliably estimated after 4 to 12 months.&#xD;
      This can lead to prolonged use of medication in non-responders (overtreatment) on one hand&#xD;
      and to unjustified and premature termination of therapy (undertreatment) on the other hand&#xD;
      (GINA report 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional lung MRI has the potential to show early changes in lung microstructure, regional&#xD;
      ventilation and perfusion and thus has the potential for early detection of therapy response.&#xD;
      Very promising results of dynamic regional ventilation and perfusion mapping using phase&#xD;
      resolved functional lung (PREFUL) MRI have been shown recently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, if functional lung MRI can reliably detect treatment effects under Mepolizumab&#xD;
      therapy and can help to predict a long-term patient outcome is still unknown. As these&#xD;
      findings could directly influence clinical decision making this question is of high clinical&#xD;
      relevance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic disease and affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. Of these&#xD;
      patients 3-10% have severe asthma which is defined as asthma remaining uncontrolled despite&#xD;
      treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids combined with other controllers (long-acting&#xD;
      Î²2-agonist, long-acting antimuscarinic agent, leukotriene receptor antagonist or&#xD;
      theophylline) and/or treatment with systemic glucocorticoids for at least 6 months. Severe&#xD;
      asthma causes a high amount of medical expenses in asthma. For patients suffering from severe&#xD;
      uncontrolled asthma, an IL-5 antibody (mepolizumab) has been approved for therapy when a type&#xD;
      2 inflammation was present. Treatment is well tolerated and a significant reduction of&#xD;
      exacerbations, oral glucocorticoid use was reported. Another IL-5 antibody (reslizumab) and&#xD;
      an IL-5 receptor antibody (benralizumab) are available now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with severe eosinophilic asthma will be placed on biologics if they continue to be&#xD;
      uncontrolled under maximal therapy or if they are only controlled under oral corticosteroids.&#xD;
      Among biologics, 80% of patients improve, 20% are non-responders, but there is no way to&#xD;
      identify them early. Among the responders, about 30% respond very well (so-called super&#xD;
      responders), the rest shows moderate improvements. The main problems at the moment are that&#xD;
      lung function improvements are only delayed, the response (or non-response) can only be&#xD;
      reliably estimated after 4 to 12 months. This leads on the one hand to prolonged use of&#xD;
      medication in non-responders (overtreatment), on the other hand to unjustified and premature&#xD;
      termination of therapy (undertreatment) (GINA report 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale Functional lung MRI has the potential to show early changes in lung&#xD;
      microstructure, regional ventilation and perfusion and thus has the potential for early&#xD;
      detection of therapy response. Very promising results of dynamic regional ventilation and&#xD;
      perfusion mapping using phase resolved functional lung (PREFUL) MRI have been shown recently.&#xD;
      This technique holds the promise to mature into a patient friendly sensitive MRI spirometry&#xD;
      test, with novel clinically relevant information to guide clinical decision making and&#xD;
      improve patient monitoring. PREFUL MRI typically uses standard 1.5T or 3T MRI equipment and&#xD;
      is based on a routine gradient echo fast low angle shot (FLASH) sequence. PREFUL is well&#xD;
      suited also for children, because it is a free breathing exam without the need for i.v.&#xD;
      contrast and has a relatively short examination time. The ventilation, perfusion and dynamic&#xD;
      flow-volume loop maps are reconstructed entirely after the image acquisition using complex&#xD;
      registration and post processing algorithms developed and validated at Hannover Medical&#xD;
      School. Preliminary unpublished data show that PREFUL MRI may detect changes in regional&#xD;
      ventilation 3 months after anti IL 5 antibody therapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, if functional lung MRI can reliably detect changes at 3 months of Mepolizumab&#xD;
      treatment and can predict long term patient outcome is still unknown, which is of high&#xD;
      clinical relevance for future clinical decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to examine if early treatment changes of Mepolizumab treatment can&#xD;
      be detected at 3 months measured by functional lung MRI and predict clinical outcome at 12&#xD;
      months of treatment.&#xD;
