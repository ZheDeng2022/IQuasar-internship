    <textblock>
      The aim of the FLUID Trial is to conduct a pragmatic, multi-centre, open label randomized&#xD;
      cluster cross-over trial (RCT) to determine whether fluid administration with 0.9% saline as&#xD;
      compared to Ringer's lactate decreases death or re-admission to hospital with 90 days of the&#xD;
      index admission.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crystalloid fluids are used extensively for acutely ill patients who are admitted to&#xD;
      hospital. Two fluids most commonly used are 0.9% saline and Ringer's Lactate. Both are used&#xD;
      to rehydrate patients, restore fluid volume and help stabilize blood pressure and failing&#xD;
      organ and both have been used for several decades. Until recently, it was thought the fluids&#xD;
      are essentially equivalent other than some minor differences related to the concentration of&#xD;
      salt components (sodium and chloride) and buffers (Ringer's Lactate has lactate as a buffer).&#xD;
      The safety of 0.9% saline is now being questioned due to its high chloride content and its&#xD;
      association with the development of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Until recently, the&#xD;
      evidence base supporting the superiority of Ringer's Lactate has been derived from&#xD;
      observational studies. Two recent pilot studies in critically ill patients comparing 0.9%&#xD;
      saline to balanced crystalloid fluids (Ringer's lactate and/or Plasma-Lyte, another balanced&#xD;
      crystalloid) did not detect clinical outcome differences between the fluid groups, but the&#xD;
      trials were not powered to do so. Furthermore, two multiple period cluster cross-over studies&#xD;
      conducted at one institution comparing 0.9% saline to balanced crystalloids (Ringer's lactate&#xD;
      and Plasma-Lyte) in the emergency department (ED) and intensive care unit (ICU) found small&#xD;
      differences in a composite outcome which included death, requirement for dialysis or&#xD;
      persistent renal dysfunction, in favor of balanced crystalloids. Authors and editorialists&#xD;
      now urge the conduct of large multi-centre randomized trials, with longer-term patient&#xD;
      centred outcomes supported by health economic evaluations to provide confirmatory evidence to&#xD;
      guide future clinical practice and resource allocation related to these usual care&#xD;
      crystalloid fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small differences in clinical outcomes between crystalloid resuscitation fluids are highly&#xD;
      relevant. Furthermore, small absolute differences in important clinical outcomes may&#xD;
      translate into substantial savings to hospitals and the health care system. The FLUID trial&#xD;
      will determine if there are differences in the clinically important outcomes of death and&#xD;
      hospital re-admissions. FLUID is novel in its design because it is a hospital wide pragmatic&#xD;
      cluster cross-over comparative effectiveness trial that will be conducted in both academic&#xD;
      and community sites which will use provincial health administrative data available through&#xD;
      the Institute of Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) for all clinical data collection. Our&#xD;
      trial will answer this fundamental fluid resuscitation question and determine if Ringer's&#xD;
      Lactate is superior to 0.9% saline at much lower cost in comparison to an individual patient&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT), or even a conventional cluster RCT.&#xD;
