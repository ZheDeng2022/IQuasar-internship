  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the brain's long-term imprint of a traumatic event.&#xD;
      PTSD is characterized by intrusive thoughts, nightmares and flashbacks of past traumatic&#xD;
      events, avoidance of trauma reminders, hypervigilance, and sleep disturbance, all of which&#xD;
      lead to considerable social, occupational, and interpersonal dysfunction. The current&#xD;
      available treatments for PTSD include medications and psychotherapy. However, a substantial&#xD;
      proportion of patients have treatment resistant PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years there is growing evidence that traumatic events can induce changes in the&#xD;
      brain's structure and function that may persist months or even years after the acute event.&#xD;
      The &quot;non-healing brain wound&quot; can be visualized using functional imaging. The new insight&#xD;
      regarding the biological nature of PTSD obligates biological intervention that can induce&#xD;
      neuroplasticity and recovery of the damage brain tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) includes the inhalation of 100% oxygen in a pressurized&#xD;
      chamber with pressures exceeding 1 atmosphere absolute (ATA), thus enhancing the amount of&#xD;
      oxygen dissolved in the body's tissues. It is now understood that the combined action of both&#xD;
      hyperoxia and hyperbaric pressure together with, oxygen fluctuations generated by a&#xD;
      pre-defined protocol may target both oxygen and pressure sensitive genes, resulting in&#xD;
      improved mitochondrial metabolism with anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects.&#xD;
      Moreover, these genes induce the proliferation of stem cells, augmented circulating levels of&#xD;
      endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and angiogenesis factors, which induce angiogenesis and&#xD;
      improved blood flow in the ischemic area. In recent years there is growing evidence that HBOT&#xD;
      induced brain neuroplasticity leads to repair of chronically impaired brain functions in&#xD;
      post-stroke and in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients with prolonged post-concussion&#xD;
      syndrome, even years after the brain insult, as well as in healthy aging adults. HBOT can&#xD;
      also induce neuroplasticity and significantly improve the clinical symptoms of the most&#xD;
      common prototype of central sensitization syndrome - fibromyalgia syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of HBOT on patients suffering from chronic unremitting PTSD due to combat trauma&#xD;
      were evaluated in a pilot study done in the investigator's institute. The recently done study&#xD;
      included veterans with combat associated PTSD according to the Ministry of Defense (MOD)&#xD;
      criteria, who failed to improve using the current available treatments. The results of the&#xD;
      study demonstrated the beneficial effect of HBOT in this unfortunate severely injured&#xD;
      unremitting PTSD population. Clinically significant improvement was demonstrated in a major&#xD;
      fraction of study participants. In correlation with the clinical improvement, a significant&#xD;
      improvement in brain activity was demonstrated in the functional MRI imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effect of HBOT on chronic unremitting combat&#xD;
      associated PTSD in an double blind sham control study&#xD;

    <description>All the conditions provided in the HBOT intervention will be provided in the sham intervention. However, in contrast to the HBOT, where the pressure will go up to 2 ATA, in the sham condition the pressure will go up to 1.1 ATA during the first five minutes of the session with noise of circulating air, and then decrease slowly during the next half hour to 1.0 ATA and the oxygen level will be 21% The initial 1.1 ATA level will provide a minimal pressure sensation in the ears, with the same nurse advice on pumping the ears. In the last five minutes of the session, the air will be circulated again with its related noises. Sham and HBOT sessions will never be adjacent, so subjects from the two groups cannot meet and discuss the session and its effects.</description>
