        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be enrolled or agree to consent to the companion genomic profiling study&#xD;
             MSKCC IRB# 12-245 Part A. Results are not required prior to initiating treatment on&#xD;
             protocol, unless patients do not have other test results by IHC or FISH confirming&#xD;
             HER2 overexpression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recurrent or persistent HER2 overexpressing endometrial cancer or&#xD;
             endometrial carcinosarcoma. HER2 overexpression is defined as 3+ by IHC or 2+ with&#xD;
             gene amplification by FISH (HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥ 2) or HER2 amplified (fold change ≥ 2)&#xD;
             on MSK IMPACT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologic documentation of diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma or carcinosarcoma is&#xD;
             required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had at least one but no more than two prior chemotherapeutic&#xD;
             regimens for management of endometrial carcinoma (including neo-adjuvant and/or&#xD;
             adjuvant chemotherapy). Initial treatment may include chemotherapy, chemotherapy and&#xD;
             radiation therapy, and/or consolidation/maintenance therapy. Chemotherapy administered&#xD;
             in conjunction with primary radiation as a radio-sensitizer WILL be counted as a&#xD;
             systemic chemotherapy regimen. Prior hormonal therapy will not count as a prior&#xD;
             regimen. Prior treatment with trastuzumab is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  LVEF ≥ 50% on baseline screening ECHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Resolution of adverse effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy to&#xD;
             Grade ≤ 1 prior to first study treatment (with the exception of alopecia or clinically&#xD;
             insignificant laboratory values).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined by RECIST&#xD;
             (version 1.1). Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each&#xD;
             non-nodal lesion must be 10 mm when measured by CT, MRI or caliper measurement by&#xD;
             clinical exam; or 20 mm when measured by chest x-ray. Lymph nodes must be ≥ 15 mm in&#xD;
             short axis when measured by CT or MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No active infection requiring antibiotics (with the exception of uncomplicated urinary&#xD;
             tract infection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must consent to mandatory pre-treatment and post-treatment core needle&#xD;
             biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate hematological, liver, cardiac and kidney function within&#xD;
             14 days prior to first treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L (&gt; 1500 per mm^3)&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN). (Unless&#xD;
                  Gilbert's Syndrome, for which Bilirubin ≤ 3 x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
                  (ULN), without concurrent clinically significant liver disease) AST (SGOT)/ALT&#xD;
                  (SGPT) ≤ 3 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) unless liver metastases&#xD;
                  are present, in which case it must be ≤ 5x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients of childbearing potential, agreement to use two effective forms of&#xD;
             contraception (e.g., surgical sterilization, a reliable barrier method, birth control&#xD;
             pills, or contraceptive hormone implants) and to continue its use for the duration of&#xD;
             the study and for 12 weeks after the last ZW25 dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to practice total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
             lifestyle of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential unless 1 of the following&#xD;
                  applies: She is considered to be permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization&#xD;
                  methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, tubal ligation, and&#xD;
                  bilateral oophorectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. She is postmenopausal, defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative&#xD;
                  medical cause. A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level consistently in&#xD;
                  the postmenopausal range (30 mIU/mL or higher) may be used to confirm a&#xD;
                  postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal&#xD;
                  replacement therapy; however, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single&#xD;
                  FSH measurement is insufficient to confirm a postmenopausal state.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy&#xD;
                  test result less than 3 day prior to administration of the first dose of study&#xD;
                  treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

        of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Presence of measurable disease outside the CNS&#xD;

                  within 4 weeks prior to treatment.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participation in another clinical study with receipt of an investigational&#xD;
