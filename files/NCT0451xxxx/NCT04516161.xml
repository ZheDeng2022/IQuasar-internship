  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational study researchers want to gather more information about the&#xD;
      characteristics of patients treated with Radium-223 (Xofigo) who had survived over a long&#xD;
      period of time prostate cancer that had spread to other places in the body and keeps growing&#xD;
      even when the amount of testosterone in the body is reduced to very low levels (metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer, mCRPC). In addition researchers want to identify the&#xD;
      factors which may contribute to survival over a long period of time in those patients.&#xD;
      Radium-223 (Ra-223) is an alpha particle-emitting radioactive agent approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Availability of this study's data will be determined according to Bayer's commitment to the EFPIA/PhRMA &quot;Principles for responsible clinical trial data sharing&quot;. This pertains to scope, timepoint and process of data access. As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014. Interested researchers can use www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com to request access to anonymized patient-level data and supporting documents from clinical studies to conduct research.
