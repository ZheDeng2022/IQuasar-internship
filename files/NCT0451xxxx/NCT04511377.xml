  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to examine the effect of short-term rehabilitation exercise support using&#xD;
      digital healthcare system (Uincare homeplus) in the patients with rotator cuff repair&#xD;
      surgery. The study is a two-arm prospective randomized controlled study comparing the effect&#xD;
      of rehabilitation exercise digital healthcare system at home with conventional brochure-based&#xD;
      home exercise. Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Pain (using Numerical rating scale), shoulder&#xD;
      range of motion (ROM), Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), Shoulder Pain and&#xD;
      Disability Index (SPADI), quality of life using EQ-5D will be evaluation on enrollment,&#xD;
      6-weeks, 12-weeks and 24-weeks after enrollment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff tear is one of the most common disorders affecting shoulder pain and&#xD;
      disabilities of daily life. It is a disorder that can be caused by trauma, overuse,&#xD;
      inappropriate usage of shoulder as well as degenerative change, which is increasing due to&#xD;
      enlarged geriatric population. Current method of post-operative rehabilitation is home-based&#xD;
      self rehabilitation using brochure, combined with one or two times of education at the&#xD;
      hospital before discharge. Patients often find difficulty in doing rehabilitation by&#xD;
      themselves at home without supervision which resulted in decreased compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With development of technologies using multi-motion sensor and AR(augmented-reality) system,&#xD;
      the investigators have developed a digital healthcare system(Uincare Homeplus) which can&#xD;
      supplement patients' rehabilitation at home by giving them proper instructions as well as&#xD;
      feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective randomized controlled study, the investigators aimed to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of the newly-developed digital healthcare system with conventional rehabilitation&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Enrollment, 6-weeks, 12-weeks, 24-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Simple Shoulder Test is a self-reported shoulder-specific questionnaire that measures functional limitations of the affected shoulder in patients with shoulder dysfunction. The SST consists of 12 questions with dichotomous (yes/ no) response options. score ranges from 0 to 100, higher score meaning better shoulder function.</description>

    <time_frame>Enrollment, 6-weeks, 12-weeks, 24-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of pain of the affected shoulder using numerical rating scale (0-10, with score 0 indicating no pain), higher scores mean worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Manual Muscle Test (MMT) on the affected arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment, 6-weeks, 12-weeks, 24-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of change of MMT in the affected arm from baseline to 24 weeks Upper extremities MMT ranges from 0-25, higher scoring meaning better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) on the affected arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment, 6-weeks, 12-weeks, 24-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The DASH is a 30-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb. The score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability) with higher score meaning worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) on the affected shoulder</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment, 6-weeks, 12-weeks, 24-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities.&#xD;
Overall total scores range from 0 to 130 with higher score indicating more shoulder dysfunction.</description>
