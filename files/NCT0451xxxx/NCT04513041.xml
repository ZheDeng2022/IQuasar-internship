  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an assessor-blinded split-mouth randomized clinical study to compare root coverage&#xD;
      and gingival tissue thickness following two different surgical procedures for non-autologous&#xD;
      grafting: the pinhole surgical technique (PST) and tunnel technique.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient will undergo both surgeries on either quadrant; the PST and tunnel technique.&#xD;
      The site will be randomized to receive either type of surgeries. Both types of surgeries are&#xD;
      considered minimally invasive procedures to obtain root coverage for gingival recession. Both&#xD;
      surgeries are clinically utilized in clinical practice and yield comparable results according&#xD;
      to the literature, however, No prospective studies are published to compare between the&#xD;
      outcomes of both techniques. patients will receive intra oral scan before the surgery and 6&#xD;
      months after the surgery to compare change in root coverage and gingival thickness outcomes&#xD;
      between the two techniques. Post operative pain as well as patient satisfaction will be&#xD;
      measured by visual analog scale and compared between the two techniques. Patients will be&#xD;
      monitored at different time points to asses healing.&#xD;

    <description>Each subject will have the each surgical procedure which are both considered routine minimally invasive clinical care for gingival recession. Gum recession on one side will receive Pinhole surgical technique (test procedure). The other side will receive Tunnel technique (control procedure), Research component involved is the capture of digital impression using intra-oral scanner in the baseline (preoperative) and the final visit (6 months postoperative).</description>
