    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes of medial UKA and HTO in the treatment&#xD;
      of AMOA by investigating the performance of these 2 procedures in terms of functional&#xD;
      outcome, radiographic assessment, range of motion, postoperative complications, revision rate&#xD;
      and relevant health economics outcome, then identify factors associated with better clinical&#xD;
      performance. It is aimed to provide evidence-based guidelines for selecting the appropriate&#xD;
      procedure in managing AMOA in Chinese population based on the findings of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pain Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SF-12 Health Survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Radiographic assessment includes pre-op and post-op mechanical femorotibial angle&#xD;
           (mFTA), patella height, patellofemoral medial and lateral articular surfaces, and&#xD;
           displacement angle of patella&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Range of motion&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Adverse event rate and classification (including complication)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Operating time&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Total blood loss (BRECHER formula)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Revision rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health economic outcomes based on hospital discharge days, recovery time, physiotherapy and&#xD;
      complications/ reoperations will also be analyzed.&#xD;

    <measure>Oxford Knee Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Oxford Knee Score is a patient reported outcome measure questionnaire with a total score range from 0 (severe arthritis) to 48 (satisfactory joint function). The questionnaire contains 12 questions, each with five options scoring from 0 to 4 with 4 being the best outcome for each question.</description>

    <measure>Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-op, Post-op 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 2 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) is a measure of pain intensity in adults that consists of a numeric version of the visual analog scale numbers between 0 and 10 where 0 indicates &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 indicates &quot;maximum pain&quot;. Respondents select a whole one number between 0 and 10, which is best representative of their pain intensity with higher scores indicating greater pain intensity.</description>

    <measure>SF-12 Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-op, Post-op 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 2 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12) measures generic health concepts relevant across age, disease, and treatment groups. It was designed to measure general health status from the patient's point of view and includes 8 concepts commonly represented in health surveys: physical functioning, role functioning physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role functioning emotional, and mental health. Two summary scores are reported from the SF-12, namely a mental component score (MCS-12) and a physical component score (PCS-12). All subscale scores were transformed to a 0 to 100 scale with the higher score indicating less dysfunction, impairment, or pain.</description>

    <measure>Mechanical femorotibial angle (mFTA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-op, Post-op 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 2 year</time_frame>
    <description>Mechanical femorotibial angle is a measurement that assess the mechanical alignment of the lower limb using the long-leg radiograph. It is the lesser angle intersecting the mechanical femoral axis (the line from the center of the femoral head to the knee center) and the mechanical tibial axis (the line from the knee center to the ankle center).</description>
