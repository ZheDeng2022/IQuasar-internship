  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community health workers (CHWs) have successfully used Motivational Interviewing (MI) to&#xD;
      improve treatment adherence (i.e. taking medications and attending clinic appointments) for&#xD;
      patients with depression in the US and globally. Mobile health (mHealth) tools can address&#xD;
      challenges in implementing MI by providing real-time support in the community and&#xD;
      facilitating ongoing coaching and supervision for CHWs, as these two challenges currently&#xD;
      impede CHWs' ability to use MI. The investigators will develop then test a new mHealth app,&#xD;
      which can potentially be used in the US and abroad, to help CHWs receive decision-support for&#xD;
      MI and capture consented audio recordings of patient interactions for review and feedback by&#xD;
      facility-based nurses with MI expertise.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will develop Community-based mHealth Motivational Interviewing Tool (COMMIT) using iterative design and testing with frequent, structured input from the key stakeholders: community health workers (CHWs), their supervisors and adult depression patients.The tool will be used by community CHWs in Dolakha, Nepal to: 1) obtain decision-support to deliver motivational interviewing (MI) for patients in their communities, and 2) capture consented audio recordings of client interactions for review and feedback by their supervisors, allowing CHWs to maintain MI skills beyond the initial training period.</description>
