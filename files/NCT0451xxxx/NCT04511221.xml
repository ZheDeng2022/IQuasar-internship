  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The BacterioPHAGE for Gastrointestinal Health-2 study is designed to determine if a&#xD;
      commercial bacteriophage product can increase the survival and efficacy of probiotic bacteria&#xD;
      that will be concurrently administered. Bacteriophages may act as prebiotics, which are&#xD;
      traditionally defined as indigestible dietary components that selectively enhance specific&#xD;
      bacterial species in the intestines to confer a health benefit. In this study, the&#xD;
      &quot;prebiotic&quot; is a unique combination of bacteriophages, or viruses that infect bacteria. These&#xD;
      phages are generally regarded as safe for human consumption and are presumed to function by&#xD;
      infecting pro-inflammatory E. coli strains in the gut. The removal of these strains alters&#xD;
      the gut environment to allow growth of more favorable bacteria, and the lysis products of&#xD;
      these E. coli may be assimilated by beneficial species to enhance their populations.The phage&#xD;
      product, PreforPro, has shown to be effective in culture-based and animal studies, but its&#xD;
      efficacy in increasing specific probiotic species has not been demonstrated in humans. The&#xD;
      investigators have previously shown that PreforPro is both safe and tolerable in a human&#xD;
      population and does not broadly disrupt the gut microbiota as would be seen with antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The commercial bacteriophage preparation,PreforPro, is often found as an ingredient in&#xD;
      commercial probiotcs, so the goal of the current study is to determine if PreforPro&#xD;
      consumption concurrent with probiotic usage improves probiotic survival and activity. A&#xD;
      secondary goal of this study is to assess various physiologic parameters to determine whether&#xD;
      consumption of PreforPro with a probiotic offers any health benefits beyond those of&#xD;
      consuming a probiotic alone. The investigators will examine whether consumption of the&#xD;
      PreforPro product increases detectable numbers of co-consumed probiotics and improves&#xD;
      parameters in clinical outcomes related to glucose and lipid metabolism, cardiovascular&#xD;
      function, inflammation of the intestines, or physical symptoms of gastrointestinal distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish these research goals, the investigators will be seeking 200 male and female&#xD;
      volunteers between 18-65 years old with BMI scores of 22 to 34.9. Recruitment will be by&#xD;
      referral from local practitioners, email recruitment, and through word-of-mouth. Eligibility&#xD;
      will be determined at the Colorado State University Food and Nutrition Clinical Research lab&#xD;
      by a screening questionnaire and interview/assessment by the clinical coordinator. After&#xD;
      securing consent, eligibility will be confirmed by taking anthropometric measures and&#xD;
      participants falling within the BMI range will randomly be assigned to 1 of 3 treatment&#xD;
      groups: (1) PreforPro+Bifidobacterium probiotic, (2) Bifidobacterium probiotic alone, or (3)&#xD;
      placebo. Participants will consume the provided capsules daily for a period of four (4)&#xD;
      weeks. Participants will be asked to visit the clinic at Visit 1 (Day 0) to pick up their&#xD;
      supply of capsules and undergo sample collections (blood and stool) and analysis procedures,&#xD;
      including weight/height, blood pressure, endothelial function analysis, gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptom screening, and blood and stool sample collection. At the end of the 4 week treatment&#xD;
      period, all analyses will be repeated. This means that participants will undergo screening&#xD;
      (either in person or by phone) and make a total of two (2) clinic visits during the study&#xD;
      (baseline, and final visit). Participants will additionally be asked to complete two 24 hour&#xD;
      dietary recalls prior to each clinic visit and track bowel movements using the Bristol Stool&#xD;
      Scale throughout the study treatment period. All blood samples will be collected at Colorado&#xD;
      State University by trained personnel. Fecal sample collection will be performed by the study&#xD;
      participant with collection materials provided.&#xD;
