    <measure>The primary endpoint is the number and percent (%) of successful heparin-free HD sessions* for each subject in each circuit.</measure>

    <description>*Definition of a successful HD session:&#xD;
A successful HD session must meet all the following criteria:&#xD;
Absence of complete HD circuit occlusion (Grade 4) rendering dialysis impossible&#xD;
Absence of the need to replace dialyzers or bloodlines due to clotting&#xD;
Absence of saline flushes to maintain blood flow through the circuit during the HD session&#xD;
Absence of any additional heparin beyond what is allowed per study visits&#xD;
Single pool Kt/V (spKt/V) ≥ 1.2&#xD;
