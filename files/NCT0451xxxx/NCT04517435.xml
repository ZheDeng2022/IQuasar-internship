  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate if ME-401 can improve the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      diffuse large b-celllymphoma (DLBCL). Many patients with DLBCL that are treated with the&#xD;
      standard of care (R-CHOP) are cured. However, a little less than half of patients will have&#xD;
      their cancer come back despite being treated. Once DLBCL comes back, it is much harder to&#xD;
      treat and treatment is much more aggressive. This study will combine ME-401 with R-CHOP.&#xD;
      There are 2 parts to this study: part1 referred to as phase I and part 2 referred to as phase&#xD;
      2. The goal of the phase I study is to find the safest dose to give patients in combination&#xD;
      with R-CHOP. The goal of the phase 2 study is to use the safest dose (found in phase 1) in&#xD;
      combination with R-CHOP to see if it decreases the rate of cancer coming back after it is&#xD;
      treated.&#xD;

      This study is a multi-institution, open-label, phase I/II study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of R-CHOP + ME-401 for participants with newly diagnosed DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives for the phase I portion of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ME-401in combination with R-CHOP for&#xD;
           participants with newly diagnosed DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe tolerability of ME-401 in combination with R-CHOP for participants with&#xD;
           newly diagnosed DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives for the phase II portion of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the clinical activity of ME-401 in combination with R-CHOP in participants&#xD;
           with newly diagnosed DLBCL, as measured by 1 year PFS rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the response rates (complete and partial remission),duration of response&#xD;
           (DOR), time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS) with ME-401 plus R-CHOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize treatment-related AEs in participants treated with ME-401 plus R-CHOP.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known CNS involvement by lymphoma. Participants at high risk for secondary CNS&#xD;
             involvement but without neurologic symptoms suspected to be due to lymphoma are&#xD;
             allowed to be enrolled and receive prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy including but&#xD;
             not limited to methotrexate, cytarabine and glucocorticoids. Participants who are&#xD;
             enrolled and subsequently identified to have pathologic confirmation of CNS&#xD;
             involvement by lymphoma may be continued on study at the discretion of the principal&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to R-CHOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with ongoing uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to ongoing&#xD;
             significantly active infections requiring intravenous antibiotics, hypertension,&#xD;
             angina, arrhythmias, pulmonary disease, or autoimmune dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled autoimmune hemolytic anemia or immune thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing drug-induced pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of clinically significant gastrointestinal (GI) conditions, particularly:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known GI condition that would interfere with swallowing or the oral absorption or&#xD;
                  tolerance of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pre-existing malabsorption syndrome or other clinical situation that would&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class&gt;2),&#xD;
             symptomatic ischemia, or conduction abnormalities uncontrolled by conventional&#xD;
             intervention or myocardial infarction within six months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen and/or hepatitis&#xD;
             B core antibody PLUS have detectable viral load on hepatitis B polymerase chain&#xD;

             appropriate anti-viral prophylaxis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab) participants with positive hepatitis C&#xD;
             antibody are eligible if they are negative for hepatitis C virus by PCR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with ME-401&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because there are no&#xD;
             studies assessing the reproductive and developmental toxicity or excretion into breast&#xD;
             milk of ME-401. Because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse events in&#xD;
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ME-401, breastfeeding should&#xD;
             be discontinued if the mother is treated with ME-401. These potential risks may also&#xD;
             apply to other drugs used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other malignancies within the past 3 years except for adequately treated carcinoma of&#xD;
             the cervix or basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, or low-risk prostate&#xD;
