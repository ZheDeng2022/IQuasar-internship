  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal randomized controlled study designed to assess changes in control of&#xD;
      Type 1 Diabetes in pubertal adolescents over a two year period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit adolescents with type 1 diabetes age 11-&lt;13 years and one&#xD;
      parent to participate in this 24-month study. While this is admittedly a long enrollment&#xD;
      time, study commitments following enrollment will be limited to three in-person visits at&#xD;
      yearly intervals and one virtual or in-person device training session to improve adherence.&#xD;
      Participants must be pubertal, as puberty appears to contribute significantly to the insulin&#xD;
      resistance that is likely related to worsened blood glucose control. Pubertal assessments&#xD;
      will occur at yearly intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to either continue their current diabetes therapy (with the&#xD;
      addition of use of a Dexcom CGM, forming the &quot;Usual Care+CGM&quot; Control Group; this includes&#xD;
      both adolescents using insulin pumps or multiple daily injections [MDI]). The Experimental&#xD;
      Group will use an AP system during the two year duration of the study. The primary outcome&#xD;
      will be HbA1c between groups at the 24-month visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following confirmation of eligibility participants will be assessed at Visit 1, with&#xD;
      assessments described further below. Randomization will occur at the end of Visit 2. A Run-In&#xD;
      Period of 2 weeks will be required for participants who do not have prior CGM experience or&#xD;
      MDI participants who have no prior insulin pump experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a Triple-Labeled Glucose Assessment at months 0, 12 and 24. This&#xD;
      assessment is to evaluate the degree of insulin resistance including in the hepatic and&#xD;
      peripheral compartments. They will also complete multiple questionnaires assessing aspects of&#xD;
      adolescent psychology and sociology. HbA1c will also be collected using a local lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CGM glucose data will be collected continuously via remote connection during the entire&#xD;
      study. At months 6 and 18, participants will be contacted to obtain insulin management&#xD;
      information and will have HbA1c measures assessed at a local clinic or laboratory. Additional&#xD;
      scheduled phone calls will occur in the month before the in-person study visits to request&#xD;
      HbA1c and confirm body composition/Triple-Labeled Glucose Assessment scheduling and discuss&#xD;
      use of CGM and activity tracker. Participants will be contacted in the event of insufficient&#xD;
      CGM or AP system use. For Experimental Group, insufficient use is defined as &lt;60% AP use over&#xD;
      a 3-month period. For the Control Group, less than 1 month of CGM data over a 3-month period&#xD;
      is considered insufficient. If participants do not meet minimum use criteria in 2 successive&#xD;
      periods, the participant will be discontinued from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are targeting completion of 21 child/parent dyads in each of the two study&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Currently using insulin for at least six months&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Both prior pump and MDI users will use insulin parameters such as carbohydrate ratio&#xD;
             and correction factors consistently on their pump in order to dose insulin for meals&#xD;
             or corrections&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Access to internet and willingness to upload data during the study as needed&#xD;

             will be required for all females of childbearing potential. Participants who become&#xD;
             pregnant will be discontinued from the study. Also, participants who during the study&#xD;
             develop and express the intention to become pregnant within the timespan of the study&#xD;
             will be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Willingness to suspend use of any personal CGM for the duration of the clinical trial&#xD;
             once the study CGM is in use&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Willingness to switch to lispro (Humalog) or aspart (Novolog) if not using already,&#xD;
             and to use no other insulin besides lispro (Humalog) or aspart (Novolog) during the&#xD;
             study, if randomized to the Control-IQ group.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Total daily insulin dose (TDD) at least 10 U/day and not more than 100 U/day&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Participants must have Internet access and a computer system that meets the&#xD;
