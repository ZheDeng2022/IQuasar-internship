  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endothelial microparticles (EMP) have a promising role as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in&#xD;
      the assessment of endothelial function. This study compares the levels of EMP in&#xD;
      hypercholesterolaemia patients before and after treatment with statins and correlates it with&#xD;
      the current method of assessing endothelial function using pulse wave analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current available methods to assess endothelial function are tedious and not suitable to&#xD;
      be applied clinically. Detecting EMP levels are simpler as it only involves routine blood&#xD;
      taking which is better tolerated by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome from this study will contribute to finding a potential diagnostic, prognostic and&#xD;
      treatment assessment tool that is suitable to be used clinically. This will have a large&#xD;
      impact in the management of cardiovascular-related disease that is prevalent worldwide and&#xD;
      increasing in the developed countries.&#xD;

      General study objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate EMP as a simple diagnostic tool in assessing endothelial function in&#xD;
      hypercholesterolaemic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the levels of EMP ( Cluster of differentiation (CD)144, CD62e and CD31+/42-)&#xD;
           in hypercholesterolaemics before and after statin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To correlate the levels of EMP with the assessment of endothelial function using pulse&#xD;
           wave analysis (PWA) in hypercholesterolaemics before and after statin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a clinical cohort study involving newly diagnosed hypercholesterolemic patients before&#xD;
      and after intervention with statin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling method and subject recruitment Consecutive sampling of sampling frame will be&#xD;
      applied due to limited number of sample who could fulfill the criteria within the planned&#xD;
      data collection period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before acceptance into the study, all potential subjects will undergo a screening procedure.&#xD;
      A signed written informed consent will be obtained from the subjects before screening&#xD;
      procedure is performed. The screening procedure will include detailed history taking on&#xD;
      medical history, physical examination and 5 ml venous blood sampling for fasting lipid&#xD;
      profile (FLP) from the antecubital vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical study session&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the FLP results are obtained, appointment to attend the clinical study sessions will be&#xD;
      arranged with the eligible subjects who fulfil the criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newly diagnosed hypercholesterolaemia patients recruited will undergo clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first visit will involve blood taking for baseline values, assessment with SphygmoCor and&#xD;
      consultation by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first visit, 10 ml of venous blood will be withdrawn from the antecubital vein&#xD;
      followed by the assessment of endothelial function, augmentation index (AI) and central&#xD;
      arterial pressure (CAP) using SphygmoCor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous blood is needed for baseline full blood count (FBC), renal function test (RFT), liver&#xD;
      function test (LFT), fasting blood sugar (FBS), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)&#xD;
      and EMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of endothelial function, AI and CAP using SphygmoCor .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physician consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first visit, all patients will be seen by the treating physician (a Family&#xD;
      Medicine Specialist) at the outpatient clinic (KRK) and advised for therapeutic life style&#xD;
      changes (TLC) as recommended by the Malaysian Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for&#xD;
      Hyperlipidaemia (2011). Patients will be on TLC for a minimum duration of 6 weeks before the&#xD;
      next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second visit will only involve blood taking for FLP (5 ml blood) after at least 6 weeks&#xD;
      duration of TLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the FLP results are obtained (in approximately a week), patients will then be seen by&#xD;
      the treating physician in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who do not achieve the targeted LDL level after TLC and indicated for treatment will&#xD;
      be prescribed with statin by the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who achieve the targeted LDL level after TLC will continue TLC and will be excluded&#xD;
      from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourth visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fourth visit will be arranged with the patients 3 months later. 10 ml of blood will be&#xD;
      withdrawn for EMP quantification, FLP, hs-CRP and LFT. This will be followed by the&#xD;
      assessments of endothelial function, AI and CAP as explained above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourth visit marks the end of the Study 2. Thereafter, patients will continue their treatment&#xD;
      at the KRK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration for each subject will be approximately 5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that miss follow-up or not compliant to the medication prescribed will be excluded&#xD;
      from the study analysis. However, this will not compromise the treatment received by patients&#xD;
      as they will continue to be treated in KRK.&#xD;
