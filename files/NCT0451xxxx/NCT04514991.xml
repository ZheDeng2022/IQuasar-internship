      The purpose of the study is to evaluate periapical healing after endodontic microsurgery with&#xD;
      the use of guided tissue regeneration. The study population includes patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      persistent periapical pathology and scheduled for surgery at UPenn endodontic clinic.&#xD;
      Patients undergoing routine endodontic surgery will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      resorbable collagen in the osteotomy site to promote bone formation. Healing will be assessed&#xD;
      radiographically at 6, 12, and 18 months.&#xD;

      Root end surgery is conducted to eliminate infection and inflammatory lesions in the tissues&#xD;
      below the roots of teeth previously endodontically treated. Healing is assessed through the&#xD;
      resolution of signs and symptoms as well as bone regeneration in the area below the root. In&#xD;
      cases where the bone defect is significant, it is recommended to use a membrane to allow the&#xD;
      bone to heal without invasion of cells from the gum tissues into the lesion. In small&#xD;
      lesions, the efficacy of using augmentation material is not determined. Routine root end&#xD;
      surgery with small lesions is often conducted with or without augmentation material. The&#xD;
      purpose of this research is to compare periradicular healing after root end surgery in&#xD;
      endondontic lesions with and without the use of resorbable collagen material.&#xD;

    <description>The outcome of the surgery will be assessed by qualitatively evaluating bone regeneration through radiographs using well-established criteria. Rud's criteria categorize healing using periapical films into four categories: complete healing, incomplete healing, uncertain and unsatisfactory healing. Cases with complete or incomplete healing are considered to be successful. Modified Penn criteria classify healing using cone-beam CT into complete, limited, and unsatisfactory healing. Success is assigned to cases with complete and limited healing.</description>
