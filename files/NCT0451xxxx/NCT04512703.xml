    <textblock>
      Prospective, non-interventional, feasibility study. 8 months, from start of screening to&#xD;
      finishing the study. Multi-center study, with a maximum of 8 centers in Europe. Health adult&#xD;
      volunteers (21 years or older) and adult patients with a clinical indication for ambulatory&#xD;
      outpatient cardiac monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To observe the feasibility of remotely monitoring patients with the novel µCor Heart Failure&#xD;
      and Arrhythmia Management System (µCor system ) that non-invasively captures thoracic fluid&#xD;
      content, electrocardiogram, heart rate, respiratory rate, activity, and body posture. tory&#xD;
      outpatient cardiac monitoring.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of two phases. Phase I of the study will enroll 6 healthy volunteers,&#xD;
      who have no indication for remote cardiac monitoring. Subjects are required to participate in&#xD;
      the study for 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II of the study will enroll up to 44 patients indicated for outpatient cardiac&#xD;
      monitoring and will participate in the study for up to 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will wear the device in two locations, one along the left midaxillary line and&#xD;
      the other along the left midclavicular line for the first seven days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, for the remainder of the study, half the enrolled subjects will only wear the&#xD;
      device in the left midclavicular position and the other half will wear the device in the left&#xD;
      midaxillary position. Subjects will use a diary to keep a daily log their activities of daily&#xD;
      living (phase I) or a log of any symptoms related to heart rhythm abnormalities and heart&#xD;
      failure (phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be acquired with the µCor system and wirelessly transmitted daily to a remote&#xD;
      server for processing, generating thoracic fluid content, ECG, heart rate, respiration rate,&#xD;
      activity, and posture measurements. Investigators will have access only to ECG data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will make weekly phone calls to subjects and record any new clinically actionable&#xD;
      events. Patients will have monthly office visits. At the end of 30 days (phase I) or 90 days&#xD;
      (phase II), patients will end wear and will complete the study follow-up questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll a maximum of 50 subjects. Six healthy volunteers will be enrolled for&#xD;
      phase I of the study. Remaining 44 subjects will be enrolled for phase II and will have an&#xD;
      indication of outpatient cardiac monitoring.&#xD;
