  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trace elements are one of the indispensable substances in human body and play an important&#xD;
      physiological role. Zinc is a trace element second only to iron in organisms, which is widely&#xD;
      distributed in various systems and organs and plays an important biological role, and&#xD;
      interacts with other trace elements such as copper and iron. With the improvement of&#xD;
      detection methods, it is possible to detect the concentration of zinc and other trace&#xD;
      elements in liquid samples. It is reported in the existing literature that there are&#xD;
      significant changes in the concentration of trace elements in a variety of eye diseases. Our&#xD;
      group intends to collect three kinds of samples (aqueous humor, blood and tears) of patients&#xD;
      with primary glaucoma and age-related cataract who were treated in Sun Yat-sen Eye Center of&#xD;
      Sun Yat-sen University from March 2020 to March 2021. Normal people with matched age and sex&#xD;
      were recruited as normal control group (normal control group only collected blood and tear&#xD;
      samples). Three methods (FI-ICP-MS, metabonomics and genomics) were used to study the&#xD;
      concentration changes of patients with primary glaucoma in three kinds of body fluid samples,&#xD;
      and the related factors were analyzed combined with clinical data, so as to provide a&#xD;
      theoretical basis for studying the pathogenic mechanism and new prevention pathway of primary&#xD;
      glaucoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a group of optic nerve diseases characterized by progressive and irreversible&#xD;
      degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. There are different opinions on the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of glaucoma, which further reflects that the mechanism of glaucoma optic nerve&#xD;
      injury is still in the exploratory stage, and there is still a long way to go to develop&#xD;
      effective drugs to prevent or reverse the visual function damage in patients with glaucoma.&#xD;
      Therefore, on the basis of previous studies, our research group explored and expanded whether&#xD;
      there were similar pathological changes in patients with clinical glaucoma not only in&#xD;
      aqueous humor, but also in blood and tear samples, and further studied the mechanism. Three&#xD;
      kinds of samples (aqueous humor, blood and tears) were collected from patients with primary&#xD;
      glaucoma and age-related cataract treated in Sun Yat-sen Eye Center of Sun Yat-sen&#xD;
      University. Normal people with matched age and sex were recruited as normal control group&#xD;
      (normal control group only collected blood and tear samples). Three methods of inductively&#xD;
      coupled plasma mass spectrometry (FI-ICP-MS), metabonomics and genomics were used to study&#xD;
      the concentration changes of patients with primary glaucoma in three kinds of body fluid&#xD;
      samples, and the related factors were analyzed combined with clinical data, so as to provide&#xD;
      a new theoretical basis for studying the pathogenic mechanism and new prevention pathway of&#xD;
      primary glaucoma.&#xD;
