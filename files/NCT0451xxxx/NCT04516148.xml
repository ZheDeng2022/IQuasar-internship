    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study if to evaluate the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics given&#xD;
      during surgery in reducing the concentration of bacteria in a burn wound after surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind, randomized, controlled study to assess the effectiveness and safety&#xD;
      of prophylactic perioperative administration of antibiotics for the reduction of bacterial&#xD;
      concentration in burn wounds. Subjects who meet enrollment criteria will be randomized in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio to receive either perioperative prophylaxis with intravenous antibiotics or&#xD;
      institutional standard of care, consisting of no antibiotic therapy. This with be a single&#xD;
      center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following randomization, patients will receive their assigned treatment (antibiotics or&#xD;
      standard of care) after induction of anesthesia, no more than one hour prior to incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients weighing 120 kg or less will receive 2 grams of intravenous cefazolin, with those&#xD;
      weighing &gt; 120 kg receiving 3 grams intravenous cefazolin. Re-dosing will occur every 4 hours&#xD;
      that the patient remains in the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with a documented beta-lactam allergy, Clindamycin 900 mg will be given&#xD;
      intravenously with re-dosing every 6 hours that the patient remains in the operating room.&#xD;
      Patients with allergies to both agents will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological samples will be obtained at three primary time-points: intraoperatively, at the&#xD;
      time of the initial postoperative dressing take-down (within six hours), and at the time of a&#xD;
      single follow up visit (10-28 days postoperatively).&#xD;

    <description>The primary effectiveness endpoint is a statistically significant reduction in the burn wound bacterial concentration in wounds where patients received antibiotics. Samples (tissue swabs and punch biopsies) obtained intraoperatively following wound bed preparation will be compared to samples (tissue swabs and punch biopsies) obtained from the wound within six hours of initial postoperative dressing take-down.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the treatment arm of the study will have orders placed by a physician on the clinical team, with preparation and delivery of the antibiotics dose by the pharmacy following standard procedures. Antibiotic administration will occur after induction of anesthesia, with delivery by the Anesthesia staff no more than one hour prior to incision. Those with known allergy to beta-lactams will receive clindamycin instead of cefazolin.</description>
