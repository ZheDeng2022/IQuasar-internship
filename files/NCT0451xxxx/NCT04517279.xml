  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to pilot a peer-provided, manualized intervention to increase the&#xD;
      proportion of young people with first episode psychosis who reduce or stop substance use and&#xD;
      improve psychiatric and functional outcomes. Coordinated specialty care teams will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to implement the intervention, Invest in My Recovery Bank (IMRB), or usual&#xD;
      care. The pilot study aims to: (a) determine if peer providers can implement IMRB with&#xD;
      adequate fidelity; (b) determine if youth and young adults engage in the intervention with&#xD;
      peer providers and find it acceptable; (c) estimate the rates of drop-out for each of the two&#xD;
      study arms; (d) estimate both between-participant (within-provider team) and between-team&#xD;
      variability on key outcome measures; and (e) identify any changes needed to the intervention&#xD;
      approach, manual, or training materials. The pilot study will set the stage for a future&#xD;
      comparative cluster randomized trial of the intervention;&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pilot study examines the feasibility of a cluster randomized controlled trial to measure&#xD;
      the effectiveness of Invest in My Recovery Bank (IMRB) compared to usual care (UC). IMRB is a&#xD;
      peer-led, manualized intervention to support youth and young adults receiving treatment for&#xD;
      early psychosis with reducing or stopping problematic substance use. Peer providers, who&#xD;
      represent clusters of service participants, will participate in a multi-day IMRB training.&#xD;
      Training will include exploring the theoretical basis for the intervention approach and logic&#xD;
      model, impact of service participant and peer provider on intervention design, the&#xD;
      intervention strategies, and opportunities to build skill in each intervention component&#xD;
      (e.g., role play with feedback). Peer providers will also receive twice monthly supervision&#xD;
      to support intervention fidelity and resolve questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed pilot study aims to: (a) determine if peer providers can implement IMRB with&#xD;
      adequate fidelity; (b) determine if youth and young adults engage in the intervention with&#xD;
      peer providers and find it acceptable; (c) estimate the rates of drop-out for each of the two&#xD;
      study arms; (d) estimate both between-participant (within-provider team) and between-team&#xD;
      variability (e.g., standard deviation, interquartile range) on key outcome measures for a&#xD;
      future comparative cluster randomized trial of the intervention; and (e) identify any changes&#xD;
      needed to the intervention approach, manual, or training materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nineteen teams across 16 sites will be randomly assigned to IMRB or UC, ensuring that the&#xD;
      three sites with more than one team have at least one team randomized to each arm. All youth&#xD;
      meeting eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study and will receive either IMRB or&#xD;
      UC, based on the assignment status of their provider team. Intervention integrity will be&#xD;
      measured through a peer-completed fidelity checklist. Participant outcomes will be measured&#xD;
      through existing data collection at each participating organization. All participant outcome&#xD;
      and service data is reported through the EPINET-TX platform, which allows for&#xD;
      measurement-based care at participating sites and research using de-identified data.&#xD;
