  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 20%-40% of NSCLC patients develop intracranial metastases, and most clinical studies&#xD;
      suggest that the survival of lung cancer patients will be significantly shortened once they&#xD;
      develop intracranial metastases. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) remain the&#xD;
      standard first-line therapy for patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC , including brain&#xD;
      metastases(EGFR BMs).The survival rate of NSCLC patients with EGFR BMs was significantly&#xD;
      improved compared with that of mutation-free patients. Third-generation EGFR-TKIs have unique&#xD;
      advantages in the treatment of NSCLC BMs due to their improved blood-brain barrier&#xD;
      permeability, and with the development of radiotherapy technology, stereotactic radiation&#xD;
      therapy (SRT) has also demonstrated its remarkable qualities of high efficiency and low&#xD;
      toxicity in a limited number of intracranial metastases. The clinical mechanisms of&#xD;
      resistance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs are far more complex than those of first- generation&#xD;
      TKIs, and the treatment paradigm for disease progression including intracranial progression&#xD;
      is challenging. It would be interesting to design prospective clinical studies of patients&#xD;
      with EGFR BMs treated with the application of third-generation TKIs to closely followed by&#xD;
      salvage SRT for oligo-progression. Therefore, we designed this prospective, phase II clinical&#xD;
      study of intracranial oligo-progression applied with stereotactic radiotherapy as salvage&#xD;
      therapy in EGFR BMs patients after failure of the third-generation EGFR-TKIs.&#xD;
