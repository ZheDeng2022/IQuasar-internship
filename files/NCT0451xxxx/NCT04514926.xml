    <textblock>
      This is an observational, clinic-based, single center study of 120 subjects. Participants&#xD;
      will be comprised of patients seen in the outpatient faculty practice in ambulatory care at&#xD;
      the UCSF Parnassus campus. Study investigators will enroll 20 healthy participants with no&#xD;
      history of lung disease, 50 asthmatics who are newly prescribed therapeutic proteins for&#xD;
      their asthma, and 50 asthmatics already being treated with therapeutic proteins for their&#xD;
      asthma. Participants will be seen at 1 to 3 visits and provide blood samples at each visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common disease affecting 5 - 10% of the population. The main underlying pathology&#xD;
      is airway inflammation, which in a majority of patients is characterized by upregulation of&#xD;
      type 2 cytokines and infiltration of the airway mucosa with type 2 inflammatory cells.&#xD;
      Despite incomplete understanding of mechanisms by which these molecules and cells initiate&#xD;
      and propagate the inflammatory process, several new therapies have been developed and even&#xD;
      approved to target type 2 cytokines like IL-4, IL-5 and IL13 in asthmatics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While mechanistic understanding lags behind therapeutic advance, the emergence of these new&#xD;
      therapeutics and increase use in treatment of asthmatic patients provides a unique&#xD;
      opportunity to better understand how these medicines alter inflammation and ameliorate&#xD;
      disease activity. The over-arching goal of this project is to advance understanding of how&#xD;
      these new therapeutic proteins modulate inflammation in peripheral blood. A better&#xD;
      understanding of these mechanisms will allow for tracking of cellular and molecular&#xD;
      biomarkers that may inform treatment regimens with these new therapeutics in patients with&#xD;
      asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this observational, clinic-based, single center study of 120 subjects, investigators&#xD;
      will compare blood lymphocytes as well as other molecular biomarkers associated with&#xD;
      inflammation in healthy controls, asthmatic patients not on therapeutic proteins and&#xD;
      asthmatics treated with therapeutic proteins. Participants will be comprised of patients seen&#xD;
      in the outpatient faculty practice in ambulatory care at the UCSF Parnassus campus.&#xD;
      Participants will be seen at 1 to 3 visits and provide blood samples at each visit. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that this study will help uncover mechanisms of response to these novel&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions in asthma.&#xD;
