  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare, genetic, progressive, life-limiting,&#xD;
      neuro-degenerative condition affecting a variety of body systems resulting in ataxia, immune&#xD;
      deficiency, respiratory complications and a predisposition to cancer. Currently there is no&#xD;
      cure for A-T. Over the years, a number of small clinical trials using steroids, antioxidants&#xD;
      and anti-inflammatory agents have had little success. The disease natural history is&#xD;
      relentless leading to early death. A-T generates a significant disease burden for the&#xD;
      individuals, their extended families and on health care resources. With palliative care being&#xD;
      the only current option for families, a treatment trial for A-T meets an unmet need. The&#xD;
      investigators preliminary data provide compelling evidence of reversible mitochondrial&#xD;
      dysfunction and preventable cell death in A-T patient cells and the beneficial effects of&#xD;
      heptanoate (C7), the primary metabolite of triheptanoin. C7 corrects a defect in endoplasmic&#xD;
      reticulum (ER)-mitochondrial signalling in A-T cells and has great potential for application&#xD;
      in treating participants. C7 has been utilised with efficacy and safety over the last 15&#xD;
      years for inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) such as long chain fatty acid defects (LC-FAOD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A-T is due to a genetic defect that results in a defective serine/threonine protein kinase,&#xD;
      known as ATM. Normally, ATM, plays a central role in protecting the genome against damage. It&#xD;
      is increasingly evident that ATM protects cells against oxidative stress. This protein is&#xD;
      also present outside the nucleus, where it is activated by oxidative stress through a&#xD;
      separate mechanism from DNA damage, providing an explanation why anti-oxidants have a&#xD;
      protective role in A-T cells in culture and in animal models. From these and other studies,&#xD;
      it is evident that mitochondrial abnormalities characterise ATM and it has been suggested&#xD;
      that A-T should be considered, at least in part, as a mitochondrial disease. The&#xD;
      Investigators have added substance to that claim by showing that ATM-deficient (B3) cells are&#xD;
      exquisitely sensitive to inhibition of glycolysis by glucose deprivation, compared to&#xD;
      controls (HBEC). The investigators have also shown this increased sensitivity to nutrient&#xD;
      deprivation for primary epithelial cells from patients and in immortalised patient cells.&#xD;
      Together these data point to a reduced capacity of A-T mitochondria to support energy&#xD;
      metabolism and provide additional evidence for a mitochondrial defect in A-T cells. The&#xD;
      investigators have recently demonstrated that this hypersensitivity to glucose deprivation&#xD;
      can be explained by a novel mechanism involving defective signalling between the ER and the&#xD;
      mitochondrion. The investigators demonstrated that this was caused by defective assembly of&#xD;
      the VDAC1-GRP75-IP3R1 calcium channel and less ER-mitochondria contact points as determined&#xD;
      by transmission electron microscopy. This in turn resulted in reduced calcium release from&#xD;
      the ER and less transfer to mitochondria providing further evidence for mitochondrial&#xD;
      dysfunction in A-T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators selected triheptanoin, a highly purified, synthetic medium odd-chain&#xD;
      triglyceride that is catabolized to heptanoate and can traverse the mitochondrial membrane&#xD;
      without the carnitine carrier. Free heptanoate is then metabolized by the medium chain fatty&#xD;
      acid oxidation enzymes to yield both acetyl CoA and propionyl CoA that act as anaplerotics to&#xD;
      replenish the TCA cycle and enhance energy metabolism by providing NADPH and generating ATP.&#xD;
      The investigators demonstrated that heptanoate partially corrects the extreme sensitivity to&#xD;
      glycolysis inhibition in both the ATM-deficient cell line as well as in primary epithelial&#xD;
      cells from a patient with A-T. Excitingly, heptanoate also corrected all of the defects in&#xD;
      ER-mitochondrial signalling including calcium uptake into mitochondria. Based on the&#xD;
      importance of mitochondrial dysfunction in the A-T phenotype and our results revealing&#xD;
      correction of mitochondrial function by heptanoate, the investigators consider that&#xD;
      triheptanoin has excellent potential in correcting many aspects of the A-T phenotype&#xD;
      including the progressive neurodegenerative phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triheptanoin has been used for over 15 years to treat LC-FAOD, with demonstrated improvements&#xD;
      in cardiac function and reductions in rhabdomyolysis episodes. Triheptanoin and heptanoate&#xD;
      are known to protect against cell death in experimental conditions largely characterised by&#xD;
      oxidative stress, such as stroke and motor neurone disease, adult polyglucosan body disease,&#xD;
      alternating hemiplegia of childhood, Glucose-1 transporter deficiency, and mouse models and&#xD;
      humans with epilepsy. Heptanoate protects cultured neurons against H2O2-induced cell death.&#xD;
      Collectively these studies demonstrate that triheptanoin is well tolerated and is effective&#xD;
      in treating a range of neurological conditions associated with neuronal energy deficiency.&#xD;
