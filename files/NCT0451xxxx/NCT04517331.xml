      This study compares the analgesic effects and dermatomal blockade distributions of single and&#xD;
      double injection bilateral thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) techniques in patients&#xD;
      undergoing reduction mammaplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining ethics committee approval; 60 patients scheduled for elective bilateral&#xD;
      reduction mammoplasty and gave written informed consent, were included in the study. The&#xD;
      patients were randomized in one of single (Group S: T3-T4) or double injections (Group D:&#xD;
      T2-T3&amp;T4-T5) bilateral TPVB groups (bupivacaine 0.375% 20 mL per side). All patients'&#xD;
      dermatomal blockade distributions (T2-T6) were followed for 30 minutes, and then they were&#xD;
      given general anesthesia. Before extubation, 1 g IV paracetamol was applied to all.&#xD;
      Postoperatively, patients in both groups received IV paracetamol 1 g when numeric rating&#xD;
      scale (NRS) pain score ≥4, and also tramadol 1 mg/kg if they defined NRS≥4 again after 1 h.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint was NRS pain scores at postoperative 12th hour. The secondary endpoints&#xD;
      were NRS scores and dermatomal blockade distributions through the postoperative first 48&#xD;
      hours, postoperative time until first pain, the total numbers of analgesic requirements on&#xD;
      days 1 and 2.&#xD;

      This prospective randomized controlled study compares the analgesic effects and dermatomal&#xD;
      blockade distributions of single and double injection bilateral thoracic paravertebral block&#xD;
      (TPVB) techniques in patients undergoing reduction mammaplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining ethics committee approval; 60 patients scheduled for elective bilateral&#xD;
      reduction mammoplasty and gave written informed consent, were included in the study. The&#xD;
      inclusion criteria were female gender, aging between 18 and 70 years, American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of 1-3, capable of consenting, understanding the&#xD;
      instructions for using the NRS pain scores and replying the study-based questions, lack of&#xD;
      contraindications to regional anesthesia (allergy to a LA, local infection, and coagulopathy)&#xD;
      and especially TPVB, absence of mental/psychiatric disorders, chronic analgesic/opioid use&#xD;
      and alcohol/illicit drug use. The patients were randomized in one of single (Group S:&#xD;
      T3-T4-bupivacaine 0.375% 20 mL/injection) or double injections (Group D:&#xD;
      T2-T3&amp;T4-T5-bupivacaine 0.375% 10 mL/injection) bilateral TPVB groups using the sealed&#xD;
      envelopes technique. All patients' dermatomal (sensorial) blockade distributions (T2-T6) were&#xD;
      tested bilaterally between T2 and T6 dermatomal levels on the midclavicular line in every 5&#xD;
      minutes through the first 30 minutes after TPVB performances, by using the pin-prick test,&#xD;
      and then they were given standard general anesthesia. Before extubation, 1 g IV paracetamol&#xD;
      was applied to all. The NRS pain scores (0: no pain and 10: worst pain imaginable), and the&#xD;
      dermatomal blockade distribution/numbers of blocked dermatomes of all patients on both sides&#xD;
      were asked and documented on postoperative 0th min, 1st, 2nd, 6th, 12th, 24th and 48th hours.&#xD;
      Postoperatively, patients in both groups received IV paracetamol 1 g when NRS pain score ≥4,&#xD;
      and also tramadol 1 mg/kg if they defined NRS≥4 again after 1 h. The primary endpoint was NRS&#xD;
      pain score at 12th hour. The secondary endpoints included the NRS pain scores and the&#xD;
      dermatomal blockade distribution/numbers of blocked dermatomes through the postoperative&#xD;
      first 48 hours, block application times, number of patients experienced hypotension or&#xD;
      required fentanyl intraoperatively, length of stay in postoperative care unit (PACU),&#xD;
      postoperative time until first pain (NRS≥4), the total numbers of paracetamol and tramadol&#xD;
      requirements, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and duration of sleep on&#xD;
      postoperative days 1 and 2, patient and surgeon satisfaction scores.&#xD;

Postoperatively, different anesthesiologists who did not participate in the TPVB performance process of that specific patient and were totally blinded to the group again collected the data.&#xD;
