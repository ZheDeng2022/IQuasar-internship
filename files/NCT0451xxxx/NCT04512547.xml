  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      40% of all asthma patients in the US are obese. Obese asthmatics have more severe disease&#xD;
      than lean asthmatics and do not respond as well to conventional anti-inflammatory therapies.&#xD;
      This proposal will utilize 3D functional imaging with 129XeMRI and single cell RNA sequencing&#xD;
      to study mechanisms driving regional airway remodeling and fibrosis in obese asthma subjects&#xD;
      and in preclinical models of obese asthma.&#xD;

      ABSTRACT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity, a major comorbidity and a potential modulator of asthma, affects nearly 40% of&#xD;
      asthmatics in the U.S., and increases its severity. Obese asthmatics do not respond as well&#xD;
      to conventional anti-inflammatory therapies and new biologics targeting asthma are less&#xD;
      effective in obese asthmatics compared to lean. Very little research has been conducted in&#xD;
      obese animals or obese asthmatics, resulting in a major knowledge deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key feature of asthma is airway remodeling and fibrosis, broadly defined as a change in&#xD;
      distribution, thickness, composition, mass or volume of structural components of the airway&#xD;
      wall of patients relative to healthy patients. Airway remodeling is difficult to diagnose in&#xD;
      obese patients as mechanical changes in chest wall compliance can contribute to the&#xD;
      physiological changes seen. Classically, evidence of airway remodeling and fibrosis are&#xD;
      revealed as fixed airway obstruction on spirometry. However, spirometry is not only&#xD;
      insensitive to the peripheral airways, where airway remodeling occurs, but is fundamentally&#xD;
      incapable of localizing the sites of remodeling and fibrosis. Thus, a critical research&#xD;
      limitation in the study of airway remodeling and fibrosis in asthma is defining regions of&#xD;
      disease activity to explore disease-specific mechanisms. To understand the nature of airway&#xD;
      remodeling and fibrosis in obese asthma and to rapidly screen for novel therapies requires&#xD;
      translation between preclinical models and patients, while using advanced imaging. Recent&#xD;
      work in asthma using 3D functional imaging with 129Xe MRI has revealed the location of both&#xD;
      reversible and fixed ventilation defects (defined based on bronchodilator responsivity).&#xD;
      Several studies suggest that fixed defects represent sites of airway remodeling and fibrosis,&#xD;
      but to date, this has been inferred indirectly from sputum analyses and CT scans. The central&#xD;
      hypothesis is that sites of abnormal ventilation on 129XeMRI represent areas of airway&#xD;
      remodeling and fibrosis and are enriched with fibroblasts that are invasive, proliferative&#xD;
      and fibrogenic. It is further hypothesized that regional alterations in oxidant stress&#xD;
      driving the production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) direct pro-remodeling&#xD;
      fibroblast functions. Lastly, it is hypothesized that 129XeMRI will be a sensitive and&#xD;
      specific biomarker of airway remodeling and fibrosis in obese asthmatics and rat models of&#xD;
      obese asthma. By leveraging our excellence in clinical asthma, bronchoscopy, and&#xD;
      translational expertise in cell function/signaling and 3D MR imaging in both patients and&#xD;
      animal models, both ex vivo cell-specific mechanistic studies and in vivo animal model&#xD;
      studies will be conducted to uncover the mechanisms of molecular and cellular function&#xD;
      through the following Specific Aims: Aim 1) Identify the pathology, structural cell profile&#xD;
      (airway fibroblast and epithelial cell) and redox status corresponding to regional areas of&#xD;
      fixed and reversible post-bronchodilator defects (BD) in obese asthmatics; 2) Define the&#xD;
      cellular requirement for redox-mediated TGF-β signaling between airway epithelial cells and&#xD;
      fibroblasts driving regional remodeling in obese asthma; 3) Develop non-invasive 3D imaging&#xD;
      techniques to assess airway regional remodeling in experimental rodent models of obese&#xD;
      asthma.&#xD;
