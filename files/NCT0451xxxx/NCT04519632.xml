      To describe the the barriers and facilitators experienced by carers and healthcare&#xD;
      professionals when managing medicines for pain relief for infants, children, and young people&#xD;
      approaching the end of life in out of hospital settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to hear about the experiences of patients, carers and healthcare&#xD;
      professionals when managing pain relief medicines for infants, children and young people&#xD;
      (ICYP) at the end of their lives, when they are not in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study plans to develop a guide to help educate and empower both carers and healthcare&#xD;
      professionals in the best ways to manage pain in this group of patients. This guide will&#xD;
      contain basic, easily understood information depending upon both the patient's and carers'&#xD;
      needs. Family carers are important in looking after their ICYP with life-threatening&#xD;
      illnesses, so they can be cared for at home if they wish. Even with varying levels of support&#xD;
      from hospice, hospital or family doctors, such responsibility can be rewarding and scary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community based healthcare professionals often have little experience to be able to support&#xD;
      good end of life pain care in these patients when at home and there may be problems which&#xD;
      prevent them from giving effective treatment. If pain and other symptoms are not well&#xD;
      controlled by medicines families often move from their chosen place of care. Carers need to&#xD;
      be able to check symptoms to decide which medicines to give and how well they are working,&#xD;
      without having any special training; some may have unhelpful views about medicines such as&#xD;
      morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not much research has looked at the problems that carers and healthcare professionals come&#xD;
      across when trying to manage a child's pain when they are not in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has already shown that being able to provide the right medicine at the right time&#xD;
      means children can be looked after where they want, without unnecessary hospital admissions.&#xD;
      It is hoped that the guide will make carers feel more confident in managing pain relief&#xD;
      safely, so lessening any worries. Future research is planned to show the value of the guide&#xD;
      in a larger study.&#xD;
