    <textblock>
      Background: Suboptimal health status (SHS) is a dynamic state potential clinical stage or&#xD;
      prior psychosomatic disease stage during which people have not been diagnosed with a disease,&#xD;
      but they have risk factors for illness and have tendency to develop diseases. The term refers&#xD;
      to an existing condition of ill health that could lead to a pathologic condition but could&#xD;
      also be eliminated, enabling the individual in question to return to a state of good health.&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) emphasizes the importance of health care and the idea that&#xD;
      preventive treatment for diseases is superior to curative treatment. Therefore, early&#xD;
      TCM-based intervention can improve the health status of people with SHS. People with SHS&#xD;
      often experience such nonspecific symptoms as fatigue; such symptoms are typical of SHS from&#xD;
      the perspective of TCM. The present study investigated people with SHS and fatigue as their&#xD;
      primary symptom. All enrolled participants completed a physical questionnaire, after which&#xD;
      their physiological parameters were monitored using a cloud physiological signal monitoring&#xD;
      system to investigate correlations with TCM patterns. Methods: The participants first&#xD;
      completed a body constitution questionnaire, the WHO Quality of Life questionnaire, the&#xD;
      SHSQ-25 questionnaire, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index,&#xD;
      and subsequently underwent sphygmography to determine their pulse patterns. Analyses of pulse&#xD;
      waves were presented in relation to the spectral energy ratio (SER), and SER10 scores&#xD;
      represented subtle changes in internal organ blood flow; 13-50-Hz spectrum analysis for pulse&#xD;
      delineated any flow energy deviation in organs.&#xD;

        This study enrolled individuals aged between 20 and 39 years based on previous studies,&#xD;
        which showed that SHS is most prevalent in people aged 20 to 39 years. Individuals who&#xD;
        conformed to A+B+D or A+C+D (described below) and who had not been diagnosed as having a&#xD;
        disease by personnel practicing Western medicine were defined as having SHS. Individuals&#xD;
        who did not meet the criteria for SHS and who had not been diagnosed as having a disease by&#xD;
        Western medicine were defined as healthy.&#xD;
