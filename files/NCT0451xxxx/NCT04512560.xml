  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical coaching, defined as a constructive relationship that provides objective feedback to&#xD;
      individuals about a broad range of factors influencing operative performance, is a key&#xD;
      strategy for integrating adult learning theory into the traditionally didactic arena of&#xD;
      surgical education. It is gaining momentum as an area of potential growth and innovation, and&#xD;
      may become a more meaningful method of ongoing professional development for practicing&#xD;
      surgeons. Effective coaching interactions encourage discussion, provide feedback, affirm&#xD;
      positive beliefs and challenge pre-existing assumptions. The effectiveness and uptake of&#xD;
      coaching interventions in surgery can be influenced by the identity of the coach, and&#xD;
      cultural or individual surgeon attitudes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical coaching has been linked to improvements in technical and procedural skills in both&#xD;
      simulated and clinical environments. In 2015, a systematic review of surgical coaching showed&#xD;
      a positive impact of surgical coaching interventions on learners' perceptions and attitudes,&#xD;
      their technical and nontechnical skills, and their performance measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a multicenter randomized controlled trial of structured&#xD;
      remote surgical coaching (SRSC) versus conventional surgical training for laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy performed by surgery residents at three institutions, in Canada and&#xD;
      Australia, to not only provide additional evidence in support of validity and&#xD;
      generalizability of a structured surgical coaching intervention for surgery trainees, but&#xD;
      also to demonstrate improvement in accuracy of self-assessment of operative performance and&#xD;
      the feasibility of remote coaching.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of adding a structured remote surgical coaching (SRSC)&#xD;
      program to conventional surgery training (CST) versus conventional surgery training (CST)&#xD;
      alone on general surgery residents' (1) technical performance, (2) technical errors, and (3)&#xD;
      accuracy of self-assessment for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedure. Feasibility of&#xD;
      conducting remote coaching across different times zones and continents will also be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Participation in a SRSC program will result in superior technical skills and&#xD;
      fewer technical errors committed during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy as compared to CST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Participation in a SRSC program will result in a more accurate self-assessment&#xD;
      of participants' technical skills as compared to CST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: It will be feasible to coach surgery residents remotely across different time&#xD;
      zones and continents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a multicenter randomized controlled trial with study&#xD;
      participants randomized 1:1 into intervention (SRSC+CST) and control groups (CST). The&#xD;
      investigators will use blocked randomization with a block size of 4 and allocation ratio of&#xD;
      1:1 to ensure equal participant distribution over the 24 month continuous recruitment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PARTICIPANTS AND RECRUITMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit general surgery residents (PGY 1-5) as study participants. Any&#xD;
      resident who routinely performs components of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy as a primary&#xD;
      surgeon (under supervision) and is rotating on a general surgery service will be invited to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRUCTURED REMOTE SURGICAL COACHING (SRSC) PROGRAM (INTERVENTION):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the intervention group will participate in a 3-month SRSC program&#xD;
      in addition to CST. They will view a standardized 10-minute video presentation, which will&#xD;
      explain the concept of surgical coaching and the purpose of the SRSC program. Surgical&#xD;
      coaches will provide structured remote surgical coaching. Credentials and qualifications of&#xD;
      each of the coaches are described below (Research Team). Zoom web-conferencing platform&#xD;
      (https://zoom.us) will be used for remote coaching. Participants will be asked to provide a&#xD;
      video recording of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy that they performed as a primary surgeon&#xD;
      prior to the coaching session. Each coach will review the video recording and will identify&#xD;
      key themes for discussion. Coaching sessions will be structured using the modified PRACTICE&#xD;
      model, will be conducted outside of the clinical environment, and will employ facilitative&#xD;
      coaching methods to encourage participants to define specific intra-operative problems and&#xD;
      conceptually troubleshoot various solutions. Key observations and discussion points for each&#xD;
      session will be recorded in a coaching template. Coaching sessions will be planned to be&#xD;
      administered on a bi-weekly basis; however, variability may occur to accommodate residents&#xD;
      operating schedule and exposure. The expectation is for each participant to complete three to&#xD;
      four coaching sessions each lasting 30-45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONVENTIONAL SURGICAL TRAINING (CONTROL):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the control group will continue of their usual general surgery&#xD;
      residency training including attending scheduled teaching sessions, and continuing with&#xD;
      assigned responsibilities on the ward and in the OR. Participants will be asked to record&#xD;
      videos of 5 consecutive laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures that they performed as a&#xD;
      primary surgeon during a 3-month period to mimic the duration of exposure in the intervention&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEMOGRAPHIC DATA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect age, sex, post-graduate year of training, handedness, number&#xD;
      of basic, intermediate and advanced laparoscopic cases performed as a primary surgeon or&#xD;
      assisted before and during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure technical performance during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy as&#xD;
      the primary outcome. Two assessment scales will be used: the Global Operative Assessment of&#xD;
      Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS) scale and the Generic Error Rating Tool (GERT) for errors in&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will explore, using a post-study questionnaire, the subjective perception&#xD;
      of the usefulness of the SRSC program and challenges with remote coaching as the secondary&#xD;
      outcome. The investigators will also collect feasibility data including duration of time&#xD;
      spent on video review, preparation for the coaching session, and conduct of the session by&#xD;
      the coach. Participant self-assessment data for their technical performance at baseline and&#xD;
      upon the completion of the study will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION ASSESSMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1st and 5th submitted video recording for each study participant will be assessed by a&#xD;
      trained rater, blinded to the group allocation and training level of participant, for&#xD;
      technical skill and errors using GOALS and GERT scales, respectively. Participants will&#xD;
      self-assess their technical performance with the GOALS scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using clinically relevant effect size of 1.25 and 1:1 allocation ratio for groups, a minimum&#xD;
      of 9 participants will be required per group to achieve a power of 0.8 and alpha of 0.05. The&#xD;
      investigators will aim to recruit a total of 24 participants (12 per group) to account for&#xD;
      possible participant dropout. An interim analysis will be performed once 9 participants have&#xD;
      been recruited per group. Recruitment will continue until completion of the interim analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform descriptive statistical analysis and will assess the normality&#xD;
      of data distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test. For continuous variables with normal&#xD;
      distribution, the investigators will use a t-test for independent samples for between group&#xD;
      comparisons, and a paired t-test for within group comparisons. For continuous variables with&#xD;
      skewed distribution, the investigators will use the Mann-Whitney U test for between group&#xD;
      comparisons, and the Wilcoxon rank sign tests for within group comparisons. The investigators&#xD;
      will compare categorical data using the Fisher exact test. The investigators will use&#xD;
      Spearman correlations to examine the correlation between self-assessment scores and blinded&#xD;
      rater scores.&#xD;
