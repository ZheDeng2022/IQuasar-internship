             especially terminal stage cancer, poorly controlled diabetic mellitus (i.e., HbA1c &gt;&#xD;
             8%), or neurological disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, may increase&#xD;
             the risk of study treatment and TKA, or complicate the subject's post-operative course&#xD;
             or interfere with the determination of pain intensity related solely to the TKA&#xD;
