  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the combination of Ytrium-90 (Y-90) Selective Internal Radiation&#xD;
      Therapy (SIRT) followed by Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). Y-90 SIRT alone or&#xD;
      SBRT alone are standard procedures used in the treatment of liver cancer. This study will&#xD;
      assess the combination of Y-90 SIRT and SBRT and obtain preliminary information about the&#xD;
      side effects and safety of the combination therapy. Additionally, this is the first time that&#xD;
      Y-90 PET-CT imaging will be included in planning for SBRT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) is a technique where radiation is internally&#xD;
      delivered to a tumor. In SIRT, small radioactive beads are deposited in the liver through a&#xD;
      large blood vessel (hepatic artery). SIRT that uses the radioactive material Yttrium-90 is&#xD;
      called Y-90 SIRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is a technique where radiation is externally&#xD;
      delivered to a tumor. In SBRT, a machine produces a beam of radiation that targets the tumor&#xD;
      from outside the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving Y-90 SIRT, participants will be evaluated to estimate how much radiation was&#xD;
      absorbed by their tumors during Y-90 SIRT. Y-90 PET-CT imaging will be used to help plan&#xD;
      SBRT, which will target areas of tumors that did not receive as much radiation as expected&#xD;
      during Y-90 SIRT.&#xD;
