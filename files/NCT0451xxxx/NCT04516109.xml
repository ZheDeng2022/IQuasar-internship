  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is protocol is intended to demonstrate the principal investigator's improvements and&#xD;
      modifications of a hip capsule side fixed slotted cannula for continued access to the hip&#xD;
      joint and a bone graft delivery tool set for grafting subchrondral cysts during hip&#xD;
      arthroscopy procedure.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and acetabular dysplasia represent the two most common&#xD;
      causes of secondary osteoarthritis of the hip1-3 and the two main indications for Hip&#xD;
      Preservation procedures. Most patients with these pathologies will undergo Hip Arthroscopy,&#xD;
      either alone, or combined with bony realignment procedures. Hip arthroscopy has grown&#xD;
      exponentially over the past 15 years and is currently being leveraged in the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of a wide range of hip joint problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to improve surgical techniques, make surgeries faster and reproducible, mitigate&#xD;
      complications and increase patient safety, surgeons modify and improve commercially available&#xD;
      and commonly used non-significant risk devices with the above goals in mind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, the Principal Investigator (PI) modified and improved two devices for hip&#xD;
      arthroscopy. These include the modified (1) hip capsule side fixed slotted cannula for&#xD;
      continued access to the hip joint and (2) bone graft delivery tool set for grafting&#xD;
      subchrondral cysts arthroscopically during hip arthroscopy procedure. After utilizing these&#xD;
      modified devices clinically, the PI has been impressed with their impact and thus aims to&#xD;
      demonstrate that the modifications provide significant improvements in surgical flow and&#xD;
      technique, minimize surgical time (per technical phase), minimize surgical costs, result in&#xD;
      an absolute low incidence of surgical complications, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.&#xD;

    <intervention_model>Single Group Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>All eligible patients undergoing hip arthroscopy by the principal investigator will be assigned to one of two groups for analysis, based on the appropriate SOC surgical treatment for FAI, hip dysplasia, or a combination of the two. All patients will undergo hip arthoscopy with the use of the modified hip capsule slotted cannula.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>We will be utilizing anonymous staff surveys. After the staff within the operating room (scrub, circulator, PA, and fellow) completes the paper survey (following the procedure), the staff member (who did not use the device per specific surgery) will administer the survey and seal in an envelope, which will be sent to the PRA. Thus, these responses will be blinded to the PI.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgical time per technical phase measured in minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>We aim to demonstrate that the use of the modified device for hip arthroscopy is fast and efficient as measured by surgical time per technical phase (i.e. arthroscopic labral repair phase and arthroscopic bone grafting phase).&#xD;
Arthroscopic Labral Repair Phase: During hip arthoscopy, the surgical time of the arthroscopic labral repair phase will be collected.&#xD;
Arthroscopic Bone Grafting Phase: During hip arthoscopy, the surgical time of the bone grafting of the hip joint phase will be collected.&#xD;
In this design, the technical phase recorded will either be: 1) duration of arthroscopic labral repair phase (in patients only undergoing arthroscopic labral repair) or 2) duration of arthroscopic bone grafting phase (in patients undergoing arthroscopic bone grafting).</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, Week 6, Month 3, Month 6, Month 12, Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The International Hip Outcome Tool (IHOT-12) measures both health-related quality of life and changes after treatment in young, active patients with hip disorders. Patients indicate their responses to the various questions by marking a 100 mm visual analog scale. The total score is calculated by calculating the mean of the participant's responses. Possible scores range from 0-100 with 0 indicating the worst and 100 indicating the best possible quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Patient Outcomes: Change in Non-Arthritic Hip Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, Week 6, Month 3, Month 6, Month 12, Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Non-Arthritic Hip score is a self-administered hip score measuring function and quality of life designed for use in younger patients with higher activity demands and treatment expectations than older patients with degenerative joint disease. Possible scores range from 0-4, with 0 indicating the worst and 4 indicating the best level of function and outcome for the patient.</description>
