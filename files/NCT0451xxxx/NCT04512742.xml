  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The disease leishmaniasis mainly occurs in hot and tropical countries, affects millions of&#xD;
      people and causes around 20,000 deaths across the world every year. Leishmaniasis is caused&#xD;
      by the Leishmania parasite and is transmitted by sand flies. The parasite is tiny and not&#xD;
      visible to the naked eye, whereas the sand fly is visible but small and inconspicuous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are different types of leishmaniasis which can affect the skin (cutaneous&#xD;
      leishmaniasis) or the internal organs of the body (visceral leishmaniasis). Some of the&#xD;
      milder forms will produce skin problems which will be localised, whilst other forms of&#xD;
      leishmaniasis will cause widespread skin changes. The skin lesions of cutaneous leishmaniasis&#xD;
      can be disfiguring if left untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some treatments for leishmaniasis but many of them are not easy to use or don't&#xD;
      work well. Therefore, new treatments are needed including vaccines that prevent or work&#xD;
      against leishmaniasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A solution being adopted for other diseases, which the investigators now wish to adopt for&#xD;
      leishmaniasis is to develop a 'Controlled human infection model' (CHIM). These models involve&#xD;
      deliberate exposure of individuals to an infection, in order to better understand how the&#xD;
      disease works and to test potential vaccines and treatments. They have contributed knowledge&#xD;
      that has led to advances in the development of treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is study builds on an our initial successful study, FLYBITE, where uninfected&#xD;
      (disease-free) sand flies were used to test the safety aspects and ensure that sand flies&#xD;
      were able to bite human participants in a controlled environment. The investigators observed&#xD;
      no major adverse effects and it was well tolerated by participants. The investigators&#xD;
      therefore wish to proceed to a study using sand flies infected with a form of leishmaniasis&#xD;
      that causes localised skin disease and is treatable, on the pathway to assessing future&#xD;
      vaccines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study in up to twelve healthy Leishmania-naïve subjects aged between 18&#xD;
      and 50 years old who develop a confirmed sand fly bite. Initially six subjects will be&#xD;
      studied and exposed to biting by Phlebotomus duboscqi infected by Leishmania major. An&#xD;
      adaptive design will be used, that has been pragmatically designed to minimise unnecessary&#xD;
      exposure of volunteers to Leishmania and maximise the likelihood of developing a reproducible&#xD;
      Controlled Human Infection Model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is the development of a controlled human infection model of Leishmania&#xD;
      major using sand fly transmission which is (a) effective and (b) safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first six subjects will be exposed to biting by Phlebotomus duboscqi (sand fly species)&#xD;
      infected by Leishmania major (species of leishmaniasis causing cutaneous, ie skin disease)&#xD;
      and assess the 'take rate', that is the number of subjects developing parasitologically&#xD;
      confirmed cutaneous leishmaniasis (PCCL) lesions. If 6/6 subjects develop PCCL lesions no&#xD;
      further recruitment will take place; if only &lt; 6 subjects develop PCCL lesions, then an&#xD;
      adaptive design will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is based on an initial study, entitled FLYBITE (clinicaltrials.gov identifier:&#xD;
      NCT03999970).&#xD;
&#xD;
      the FLYBITE study was a clinical study to develop a sand fly biting protocol using&#xD;
      pathogen-free blood-fed sand flies. Twelve healthy participants were enrolled into the study&#xD;
      and all 12 participants experienced at least one successful sand fly bite.&#xD;

The investigators will assess the 'take rate', that is the number of subjects developing parasitologically confirmed cutaneous leishmaniasis (PCCL) lesions.

    <description>There is no clear indication in the medical literature to determine which of the major sand fly vectors of Leishmania major - Phlebotomus papatasi or Phlebotomus duboscqi, will be most effective at transmitting infection to a human host. Both species have a similar mode of feeding and can support L. major development. In our previous study, FLYBITE, no significant difference in biting rates on humans was observed. Based on pre-clinical data , Phlebotomus duboscqi was determined to be the lead candidate for use in this study. If all the 6 participants have developed lesions within the 6-month follow up after Leishmania challenge, the challenge phase of the study is completed. If only 5 participants have developed lesions, then a further 6 participants will undergo Leishmania challenge by P. duboscqi. If only 4 or less subjects in the first cohort develop lesions, then the investigators will switch vector to P. papatasi and a further 6 subjects will undergo Leishmania challenge.</description>
