      Introduction:Migraine is a prevalent disabling primary headache disorder which is classified&#xD;
      in two major types; migraine without aura and migraine with aura. The aim of this study was&#xD;
      to compare the efficiency of mesotherapy with systemic therapy in pain controlin patients&#xD;
      with headache related tomigraine without aura.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We conducted this prospective parallel randomized controlled trial with the patients&#xD;
      admitted to the emergency department with headache related to migraine without aura. One&#xD;
      group was treated with mesotherapy, and the control group with intravenous dexketoprofen.&#xD;
      Changes in pain intensity at 30th minute, 60th minute, 120th minute and 24th hours after&#xD;
      treatment using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), need to use analgesic drug within 24&#xD;
      hours,re-admission with same complaint to emergency department (ED) within 72 hours, and&#xD;
      adverse effect rate of the methods were compared between groups.&#xD;
