  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the efficacy and tolerability of a combination treatment&#xD;
      of methotrexate, ibrutinib, and temozolomide (MIT regimen) in treating patients who have&#xD;
      newly-diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare and aggressive extranodal&#xD;
      Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. Induction treatment of PCNSL in most reported single-arm or randomized&#xD;
      trials includes high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX)-based therapy, temozolomide, with or without&#xD;
      cytarabine and the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab. A better combination remains undefined.&#xD;
      Treatment is associated with considerable morbidity and disease recurrences with a 5-year&#xD;
      survival of approximately 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BTK inhibitor ibrutinib has shown antitumor activity in patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      refractory PCNSL. However, tumor responses to single-agent ibrutinib in CNS lymphoma are&#xD;
      often incomplete or transient. Efficacy and safety of ibrutinib in combination with cytotoxic&#xD;
      agents are worth to be discovered. Grommes et al.have shown ibrutinib in combination with&#xD;
      methotrexate and rituximab are safe and shows promising activity in recurrent/refractory CNS&#xD;
      lymphoma. In comparison to their prior study with single-agent ibrutinib, the radiographic&#xD;
      response of r/r PCNSL was higher with the ibrutinib/HD-MTX/rituximab combination regimen and&#xD;
      PFS was longer with the combination therapy. The study has shown that ibrutinib combined with&#xD;
      chemotherapy were superior to ibrutinib single agent and overcome the transient effect of&#xD;
      ibrutinib in relapsed PCNSL. However, there are some limitations in interpreting Grommes'&#xD;
      study results, especially the heterogeneous patient population with inclusion of both PCNSL&#xD;
      and SCNSL. Most recently, the role of rituximab in PCNSL has become clearly. In the HOVON&#xD;
      105/ALLG NHL 24 study, the addition of rituximab to a methotrexate-based regimen did not&#xD;
      demonstrate a significant benefit on clinical outcome. We therefore initiate this study aim&#xD;
      to evaluate the activity and safety of ibrutinib in combination with Methotrexate and&#xD;
      temozolomide (MIT regimen) in newly diagnosed PCNSL patients.&#xD;
