  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will review practices in relation to chorioamnionitis (CAM) before and after to&#xD;
      the implementation of the Neonatal Early-Onset Sepsis (EOS) Risk Calculator to determine the&#xD;
      effect in the nursery at Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix. Newborns enrolled will&#xD;
      be at least 35 weeks gestational age (GA) and have a maternal diagnosis of at least suspected&#xD;
      or confirmed CAM. The data will include those newborns whose assessment and treatment were&#xD;
      not guided by the EOS calculator which was implemented on August 28, 2019 and those with&#xD;
      which the EOS calculator was utilized. A secondary objective is to show the economic impact&#xD;
      with utilization of the EOS calculator. Data collected will include full laboratory workups&#xD;
      including complete blood counts (CBC), blood cultures, antibiotic usage, length of time in&#xD;
      the newborn nursery and total length of stay.&#xD;
