  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle plays several different roles in the promotion and maintenance of health and&#xD;
      well-being. The loss of muscle mass that occurs with aging, chronic muscle wasting diseases,&#xD;
      and physical inactivity puts people at an increased risk of frailty and becoming insulin&#xD;
      resistant, and therefore imposes a significant burden on health care spending. Resistance&#xD;
      exercise participation has proven particularly effective for increasing muscle mass and&#xD;
      strength. This effectiveness can be used by health care practitioners in a rehabilitation&#xD;
      setting to promote the recovery of individuals who have undergone involuntary periods of&#xD;
      muscular unloading (i.e. limb immobilization caused by a sports injury or reconstructive&#xD;
      surgery). However, there is large variability in the amount of muscle mass and strength that&#xD;
      people gain following participation in resistance exercise. Some individuals fail to increase&#xD;
      the size of their muscle (low responders) whereas others show vary large increases in muscle&#xD;
      size (high responders) in response to the same resistance training program. People also show&#xD;
      differences in the amount of muscle tissue they lose when they have a limb immobilized. To&#xD;
      circumvent variability across individuals, the investigators utilized a within-person paired&#xD;
      Hypertrophy and Atrophy ('HYPAT') strategy that reduced response heterogeneity by ~40%&#xD;
      (Available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3445673). Specifically, one leg performed resistance&#xD;
      training for 10 weeks to induce hypertrophy, whereas the other leg underwent single-leg&#xD;
      immobilization for 2 weeks to induce atrophy. The primary goal of the study will be to gain&#xD;
      insight into the molecular responses to an acute period of single-leg immobilization and&#xD;
      resistance exercise (8 days). The investigators will use an integrated systems biology&#xD;
      approach to monitor the individual rates of over one hundred different muscle proteins.&#xD;
