  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies from our lab indicated that long-term sedation is protective in mice with midbrain&#xD;
      infarct. To assess whether post-operative sedation has protective effects on the infarct size&#xD;
      and clinical outcome in patients with ischemic stroke undergoing endovascular thrombectomy&#xD;
      (EVT), a multi-center, randomized clinical trial will be carried out (POSET study). In POSET&#xD;
      study, patients receiving EVT for acute ischemic stroke under general anesthesia will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the control group (Con group) and the post-operative sedation group (POS&#xD;
      group). Patients in the Con group will be recovered and extubated immediately after the&#xD;
      surgery, whereas those in the POS group will be sedated with propofol and dexmedetomidine for&#xD;
      6h before extubation. The primary endpoint is infarct growth between CT perfusion (CTP) or&#xD;
      MRI scans performed before EVT and 7 days after EVT. The hypothesis is that patients in the&#xD;
      POS group will have less infarct growth.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in the POS group will undergo EVT under general anesthesia. After the surgery is done, patients will keep being intubated and mechanically ventilated for 6h, during which period the patients will be sedated with propofol (TCI 1.0~3.0μg/ml) and Dexmedetomidine (0.2~0.7μg/kg/h) to maintain a BIS value of 50~70 and Ramsay sedation score of 5 ~ 6. The SBP will be controlled between 120 ~ 180mmHg with vasoactive drugs.</description>

    <description>Patients in the Con group will undergo EVT under general anesthesia and will be routinely recovered and extubated immediately after the surgery is done. The SBP will be controlled between 120 ~ 180mmHg with vasoactive drugs for at least 7h after the surgery. In case the patient shows agitation after extubation, i.e., the Ramsay sedation score is 1, 0.02 ~ 0.1mg/kg of midazolam will be given. If the patient's Ramsay sedation score keeps being 1 and more than 0.2mg/kg of midazolam is given within 1 h, dexmedetomidine or propofol will be administered to calm the patient. Any patients in the Con group receiving dexmedetomidine or propofol within 24h after extubation will be excluded.</description>
