  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs), could be a highly effective medium to&#xD;
      address health behaviour change among older adults. As compliance to health advice is&#xD;
      important for positive health outcomes, successful design of persuasive ECAs can have huge&#xD;
      health benefits. However, insights in the mechanisms underlying usage and health behaviour&#xD;
      change via ECAs are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective is to unravel the mechanisms behind the use of an ECA intervention,&#xD;
      and understand the mechanism behind the observed behaviour change&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A randomized staggered-entry waitlist-controlled trial will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study population consist of Dutch-speaking older adults, who live&#xD;
      independently, are without partner, are retired, 65+ and possess basic computer skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The application PACO has been created for (and with) older adults with the goal&#xD;
      to motivate them to improve their eating behaviour and decrease their feelings of loneliness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameters are use, loneliness, and eating&#xD;
      behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Subjects are not exposed to any risks, nor have they any costs. They do have to&#xD;
      fill in questionnaires and use the application. The duration and data collection moments are&#xD;
      needed to gain a fine-grained understanding of the use, relationship development and health&#xD;
      change process. For subjects, the main benefit is to gain insight in their health behaviour&#xD;
      via the PACO-application. Although this might be experienced as confronting by some. The&#xD;
      technology was developed based on sound theories, with input from the target group, so the&#xD;
      investigators expect positive experiences and an improvement in participants loneliness and&#xD;
      eating behaviour. However, this can only be proven after the study.&#xD;
