      The purpose of this project is to examine the efficacy of a safety aid reduction treatment&#xD;
      (START), compared to a wait-list control, among Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD). It is hypothesized that participation in START, compared to a wait-list control, will&#xD;
      be associated with decreased PTSD symptom severity immediately and over time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among military personnel have surged in recent&#xD;
      years. In response, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has launched nationwide training&#xD;
      initiatives to disseminate two PTSD treatments with strong empirical support: prolonged&#xD;
      exposure (PE) therapy and cognitive processing therapy (CPT). Despite the well-documented&#xD;
      effectiveness of PE and CPT, only a minority of Veterans with PTSD initiate these&#xD;
      trauma-focused treatments. One approach to addressing PTSD in a non-trauma-focused fashion is&#xD;
      to utilize empirically supported treatments focused on safety aid reduction. Safety aids are&#xD;
      maladaptive cognitive and/or behavioral strategies designed to prevent, avoid, or alleviate&#xD;
      anxiety. Initially introduced as a way to explain how pathological anxiety can persist&#xD;
      despite repeated exposure to feared stimuli, safety aids have been found to play a critical&#xD;
      role in the etiology and maintenance of various anxiety and related conditions including&#xD;
      PTSD. Importantly, a separate line of research suggests that safety aids are amenable to&#xD;
      change through cognitive behavioral interventions. Although promising, these trials did not&#xD;
      include patients with PTSD. In this context, the purpose of this project is to examine the&#xD;
      efficacy of a safety aid reduction treatment (START), compared to a wait-list control.&#xD;
      Participants will include veterans with a diagnosis of PTSD who decline to participate in&#xD;
      evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs) for PTSD, namely PE or CPT. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      participation in START, compared to a wait-list control, will be associated with decreased&#xD;
      PTSD symptom severity immediately and over time.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in PTSD diagnostic status as measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS-5 is a 30-item clinician-administered interview designed to assess current (i.e., past month) and lifetime PTSD diagnostic status. In addition to assessing the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, the CAPS-5 contains questions regarding the onset and duration of symptoms, associated impairment in various life domains, and specifications for the dissociative subtype. The past month CAPS-5 will be administered at baseline and one-month follow-up to assess changes in PTSD diagnostic status.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PTSD symptoms as measured by the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention or wait-list (10-weeks), and one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess each of the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. Veterans will be asked to read a list of symptoms and indicate their level of distress as it relates to each within the past month using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Extremely) with higher scores reflecting increased symptom severity. The PCL-5 will be administered at baseline, immediately following the 10-week group or wait-list period, and at a one-month follow-up to assess changes in PTSD symptom severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in safety aid usage as measured by the Safety Behavior Assessment Form (SBAF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention or wait-list (10-weeks), and one-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The SBAF is a 41-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess safety behavior usage. Veterans will be asked to read a list of behaviors and rate how often they engage in each behavior using a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (Never) to 3 (Always) with higher scores reflecting increased symptom severity. The SBAF will be administered at baseline, immediately following the 10-week group or wait-list period, and at a one-month follow-up to assess changes in safety behavior usage.</description>

    <description>START-PTSD includes many of the key elements found in empirically supported treatments for PTSD including: a) psychoeducation regarding the development and maintenance of PTSD; and b) exposure to internal sensations and external situations that are connected to one's fear/distress response via identification and elimination of safety aids. Known safety aids to be covered include: cognitive avoidance (e.g., using mental distractions to avoid trauma-related images); situational avoidance (e.g., avoiding crowded market places); checking behaviors (e.g., checking doors, windows, locks, and perimeters more often than necessary); reassurance seeking (e.g., excessively watching the news); other compulsive behaviors (e.g., checking the location of exits); use of companions (e.g., relying on someone to attend a social gathering); and use of alcohol and certain substances (e.g., consuming alcohol to reduce anxiety).</description>
