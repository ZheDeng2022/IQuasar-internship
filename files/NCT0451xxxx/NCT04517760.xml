  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the research was to evaluate the performance of items within the Kizazi Kipya&#xD;
      (K2) Orphan and Vulnerable Children (OVC) HIV risk screening tool in identifying HIV-positive&#xD;
      children, to optimize an HIV screening tool for OVC and children and adolescents in facility&#xD;
      settings and to assess the feasibility and acceptability of home-based HIV risk screening and&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Under the ongoing community-based Kizazi Kipya (K2) OVC project, program staff currently&#xD;
      administer a 13-item HIV risk screening tool to all K2 program beneficiaries, and refers&#xD;
      those who screen positive to facility-based HIV testing. A subset of this 13-item tool is a&#xD;
      module of four items that had previously been used as a standalone four-question screening&#xD;
      tool in facilities in Zimbabwe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the performance of a lay cadre-administered four-item subset of the K2 HIV&#xD;
           risk screening tool that matches the Zimbabwe evidence-based tool in predicting the HIV&#xD;
           status of vulnerable children/adolescents represented by two populations: (a) K2 OVC&#xD;
           beneficiaries and (b) children/adolescents attending health facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify additional items in the K2 HIV risk screening tool that could be added to&#xD;
           the four-question subset to improve the tool's performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess fidelity to the administration of the OVC HIV screening tool items through&#xD;
           structured observations of community case workers in the K2 program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the acceptability of OVC HIV risk screening and testing implemented in the&#xD;
           community among OVC beneficiaries in the K2 program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the acceptability and feasibility of integrating the OVC HIV screening tool&#xD;
           with HIV testing among OVC community case workers in the K2 program.&#xD;
