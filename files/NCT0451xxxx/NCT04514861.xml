    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to monitor changes in local tissue oxygen levels in participants&#xD;
      with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) using the Wireless Lumee Oxygen Platform. A&#xD;
      transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) device is used to show correlations in oxygen&#xD;
      dynamics. Oxygen dynamics are induced by a pressure cuff and position maneuvers. Study&#xD;
      participants will participate in the study for 12 months with six (6) planned visits over the&#xD;
      course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational device, the Wireless Lumee Oxygen Platform, consists of the Lumee Oxygen,&#xD;
      a sterile soft injectable oxygen-sensitive hydrogel, designed to sense and report oxygen&#xD;
      levels in the subcutaneous tissue. After initial insertion of the hydrogel in the&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissue using the Lumee Pen (a sterile disposable injector device), tissue oxygen&#xD;
      levels can be monitored continuously using the Lumee Patch (a non-invasive, non-sterile,&#xD;
      wireless electronic device to collect, analyze and report tissue oxygen levels sensed by&#xD;
      Lumee Oxygen Hydrogel) attached to the skin through the Lumee Patch Adhesive (designed to&#xD;
      adhere the Lumee Patch). The Lumee Patch sends collected tissue oxygen data to the Lumee App&#xD;
      which displays the collected data and operates up to four Lumee Patches.&#xD;
