  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy and optimal dose of TSG-01, an&#xD;
      innovative drug with ginsenosides as its main components, in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      chronic heart failure(CHF). Preclinical studies have revealed that TSG-01 promote myocardial&#xD;
      energy metabolism and ATP production, reduce the damage of human pulmonary microvascular&#xD;
      endothelial cell connection, resist arrhythmia, and regulate the lipid metabolism disorder&#xD;
      caused by myocardial ischemia. Results from CHF animal models(dog, rat) showed that TSG-01&#xD;
      significantly increase coronary blood supply, improve myocardial contractility, reduce heart&#xD;
      expansion and pulmonary edema. Besides its potency of improving heart function, TSG-01 was&#xD;
      found to induce diuresis without obvious effect on urine potassium in rats. TSG-01 has been&#xD;
      approved by CFDA for a clinical trial on the treatment of CHF (Approval No. 2018L03012). A&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled phase IIa clinical trial is now&#xD;
      being conducted in 5 hospitals in China. A total of 90 cases of CHF caused by coronary heart&#xD;
      disease are included and randomly divided into three groups: high-dose, low-dose of TSG-01&#xD;
      and placebo group. NYHA functional class, 6-minute walk test(6MHWT) distance, NT-proBNP, left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction(LVEF), echocardiographic parameters (LVESV, LVEDV, and heart&#xD;
      size) and MLHFQ score are measured before, during and after treatment to evaluate the&#xD;
      benefits of TSG-01 therapy in patients with CHF.&#xD;
