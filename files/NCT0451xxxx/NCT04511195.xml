  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee Osteoarthritis is one of the most frequent rheumatic disorders in the population and, in&#xD;
      many cases, it causes disability due to pain, stiffness and deformation. The drugs available&#xD;
      for treatment cause adverse events that are sometimes very severe and, for this reason, the&#xD;
      development of new drugs for topical administration with fewer adverse events is desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To elaborate a phytopharmaceuticals for topical administration with a standardized extract of&#xD;
      Sphaeralcea angustifolia and evaluate its efficacy and therapeutic tolerability when&#xD;
      administered in patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An extract will be obtained from the aerial parts of the plant species S. angustifolia with&#xD;
      which a phytomedicine will be designed in a pharmaceutical presentation for topical&#xD;
      administration. Once the phytomedicine has been designed, it will be scaled at the pilot&#xD;
      plant level and the drug produced will be subjected to a clinical study in order to evaluate&#xD;
      its efficacy and therapeutic tolerability in patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
      Through a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical study with 2% diclofenac, patients&#xD;
      will be treated topically for four weeks. The evolution of the disease will be evaluated&#xD;
      weekly during the four weeks of treatment through the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Western&#xD;
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) of function. The primary&#xD;
      outcome variable will be: therapeutic efficacy (clinical parameters for the evolution of knee&#xD;
      pain). The secondary outcome variables will be therapeutic tolerability (side effects that&#xD;
      are triggered by the application of the drug), and the Western Ontario and McMaster&#xD;
      Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) of function. A scale used to evaluate function of&#xD;
      the knee&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to identify possible participants, the project will be promoted in the outpatient&#xD;
      waiting rooms for family medicine and specialties of the General Hospital of Zone # 1 of the&#xD;
      Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) in Cuernavaca, Morelos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People interested in participating will be asked to go to the clinical research office so&#xD;
      that the supporting physician will perform a medical history in addition to a physical&#xD;
      examination, in this way the clinical diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis will be made and it&#xD;
      will be defined if the patient meets the clinical criteria necessary to be included in the&#xD;
      study. Once it is determined that the patient is a possible candidate and the diagnostic,&#xD;
      treatment and follow-up procedures can be continued, the patient will need to sign an&#xD;
      informed consent letter, duly completed and authorized by the Ethics Committee. Otherwise, if&#xD;
      patient decide not to participate, an interconsultation with the corresponding family doctor&#xD;
      will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To make the radiological diagnosis, the patient will be submitted to X-ray office, in order&#xD;
      to take a front to back and lateral knee (s) radiograph. Once the diagnosis is corroborated,&#xD;
      the participants will prepare a file that will contain a questionnaire with questions related&#xD;
      to sociodemographic, personal, family and condition history, in addition, treatment will be&#xD;
      assigned with the corresponding folio number upon admission. Each of the patients will be&#xD;
      given oral and written instructions on how the treatment should be administered and the&#xD;
      hygienic measures that must be followed during their participation in the study. The first&#xD;
      administration of the treatment will be in the research office, in order to teach the&#xD;
      participant how to do it; later, instructions about how the medication should be administered&#xD;
      three times a day in the affected knee (s), for four weeks will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be cited every week for four weeks where their evolution will be assessed; in&#xD;
      each of the appointments. Patients will undergo a complete evaluation of their condition,&#xD;
      there will be a format in which each of the data that is collected will be recorded, either&#xD;
      at the interrogation or on the physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be summoned every week in order to evaluate the evolution of the disease,&#xD;
      and consequently the therapeutic efficacy by means of the Visual Analogue Scale of pain and&#xD;
      the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) of function, a&#xD;
      scale used to evaluate function of the knee. The presence of adverse effects (Therapeutic&#xD;
      tolerability) and the adherence to the treatment (based on the days of administration) will&#xD;
      be evaluated. A concentrate related to tolerability and adherence to treatment will be filled&#xD;
      in each of the patients.&#xD;

    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) is a questionnaire for the assessment of function of the affected knee. Scale describes pain in every day's life activity of the patient. Physical Function is measured by means of 17 items: using stairs, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in / out of a car, shopping, putting on / taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in / out of bath, sitting, getting on / off toilet, heavy domestic duties, light domestic duties The test questions are scored on a scale of 0-4, which correspond to: None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), and Extreme (4).&#xD;
The scores are summed up, with a possible score range of 0-68 for Physical Function. Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse functional limitations.</description>
