  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Routine preoperative tests aim to identify asymptomatic diseases that can't be recognized by&#xD;
      history and examination. Identification and management of these diseases is thought to help&#xD;
      minimizing perioperative morbidity and mortality. A large number of routine screening tests&#xD;
      increase the cost of perioperative care. Also unneeded tests may harm the patient due to&#xD;
      overtreatment for borderline / false positive results. Therefore, the routine use of such&#xD;
      examinations remains controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE-UK) guidelines for&#xD;
      preoperative examination are the assessment standard developed by NICE in collaboration with&#xD;
      the National Collaboration Center for Acute Care in the UK; in order to reduce unnecessary&#xD;
      tests by recommending which tests should be offered to people before minor and major&#xD;
      operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the degree of adherence of the current preoperative tests&#xD;
      at Kasr Alaini hospital to the NICE guidelines, to assess the effectiveness and usefulness of&#xD;
      the current practice of various examinations ordered by anesthesiologists during the&#xD;
      pre-anesthetic evaluation in patients who are intended for elective surgery in the hospital&#xD;
      and to also evaluate the cause of delay &amp; its effect to predict postoperative complications.&#xD;
