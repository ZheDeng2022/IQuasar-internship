  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the most common form of urinary incontinence in women.&#xD;
      It affects women in their quality of life : physical, social, sexual and psychological&#xD;
      levels. International recommendations suggest conservative treatments as first-line by&#xD;
      training the pelvic floor muscles with or without a biofeedback-type control system. The&#xD;
      latter allows the patient to visualize her muscle activity while stimulating her motivation.&#xD;
      The part of adherence and compliance is very important in this rehabilitation where the woman&#xD;
      must provide a significant commitment to continue the exercises beyond the support of the&#xD;
      physiotherapist. In this area, a new approach is emerging with the arrival of health&#xD;
      applications on smartphones. However, these tools lack scientific validation. The objective&#xD;
      of this mixed pilot study (randomized controlled study with a qualitative part) is to&#xD;
      investigate a new treatment for middle-aged to advanced patients outside the period of&#xD;
      peripartum suffering from SUI, through an application mobile with probe as home program in&#xD;
      standard physiotherapist treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The quantitative component is composed of 2 arms and the intervention is during 3 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study group : half of the participants will have a home pelvic floor work program via a&#xD;
           mobile application in addition to therapeutic follow-up by a physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: the other half will perform the home pelvic floor work program without&#xD;
           application and will also have therapeutic follow-up by a physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative component will include individual and semi-structured interviews based on an&#xD;
      interview guide with 4 women in the study group and 4 women in the other group after&#xD;
      completion of their perineal rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will be offered to patients who meet the inclusion criteria (see below).&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into one of the two groups using sealed opaque envelopes, the&#xD;
      order of which will have been randomly generated by randomization software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of participants will be done with the help of partner doctors. They will be&#xD;
      responsible for introducing them to the study and providing them with the necessary&#xD;
      documentation (information and informed consent sheets, 9 physiotherapy sessions for the&#xD;
      treatment of SUI and the list of physiotherapists from the ASPUG-PP adapted to the study).&#xD;
      The physiotherapists included in this study are all specialized in pelvi-perineology and&#xD;
      members of ASPUG-PP and trained in the study protocol. They will ensure running of the&#xD;
      process by collecting information from the anamnesis and carrying out pre- and post-tests&#xD;
      with the project team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be entered directly by the investigator or one of the collaborators in Redcap.&#xD;
      All information required by the protocol should be entered as it is obtained and an&#xD;
      explanation should be provided for any missing data. Data analysis will be performed with the&#xD;
      intention of addressing the study design. A drop-out rate of 30% is taken into account in the&#xD;
      calculation of the sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was estimated based on the ICQI-SF (intensity of UI symptoms) data from the&#xD;
      study by Asklund et al (2018) because these are the only data available for an accurate&#xD;
      calculation. The probability of error (alpha) was set at 0.10 and the power (1-beta) at 0.95.&#xD;
      Based on these values, the sample size was calculated at 30 participants, or 15 per group.&#xD;
      The standard deviation considered is 3.5 and the desired effect size is d=0.8 (strong).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be carried out on the feasibility outcomes and on the outcomes of&#xD;
      the final trial. Intention-to-treat analysis, inferential statistics will be considered in&#xD;
      order to obtain primary results from the final trial. The objective is to investigate the&#xD;
      relevance of the project by assessing differences between groups (inter-group analysis) and&#xD;
      between evaluations (intra-group analysis). The thematic analysis of the qualitative data&#xD;
      will be carried out in four phases as described by Braun &amp; Clarke (2006) : (1)&#xD;
      familiarization (2) identification of themes and units of meaning; (3) coding of transcripts;&#xD;
      (4) concordance and reduction of redundancies. Phase 4 will allow for the comparison of&#xD;
      categories and their refinement. The thematic analysis has the advantage of highlighting the&#xD;
      analysis process through its transparency and the links between the stages of analysis.&#xD;
