      The purpose of this trial is to understand whether:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Metformin vs fluvoxamine vs ivermectin vs metformin+fluvoxamine vs metformin+ivermectin&#xD;
           is superior to placebo in non-hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 disease for preventing&#xD;
           Covid-19 disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To understand if the active treatment arms are superior to placebo in improving viral&#xD;
           load, serologic markers associated with Covid-19, and gut microbiome in non-hospitalized&#xD;
           adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To understand if any of the active treatment arms prevent long-covid syndrome, PASC&#xD;
           (post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a rapidly spreading viral&#xD;
      infection causing COVID-19 disease. There currently is no definitive preventive or early&#xD;
      outpatient treatment therapy for Covid-19. Six observational studies have found decreased&#xD;
      severity of Covid-19 disease among persons with metformin use before diagnosis with Covid-19:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cariou et al, Diabetologia, adults with diabetes (DM) in France: OR mortality 0.59&#xD;
           (0.42, 0.84)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Crouse et al, medrxiv.org adults with DM at Univ of Alabama Birmingham: OR mortality&#xD;
           0.33 (0.13-0.84)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bramante et al, Lancet Healthy Longevity, females with DM or obesity, claims data from&#xD;
           50 US5 states: OR mortality 0.759 (0.601, 0.960) by propensity matching; OR 0.785&#xD;
           (0.650, 0.951) by Cox model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Lou et al, Am J Trop Med, adults with diabetes in China, OR for survival: 4.36&#xD;
           (1.22-15.59)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Bramante et al. Under review, in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and&#xD;
           +SARS-CoV-2, OR for admission: 0.42 (0.18-1.01, p=0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Bramante et al. Under review, in adults with Covid-19, OR for admission 0.46&#xD;
           (0.27-0.80), p&lt;0.01; mortality, OR 0.49 (0.26-0.94); and metformin was associated with&#xD;
           lower IL-6 (non-significant) lower neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and CPR, and equivalent&#xD;
           lactate and bicarbonate as non-metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kow, J Med Virol conducted a meta analysis, with an overall odds ratio for mortality of 0.62&#xD;
      (0.43-0.89).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gordon et al found decreased SARS-CoV-2 and increased cell viability with metformin in vitro.&#xD;
      (Gordon et al, Nature). While anti-viral activity may be contributing to the observational&#xD;
      associations of reduced severity of Covid-19, metformin has a proven history of beneficial&#xD;
      immune-modulatory effects, including on CRP, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, neutrophil extracellular&#xD;
      traps, and improved T cell immunity. Outpatient metformin use has now been associated with&#xD;
      lower IL-6, CRP, and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio in persons with Covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to metformin, fluvoxamine appears to have important anti-viral and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects in SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is evidence that SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection causes ER stress and activates pathways of unfolded protein response. Sigma-1&#xD;
      receptor (S1R) is an ER chaperone protein that regulates cytokine production through&#xD;
      interaction with IRE1. S1R modulation has demonstrated significant changes to coronavirus&#xD;
      replication, and atypical antipsychotics with S1R activity have displayed protective effects&#xD;
      against clinical deterioration. Fluvoxamine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor that&#xD;
      is a powerful S1R agonist. Fluvoxamine has previously been shown to protect mice from septic&#xD;
      shock and reduce the inflammatory response. There is potential for fluvoxamine as an&#xD;
      immunomodulatory treatment for SARS-Cov-2. Fluvoxamine in CACO2 cells infected with&#xD;
      SARS-Cov-2 had a reduction in production of a subset of cytokines including IL-6, IL-8,&#xD;
      CXCL1, and CXCL10.53 A randomized controlled clinical trial of 152 patients showed that&#xD;
      patients who received fluvoxamine were less likely to experience clinical deterioration, or&#xD;
      serious adverse events due to SARS-Cov-2 when compared to placebo (0% vs. 8%). A follow-up&#xD;
      real-world observational cohort had similar findings of 0% (0/65) hospitalization with&#xD;
      fluvoxamine vs. 12% (6/48) with observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ivermectin has also shown anti-inflammatory effects that would reduce the harmful cytokine&#xD;
      cascade noted in severe Covid-19 disease. A recent trial assessing a multi-therapy including&#xD;
      12mg one-time dose of ivermectin found a 75% reduction in hospitalizations. Another small&#xD;
      double-blinded RCT showed significant increased chance of viral clearance after a 5-day&#xD;
      course of ivermectin. Another March 2021 RCT reported no effect on diminishing symptoms, but&#xD;
      was under-powered for assessing reductions in hospitalization. An RCT with ivermectin must be&#xD;
      done in the US, as endemic strongyloidiasis in other countries may confound results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 has been promising, there may be reduced willingness&#xD;
      among the public to receive a vaccine developed so quickly. This is a substudy with&#xD;
      laboratory outcomes. The intervention is metformin, a biguanide, administered in its&#xD;
      immediate release formation, 1,500mg daily.&#xD;

        The following medications may not need to be excluded when dose for that individual is&#xD;
        considered alongside the low dose of fluvoxamine being used and other medications being&#xD;
        used. The PI or site PI may review and decide if the patient should be excluded from the&#xD;
        fluvoxamine arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Taking SSRIs, SNRIs, or tricyclic antidepressants, unless these are at a low dose such&#xD;
             that a study investigator concludes that a clinically significant interaction with&#xD;
             fluvoxamine (ie either serotonin syndrome or TCA overdose) is unlikely (examples:&#xD;
             participant takes escitalopram but only at 10mg daily; that dose plus 100mg&#xD;
             fluvoxamine would be insufficient to cause serotonin syndrome; or, participant takes&#xD;
             amitriptyline but only at 25mg nightly; even if fluvoxamine inhibits its metabolism,&#xD;
             it would be an insufficient dose to cause QTc prolongation or problematic side&#xD;
             effects). Risk Class C, monitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Individuals who take alprazolam or diazepam and are unwilling to cut the medication by&#xD;
             20% (rationale: fluvoxamine modestly inhibits the metabolism of these drugs). Risk&#xD;
             Class C, monitor therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants taking theophylline, clozapine, or olanzapine (drugs with a narrow&#xD;
             therapeutic index that are primarily metabolized by CYP 1A2, which is inhibited by&#xD;
             fluvoxamine) will be reviewed with a study investigator and excluded unless the&#xD;
             investigator concludes that the risk to the participant is low (this would be&#xD;
             unlikely; example: participant takes clozapine only as needed and is willing to avoid&#xD;
             it for the 14 days of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients will be advised that there is a small risk that the following substances will&#xD;
             be affected by fluvoxamine, but that significant effects are not likely at the low&#xD;
             dose being used: caffeine, nicotine, melatonin. Risk Class C, monitor therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Taking warfarin-also known as Coumadin, NSAIDs, and Aspirin (rationale: increased risk&#xD;
             of bleeding), phenytoin (rationale: fluvoxamine inhibits its metabolism), clopidogrel&#xD;
             (rationale: fluvoxamine inhibits its metabolism from pro-drug to active drug which&#xD;
             raises risk of cardiovascular events), and St John's wort (rationale: fluvoxamine + St&#xD;
             John's wort are considered contraindicated because of the risk of serotonin syndrome)&#xD;
             Risk C, monitor therapy.&#xD;
