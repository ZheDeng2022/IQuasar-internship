      Objective: Chronic Hand eczema (CHE) is a common inflammatory skin disease has a major&#xD;
      medical psychological and socio-economic implications that affect quality of life (QoL)and&#xD;
      work ability. This study, the first randomized controlled trial that will be conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of paraffin bath therapy (PBT) in the treatment of CHE.&#xD;

      Design: The study design is a randomized controlled trial with measures at pre-and&#xD;
      post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Sixty patients with moderate to severe Chronic Hand eczema (CHE) will participate&#xD;
      in the study. They will be classified randomly into two groups of equal number; paraffin&#xD;
      group and the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Paraffin group will receive Paraffin bath therapy for 5 days per week for 12&#xD;
      weeks in addition to routine skin care program while the control group will receive routine&#xD;
      skin care program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective SCORing Atopic Dermatitis, subjective item score and dermatology life quality index&#xD;
      (DLQI) will be assessed before, at 6th week and at 12th week of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>is the most widely clinical tool for assessing the severity (i.e. extent, intensity) of atopic dermatitis as objectively as possible.20 It consists of six objective items (erythema, oedema/papules, effect of scratching, oozing/crust formation, lichenification, and dryness), and two subjective symptoms (itch and sleeplessness), the maximum score is 103 points</description>

    <description>Patients in treatment group will receive paraffin wax baths for five days per week for 12 weeks. Prepare the paraffin device and blocks of paraffin wax. Put the paraffin wax blocks inside the tank and set the thermostat 35 to 40â—¦C. Melting paraffin was taken from 90 to 120 minutes. Adjust the suitable temperature for each patient before immersion of patient's hand. Submerge patient's hand completely for three to four seconds then withdraw it</description>
