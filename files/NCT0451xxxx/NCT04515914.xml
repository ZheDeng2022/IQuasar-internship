  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent investigations have demonstrated that DNMT gene polymorphisms can contribute to the&#xD;
      inter-individual variants in DNMT expression. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the DNMT and&#xD;
      HDAC genes SNPs could predict the outcomes of decitabine therapy for myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndrome. Prospective collection of DNA from peripheral blood will be performed in the&#xD;
      patients with MDS before commencement of decitabine therapy. We will evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      decitabine therapy according to the DNMT or HDAC gene SNPs in terms of following parameters:&#xD;
      1) hematolotic response (HR) or improvement (HI), or requirement of decitabine dose to&#xD;
      achieve HR or HI, 2) complete (CR) or partial response (PR), or requirement of decitabine&#xD;
      dose to achieve CR or PR, and 3) time to relapse or progression of MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is 1) to determine genotypes from DNA samples from MDS patients&#xD;
      receiving Decitabine therapy, 2) to determine the association of clinical outcomes (HR, HI,&#xD;
      CR, PR or time to progression to leukemia) following decitabine therapy with DNMT or HDAC&#xD;
      genotypes, and 3) to analyze the impact of cytogenetic risk on the response or leukemic&#xD;
      evolution following decitabine therapy for MDS.&#xD;

      This study will include the patients who signed the subject informed consent form among the&#xD;
      patients with MDS who were chosen to be treated with Decitabine (Part I), plus additional 140&#xD;
      MDS patients as a historical control (Part II). Approximately, 68 patients will be included&#xD;
      who satisfy the following inclusion and exclusion criteria in the Part I study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective collection of DNA from peripheral blood will be performed in the patients with&#xD;
      MDS before commencement of decitabine therapy. We will evaluate the efficacy decitabine&#xD;
      therapy according to the DNMT or HDAC gene SNPs in terms of following parameters: 1)&#xD;
      hematolotic response (HR) or improvement (HI), or requirement of decitabine dose to achieve&#xD;
      HR or HI, 2) complete (CR) or partial response (PR), or requirement of decitabine dose to&#xD;
      achieve CR or PR, and 3) time to relapse or progression of MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genotyping will be undertaken using the Sequenom® iPLEX platform™, according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's instructions (www.sequenom.com; Sequenom Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). Whole blood&#xD;
      samples will be obtained according to the declaration of Helsinki. DNA will be extracted&#xD;
      using the Puregene DNA purification Kit (Gentra Systems Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The&#xD;
      detection of SNPs will be performed by the analysis of primer extension products generated&#xD;
      from previously amplified genomic DNA using a Sequenom chip-based matrix-assisted laser&#xD;
      desorption / ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry platform. Multiplex SNP&#xD;
      assays will be designed using SpectroDesigner software (Sequenom). Ninety-six well plates&#xD;
      containing 2.5 ng DNA in each well will be amplified by PCR following the specifications of&#xD;
      Sequenom. Unincorporated nucleotides in the PCR product will be deactivated using shrimp&#xD;
      alkaline phosphatase. Allele discrimination reactions will be conducted by adding the&#xD;
      extension primer(s), DNA polymerase, and a cocktail mixture of deoxynucleotide triphosphates&#xD;
      and di-deoxynucleotide triphosphates to each well. MassExtend clean resin (Sequenom) will be&#xD;
      added to the mixture to remove extraneous salts that could interfere with MALDI-TOF analysis.&#xD;
      The primer extension products will be then cleaned and spotted onto a SpectroChip. Genotypes&#xD;
      will be determined by spotting an aliquot of each sample onto a 384 SpectroChip (Sequenom),&#xD;
      which is subsequently read by the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical tests will be two-sided with the significance level set as 0.05 unless&#xD;
      otherwise stated. The statistical data will be obtained using an SAS version 9.1 (SAS&#xD;
      Institute, Cary NC, USA). Followings are the endpoints for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary endpoint evaluation data&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Response rate: A response rate will be obtained and its confidence interval estimated&#xD;
           to be evaluated through chi-square test. If the main endpoints which may influence the&#xD;
           final evaluation must be controlled, stratified analysis (Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel, etc.)&#xD;
           will be conducted. If all the subjects' characteristic endpoints must be controlled, the&#xD;
           logistic regression model will be used for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary endpoint evaluation data&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Overall survival: survival will be evaluated from the registration day to death&#xD;
                through Kaplan-Meier method.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Progression free survival: : The time of progression from MDS to AML and death from&#xD;
                any cause. Progression free survival will be analyzed through Kaplan-Meier method.&#xD;
