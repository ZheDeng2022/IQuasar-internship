      Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) still a major cause of health loss for all regions of the&#xD;
      world. Sociodemographic change over the past 25 years has been associated with the dramatic&#xD;
      decrease in CVD in regions with very high sociodemographic index (SDI), but only a gradual&#xD;
      decrease or no change in most regions (Roth et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics from the World Health Organization indicates that cardiovascular diseases are the&#xD;
      leading cause of death in Egypt, accounting for 46% of total deaths ( Royal Philips,2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mouth serves as &quot;a mirror of health or disease, as a sentinel or early warning system, as&#xD;
      an accessible model for the study of other tissues and organs, and as a potential source of&#xD;
      pathology affecting other systems and organs (Dr. Shantala Arunkumar, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oral cavity is considered as a window to the body because oral manifestations accompany&#xD;
      many systemic diseases. In many instances, oral involvement first appears than other symptoms&#xD;
      or lesions at other locations. These oral manifestations must be properly recognized if the&#xD;
      patient is to receive appropriate diagnosis and referral for treatment (Mehrotra et al.,&#xD;
      2010b).&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with cardiovascular disease and who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the&#xD;
      presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or&#xD;
      already established disease) need early detection and management using counselling and&#xD;
      medicines, as appropriate(World Health Organization, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A great many cardiovascular drugs have adverse reactions in the mouth in the form of&#xD;
      xerostomia, lichenoid reactions, burning mouth sensation, loss of taste sensation, gingival&#xD;
      hyperplasia and bleeding(Arunkumar, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of early death among people with diabetes. People&#xD;
      with diabetes also suffer from hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and obesity, which contribute to&#xD;
      increased incidence of cardiovascular disease (Malik and Dwivedi, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CVDs are a leading cause of death worldwide including the Middle East. This is caused in part&#xD;
      by the dysregulation of adipose tissue cause increasing in production of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      adipokines and reduction in cardio-protective adipokines such as adiponectin (Abu-Farha,&#xD;
      Behbehani and Elkum, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low- and middle-income countries are disproportionally affected: over 80% of CVD deaths take&#xD;
      place in low- and middle-income countries and occur almost equally in men and women. By 2030,&#xD;
      almost 23.6 million people will die from CVDs, mainly from heart disease and stroke (WHO,&#xD;
      2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medications used for management of hypertension cause oral alternation like Diuretics cause&#xD;
      oral dryness, adrenergic inhibitors cause oral dryness and ulcerations, calcium antagonists&#xD;
      cause overgrowth of gingiva while ACE inhibitors affect test sensation and lichenoid&#xD;
      reactions of the oral mucosa (Mehrotra et al., 2010).&#xD;
