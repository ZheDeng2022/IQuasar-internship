  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objectives of this work is to establish feasibility of a robotic ankle assist&#xD;
      device (RAAD) to improve mobility in free-living settings and to establish the RAAD as an&#xD;
      effective tool to provide increased dose and precision of targeted ankle therapy. The first&#xD;
      specific aim is to complete a personal-use feasibility analysis of ankle mobility assistance.&#xD;
      It is hypothesized the children will be able to safely walk faster and travel farther in the&#xD;
      community when using the RAAD device vs. without the device. The second specific aim is to&#xD;
      gather feedback to design and prototype a minimum viable product for use in clinical and&#xD;
      community settings. The third specific aim is to quantify the potential for the RAAD system&#xD;
      to increase the effectiveness of clinical gait therapy. Individuals with CP will complete&#xD;
      three training sessions: RAAD assistance, RAAD resistance and standard of care. Muscle&#xD;
      activity and step activity will be measured during each session. It is hypothesized that the&#xD;
      RAAD assistance and resistance therapy will improve ankle plantar-flexor muscle activity and&#xD;
      treatment session quality compared to traditional physical therapist-guided gait training.&#xD;
      The fourth specific aim is to assess the benefits of repeated gait training with RAAD&#xD;
      assistance and resistance. Individuals with CP will participate in a 4-week assistance or&#xD;
      resistance intervention and mobility outcomes will be quantified pre and post intervention.&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that both assistance and resistance training will improve mobility&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study has four experiments. In experiment I, participants will be recruited to complete user-centric device testing. In experiment 2, participants will be recruited to complete a study to determine effectiveness of the device during clinical gait therapy. In experiment three, participants will be recruited to complete gait training with the RAAD under assistance.In experiment four, participants will be recruited to complete gait training with the RAAD under resistance either (1) always under therapist supervision, or (2) with one therapist-supervised and two parent- supervised sessions per week.</intervention_model_description>
