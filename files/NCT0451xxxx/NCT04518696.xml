      Study of novel surgical technic-suprachoroidal buckling for therapy of rhegmatogenous retinal&#xD;
      detachment.It was excpted to reattached the retina and improve visual function of&#xD;
      rhegmatogenous retinal detachment patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The operation was performed under a surgical microscope with a 25G Chandelier light source&#xD;
      and a wide-field observation system to observe the fundus.Location, marking and freezing of&#xD;
      the retinal tear on the scleral side .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subretinal fluid is released from the outside of the sclera as needed. The spherical&#xD;
      conjunctiva was opened and the radial full-thickness scleral incision (3mm)was made about&#xD;
      8-13mm away from the retinal tear. A &quot;pocket&quot; is formed by injecting some viscoelastic agent&#xD;
      into the posterior edge of the sclera and separating the choroid from the sclera using the&#xD;
      Healon packaged cannula (No.27 Rycroft cannula). The Healon 5 syringe was connected with a&#xD;
      450-um special tube (a 23 caliber curved tube with olive tip). The cannula is inserted into&#xD;
      the supragromal space under microscopic and was scaned by iOCT . Monitor the location of&#xD;
      retinal tear during intubation in real time, and adjust the position of the needle: posterior&#xD;
      margin of the tear. Once confirmed in accord with the needle position, sodium hyaluronate&#xD;
      injection, injection needles to in front of shift to injection, until the tear was completely&#xD;
      surrounded in viscoelastic agent to create the choroid crest, usually need 0.2 mL to 0.5 mL.&#xD;
      Exit the duct and close the incision with scleral presutures.&#xD;

In the quadrant of the retinal tear, the spherical conjunctiva was opened and the radial full-thickness scleral incision (3mm)was made about 8-13mm away from the retinal tear. After the choroid was exposed, a &quot;pocket&quot; is formed by injecting some viscoelastic agent into the posterior edge of the sclera and separating the choroid from the sclera using the Healon packaged cannula (No.27 Rycroft cannula). The Healon 5 syringe was connected with a 450-um special tube . The cannula is inserted into the supragromal space under microscopic and was scaned by iOCT . Once confirmed in accord with the needle position, sodium hyaluronate injection, usually need 0.2 mL to 0.5 mL, application of anterior chamber puncture or subretinal fluid stable intraocular pressure. Exit the duct and close the incision with scleral presutures.</description>
