    <textblock>
      For patients with large head and neck tumors the recommended treatment, in many cases, is a&#xD;
      combination of extensive surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. The surgical procedure&#xD;
      involves resection of the tumor and reconstruction with a so called microvascular free flap,&#xD;
      i.e. tissue transferred from for instance the arm or leg to the resection site. Complications&#xD;
      of this complex procedure include, but are not limited to, bleeding and blood cloths&#xD;
      (thrombosis) in the transferred tissue (free flap), which can cause very serious&#xD;
      complications including need for further surgery and loss of the flap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine blood tests can measure parts of the system that regulates bleeding and the forming&#xD;
      of blood clots, the so called coagulation system, but these tests don't cover the whole&#xD;
      system. There are however more advanced instruments, such as ROTEM, rotational&#xD;
      thromboelastometry, which provide a more global view of the hemostatic potential of whole&#xD;
      blood. ROTEM is one of few more advanced assays that can be analyzed in emergency situations&#xD;
      in major hospitals. Other more advanced coagulation assays are thrombin generation and&#xD;
      measurements of specific coagulation factors, several of which are vitamin K dependent.&#xD;
      Vitamin K is essential in the coagulation system and also involved in many other&#xD;
      physiological processes. Deficiency of this vitamin is common, but not well studied in&#xD;
      patients undergoing head an neck free flap surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to study ROTEM and other above mentioned coagulation parameters in&#xD;
      patients undergoing major head and neck surgery including microvascular free flap&#xD;
      reconstruction to assess if these parameters can help predict patients at risk for bleeding&#xD;
      or flap thrombosis. Further on this could hopefully enable prevention of complications and&#xD;
      improve treatment of coagulation complications that still occur.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Microvascular reconstructive free flap surgery is an important part of the recommended&#xD;
      treatment for extensive head and neck tumors. However, the procedure includes risks of&#xD;
      perioperative coagulation related complications, such as bleeding, but also thrombosis in the&#xD;
      flap blood vessels. In about 10% of cases this requires reoperation, but, in spite of intense&#xD;
      efforts, about 5% of all patients suffer from flap failure, i.e. necrosis of the free flap.&#xD;
      This results in significant suffering for the patients who must undergo further surgery and&#xD;
      oftentimes considerable prolonged hospital stay etc. This in turn leads to increased health&#xD;
      care costs. There are several indications that tendency towards thrombosis can increase the&#xD;
      risk of flap failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have indicated that increased levels of fibrinogen and inherited&#xD;
      thrombophilia, such as APC resistance, are associated with thrombotic free flap&#xD;
      complications, but more conventional coagulation parameters, such as PK/INR and aPTT have not&#xD;
      shown the same connection. Low fibrinogen levels have also been associated with bleeding&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients undergoing the above mentioned surgery receive anticoagulant therapy. However,&#xD;
      there is no international consensus on any specific pharmacological regime. Many different&#xD;
      prophylactic therapies are used, including low molecular weight heparin, dextran and&#xD;
      acetylsalicylic acid. Still coagulation-related complications are difficult to prevent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defective coagulation apparently seems to be associated with bleeding and thrombotic&#xD;
      perioperative complications. It would therefore be desirable to increase the knowledge about&#xD;
      factors influencing the development of these complications, and the patients at risk for&#xD;
      them. ROTEM, rotational thromboelastometry, is a viscoelastic essay that provides a more&#xD;
      global view of the hemostatic potential in whole blood, and it is also one of few more&#xD;
      advanced assays that can be analyzed around the clock in many Swedish hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to study perioperative coagulation and vitamin K status, and&#xD;
      thereby further on hopefully be able to prevent, and improve the treatment of, bleeding and&#xD;
      thrombosis related complications in patients undergoing head and neck microvascular free flap&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
