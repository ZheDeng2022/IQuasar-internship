  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if giving a typhoid vaccine by mouth (an&#xD;
      experimental vaccine, CVD 909) before giving a vaccine shot (Typhim Vi) will result in a&#xD;
      better immune response than giving Typhim Vi vaccine by itself. Another purpose is to see&#xD;
      whether CVD 909 is safe. Typhim Vi has been shown to be safe and effective in preventing&#xD;
      typhoid fever in older children and adults, but it does not work in children under age 2.&#xD;
      Scientists at the University of Maryland think that young children could respond to Typhim Vi&#xD;
      if they were given a dose of the other typhoid vaccine by mouth before they are given the&#xD;
      Typhim Vi shot. Twenty-eight healthy adult volunteers, ages 18-40 years, will take part in&#xD;
      this study. Study participation will last for up to 63 weeks, but most of the study visits&#xD;
      will be in the first 6 weeks. Blood samples will be collected approximately 13 times. Four&#xD;
      stool samples will be collected. Some volunteers may be followed for an additional 4 years.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, randomized, double-blind, heterologous prime-boost study of the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of Vi polysaccharide typhoid vaccine after priming by live, attenuated oral&#xD;
      Vi+ Salmonella Typhi strain CVD 909. The primary study objective is to determine the phase 1&#xD;
      safety of the prime-boost regimen of priming with CVD 909, a live attenuated Vi+ S. Typhi&#xD;
      strain, followed by boosting with licensed parenteral Vi polysaccharide vaccine in healthy&#xD;
      adult volunteers. The secondary objective is to compare the immunogenicity of licensed&#xD;
      parenteral Vi polysaccharide vaccine in volunteers primed with a single oral dose of CVD 909&#xD;
      and in volunteers who are not primed with the oral vaccine. The outcome measures of interest&#xD;
      are the seroconversion rate and titer of serum IgG anti-Vi antibodies, the timing of&#xD;
      development and longevity of serum anti-Vi antibodies, the subclasses and avidity of&#xD;
      antibodies developed, and the memory B and T cell responses elicited. The following&#xD;
      immunologic outcome measures will be sought: rate and timing of seroconversion in each study&#xD;
      arm after receiving Vi polysaccharide and analysis of immunoglobulin subclasses and avidity.&#xD;
      This will assess the presence of priming and the rapidity of the anamnestic response. A&#xD;
      successful priming would accelerate the response to the boost (Day 7 after Vi vaccine), and&#xD;
      this response is expected to be more balanced, inducing both Th1/Th2-type immunity evidenced&#xD;
      by the induction of both IgG1 and IgG2; geometric mean titer (GMT) of serum IgG anti-Vi&#xD;
      antibodies on Days 7, 14, 21, and 35 post-Vi (Days 28, 35, 42, and 84 of the study). This&#xD;
      will assess magnitude of response (another measure of priming); GMT of serum IgG Vi antibody&#xD;
      in each study arm at multiple later time points up to 1 year after receiving parenteral Vi&#xD;
      (week 55 of the study). This will assess the quality and duration of the antibodies; and&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected to measure cytokine production and&#xD;
      cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity, as well as the induction and maintenance of B and T&#xD;
      cell memory responses and homing potential of antibody secreting cells (ASC) and T cells&#xD;
      depending on cell numbers. Twenty-eight healthy adult volunteers, 18-40 years of age and from&#xD;
      the Baltimore community, will be recruited to participate in this study, which will be&#xD;
      conducted at the Center for Vaccine Development (CVD), University of Maryland School of&#xD;
      Medicine. The volunteers will be randomized to receive either 5x10^9 colony forming units of&#xD;
      CVD 909 with buffer or buffer placebo alone. Three weeks later, all volunteers will receive&#xD;
      25 micrograms (0.5 ml) of licensed purified Vi polysaccharide vaccine by the intramuscular&#xD;
      route. Blood for serum and antibody secreting cell responses to Vi, S. Typhi LPS, and O&#xD;
      antigen will be drawn before and after the Vi boost. The patient participation duration is up&#xD;
      to 63 weeks, with the option for prolonged immunologic follow-up for 4 additional years.&#xD;
