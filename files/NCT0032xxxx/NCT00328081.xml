  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether care gap(s) exist in the management of obesity&#xD;
      and its related conditions in obese patients seen by primary care physicians and specialists.&#xD;
      The study will also look at whether there is a compliance and adherence gap that exists in&#xD;
      patients prescribed medication for obesity management.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obesity currently affects over 15% of the adult population in Canada. The economic burden&#xD;
      associated with obesity is estimated at $4.3 billion or 2.2% of the total health care costs&#xD;
      in Canada. Despite increasing recognition as a public health problem, clinical management of&#xD;
      obese patients in Canada has received little attention. This study will collect information&#xD;
      on the current status, characteristics and management of subjects with obesity. The design of&#xD;
      the study will mirror real-life management of these subjects.There are three goals in this&#xD;
      study: the primary goal is to document appropriate obesity management strategies aimed at&#xD;
      reducing and maintaining a healthy body weight by participating primary care physicians and&#xD;
      specialists. The second goal is to explore factors that determine patients compliance and&#xD;
      adherence to anti-obesity medication when prescribed. Obesity management is currently not a&#xD;
      priority in tertiary care centres in Canada. An exception being the Bariatric Clinic located&#xD;
      at McMaster University, which is one of the few academic centers dedicated to obesity&#xD;
      management in Canada. The primary goal of the Bariatric Clinic Substudy is to evaluate the&#xD;
      management, compliance and adherence of patients seen at a tertiary care obesity clinic&#xD;
      compared to those of primary care physicians and specialists.&#xD;
