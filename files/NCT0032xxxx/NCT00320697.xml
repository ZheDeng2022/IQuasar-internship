      Background and Preliminary Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 72% and 90% of patients with schizophrenia smoke cigarettes, and schizophrenia&#xD;
      patients are more likely than the general population to smoke and to smoke heavily (1-6).&#xD;
      Compared with the general population, patients with schizophrenia have low smoking cessation&#xD;
      rates, even through they can be both highly motivated and persistent in their attempts to&#xD;
      quit smoking (7-10) and can tolerate short-term tobacco abstinence without significant&#xD;
      exacerbation in clinical or cognitive symptoms (11, 12). Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)&#xD;
      and bupropion are each well tolerated by patients with schizophrenia, and bupropion is&#xD;
      superior to placebo for smoking cessation in this population when added to CBT (13-20).&#xD;
      However, abstinence rates have been low (4-19%) at 3-6 month follow up, whereas placebo plus&#xD;
      CBT has produced cessation rates of 0-6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been estimated that 45% of cigarettes sold in the US are sold to people with a mental&#xD;
      illness (21) and that in the UK and Ireland, patients with schizophrenia spend approximately&#xD;
      one third of their weekly income on cigarettes (22, 23). Age-adjusted mortality from&#xD;
      smoking-related diseases such as pulmonary and cardiovascular disease are two to six times&#xD;
      higher among people with schizophrenia compared to age matched samples (24-27). More&#xD;
      effective pharmacologic treatments for smoking cessation in patients with schizophrenia are&#xD;
      thus urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination treatment with bupropion and NRT has shown promise. In a large study in a&#xD;
      non-psychiatric population, a combination of bupropion SR and NRT was superior to placebo and&#xD;
      to NRT alone but not to bupropion alone for smoking cessation (28). In an open,&#xD;
      non-randomized smoking cessation study in 115 nicotine dependent patients with co-morbid&#xD;
      psychiatric and substance use disorders, patients treated with bupropion SR plus NRT and&#xD;
      weekly CBT had significantly greater reduction in smoking than those on bupropion SR plus&#xD;
      CBT, NRT plus CBT or CBT alone (29). Subjects on a combination of bupropion SR plus NRT also&#xD;
      had significantly greater retention in the smoking cessation program and tolerated the&#xD;
      combination treatment well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings were extended to patients with schizophrenia in a 12-week, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind trial of bupropion or placebo added to NRT + CBT (30). In this trial, bupropion&#xD;
      300 mg/d or identical placebo was added to NRT and CBT for 12 weeks. NRT was given, starting&#xD;
      on the quit date at week 4, as nicotine patch 21 mg/d for 4 weeks, 14 mg/d for 2 weeks and 7&#xD;
      mg/d for 2 weeks combined with nicotine gum up to 18 mg per day prn. Combination treatment&#xD;
      with bupropion and NRT was well tolerated and more beneficial than NRT alone for significant&#xD;
      smoking reduction in patients with schizophrenia (Table 1 &amp; Figure 1). The combination&#xD;
      treatment was also superior for continuous abstinence until week 8 when the dose of NRT was&#xD;
      reduced. When subjects were taking bupropion 300 mg per day, nicotine patch 21 mg per day and&#xD;
      prn nicotine gum up to 18 mg per day, they had a cessation rate of 52%. See Table 1. Patients&#xD;
      began to relapse to smoking after the dose of nicotine patch was reduced to 14 mg per day and&#xD;
      continued to relapse through the 12 month follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is our hypothesis that the 8-12 week treatment model that has been traditionally used for&#xD;
      smoking cessation treatment is not of adequate duration for patients with schizophrenia. In&#xD;
      our trial of bupropion combined with NRT, subjects experienced a 30% relapse rate during the&#xD;
      taper of NRT patch from 21 mg/day to 7 mg/day while still on bupropion. In patients who are&#xD;
      able to achieve abstinence with short-term treatment, a trial of longer duration treatment&#xD;
      with bupropion + combination NRT at the dose used to quit smoking is warranted. It is our&#xD;
      hypothesis that the rate of relapse to smoking will be lower with longer duration of the&#xD;
      pharmacologic treatment used to quit smoking. Longer duration treatment can be justified in&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia for several reasons. First, schizophrenia patients have known&#xD;
      abnormalities in nicotinic receptor expression and function and may benefit more than the&#xD;
      general population from continued pharmacotherapy for maintenance of abstinence (32-34).&#xD;
      Nicotinic receptors are reduced in number in patients with schizophrenia (32, 35) and heavy&#xD;
      smoking in schizophrenia may be attributable to attempts to overcome a deficit in nicotinic&#xD;
      activity. Benefits of nicotine to patients with schizophrenia include reversal of some of the&#xD;
      specific cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia and antipsychotic medications&#xD;
      (36-40). Nicotine has been shown to improve learning, visual and spatial working memory,&#xD;
      attention, auditory sensory gating smooth pursuit eye movements and reaction time (41, 42).&#xD;
      The positive effects of chronic nicotine treatment appear to persist over time, and in some&#xD;
      studies, improvements in cognition with chronic nicotine treatment become more robust over&#xD;
      time (43). Secondly, the burden of morbidity and mortality of smoking related illness is high&#xD;
      in schizophrenia such that it warrants a harm reduction approach. Continued NRT may be&#xD;
      considered a harm reduction approach if it is associated with long term tobacco abstinence.&#xD;
      For schizophrenia patients who are heavily addicted to tobacco products and would like to try&#xD;
      to quit smoking, it may be appropriate to test whether higher abstinence rates can be&#xD;
      sustained with longer-term treatment with bupropion and NRT, combined with a behavioral&#xD;
      intervention. This study seeks to determine if continued treatment with bupropion and NRT can&#xD;
      reduce the relapse rate in patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a study that will determine if continued treatment with bupropion and NRT can&#xD;
      reduce smoking relapse rates in schizophrenia. This study has been designed with 3 phases: an&#xD;
      initial open, 8 week smoking cessation phase, followed by a 44 week, randomized, placebo&#xD;
      controlled, relapse prevention phase and then a 3 month follow-up phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and thirty adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder&#xD;
      will be entered into an 8-week open smoking cessation trial. Subjects will receive weekly&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), bupropion 300 mg/d nicotine patch 21mg/day and up to 20&#xD;
      mg/day of either nicotine gum or lozenge for prn use. Those who attain abstinence and agree&#xD;
      to participate in the relapse prevention phase(n=60-70), will be randomized, according to a&#xD;
      double-blind, parallel group design, to receive continued treatment with a 21 mg nicotine&#xD;
      patch and bupropion SR 300 mg or placebo added to CBT for 44 weeks. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      documented at each visit. Study medication will be distributed bi-weekly during the double&#xD;
      blind phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Measures and Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Review of medical chart to confirm DSMIV diagnosis of schizophrenia/schizoaffective&#xD;
           disorder and medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Demographic Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical Rating Scales: SANS (Schedule for assessment of Negative symptoms), BPRS (Brief&#xD;
           Psychiatric Rating Scale), Hamilton Calgary depression scale, AIMS (Abnormal Involuntary&#xD;
           Movement Scale), SAS (Simpson Angus Scale), BAS (Barnes Akathisia Scale), Tiffany&#xD;
           Questionnaire of Smoking Urges, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Snaith Hamilton Anhedonia&#xD;
           scale, Barrett Impulsiveness Scale, SF-12 smoking Self Efficacy Questionnaire and the&#xD;
           Wisconsin Smoking Withdrawal Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Drug, alcohol and smoking history including Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Cognitive tests including AX-Continuous Performance Test, WMS-III spatial span, Brief&#xD;
           visuospatial memory test, Emotional Stroop, finger tapping, signal detection (reward&#xD;
           responsivity) and WTAR IQ.6. Measure of reward responsivity using a signal detection&#xD;
           test7. Expired air CO, Salivary Cotinine&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Weight, height, pulse, blood pressure, and the UKU self-report of adverse events form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Salivary Drug test to exclude current abuse of PCP, cannabis, alcohol, cocaine,&#xD;
      methamphetamine and opiates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. Phlebotomy to measure metabolic health, cotinine, bupropion medication levels, genes for&#xD;
      nicotine metabolism, and genes associated with smoking cessation and nicotine dependence.&#xD;
      Additional serum will be stored. If there is a significant effect of continued treatment on&#xD;
      smoking relapse, this serum will be tested for comparison of lipids and inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Open Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All enrolled subjects will receive weekly CBT group sessions, bupropion 300 mg/ daily,&#xD;
           nicotine patch 21 mg/day, and up to 20 mg/day of nicotine gum, lozenge, or nasal spray&#xD;
           for prn use. Subjects will set a quit date between group sessions 3 and 4. The open&#xD;
           phase groups will consist of 8 weekly CBT meetings with up to 10 participants. Subjects&#xD;
           who achieve 2 weeks continuous abstinence at the end of the open intervention will be&#xD;
           eligible for the double blind, relapse prevention trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Relapse Prevention Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will be randomized to receive either nicotine patch and bupropion or placebo&#xD;
           patch and pill added to CBT for 44 weeks. Randomization will take place using a&#xD;
           computer-generated table of random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visits will then take place bi-weekly for the first 4 visits then monthly throughout the&#xD;
           relapse prevention phase for CBT group treatment. Study medication will be distributed&#xD;
           at each visit. Smoking status will be determined at each visit with self-report and&#xD;
           expired air CO. Medication side effects will also be recorded at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow- up Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During medication taper and after medication is discontinued, subjects will attend 4 follow&#xD;
      up visits over the next 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical status using rating scales will be evaluated at visits 1, 11, 17, 20, 30 and 34.&#xD;
      Serum levels of psychiatric medications and metabolic markers will also be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be paid $5 for each of the group meetings during the open and relapse&#xD;
      prevention phases. Subjects will also be paid an additional $5 for each follow-up visit they&#xD;
      attend for self-report and $20 for clinical and cognitive assessments. Subjects who complete&#xD;
      visits 30 and 34 at the end of the study will receive an additional $50 bonus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Selection and Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are 130 adult outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who smoke&#xD;
      more than 10 cigarettes per day and wish to stop smoking. Subjects will be recruited by&#xD;
      referral from treatment staff at Freedom Trail Clinic in Boston and by self-referral by&#xD;
      responding to posted fliers in clinic waiting rooms. The Freedom Trail Clinic has established&#xD;
      procedures for identifying and recruiting subjects for research. Clinicians and members of&#xD;
      research teams meet each week to discuss current projects. Using this information clinicians&#xD;
      approach their patients if they are likely to be suitable and interested in the study. Those&#xD;
      who contact research staff about the study will be given information by a research assistant.&#xD;
      Those who remain interested and express a desire to quit smoking will meet with a research&#xD;
      psychiatrist. At this meeting subjects will be given further information about the study&#xD;
      including risks and benefits and screening for eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case managers, primary care physicians and residential treatment staff within the Boston Area&#xD;
      will also refer subjects. Research staff will meet with local case managers, residential&#xD;
      staff and primary care physicians to inform them of the study, eligibility criteria and means&#xD;
      of referral. Fliers will also be placed in local mental health facilities.&#xD;
