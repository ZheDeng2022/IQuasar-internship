      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of rifaximin 600&#xD;
      mg (3 x 200-mg tablets) once daily compared with placebo when taken for 14 days by healthy&#xD;
      subjects to prevent travelers' diarrhea (TD) from all causes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Travelers' diarrhea (TD) is the most common illness in travelers to the developing world,&#xD;
      occurring in 60% or more of international travelers to high-risk areas. It can be quite&#xD;
      debilitating for the usual 2 to 4 days of the illness and may lead to disruption of travel&#xD;
      plans. Findings from recent studies have indicated that the chronic post-travel illness may&#xD;
      prove to be of greater clinical and public health significance than the acute illness.&#xD;
      Specifically, persistent diarrhea has been reported in 2% to 10% of travelers developing&#xD;
      diarrhea. Moreover, bacterial enterocolitis, including that associated with TD, leads to&#xD;
      post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome in 4% to 31% of patients.&#xD;
