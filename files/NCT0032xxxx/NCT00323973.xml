      Chagas disease (CD) is the major cause of disability secondary to tropical diseases in young&#xD;
      adults from Latin America. In this region 20 million people are currently infected by T.&#xD;
      cruzi, the etiologic agent for CD. In Colombia, 18 percent of the population live in CD&#xD;
      endemic areas, 900,000 people are infected and over three million are at high risk of being&#xD;
      infected. Heart failure due to Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCM) is the main clinical form of CD in&#xD;
      Colombia. However, the incidence of CCM among T. cruzi infected people is unknown and the&#xD;
      mechanisms that lead from infection to CCM are uncertain. Besides the poor prognosis of CHF&#xD;
      due to Chagas disease, it is important to estimate the risk of complications and death in&#xD;
      patient infected with T. cruzi Unfortunately, few clinical studies have addressed this issue.&#xD;
      Most T. cruzi infected patients have mild or no clinical disease, however, the percentage of&#xD;
      infected people that will develop detectable cardiac abnormalities is approximately 30 to 40&#xD;
      percent, but only 20 percent of them will develop symptomatic cardiac involvement. Like CHF&#xD;
      from other causes, CHF due to CD responds to digital, diuretics and vasodilators therapy.&#xD;
      Also, some studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve&#xD;
      survival in patients with moderate to severe CHF due to CD. Increased sympathetic drive&#xD;
      results in an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death. Beta-adrenoreceptor&#xD;
      antagonism seems to protect against the deleterious effects of chronic sympathetic&#xD;
      stimulation. The effects of the selective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker Bisoprolol on&#xD;
      cardiovascular mortality, hospital readmission due to progressive heart failure and&#xD;
      functional status in patients with CHF secondary to CCM has not been explored to-date. To&#xD;
      evaluate the benefit of Bisoprolol in CHF due to CCM, a cohort of T. cruzi seropositive&#xD;
      patients will be selected from several institutions in Colombia. Patients will be classified&#xD;
      according to a modified version of the Panamerican Health Organization recommendations for&#xD;
      patients with CCM. Overall one year mortality in patients with CHF due to Chagas disease has&#xD;
      been reported as 34 percent. However, one year mortality is only 3 percent in patients in&#xD;
      NYHA functional class II, 27 percent in those in NYHA functional class III, and 62 percent&#xD;
      among those in functional class IV (22). The sample size has been calculated assuming an&#xD;
      event rate of 40 percent in two years in the placebo group, and using a 95 percent confidence&#xD;
      level and power of 80 percent, we will need to recruit 250 patients per treatment arm to&#xD;
      detect a reduction of 30 percent in the risk of the primary outcome. The event rate we have&#xD;
      used to estimate sample size is similar to the expected two-year mortality in patients with&#xD;
      CHF due to Chagas disease in NYHA functional class II. Therefore, the estimated sample size&#xD;
      should be enough to measure significant changes in the composite primary outcome (death, HF&#xD;
      hospitalizations, SMVT, SCD). The recruitment process will follow guidelines set out by the&#xD;
      FCV Ethics Committee. Most participants will be recruited from the Chagas disease and the&#xD;
      Heart Failure clinics located in Bucaramanga, Bogotá and Cucuta. During the pretreatment&#xD;
      period an initial evaluation visit will be scheduled in which participants will sign consent&#xD;
      forms, baseline measurements and tests will be conducted at the FCV including blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements obtained with patients in the sitting and standing positions. Laboratory test&#xD;
      such as twelve-lead ECG will be recorded in each patient. Left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
      at rest will be determined by 2D echocardiography, using a modified Simpsons rule to&#xD;
      calculate LV volumes. Quality of life questionnaire will be performed two weeks apart during&#xD;
      baseline examination using the Minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire. Minimum of&#xD;
      two 6-minutes corridor walk test once a week over a two-week period will be performed to&#xD;
      measure the functional class. During the treatment period patients will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to receive double-blind Bisoprolol or placebo, initially taking a total daily dose of 2.5&#xD;
      mgrs qd. The dose will be increased every two weeks to 5 up to 7.5 and 10 mgrs qd (maximum&#xD;
      maintenance dose). Follow-up assessment will include clinical check-up, and blood collection&#xD;
      for future measurements of inflammatory reactants and markers. Quality of life measurements&#xD;
      will be obtained at six months. Following the descriptive analysis we will compare the&#xD;
      patient survival and hospitalization rates using Kaplan-Meier estimates and survival graphs.&#xD;
      Cox regression will be used for the multivariate analysis of time to death and time to&#xD;
      hospitalization. This analysis will allow us to explore the pattern of changes in patients&#xD;
      with chronic heart failure due to Chagas disease such as the effect of beta-blockers in this&#xD;
      special type of cardiomyopathy.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chagas disease (CD) is a permanent threat for almost a quarter of the population of Latin&#xD;
      America. Although the disease has been described in almost all Central and South America,&#xD;
      clinical presentation and epidemiological characteristics are highly variable among the&#xD;
      different endemic zones (1,2). A wide range of prevalence rates has also been reported&#xD;
      suggesting local differences in transmission of the disease as well as differences in vectors&#xD;
      and reservoirs (3). Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCM) represents a serious public health problem in&#xD;
      most Latin American countries, and the most recent statistics provided by the World Health&#xD;
      Organization indicate that 100 million persons are exposed to the disease and approximately&#xD;
      20 million are currently infected (4). Interestingly, in addition to the natural infection&#xD;
      foci, an increase in the transmission associated with blood transfusions has also been&#xD;
      noticed. These statistics are considered an underestimation of the real rates of infection,&#xD;
      most likely due to lack of reports from highly endemic retired rural communities. In&#xD;
      countries in which the disease is endemic such as Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil, the overall&#xD;
      prevalence of infection averages 10 percent. However, in highly endemic rural areas rates&#xD;
      have ranged from 25 to 75 percent (5). Prevalence of infection varies widely even between&#xD;
      cities and provinces within the same country because of variations in climate, housing&#xD;
      condition, public health measures, and urbanization. The actual prevalence of clinical Chagas&#xD;
      disease and the number of case fatalities are largely unknown, mainly because case reporting&#xD;
      is virtually nonexistent in many areas in which CD is highly endemic. Congestive heart&#xD;
      failure (CHF) is a late manifestation of CD that results from structural abnormalities and&#xD;
      extensive and irreversible damage to the myocardium. Heart failure in T. cruzi infected&#xD;
      patients usually occurs after age 40 and follows AV block or ventricular aneurysm. However,&#xD;
      when CHF develops in patients less than 30 years old it is frequently associated with a more&#xD;
      aggressive myocarditis and an extremely poor prognosis (1). The mortality attributable to CD&#xD;
      is related to the severity of the underlying heart disease. Very high mortality is often&#xD;
      found in patients with congestive heart failure (2), however, mortality in asymptomatic&#xD;
      seropositive patients varies greatly between geographic regions, suggesting that other&#xD;
      factors may influence the severity and progression rate of cardiac disease. It is believed&#xD;
      that cardiac damage in CD progresses slowly but steadily over decades, from subclinical&#xD;
      myocarditis to mild segmental abnormalities with conduction defects, to severe ventricular&#xD;
      structural abnormalities, and finally to overt congestive heart failure and sudden cardiac&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the poor prognosis of CHF due to Chagas disease, it is important to estimate the risk&#xD;
      of complications and death in patient infected with T. cruzi. Unfortunately, few clinical&#xD;
      studies have addressed this issue. Most T. cruzi infected patients have mild or no clinical&#xD;
      disease, however, the percentage of infected people that will develop detectable cardiac&#xD;
      abnormalities is approximately 30 to 40 percent (3), but only 20 percent of them will develop&#xD;
      symptomatic cardiac involvement (6). Like CHF from other causes, CHF due to CD responds to&#xD;
      digital, diuretics and vasodilators therapy (7). Additionally, some studies have shown that&#xD;
      angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve survival in patients with moderate to&#xD;
      severe CHF due to CD (8). In spite of its benefits on patients with non Chagas disease CHF,&#xD;
      there is considerable uncertainty about the potential role of ACE inhibitors in patients with&#xD;
      CHF due to Chagas disease. Captopril, and ACE inhibitors, has been shown to reduce&#xD;
      neurohormonal activation and non lethal arrhythmias in a small number of patients with Chagas&#xD;
      heart failure (8,9). Another intervention currently included in the management of CHF&#xD;
      patients is the use of b blockers. Observational studies (10) as well as clinical trials&#xD;
      (11,12) have shown that b-blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in CHF patients. The&#xD;
      effects of b-blockers on CHF patients are being studied in large scale clinical trials&#xD;
      (13-19). Apparently, the cardiac sympathetic hyperstimulation that initially helps to&#xD;
      preserve ventricular function in CHF patients, later on, results in an increased risk of&#xD;
      cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death (20) b-adrenoreceptor antagonism seems to protect against&#xD;
      the deleterious effects of chronic sympathetic stimulation (21). Moreover, b-blockers reduce&#xD;
      heart rate, improve myocardial energetic balance and lead to a less negative force-frequency&#xD;
      relationship. These effects contribute to the benefits of b-blocker therapy in CHF patients.&#xD;
      Clinical studies with Carvedilol, a a1 and non selective b-blocker, further support the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of b-adrenoceptor antagonism (18,19,23,24). Results from the US CARVEDILOL&#xD;
      and COPERNICUS trial, suggest that prognosis in CHF may partly depend on left ventricular&#xD;
      dysfunction improvement as well as sympathetic activity reduction (18,23). However,&#xD;
      additional data are needed to define more precisely the relationships between heart rate&#xD;
      reduction, left ventricular function improvement and survival in CHF patients. In some&#xD;
      studies like CIBIS II and MERIT HF, the beneficial effects of the selective b- blockers on&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality were observed specially in patients functional class II and III. In&#xD;
      COPERNICUS a multicentric placebo controlled clinical trial with Carvedilol, these effect was&#xD;
      ascertained even in patients functional class IV (23), demonstrating that patients with CHF,&#xD;
      independently of their functional class, should receive b-blocker therapy. Current guidelines&#xD;
      for the management of CHF strongly recommend the use of beta-blockade in management of CHF.&#xD;
      However, these benefits have not been proven in Chagas´ cardiomyopathy (25,26). Nevertheless,&#xD;
      there are reasons to believe that beta-blockade will be beneficial for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, patients with CHF due to CD have a raised end-diastolic pressure associated with a low&#xD;
      systemic blood pressure, which lead to low transmyocardial pressure gradient and&#xD;
      subendocardial ischemia. Therefore, reduction in myocardial oxygen demand due to&#xD;
      beta-blockade could be expected to be beneficial in this situation, even in non ischemic CHF&#xD;
      patients. Second the reduction in sudden cardiac deaths and serious ventricular arrhythmias&#xD;
      suggest that an anti arrhythmic effect is an important component of beta-blockade. This&#xD;
      anti-arrhythmic effect is explicable not only on an anti-ischemic basis but also by blockade&#xD;
      of sympathetic activity, which is indeed increased in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
      Third, prolonged activation of the sympathetic nervous system can accelerate the progression&#xD;
      of heart failure, and the rate of progression can be substantially decreased using&#xD;
      pharmacological agents that interfere with sympathetic activity in the heart and peripheral&#xD;
      blood vessels. There is clear evidence of increased circulating beta-adrenergic antibodies in&#xD;
      Chagas disease providing further theoretical support for the use of beta-adrenergic blockade&#xD;
      in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beta-blockers already proven to be beneficial in CHF patients are metoprolol, bisoprolol and&#xD;
      carvedilol, drugs which have been tested in over 10.000 patients in more than 20&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical trials enrolling men and women with systolic dysfunction due to&#xD;
      ischemia, hypertension and dilated idiopathic cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bisoprolol is a beta-1 selective blocker with the highest selectivity for this receptor, in&#xD;
      doses less than 10 mg it has very little or no effect on beta-2 receptors. Bisoprolol was&#xD;
      first tested in CHF in the CIBIS I trial which enrolled 641 patients and showed improvement&#xD;
      in functional class, less hospitalizations for heart failure and a trend to improved&#xD;
      survival. The much larger randomized CIBIS II assigned 2647 patients with class III or IV HF&#xD;
      and an LVEF lower than 40 percent to bisoprolol or placebo, the patients also received&#xD;
      standard therapy with diuretics and ACE inhibitors. After an average follow-up of 1.4 years,&#xD;
      the trial was prematurely stopped when the benefits were observed in the active treatment&#xD;
      group: significant reduction in total all-cause mortality (11.8 versus 17.3 percent) that was&#xD;
      independent of the severity or cause of HF. This benefit was primarily due to a reduction in&#xD;
      SCD (3.6 versus 6.3 percent, p 0.001), with a non-significant trend toward fewer deaths from&#xD;
      HF, significant 15 percent reduction in hospital admissions for any cause and a 30 percent&#xD;
      reduction in admissions for HF (p 0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering all the beneficial effects beta-blockers in patients with mild to severe CHF due&#xD;
      to ischemic and non ischemic disease, there is no data regarding its potential effects in&#xD;
      patients with CHF due to Chagas disease. Based on the aforementioned we propose to develop a&#xD;
      multi-center placebo controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effect of Bisoprolol in&#xD;
      patients with CHF due to CD.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Bisoprolol will significantly reduce hospitalization rates due to heart failure in&#xD;
           patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy in functional class NYHA II to&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHARITY is a multicenter randomized prospective, double blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      forced-titration study in subjects with CHF secondary to CCM. Enrolled subjects will receive&#xD;
      placebo or Bisoprolol in addition to standard therapy for chronic heart failure which&#xD;
      includes an ACE-inhibitor and may include diuretics or other medication such as digitalis or&#xD;
      nitrates for heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in CHARITY should be on stable doses of an ACE-inhibitor. Diuretics can be&#xD;
      added to treatment as needed but patients must be on stable doses of each drug during four&#xD;
      weeks prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      500 subjects will be randomized in two arms; one will receive oral bisoprolol and the other&#xD;
      placebo, during the duration of the study. Forced titration will start with the lowest oral&#xD;
      dose of 2.5 mg qd and will be up-titrated in 2.5 mg increments every two weeks until the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose is achieved or 10 mg qd is reached. In case of intolerance, dose will&#xD;
      be reduced to the previously tolerated lower dose. Subjects not tolerating the lower dose of&#xD;
      2.5 qd will have a treatment interruption. The best tolerated dose will be continued for one&#xD;
      month, then a security visit will re-asses tolerance. Thereafter patients will be controlled&#xD;
      every three months until they complete the mean follow-up period of two years. Standard heart&#xD;
      failure therapy with ACE-inhibitors, diuretics, digitalis and nitrates will be strongly&#xD;
      reinforced in both parallel arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BLINDING&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and investigators will remain blinded during the trial. The treatment codes will&#xD;
      remain blinded until the database is locked for final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRETREATMENT CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline vital signs will be obtained with patients in the sitting and after 3 minutes in the&#xD;
      standing position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve-lead ECGs will be recorded in each patient. Left ventricular ejection fraction at rest&#xD;
      will be determined by echocardiography, using a modified Simpsons rule to calculate LV&#xD;
      volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life questionnaire will be administrated two weeks apart during baseline&#xD;
      examination using a translated-validated version of the Minnesota living with heart failure&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimum of two 6-minutes corridor walk test once a week over a 2-week period will be&#xD;
      performed. The last value will be used if it is within 10 percent of the previous value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP PERIOD&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG tracings will be recorded during the security visit and at 1 and 2 years. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed for two years after randomization. Repeat echocardiograms will be recorded at 1&#xD;
      and 2 years of follow-up along with HF Quality of-life questionnaire and six-minute walk&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measurements will be obtained every three months along with an assessment of&#xD;
      treatment adherence and tolerance. Mortality and hospitalization events will be ascertained&#xD;
      by telephonic interview and verified with hospital charts review, up to two years after&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MONITORING COMMITTEES&#xD;

      Interruption of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial treatment should be interrupted under the following conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient decides it is in his-her best interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigator considers it is advisable or in the patients best interest.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Presence of life-threatening conditions despite adjustment of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If study treatment is interrupted, every effort should be made to reinstate treatment as soon&#xD;
      as possible and medically acceptable. The re-initiation dose is determined at investigators&#xD;
      discretion and the dose may be reduced or re-started at the last dose level. Patients with&#xD;
      treatment interruption should continue on the protocols visit schedule and study procedures&#xD;
      except drug dispensing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FCV Research Institute will supply ranurated 5 mg bisoprolol tablets and matched placebo&#xD;
      needed for the whole duration of the trial. Study drug and placebo have been kindly provided&#xD;
      by Merck Colombia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EFFICACY ASSESSMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy assessments will be made at every visit during the trial following randomization.&#xD;
      Information will be recorded in the supplied CRF formats dealing with clinical variables,&#xD;
      Adverse Events (AE), Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the primary endpoints will be recorded on the SAE form and in the individual&#xD;
      corresponding form for each endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint Definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular death: any death attributable to a cardiac or vascular cause occurring within&#xD;
      two years after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-cardiovascular death: death from any cause excluding cardiovascular diseases occurring&#xD;
      within two years after randomization..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital admission-hospitalization caused by heart failure: admission in a hospital or clinic&#xD;
      during at least 24 hours caused by heart failure worsening. It excludes procedures and&#xD;
      hospitalization for procedures which have been scheduled and not due to worsening of the&#xD;
      current heart failure condition since randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart failure worsening: decline of at least one functional class as defined by the New York&#xD;
      Heart Association occurring during any inter-visit period of three months needing inotropic&#xD;
      support, IV diuretics, medication dose adjustments or additional drugs for compensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceived quality of life worsening: increase in the Minnesota living with heart failure test&#xD;
      score of at least 10 points. The tests score ranges from 0 (best) to 100 (worst).&#xD;
&#xD;
      New AV block: appearance of any AV conduction disturbance including first, second and third&#xD;
      degree AV block after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bradycardia requiring pacemaker implantation: ventricular rates &lt; 50 per minute due to any&#xD;
      cause including sick-sinus syndrome and AV block, causing symptoms or disability and&#xD;
      complying with current indications for permanent pacemaker implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICD: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator indicated for the prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      sudden death, ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRT: cardiac resynchronization therapy or biventricular pacing or ventricular bifocal pacing&#xD;
      for the treatment of advanced heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PM: permanent pacemaker for the treatment of conduction disturbances. Clinically significant&#xD;
      ventricular arrhythmias: sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular&#xD;
      fibrillation with symptoms caused by hemodynamic or perfusion alterations, circulatory&#xD;
      collapse or syncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistical analysis will be composed with simple distribution of frequencies,&#xD;
      calculation of proportions, means, their respective standard deviations and 95 percent&#xD;
      confidence intervals. For effects of group comparison, t-test and Mann-Whitney tests will be&#xD;
      used according to the dependent variable distribution. For categoric variables, the&#xD;
      Chi-square test or the exact Fisher test will be applied as corresponding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient survival and hospitalization rates will be described using Kaplan-Meijer estimates&#xD;
      and survival graphs. Cox regression will be used for the multivariate analysis of time to&#xD;
      death and time to hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formal efficacy interim analyses will take place one year after the recruitment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct Results: Study results will help identify interventions potentially useful to prevent&#xD;
      the progression from T. cruzi infection to CCM. This may significantly lessen the burden of&#xD;
      CD in Colombian and other exposed populations. This will have a significant impact on the&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality of the Colombian population, mainly in areas with high prevalence of&#xD;
      seropositive subjects for T. cruzi such as Santander. The execution of this project will&#xD;
      allow us to determine the effect of the b-blocker therapy on the CCM and the behavior of the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system on the mortality and morbidity of subjects infected by T. cruzi. The&#xD;
      results of this study will also arise the need knowledge to suggest new therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions for patients with CCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indirect Results: This project will contribute to the consolidate the clinical research group&#xD;
      of the Easter Cardiovascular Foundation as well the Chagas group that is already working at&#xD;
      the same institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy to be use for data transferring&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to recent trends in the field literature we will try to get the results of this&#xD;
      project in one of the following clinical journals: Circulation, Journal of the American&#xD;
      College of Cardiology, American Journal of Cardiology and another one in one of the following&#xD;
      basic journals: Infection and Immunity, Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical&#xD;
      Medicine and Hygiene. The obtained results from this study will be presented at the Colombian&#xD;
      Congress of Cardiology, the Colombian Congress of Intern Medicine and at least in one&#xD;
      international meeting (Inter American Congress of Cardiology, Meeting of the American College&#xD;
      of Cardiology or the Annual Meeting of the American Heart Association). This strategy will&#xD;
      guarantee the communication, discussion and evaluation of the results by the international&#xD;
      scientific community in this subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experience of the Research Group and presentation of the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The members of the research team belong to the Research Institute of the Fundación&#xD;
      Cardiovascular del Oriente Colombiano (RIFCV) are physician from the medical staff of the FCV&#xD;
      and from the Instituto Colombiano de Investigacion ICIB, one of the members of the VILANO&#xD;
      group. The RIFCV is a well recognized research center, that has been promoted by COLCIENCIAS,&#xD;
      and has received twice economical support. During the last tree years the RIFCV has been&#xD;
      funded by COLCIENCIAS to make five research projects. Two of them, related to this subject,&#xD;
      are being carried out right now. Moreover, the RIFCV has also been funded by the Ministry of&#xD;
      Health for two projects. The RIFCV has also participated in more than ten projects funded by&#xD;
      pharmaceutical companies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RIFCV is one of the institution that constitute the ICIB. Three of the researcher of this&#xD;
      project, (CAM, LAC, JPC ) belong to the VILANOs group, which has been qualified by COLCIENCAS&#xD;
      as a group class A. The research team is a multidisciplinary group constituted by physicians&#xD;
      of several fields (Basic science, clinic and epidemiology) and includes one masters, tree&#xD;
      cardiologist, one master student and two general physician. The high academic degree and the&#xD;
      experience of the group allow to carry out high degree research with good quality. Tree of&#xD;
      the members of the team has developing research in the autonomic aspects of CCM and one have&#xD;
      been working in heart failure patients.&#xD;
