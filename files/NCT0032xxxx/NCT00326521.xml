      Briefly, the investigators propose to evaluate nulliparous (first time mothers) patients&#xD;
      beyond 36 0/7 weeks' gestation in active labor who already have received epidural anesthesia&#xD;
      and have an intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC) in place. Any patient who then develops a&#xD;
      single temperature elevation of &gt; 38 degrees will be eligible for inclusion and consented for&#xD;
      the study. Maternal blood will be drawn immediately, one hour later and at delivery. Amniotic&#xD;
      fluid will be aspirated from the pressure catheter; the first 1-2 cc will be discarded and&#xD;
      the remainder will be evaluated for gram stain, culture, glucose level, interleukin-6 (IL-6),&#xD;
      and proteomics. All placentas will be sent for routine pathologic examination. Cord blood&#xD;
      will be obtained at birth for routine studies. Both maternal and cord blood will be sent for&#xD;
      proteomic evaluation (defined). The patients with amniotic fluid that has a positive gram&#xD;
      stain and culture will be defined as the infected group, and the patients with amniotic fluid&#xD;
      that has a negative gram stain and culture will be defined as the uninfected group.&#xD;
      Differences in clinical presentation and laboratory assessments, including proteomics, will&#xD;
      be compared between the two groups to determine if there are any markers that might prove to&#xD;
      be useful in distinguishing between these two entities (epidural fever with and without&#xD;
      actual infection).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Historically the diagnosis of chorioamnionitis (an infection of the membranes surrounding the&#xD;
      fetus) for patients in labor has been made on the basis of multiple clinical variables such&#xD;
      as maternal fever, fetal tachycardia, uterine tenderness, or foul smelling vaginal discharge.&#xD;
      The diagnosis also takes into account a clinical picture consistent with risk factors such as&#xD;
      prolonged labor and prolonged rupture of membranes. Since most of these findings are not&#xD;
      specific, chorioamnionitis becomes the diagnosis of exclusion unless there is another&#xD;
      explanation for the fever. Randomized studies have clearly shown that maternal antibiotics&#xD;
      and neonatal septic work-ups are indicated once the diagnosis of chorioamnionitis has been&#xD;
      made. Neonatal sepsis is a severe infection of the blood stream. Such policies have important&#xD;
      implications for health care providers, on the impact of medical costs, and on the duration&#xD;
      of hospital stay. This becomes especially true for the newborn that is transferred to the&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for sepsis evaluation. Often times, these newborns are&#xD;
      prophylactically treated with antibiotics based on the suspicion of an infection, while&#xD;
      waiting for finalized blood culture results. Since newborn sepsis is such a difficult&#xD;
      diagnosis to make, many more newborns are treated than actually have the disease and the&#xD;
      length of their hospital stay may be significantly increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past 15 years, both observational and randomized trials have observed an increase in&#xD;
      maternal fever associated with epidural anesthesia in labor. These trials have shown&#xD;
      increased ranges from 10 - 15% over baseline rates and an increased relative risk of 1.5 to&#xD;
      15 fold, and even up to 70 fold in one study, over the rates seen in women not receiving&#xD;
      epidural anesthesia. After correcting for duration of labor and other confounding variables,&#xD;
      these increases remained present. Since epidural fever is virtually impossible to distinguish&#xD;
      from chorioamnionitis-related fever, these women are almost all treated with antibiotics and&#xD;
      given the diagnosis of infection. This approach also has tremendous impact on the evaluation&#xD;
      and care of the newborn. Two specific studies evaluated this impact on the neonate. Lieberman&#xD;
      found that babies of mothers given epidural anesthesia were more likely to be evaluated for&#xD;
      sepsis (34 vs. 9%) and treated with antibiotics (15 vs. 4%). Similarly, Philips found the&#xD;
      same increase (25 vs. 16% and 19 vs. 11%). Both studies had very low rates of confirmed&#xD;
      neonatal sepsis. On a national basis, the cost of this confusion nationally is tremendous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is one known way to distinguish between true chorioamnionitis in labor and&#xD;
      non-infectious fever due to the epidural anesthesia. Gibbs and colleagues found that amniotic&#xD;
      fluid aspirated from an intrauterine pressure catheter, a device commonly utilized for&#xD;
      monitoring contractions in labor, could be used to accurately make the diagnosis of infection&#xD;
      using gram stain and culture. More recently, many papers have shown that low glucose levels&#xD;
      and elevated IL-6 in amniotic fluid were also accurate tests for infection. While these&#xD;
      markers could in theory be used for distinguishing between epidural fever and true&#xD;
      chorioamnionitis, most patients do not require such a device and this approach would not&#xD;
      likely gain widespread favor. Alternatively, however, this approach could be used as a&#xD;
      research tool in women who already have such a catheter in place to determine if there are&#xD;
      additional non-invasive clinical or laboratory markers to distinguish one from the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently proteomic assessment has become an extremely effective tool in determining if there&#xD;
      are certain markers for various diseases. Proteomics is the determination of the structure,&#xD;
      function, and expression of all of the corresponding proteins that are encoded within the&#xD;
      genome structure. It can also be defined as the &quot;fingerprint&quot; of a disease process. It&#xD;
      involves running tandem mass spectometry on the fluid of interest. Such an approach could be&#xD;
      extremely valuable both in determining whether the mother actually has chorioamnionitis and,&#xD;
      if so, whether there are better markers for neonatal sepsis.&#xD;
