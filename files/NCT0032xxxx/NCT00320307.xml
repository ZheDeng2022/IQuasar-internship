    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to look at the levels of the drug abacavir (ABC) in blood. Also,&#xD;
      the study will look at the levels of carbovir triphosphate (CBV-TP), which is the active&#xD;
      substance produced from ABC in the body√¢ s cells which helps prevent HIV from multiplying.&#xD;
      CBV-TP will be measured in specific blood cells. The amount of ABC and CBV-TP will be looked&#xD;
      at when subjects receive ABC as a 300mg dose twice a day and compared with the levels when&#xD;
      they receive ABC as a 600mg dose once a day.&#xD;
