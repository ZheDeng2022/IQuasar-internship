  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researches aim to study the effects of DHA (component of fish oil) on patients with&#xD;
      Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC). Our hypothesis is that DHA might reverse the problems&#xD;
      associated with PSC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) is unknown. There are no proven&#xD;
      effective therapies and no early markers of the disease to predict which patients with&#xD;
      colitis may be at risk to develop PSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group has demonstrated an increased prevalence of CFTR alleles (the gene responsible for&#xD;
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF)) in patients with PSC which was correlated with decreased CFTR function&#xD;
      as measured by Nasal Potential Difference Testing. These data suggested that colitis in the&#xD;
      setting of CFTR dysfunction may lead to bile duct inflammation and fibrosis. As proof of&#xD;
      concept, we subsequently demonstrated in cftr-/- mice that (1) colitis leads to the&#xD;
      development of bile duct injury and (2) this is prevented by correction of the CFTR related&#xD;
      fatty acid defect with oral Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA). Preliminary data in these mice&#xD;
      indicates that low PPAR expression in the liver may predispose to inflammation. One mechanism&#xD;
      by which DHA ameliorates the innate inflammatory response linked to CFTR dysfunction may be&#xD;
      through an increase in PPAR expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these data, we hypothesize that CFTR dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Furthermore, correction of the fatty acid&#xD;
      abnormality and changes in the innate immune response associated with CFTR dysfunction by&#xD;
      oral administration of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, might&#xD;
      be an effective therapy for patients with PSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of DHA therapy on patients with PSC, examining:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • serum alkaline phosphatase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cholangiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  liver biochemistry (ALT, AST, gamma-glutamyl transferase, bilirubin, albumin,&#xD;
           prothrombin time,)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fatty acid profile (docosahexaenoic acid, arachidonic acid)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  serum/plasma liver fibrosis markers (hyaluronic acid, tumor necrosis factor-α,&#xD;
           transforming growth factor-ß, type III procollagen peptide)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  innate immune response (peripheral blood monocytes for assessment of cytokine secretion,&#xD;
           lipoxins, and PPAR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical data on signs and symptoms&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have a diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. The diagnosis will&#xD;
        require a chronic cholestatic liver disease of at least 6 months' duration; a serum&#xD;
        alkaline phosphatase level at least 1.5 times the upper limit of normal; cholangiographic&#xD;
        findings of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary-duct obstruction, beading, or narrowing&#xD;
        consistent with PSC; and a liver biopsy in the previous 12 months with compatible findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age less than18 years or more than 80 years. Subjects must have no evidence of secondary&#xD;
        cholangitis or other liver disease (primary biliary cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease,&#xD;
        autoimmune hepatitis, and chronic viral hepatitis). Subjects will be excluded if there is a&#xD;
        history of previous bile duct surgery, previous choledocholithiasis, recurrent ascending&#xD;
        cholangitis, previous history of variceal hemorrhage, or cholangiocarcinoma. Subjects with&#xD;
        PSC stage III (fibrosis) or IV (cirrhosis) based on the criteria of Ludwig et al. will be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will be excluded if there are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will also be excluded if treatment with corticosteroids, cyclosporine or&#xD;
        methotrexate has occurred within the preceding 3 months, or there is an anticipated need&#xD;
        for liver transplantation within 1 year. No fish oil supplements will otherwise be allowed.&#xD;
        Patients on 5-aminosalicylate preparations or azathioprine will remain on these&#xD;
        preparations for the duration of the trial. Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid will not be&#xD;
        an exclusion criteria. Patients on this therapy will be advised to continue the drug&#xD;
        throughout the trial. Those not on ursodeoxycholic acid will not be allowed to start this&#xD;
        drug since it is could affect the alkaline phosphatase levels and is not an accepted&#xD;
        efficacious therapy. Subjects will not be excluded for refusal of follow-up MRCP at study&#xD;
        completion. There will be no exclusion based on sex, race, and ethnic background.&#xD;
