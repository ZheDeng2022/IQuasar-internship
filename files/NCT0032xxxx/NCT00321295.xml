    <textblock>
      Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a medical condition that is due to left ventricular&#xD;
      systolic dysfunction (LVSD). LVSD is a decreased ability of the heart to pump blood forward.&#xD;
      There are 5 million people in the United States that have CHF and 52,828 new cases are&#xD;
      diagnosed annually. There are 995,000 hospital visits and 52,828 deaths annually due to CHF.&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that people with this condition are at a higher risk for&#xD;
      complications immediately after any type of heart surgery than are normal individuals. This&#xD;
      includes increased dependence on medications and devices to improve the pumping function of&#xD;
      the heart and blood pressure. Additionally, they also have longer lengths of hospital stay&#xD;
      and higher rates of death compared to normal individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients with LVSD not only have a decreased pumping ability of the heart, they also&#xD;
      have an inefficient pumping function. These patients have been shown to benefit from a device&#xD;
      therapy known as biventricular pacing. Biventricular pacing involves simultaneously&#xD;
      electrically stimulating the two major pumping chambers of the heart known as ventricles&#xD;
      using a pacemaker and wires. This causes a more coordinated contraction of the heart chambers&#xD;
      resulting in improvement in the pumping ability of the heart and blood pressure. Studies have&#xD;
      confirmed that in these patients, implantation of a biventricular pacemaker improves&#xD;
      patients' symptoms and quality of life as well as decreasing a need for future&#xD;
      hospitalizations. Whether biventricular pacing in patients with LVSD improves patient&#xD;
      outcomes after heart surgery has not been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients temporarily develop slow heart rates after cardiovascular surgery. These slow&#xD;
      heart rates can cause a decrease in the blood pumped from the heart and result in low blood&#xD;
      pressures. Therefore, all patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery, regardless of left&#xD;
      ventricular function, receive temporary pacing wires that are placed on one of the ventricles&#xD;
      during the surgery. Temporary pacing will result in an increase in heart rate and improvement&#xD;
      in the amount of blood pumped by the heart and in blood pressure. The placement of these&#xD;
      wires is precautionary as only a few patients need to be paced for slow heart rates. Once&#xD;
      patients are felt to no longer require them, the wires are easily removed. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to determine whether biventricular pacing immediately after heart surgery in&#xD;
      patients with LVSD will improve in-hospital outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that are scheduled for heart surgery and meet the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      approached for consent to participate in this study. Once consented, they will be randomized&#xD;
      to one of three treatment arms: usual care, RV pacing (single ventricle pacing), or&#xD;
      biventricular pacing. Randomization is a process similar to picking numbers out of a hat. The&#xD;
      patients will then undergo surgery as scheduled. During the surgery, the patients will&#xD;
      receive the temporary pacing wires on both ventricles instead of one. Immediately after&#xD;
      surgery, the patients will receive either usual care, RV pacing, or biventricular pacing&#xD;
      depending upon the treatment arm that they were randomized to. The pacing wires will be&#xD;
      removed as soon as the patients become stable as per routine. The clinical, operative, and&#xD;
      in-hospital characteristics of these patients will be recorded on specialized forms. The&#xD;
      characteristics of those that received biventricular pacing will be compared to those that&#xD;
      had RV or no pacing to see whether there was any benefit to this mode of therapy.&#xD;

      1. Basis for the study/study rationale Patients with congestive heart failure have high&#xD;
           rates of mortality and morbidity (1). There are 5 million people in the United States&#xD;
           that have congestive heart failure (CHF) and 52,828 new cases are diagnosed annually.&#xD;
           There are 995,000 hospital visits with 52,828 deaths annually due to this condition.&#xD;
           Although there have been numerous medical advances in drug therapy, there was a 164%&#xD;
           increase in the number of hospital admissions for CHF since 1979 (1, 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Biventricular (BiV) pacing has been shown to have acute and chronic benefits in a subset&#xD;
           of patients with CHF (3-6). Those that have been shown to benefit from this mode of&#xD;
           therapy have left ventricular systolic dysfunction with a widened QRS duration on the&#xD;
           electrocardiogram. Acute hemodynamic studies comparing patients at baseline with either&#xD;
           right ventricular (RV) or BiV pacing show significant improvements in the systolic blood&#xD;
           pressure and cardiac output in patients with BiV pacing compared to either RV pacing or&#xD;
           baseline measurements (3, 4). Furthermore, BiV pacing was associated with decrease in&#xD;
           the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and diastolic mitral regurgitation. These&#xD;
           acute hemodynamic benefits are sustained and manifest as improvements in clinical&#xD;
           symptoms. The Multisite Stimulation in Cardiomyopathies (MUSTIC) study showed that BiV&#xD;
           pacing was associated with a 23% increase in the distance walked in six minutes&#xD;
           (P&lt;0.001), a 32% increase in the quality-of-life score (P&lt;0.001), an 8% increase in the&#xD;
           peak oxygen uptake (P&lt;0.03), and a 66% decrease in the need for hospitalization (P&lt;0.05)&#xD;
           compared to no pacing (5). Patients also preferred BiV pacing compared to no pacing&#xD;
           (P&lt;0.001). The Multicenter InSync Randomized Clinical Evaluation (MIRACLE) study not&#xD;
           only confirmed many of the findings of the MUSTIC trial, but also showed improvement in&#xD;
           the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with BiV pacing (+4.6% vs. -0.2%,&#xD;
           P&lt;0.001), compared to non-paced controls (6). Such data has led to the classification of&#xD;
           BiV pacing in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy as a class IIa recommendation by&#xD;
           ACC/AHA/NASPE guidelines (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with left ventricular dysfunction&#xD;
           carries a high mortality (8). Furthermore, patients with a low LVEF have a greater need&#xD;
           for intraaortic balloon pump (P&lt;0.0001) and inotropic support (P&lt;0.001) with a longer&#xD;
           length of hospital stay (P&lt;0.002) compared with those with normal LVEF (9, 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Conduction system abnormalities following CABG are common (11, 12). The majority of&#xD;
           these abnormalities are transient and are often managed using temporary epicardial&#xD;
           pacing. Hence, all patients that undergo CABG receive epicardial leads as a&#xD;
           precautionary measure. These leads are placed on the right or left ventricle and the&#xD;
           right atrium. When patients are felt to no longer require these, they are removed&#xD;
           easily. The role of BiV pacing in this setting is unknown. Whether patients that have&#xD;
           left ventricular dysfunction would have improved post-operative mortality, less need for&#xD;
           intraaortic balloon pump and inotropic support, and shorter length of hospital stay is&#xD;
           unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives Our hypothesis is that BiV pacing immediately following CABG will improve&#xD;
           in-hospital outcomes in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary: -Length of ICU stay&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary: -In-hospital mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Length of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Duration of inotropic support&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Duration of intraaortic ballon pump support&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Duration of mechanical ventillation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change in stroke volume with biventricular pacing&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change in ventricular synchrony with biventricular pacing&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methodology All patients that are scheduled for CABG or valve surgery and meet the&#xD;
           inclusion criteria will be approached for consent pre-operatively. Once consent is&#xD;
           obtained the patient will be randomized into one of three treatment arms: usual care, RV&#xD;
           pacing, or BiV pacing. The patients will then undergo surgery as per routine. During&#xD;
           cardiovascular surgery patients routinely receive epicardial pacing leads that are&#xD;
           placed on the right or left ventricle and the right atrium. For the purposes of this&#xD;
           study, epicardial pacing leads will be placed on both the right and left ventricles as&#xD;
           well as the right atrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After surgery is completed, the patients will receive either usual care, RV pacing, or&#xD;
           BiV pacing depending upon their treatment arms. Intraoperative transesophageal&#xD;
           echocardiography (TEE) is routinely performed during cardiac surgery. If TEE is being&#xD;
           used in the subject images will be recorded with biventricular pacing, right ventricular&#xD;
           pacing and no pacing in the first 30 patients studied to quantify changes in vetricular&#xD;
           synchrony with biventricular pacing. Once the patient arrives in the SICU hemodynmic&#xD;
           monitoring will be performed as usual. All patients return from the operating room with&#xD;
           a pulmonary artery catheter. In the first 50 patients the stroke volume will be obtained&#xD;
           by thermodilution method using the pulmonary artery catheter in their assigned treatment&#xD;
           arm as well as following 2 minutes of right ventricular pacing and again following 2&#xD;
           minutes of biventricular pacing. Pacing will be continued in the assigned treatment arm&#xD;
           until all inotropic and intraortic ballon pump support has been weaned off. Crossover in&#xD;
           treatment arms is discouraged, but will be at the discretion of the treating physicians.&#xD;
           The epicardial pacing leads will be removed as per routine.&#xD;
