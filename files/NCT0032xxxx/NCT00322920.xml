  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of topotecan when&#xD;
      given weekly with cisplatin in patients with persistent, recurrent, or advanced stage&#xD;
      cervical cancer. Secondary purposes are to describe the toxicity profile in patients with&#xD;
      persistent, recurrent, or advanced stage cervical cancer treated with the combination of&#xD;
      topotecan when given weekly with cisplatin and to determine the response rate and time to&#xD;
      progression in patients with persistent, recurrent, or advanced stage cervical cancer treated&#xD;
      with the combination of topotecan when given weekly with cisplatin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with recurrent cervical cancer generally have limited options for cure.&#xD;
      Occasionally, radiation therapy may be utilized in localized recurrent disease with curative&#xD;
      intent; however, most patients are not candidates for curative therapy secondary to&#xD;
      disseminated disease, and thus are frequently treated with palliative chemotherapy. Initial&#xD;
      experiences with chemotherapy in this clinical setting demonstrated cisplatin to be an active&#xD;
      agent. Subsequent trials using combinations of cisplatin and ifosfamide or paclitaxel&#xD;
      demonstrated higher response rates compared to cisplatin alone but did not demonstrate an&#xD;
      improvement in overall survival. Topotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor that has been used&#xD;
      in the management of cervical and ovarian cancer. Several phase II studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      topotecan to be an active agent in cervical cancer. In an effort to ameliorate toxicity noted&#xD;
      with 3-5 day dosing regimens of topotecan, investigators have evaluated weekly dosing of&#xD;
      topotecan. Thus far, the toxicity of weekly topotecan dosing in cervical cancer has not been&#xD;
      evaluated. In this study, topotecan will be given weekly at escalating dose levels starting&#xD;
      at 2.0 mb/m2 with standard cisplatin at 50 mg/m2 every 21 days. This study will help to&#xD;
      determine acceptable dosing for the combination of weekly topotecan and cisplatin in patients&#xD;
      with persistent, recurrent, or advanced stage cervical cancer which can then be utilized in a&#xD;
      cohort of patients with cervical cancer in a phase II study.&#xD;
