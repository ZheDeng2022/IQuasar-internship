      Blockages in the blood vessels of the heart are the main cause of chest pain, heart attacks,&#xD;
      and sudden death. A cardiac catheterization, or injecting x-ray dye into the blood vessels of&#xD;
      the heart and taking pictures, is currently the best way of assessing these blockages. This&#xD;
      procedure, however, does not allow us to know what is happening inside the blockages. Some&#xD;
      blockages have a higher risk of &quot;rupturing&quot; and completely blocking of the blood vessel while&#xD;
      others are at low risk for doing this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood levels of different substances produced by the body have been shown to be associated&#xD;
      with a higher risk of having chest pain, a heart attack, or sudden death. There is also&#xD;
      evidence from studies in animals and tissues taken from humans during surgery that some of&#xD;
      these substances are made in the blockages themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to investigate whether a number of these substances are made in the blockages&#xD;
      and released into the bloodstream. We will do this by taking one tablespoon samples of blood&#xD;
      upstream and downstream of the blockages in the blood vessels of the heart. The samples will&#xD;
      be obtained by using a very thin catheter, or plastic tubing, that is about 1/3 the size of&#xD;
      the blood vessels of the heart. We will take samples from the tightest blockage found as well&#xD;
      as another, less tight, blockage and compare the two. We will also sample blood from the&#xD;
      tightest blockage after it is opened by doing an angioplasty. Finally, we will also take&#xD;
      pictures of the blockages studied using a very small ultrasound camera inserted into the&#xD;
      blood vessel. We will compare the levels of the substances measured with the features we see&#xD;
      on the pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope to learn if some or all of the substances measured can identify which blockages are&#xD;
      more at risk for rupturing and causing heart attacks and sudden death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who are entered into this study will already be having an angioplasty done. The&#xD;
      procedures needed for the study (sampling of blood and taking pictures with an ultrasound)&#xD;
      are already often, though not always, used in patients undergoing an angioplasty.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for &gt;&#xD;
      500,000 lives each year. Atherosclerosis is the underlying mechanism for unstable angina,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death. Luminal narrowing of the arteries caused by&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque encroachment causes the chronic ischemic manifestations of coronary&#xD;
      heart disease, whereas superimposition of thrombi over the plaques leads to acute coronary&#xD;
      syndromes. To date, angiography has been the method of choice of detecting arterial lesions.&#xD;
      However, this diagnostic technique, which approximately compares the degree of luminal&#xD;
      stenosis of arteries relative to its' segments, does not provide insight into the disease&#xD;
      state within the artery, and often fails to detect those lesions prone to thrombosis, often&#xD;
      referred to as 'vulnerable plaque'. Multiple invasive and non-invasive methods have been&#xD;
      employed in order to identify vulnerable plaque, usually by trying to image the plaque and&#xD;
      its morphology, however none has gained widespread use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elevation of several biochemical markers in the bloodstream has been associated with adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular events. Inflammation has been identified as a significant component of the&#xD;
      unstable atherosclerotic plaque. The inflammatory response seems to participate early in the&#xD;
      development of atherosclerosis and involves multiple pathways3. Indeed, many markers of&#xD;
      inflammation have now been shown to predict cardiovascular risk4-7 and recent studies have&#xD;
      shown that key inflammatory markers are synthesized within atherosclerotic lesions8-10.&#xD;
      Another process that appears to precede inflammation is oxidative stress. Increased cellular&#xD;
      oxidative stress may be the process that initiates much of the subsequent inflammation and&#xD;
      ultimately to development of the atherosclerotic process. Our preliminary data demonstrates&#xD;
      that oxidative stress is increased in patients with acute coronary syndromes and after&#xD;
      coronary stenting. The immune system is also activated in those with unstable atherosclerotic&#xD;
      plaque with well documented changes in the T cells11-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exciting new field of medicine is the application of systems approaches. One of these&#xD;
      systems approaches is metabolomics. Metabolomics is based on the use of NMR (and other&#xD;
      spectroscopic methods) and multivariate statistics for data analysis and interpretation. NMR&#xD;
      spectroscopy is based on the behavior of atoms placed in a static external magnetic field.&#xD;
      1H-NMR spectroscopy allows the simultaneous detection and quantification of thousands of&#xD;
      low-molecular-weight metabolites within a biologic fluid, resulting in the generation of an&#xD;
      endogenous profile that may be altered in disease to provide a characteristic &quot;fingerprint&quot;&#xD;
      of the disease process. It has been used clinically in the detection of ovarian cancer and&#xD;
      coronary artery disease13, 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this in mind, the difference in levels of oxidation and inflammatory markers, activated&#xD;
      leucocytes, and the metabolomic profile across an atherosclerotic lesion, that is the&#xD;
      translesional gradient, may be of clinical utility. An elevated translesional gradient of&#xD;
      inflammatory and oxidative markers, leucocyte activation, as well as a change in the&#xD;
      metabolomic profile, could be used to identify plaques prone to rupture. By implication, the&#xD;
      ability to simply and reliably identify such plaques would have profound clinical&#xD;
      consequences by either allowing placement of intracoronary stents in high-risk, but not yet&#xD;
      flow-limiting lesions that if left untreated would rupture and lead to an acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the translesional gradients of (a) markers of oxidative stress, and (b) inflammation,&#xD;
           and (c) activated leucocytes will be elevated across culprit lesions as opposed to&#xD;
           non-culprit lesions in the same individuals; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the translesional gradients of markers of oxidation, inflammation and leucocyte&#xD;
           activation will differ in plaques with high-risk morphologic appearance compared to&#xD;
           plaques with low-risk morphologic appearance, as assessed by intravascular ultrasound&#xD;
           (IVUS); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The metabolomic profile assessed by 1H-NMR spectroscopy will differentiate culprit and&#xD;
           non-culprit lesions as well as plaques that have high-risk and low-risk morphologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine and compare the translesional gradients of established markers of&#xD;
      oxidative stress, inflammation, and leucocyte activation across culprit lesions vs&#xD;
      non-culprit lesions in the same individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To compare the translesion gradients of markers of oxidation, inflammation and&#xD;
      leucocyte activation with plaque morphology as assessed by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To determine if a systems approach using 1H-NMR-based metabolomics can be used to&#xD;
      distinguish ruptured culprit and non-culprit lesions as well as plaques that have high-risk&#xD;
      and low-risk morphologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A comparison of the markers of oxidation, inflammation, and leucocyte activation in the&#xD;
           following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. A comparison will be made between the translesional marker gradients (distal level&#xD;
                - proximal level) of samples from the culprit lesion and non-culprit lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. A comparison will be made between levels (distal level - proximal level) to the&#xD;
                culprit lesion before and after angioplasty/stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A comparison of the markers of oxidation, inflammation, and leucocyte activation with&#xD;
           plaque morphologic indices as assessed by intravascular ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A comparison of 1H-NMR metabolomic spectra from culprit and non-culprit lesions as well&#xD;
           as plaques that have high-risk and low-risk plaque morphologies.&#xD;
