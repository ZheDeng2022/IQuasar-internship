      This is a Phase 1b clinical trial to assess the safety and tolerability of vaccination with&#xD;
      EC90 (KLH-FITC) and GPI-0100 (adjuvant) followed by treatment with EC17 (Folate-FITC) in&#xD;
      combination with low-dose cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-alpha) in patients with metastatic or&#xD;
      refractory cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: This is a Phase 1b, single-cohort study of FolateImmune in combination with&#xD;
      low-doses of the cytokines Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha).&#xD;
      FolateImmune treatment consists of subcutaneous vaccinations with EC90, a compound designed&#xD;
      to elicit an immune response (antibodies) to a dye called fluorescein (FITC), in combination&#xD;
      with GPI-0100 adjuvant (a drug intended to improve antibody production). Vaccination is&#xD;
      followed by treatment with EC17, a drug made by linking folate (a vitamin) with FITC.&#xD;
      Experimental evidence has shown that the folate vitamin receptor is over-expressed in many&#xD;
      human cancers. It is expected that EC17 will attach to cancer cells through the folate&#xD;
      vitamin receptor and that antibodies to FITC will recognize the cancer cell and mark it for&#xD;
      destruction by the body's immune system. Two drugs, IL-2 and IFN-alpha, will be administered&#xD;
      at low doses in combination with EC17 in order to boost the immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the safety of administering EC90 vaccine with GPI-0100 adjuvant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the safety of administering EC17 concurrent with IL-2 and IFN-alpha&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic or refractory cancer for which&#xD;
             there are no effective standard therapeutic options available, (Note: for patients&#xD;
             accrued at Southern Illinois University, a diagnosis of renal (i.e., kidney) carcinoma&#xD;
             is required.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent form (ICF)&#xD;
             prior to performing any study evaluation/procedures&#xD;

             2) have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to commencing treatment.&#xD;
             Patients are considered not of childbearing potential if they are surgically sterile&#xD;
             (they have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy) or they are postmenopausal (12 consecutive months of amenorrhea [lack of&#xD;
             menstruation])&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (If applicable) Have completed prior cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy or&#xD;
             immunotherapy or experimental therapy &gt; or = 30 days prior to the study enrollment,&#xD;
             and recovered form associated toxicities&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of &lt; or = 2, and an&#xD;
             anticipated life expectancy of at least 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have adequate hematologic function, as defined by an absolute or calculated neutrophil&#xD;
             count &gt; or = 1500/microL, platelet count &gt; or = 100000/microL, lymphocyte count &gt; or =&#xD;
             500/microL, and hemoglobin level &gt; or = 10 g/dL. Patients may not receive prophylactic&#xD;
             transfusion in order to qualify for trial eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have adequate renal function, as defined by a documented serum creatinine of &lt; or =&#xD;
             2.0mg/dL. Greater than &quot;1+&quot; proteinuria will require microscope evaluation and the&#xD;
             results discussed with the medical monitor prior to patient enrollment; or if serum&#xD;
             creatine is &gt;2.0, patient must have an actual or calculated 24-hour creatinine&#xD;
             clearance of &gt;60mL/min and no obvious evidence of concurrent medullary cystic disease&#xD;
             or obstructive uropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have adequate hepatic function, as defined by a total bilirubin level &lt; or = 1.5 x&#xD;

             and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels &lt; or = 2.5 x ULN. If alkaline phosphatase is&#xD;
             outside of these parameters and is due to bone metastases (as verified by the&#xD;
             assessment of isoenzymes), then the patient is eligible.&#xD;
