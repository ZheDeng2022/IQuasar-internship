      To obtain demographic and baseline ophthalmic parameters (such as Intraocular Pressure&#xD;
      profiles, disc morphological characteristics, central corneal thickness, peripapillary&#xD;
      retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and its serial changes, visual field changes, severity of&#xD;
      any medical associations-e.g. hypertension, migraine, strokes, silent cerebral infarcts) with&#xD;
      non-invasive measurements, in Chinese Patients with Normal Tension Glaucoma&#xD;

      This is a multi-centered non-interventional descriptive study. The Declaration of Helsinki is&#xD;
      followed. All procedures will be conducted in accordance with the GCP guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 100 Consecutive NTG glaucoma patients will be included in this study. NTG is defined&#xD;
      as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Six median untreated intraocular pressure consistently less than 21 mm Hg, with no more&#xD;
           than 1 reading = 23 mmHg or 24 mmHg, and with no single measurement greater than 24 mm&#xD;
           Hg,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Open drainage angles on gonioscopy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Typical optic disc damage with glaucomatous cupping and loss of neuroretinal rim,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Absence of any secondary cause for a glaucomatous optic neuropathy (trauma, steroids,&#xD;
           uveitis),&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Glaucomatous visual field defect compatible with glaucomatous optic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age and sex-matched normal control subjects and age, sex, severity-matched POAG control&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization not required as this will be a non-interventional descriptive study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete baseline ophthalmic assessment will be performed with Snellen visual acuity (VA),&#xD;
      Best-corrected VA, intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements, slit lamp examination,&#xD;
      gonioscopy, disc assessment and dilated fundal examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These measurements were performed at recruitment and then at 3,6,9,12 months after the&#xD;
      intervention. The details of some of these measurements were as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All IOP was measured with Goldmann applanation tonometry. The median of 5 readings were&#xD;
      taken. Gonioscopy was carried out first using a Goldmann 2-mirror gonioscope. The examination&#xD;
      was carried out at the lowest level of illumination that permitted a view of the angle and at&#xD;
      high magnification (×16 to ×25). A 1-mm light beam was reduced to a very narrow slit, and was&#xD;
      offset horizontally for assessing superior and inferior angles and vertically for nasal and&#xD;
      temporal angles. Care was taken to avoid light falling on the pupil during gonioscopy. Slight&#xD;
      tilting to gain a view over the convexity of the iris was permitted, but further manipulation&#xD;
      of the lens or redirection of gaze was avoided because of the possibility of exerting&#xD;
      pressure on the cornea and artificially widening the angle. The drainage angle was graded&#xD;
      according to Shaffer's convention in each quadrant. The average angle width was calculated by&#xD;
      adding the Shaffer grade in each quadrant and dividing by 4. Indentation gonioscopy using a&#xD;
      Posner lens was also used to detect PAS, and the number of clock hours of PAS was recorded.&#xD;
      All gonioscopy was performed by a single investigator for standardization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vertical CDR was taken to be the longest vertical cup diameter divided by the longest&#xD;
      vertical disc diameter. Estimates were made to the nearest 0.05. The vertical disc diameter&#xD;
      was examined. All features of a glaucomatous optic neuropathy were noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects underwent static automated white-on-white threshold perimetry (program 24- 2,&#xD;
      SITA standard, model 750, Humphrey Instruments, Dublin, CA), and the first reliable VF was&#xD;
      used in our analysis. The global indices mean deviation (MD), and pattern standard deviation&#xD;
      (PSD) were documented for all cases. After finding the proportion of VF that is reliable, the&#xD;
      VF was then scored using the tested scoring algorithm developed for the Advanced Glaucoma&#xD;
      Intervention Study (AGIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimal criteria for glaucomatous VF defect were as follows: glaucoma hemifield test outside&#xD;
      normal limits, pattern standard deviation with a P value of &lt;5%, or a cluster of ≥3 points in&#xD;
      the pattern deviation plot in a single hemifield (superior or inferior) with P value of &lt;5%,&#xD;
      one of which must have a P value of &lt;1%. Any one of the preceding criteria, if repeatable,&#xD;
      was considered sufficient evidence of a glaucomatous VF defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be verified by diurnal tension curve, which was recorded no more than one year&#xD;
      before inclusion in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic haemodynamics Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures (SBP, DBP, MAP) were&#xD;
      measured on the upper arm by an automated oscillometric device. Pulse rate (PR) and blood&#xD;
      oxygenation was automatically recorded from a finger pulse oximetric device (HP-CMS patient&#xD;
      monitor, Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP) A Median of 3 readings for each subject with&#xD;
      Goldmann applanation tonometer was used for each measurement of intraocular pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fundus Photography and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) A baseline fundus photo will be&#xD;
      performed for all participants. A baseline OCT for retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and&#xD;
      optic nerve head parameters will be determined. Serial changes of these parameters will be&#xD;
      correlated to VF indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic Contour Tonometry (DCT) and Ocular Response Analyzer (ORA) will also be performed on&#xD;
      these subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A history of the following systemic conditions was recorded: systemic hypertension (HT),&#xD;
      hypotension, ischemic heart disease (IHD), arrhythmia, diabetes mellitus (DM),&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia, cerebral vascular accidents (CVA), migraine, obstructive sleep apnea&#xD;
      (OSA), sensorineural hearing loss and Raynaud's phenomenon. All diagnoses were obtained from&#xD;
      the history and confirmed by the clinical management system of the Hong Kong Hospital&#xD;
      Authority, which is a computerized database connecting all public hospitals and clinics in&#xD;
      Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic use of statins, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors (ACEI),&#xD;
      calcium-channel-blockers, aspirin and diuretics was also noted.&#xD;
