  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of diabetes in adolescence presents significant difficulties due to&#xD;
      psychological and physiological factors. Blood glucose control deteriorates in this age group&#xD;
      and poor management threatens long-term health. Motivational Interviewing, a psychological&#xD;
      intervention designed to facilitate behaviour change, has recently been used with a small&#xD;
      group of teenagers, producing improved blood glucose control. To establish the impact of this&#xD;
      intervention and its key components, we plan to compare the outcome in several clinics over a&#xD;
      longer period of time in a larger number of adolescents selected at random to undergo&#xD;
      motivational interviewing or to act as a control group. If successful this approach has&#xD;
      potential to be incorporated into the routine clinical care of adolescents with diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes in adolescence is associated with deterioration in glycaemic control and self-care,&#xD;
      resulting in increased risk of long-term complications. Although psychosocial factors are&#xD;
      recognized as playing an important part in these changes and therefore in clinical&#xD;
      management, there are few indicators from research studies of practical, effective&#xD;
      interventions. Motivational interviewing is a counselling approach designed to facilitate&#xD;
      decision-making about behaviour change. It has been shown to be effective in a variety of&#xD;
      clinical settings, including diabetes care in an adult population. In a BDA-funded pilot&#xD;
      study of motivational interviewing with adolescents, our group has shown that the&#xD;
      intervention improves glycaemic control (glycosylated haemoglobin), at least in the&#xD;
      short-term. This study aims to replicate and extend the findings of the pilot study in a&#xD;
      multicentre, randomised, controlled trial over a longer intervention period with a larger&#xD;
      sample. The intervention will be monitored to facilitate analysis and description of key&#xD;
      components. Other psychological variables thought to be of significance in the self-care of&#xD;
      adolescents with diabetes will be measured. If the results indicate that this is a successful&#xD;
      intervention, the method has potential to be disseminated and applied within routine clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
