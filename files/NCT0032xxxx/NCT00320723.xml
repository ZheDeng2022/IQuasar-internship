      This proposal seeks to evaluate a pilot smoking cessation treatment program that will combine&#xD;
      nicotine replacement therapy with or without bupropion sustained-release (SR) with cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy for smoking cessation in patients with major mental illness.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy-four to 92% of patients with schizophrenia smoke cigarettes compared to 24% of the&#xD;
      adult US population and 18% of adults in Massachusetts (1-3). Patients with schizophrenia&#xD;
      also smoke more cigarettes on average per day (4) and attain higher serum levels of cotinine,&#xD;
      the primary metabolite of nicotine, a finding attributed to deeper smoke inhalation (5).&#xD;
      Cigarette smoking has been identified as the single most important source of preventable&#xD;
      morbidity and premature mortality in the general U.S. population for the last 29 years (6,&#xD;
      7). Compounded by the problem that patients with schizophrenia live a less healthy lifestyle&#xD;
      (8) and may be less likely to receive adequate routine and preventative medical care (9-12),&#xD;
      heavy smoking represents a significant and neglected public health problem for people with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia clearly have greater morbidity and early mortality&#xD;
      from 'natural causes' than people without schizophrenia (13-22) and are more likely to die&#xD;
      prematurely from cardiovascular or pulmonary disease (14, 19, 23-26). Women with&#xD;
      schizophrenia have been shown to have increased risk of premature death from cancer (24) and&#xD;
      previous studies showing lower mortality from cancer in patients with schizophrenia compared&#xD;
      to the general population have not been confirmed (14, 27, 28). Successful smoking cessation&#xD;
      programs for patients with schizophrenia could reduce this increased medical morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. A recent report of patterns of nicotine use in a cohort of 50 patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder underscores this point: the cohort had a mean age&#xD;
      of 47 years and mean age at onset of daily smoking of 20 years; 45.8% reported they currently&#xD;
      have a smoking related health problem; 95.8% had tried unsuccessfully to cut down on their&#xD;
      smoking; 70% had made a serious attempt to quit smoking (29). Smoking cessation programs for&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia have reported compliance rates as high as 80% (30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nicotinic receptors have been shown to be reduced in number in patients with schizophrenia&#xD;
      (31, 32) and heavy smoking in schizophrenia may be attributable to attempts to overcome this&#xD;
      deficit. Benefits of nicotine to patients with schizophrenia include reversal of some of the&#xD;
      specific cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia and antipsychotic treatment&#xD;
      [(33-37). Nicotine has been shown to improve learning, visual and spatial working memory,&#xD;
      attention, auditory sensory gating smooth pursuit eye movements and reaction time (38, 39).&#xD;
      The positive effects of chronic nicotine treatment appear to persist over time, and in some&#xD;
      studies, improvements in cognition with chronic nicotine treatment become more robust over&#xD;
      time (40). Smoking cessation in patients with schizophrenia is associated with increase in&#xD;
      positive symptoms (30). Treatment with atypical antipsychotics may enhance the effectiveness&#xD;
      of smoking cessation treatment (41-43). The mechanism of this effect is not known but may be&#xD;
      due to decreased extrapyramidal side effects, improved efficacy for negative symptoms or&#xD;
      effects on glutamatergic systems. Combination of NRT and antidepressant medication has been&#xD;
      shown to increase cessation rates over monotherapy with NRT (44) but not over antidepressant&#xD;
      medication alone (45).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a powerful aid to smoking cessation with well&#xD;
      established efficacy (46-49) in non-psychiatric patients and has been proposed as a potential&#xD;
      tool in increasing smoking harm reduction in persons unable to achieve smoking abstinence&#xD;
      (50). Smoking cessation outcomes in patients with schizophrenia using NRT have been extremely&#xD;
      variable. Ziedonis and colleagues used a range of doses of NRT administered by patch, gum or&#xD;
      combination in addition to CBT for up to 10 weeks in 24 patients with schizophrenia (51).&#xD;
      Twelve subjects completed the trial. The cessation rate was 13% at 6 months (51). In one&#xD;
      study, atypical antipsychotic agents, in combination with the nicotine transdermal patch,&#xD;
      have been shown to significantly enhance the rate of smoking cessation (55.6% in the atypical&#xD;
      agent group versus 22.2% in the typical group) (41). In this study the overall end of&#xD;
      treatment point prevalence smoking cessation rate in 45 patients with schizophrenia was 35%.&#xD;
      In another study of the acute effects of transdermal nicotine patch in psychiatric patients,&#xD;
      however, no patients quit smoking acutely, and only heavy smokers reduced their cigarette&#xD;
      consumption (52).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of NRT in patients with schizophrenia has only been evaluated on a very small scale.&#xD;
      One important trial examined the effects of a 21 mg nicotine patch on smoking behavior,&#xD;
      nicotine levels in blood and signs of toxicity in patients with schizophrenia (53). In this&#xD;
      crossover trial, 10 male veterans were monitored while wearing nicotine vs placebo patches.&#xD;
      The nicotine patch condition was associated with increased nicotine levels without signs of&#xD;
      toxicity and decreased CO levels in 80% of patients. No trials have reported worsening of&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms with NRT. Larger studies in which NRT is combined with behavioral&#xD;
      support are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NRT in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Component:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be outpatients who are clinically stable and currently in treatment for&#xD;
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Subjects will be recruited through referral from&#xD;
      case managers, residential treatment settings and outpatient treaters. Subjects must smoke&#xD;
      =1/2 pack per day of cigarettes and wish to quit smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive cognitive behavioral smoking cessation therapy&#xD;
      CBT) with nicotine patch (NRT) plus placebo or nicotine patch combined with bupropion SR.&#xD;
      Subjects who are unable to tolerate or who have a contraindication to treatment with zyban&#xD;
      may be enrolled to receive CBT and open label NRT alone. All subjects will receive a 12&#xD;
      session group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program designed for smoking cessation&#xD;
      treatment in patients with schizophrenia in addition to pharmacologic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation Component:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation component of this protocol involves monitoring patients for stability of&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms, serum levels of psychiatric medications, and medication side effects at&#xD;
      baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12 and 14 and degree of smoking reduction or cessation weekly during&#xD;
      the treatment intervention and at 6, 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, subjects will complete a demographic questionnaire. Prior to beginning&#xD;
      treatment, subjects will be evaluated for symptoms of psychosis, depression, anxiety, and&#xD;
      medication side effects with standard clinical rating scales that include the schedule for&#xD;
      assessment of negative symptoms (SANS), positive and negative symptom scale (PANSS), Hamilton&#xD;
      depression scale (HamD), Hamilton anxiety scale (HamA), abnormal involuntary movement scale&#xD;
      (AIMS), Simpson Angus Scale, and SAFTEE. A brief cognitive battery will include tests of&#xD;
      response inhibition (the single trial Stroop), vigilance (continuous performance test),&#xD;
      verbal fluency (FAS), verbal memory (California Verbal Learning Test), working memory (letter&#xD;
      number span), non-verbal memory (Benton visual retention test), psychomotor ability (grooved&#xD;
      peg board task), and executive functioning (trail making or tower of London). Baseline carbon&#xD;
      monoxide (CO) measurements will be used with self report to verify number of cigarettes&#xD;
      smoked per day. Serum will be drawn for cotinine and antipsychotic levels at baseline. Weight&#xD;
      will be checked at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will set a quit date between weeks 3 and 4. The evaluation battery will be repeated&#xD;
      at week 4 just following the quit date. It will also be repeated at week 12 when patients&#xD;
      discontinue the group and medication treatment. An evaluation that includes the clinical&#xD;
      battery and CO measurement will be performed at week 14, two weeks following termination of&#xD;
      smoking cessation treatment and at week 24. Subjects will also be contacted at 1 and 2 years&#xD;
      for follow up self report of tobacco use and CO measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increase availability of nicotine replacement therapy, which is not currently available&#xD;
           by prescription, to patients with major mental illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Train staff members with expertise in treating patients with major mental illness to be&#xD;
           Tobacco Treatment Specialists using the training protocol developed by University of&#xD;
           Massachusetts Medical School in collaboration with the Massachusetts Department of&#xD;
           Public Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Establish a network of centers able to deliver tobacco treatment to patients with major&#xD;
           mental illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate smoking cessation rates, smoking reduction rates and stability of psychiatric&#xD;
           symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder during a smoking&#xD;
           cessation attempt using cognitive behavioral therapy combined with NRT plus placebo and&#xD;
           NRT + bupropion SR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate safety of nicotine replacement therapy in patients with schizophrenia and&#xD;
           schizoaffective disorder when combined with antipsychotic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate safety of nicotine replacement therapy in patients with schizophrenia and&#xD;
           schizoaffective disorder when combined with bupropion SR and antipsychotic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nicotine replacement therapy combined with bupropion SR and cognitive behavioral therapy&#xD;
           will be associated with improvement in smoking cessation and smoking reduction rates&#xD;
           when compared to NRT alone added to CBT in patients with schizophrenia and&#xD;
           schizoaffective disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nicotine replacement therapy combined with bupropion SR will be associated with&#xD;
           improvement in negative symptoms, depression and impulsivity when compared to NRT alone&#xD;
           in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder who quit smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Concurrent treatment with atypical antipsychotic medications will further enhance the&#xD;
           effectiveness of NRT combined with bupropion SR and NRT plus placebo for smoking&#xD;
           cessation and reduction in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder&#xD;
           compared to concurrent treatment with conventional antipsychotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients with low baseline cotinine = 250 ng/ml will have higher cessation rates than&#xD;
           patients with high baseline cotinine &gt;250 ng/ml.&#xD;
