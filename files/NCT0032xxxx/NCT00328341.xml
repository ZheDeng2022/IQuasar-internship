  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is anticipated that the use of tissue oxygen monitoring to measure brain tissue oxygen and&#xD;
      deltoid muscle oxygen will provide more precise information about focal brain ischemia and&#xD;
      systemic hypoperfusion than current techniques and measures such as blood pressure, heart&#xD;
      rate and intracranial pressure. Understanding the relationship between tissue oxygen tension&#xD;
      collected from the brain and deltoid muscle in critically injured patients could lead to a&#xD;
      broader understanding of the important metabolic and cellular events that occur following&#xD;
      severe injury and the changes induced by therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, the use of&#xD;
      interventions designed to improve tissue hypoxia, as measured by low brain or muscle tissue&#xD;
      oxygen, may improve mortality or neurological recovery after systemic trauma or head trauma&#xD;
      compared to current approaches that do not involve tissue metabolic monitoring.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, cohort study designed to investigate metabolic changes&#xD;
      in the brain and deltoid muscle of injured patients. Study objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish critical, abnormal levels of tissue oxygen in the brain (PbrO2) and muscle&#xD;
           (PmO2) of injured patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate PbrO2 with other currently available diagnostic measures used in&#xD;
           head-injured patients, including ICP, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), CPP, SjO2, CT&#xD;
           findings, neurological examinations, and clinical outcomes from traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate PmO2 with base deficit measurements, standard physiologic variables, near&#xD;
           infra-red oxygen levels, infectious complications, and outcomes in critically injured&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will enroll patients with multisystem trauma including brain injury. In&#xD;
      addition to the results obtained from oxygen monitoring, other data collected prospectively&#xD;
      will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline Characteristics- mechanism of injury, arrival blood pressure and GCS, results&#xD;
           of imaging procedures, age, gender, blood gas analysis, injuries and injury severity,&#xD;
           and all operative procedures,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ICU Care - MAP, ICP, CPP, base deficit, oxygen saturation, CVP, cardiac output, GCS&#xD;
           scores, short-term outcome data, infectious complications and organ dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All physiological data will be downloaded automatically and continuously from the bedside&#xD;
      monitor, ventilator, and oxygen monitors via a study-dedicated computer and customized&#xD;
      software (Aristein Bioinformatics, Palo Alto, CA).&#xD;
