  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that currently affects as many as 1 out of 166&#xD;
      children in the United States. Autism is considered by many to be a permanent condition with&#xD;
      little hope for improvement. Treatment for autism is centered on special schooling and&#xD;
      behavioral therapy; medical science currently has little to offer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research has discovered that some autistic individuals have decreased blood flow to&#xD;
      the brain, evidence of inflammation in the brain, and increased markers of oxidative stress.&#xD;
      Multiple independent single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) research studies have revealed hypoperfusion to several areas of the&#xD;
      autistic brain, most notably the temporal regions and areas specifically related to language&#xD;
      comprehension and auditory processing. Several studies show that diminished blood flow to&#xD;
      these areas correlates with many of the clinical features associated with autism including&#xD;
      repetitive, self-stimulatory and stereotypical behaviors, and impairments in communication,&#xD;
      sensory perception, and social interaction. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been used&#xD;
      with clinical success in several cerebral hypoperfusion syndromes including cerebral palsy,&#xD;
      fetal alcohol syndrome, closed head injury, and stroke. HBOT can compensate for decreased&#xD;
      blood flow by increasing the oxygen content of plasma and body tissues and can even normalize&#xD;
      oxygen levels in ischemic tissue. In addition, animal studies have shown that HBOT has potent&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects and reduces oxidative stress. Furthermore, recent evidence&#xD;
      demonstrates that HBOT mobilizes stem cells from human bone marrow which may aid recovery in&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases. Based upon these findings, it is hypothesized that HBOT will&#xD;
      improve symptoms in autistic individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if HBOT improves clinical outcomes in children with&#xD;
      autism. The study will also determine if HBOT changes markers of inflammation and oxidative&#xD;
      stress in autistic children.&#xD;
