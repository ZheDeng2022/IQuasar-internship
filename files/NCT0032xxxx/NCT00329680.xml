      The scope of this clinical study is to evaluate the possible role of an enteral formulation&#xD;
      enriched with EPA, GLA and Antioxidants in patients diagnosed in the early stages of sepsis&#xD;
      despite mechanical ventilation requirements, as well as the impact of this diet upon glycemic&#xD;
      control and its capacity to prevent the development of sepsis into severe sepsis and septic&#xD;
      shock.&#xD;

      The effectiveness of nutritional support in modulating the chain of inflammatory response and&#xD;
      in reducing demands of the respiratory system through use of nutritional intervention has&#xD;
      received a growing attention, as a result of its capacity to interfere in a variety of&#xD;
      biological processes [1]. Nutritional formulations that are low in carbohydrates and rich in&#xD;
      lipids may reduce minute-ventilation and ventilatory demand, leading to a reduction of&#xD;
      respiratory coefficient and CO2 production [2]. Gadek et al. [3] used a high lipid enteral&#xD;
      diet enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA or fish oil), gamma-linolenic acid (GLA or&#xD;
      borage oil) and enhanced levels of antioxidant vitamins in patients with ARDS, demonstrating&#xD;
      a significant improvement, not only in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, but also in several outcomes such&#xD;
      as ventilator-free days, ICU-free days and reduced new organ dysfunctions. A recent clinical&#xD;
      trial demonstrated that the use of this type of diet may produce better outcomes also in&#xD;
      patients with acute lung injury (ALI) [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent pharmaceutical interventions proposed for sepsis have sought to focus on regulating&#xD;
      the chain of pro and anti-inflammatory mediators [5,6], responsible for causing the systemic&#xD;
      characteristics of the disease and, consequently, for leading to multiple organ failure. The&#xD;
      inflammatory reaction is capable of activate synthesis of lipid mediators, such as&#xD;
      prostaglandin E2, which are involved in the complex regulation of the inflammatory process&#xD;
      [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of these inflammatory mediators are metabolites of omega-6 fatty acids, such as linoleic&#xD;
      acid and the product of its elongation/desaturation, arachidonic acid [8]. Substitution of&#xD;
      Omega-6 fatty acids by fatty acids rich in Omega-3, such as EPA, has proved to be beneficial&#xD;
      in modulating the inflammatory processes both in animal models and in humans [9-17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interest has also grown around the potential metabolic effects of GLA. This oil is rapidly&#xD;
      lengthened to dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) and is incorporated into tissue lipids. DGLA&#xD;
      may, amongst other effects, suppress bio-synthesis of leukotrienes, being rapidly metabolized&#xD;
      to monoenoic prostaglandins [18]. In addition, although EPA allows the elongation of GLA into&#xD;
      DGLA, it tends to prevent its desaturation into arachidonic acid. This mechanism can produce&#xD;
      an increase in 1 series prostanoids and a decrease in 2 series eicosanoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research using animal models of sepsis-induced ARDS has shown that a diet low in&#xD;
      carbohydrates and rich in EPA and GLA may modulate the production of inflammatory mediators,&#xD;
      improving the functional capacity of the lungs. This type of diet is capable of rapidly&#xD;
      reducing the phospholipid fatty acid content of arachidonic acid in inflammatory cell&#xD;
      membranes [19], even if administered parenterally [20]. In animal models of sepsis, a diet&#xD;
      enriched with omega-3 fatty acids has been associated with reduced mortality [21-24].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, a recent study [25] demonstrated the beneficial effects of an enteral diet enriched&#xD;
      with EPA, GLA and elevated level of antioxidant vitamins, in patients with severe sepsis and&#xD;
      septic shock requiring mechanical ventilation. In this subpopulation of patients, the use of&#xD;
      an enteral formulation enriched with EPA, GLA and Antioxidants is associated with an&#xD;
      improvement in oxygenation status, reduced mechanical ventilation time, fewer days in ICU,&#xD;
      less new organ dysfunction and also with a 19.4% absolute risk reduction in mortality&#xD;
      (NNT=5). Since there is evidence in the literature pointing towards the anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      roles not only of EPA and GLA (26), but also of antioxidant vitamins alone (27-29), the&#xD;
      differences between both groups may be explained not just by the effects of EPA, GLA or&#xD;
      antioxidants, but also by a combination of them. Although this and the previously published&#xD;
      trials were designed to investigate the effect of this diet in patients with ARDS, certain&#xD;
      differences prove to be particularly relevant. First, the former study examines the effects&#xD;
      of such a diet in a population of ARDS patients constituted solely by patients with severe&#xD;
      sepsis or septic shock. Moreover, it enrolled patients with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio below 200,&#xD;
      rather than below 250, as occurred in the latter study. The heightened gravity of the&#xD;
      patients used may have contributed to the greater number of days requiring mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation and lower days outside ICU, when compared with previously published results.&#xD;
      Finally, this study allows only 6 hours from the moment at which patients fulfilled all entry&#xD;
      requirements to effective onset of diet, rather than 24 hours, leading to a significant&#xD;
      reduction in time necessary to achieve 75% of BEE x 1.3. Recent studies have shown that&#xD;
      time-dependence is a determinant aspect in the treatment of septic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For instance, the PROWESS study [5] showed a significant reduction in the mortality of severe&#xD;
      septic patients with a high APACHE II score and who were treated with recombinant human&#xD;
      activated protein C (rhAPC) in the first 48 hours after fulfillment of study entry criteria.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the ENHANCE study showed that septic patients who were treated with rhAPC in&#xD;
      the first 24 hours after meeting inclusion criteria had lower mortality than those patients&#xD;
      who were treated after 24 hours, but within the first 48 hours. The early use was also&#xD;
      associated with a lower consumption of hospital resources including mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      and the use of vasopressors [30]. Time-dependency was also associated with several other&#xD;
      recommendations for the management of septic patients [31].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another important finding from this recent trial is the number of patients who developed new&#xD;
      organ failures not observed at the baseline, considerably lower in the group that received&#xD;
      the study diet. This reduction demonstrates a trend towards lower evolution of multiple organ&#xD;
      dysfunction in patients fed with EPA+GLA+Antioxidants. If we consider that the development of&#xD;
      multiple organ dysfunctions is associated with increasing mortality rates, we can hypothesize&#xD;
      this may be a determining factor in reducing the mortality rate [32]. This also suggested&#xD;
      that this diet may develop an important role for patients in the early stages of sepsis, by&#xD;
      preventing the evolution of the disease to severe sepsis or septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are common in critically ill&#xD;
      patients, even when glucose homeostasis has previously been normal. Increased&#xD;
      gluconeogenesis, despite abundantly released, is probably central to this disruption of&#xD;
      glucoregulation [33,34]. Strict maintenance of normoglycemia with intensive insulin therapy&#xD;
      has been shown to reduce intensive care and hospital mortality and morbidity of critically&#xD;
      ill adult patients [35].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplements or tube feeding using standard nutritional formulations can significantly&#xD;
      compromise glycemic control [36-39], very probably due to the rapid and efficient absorption&#xD;
      of these liquids. This is specially relevant in those individuals with overt diabetes or&#xD;
      stress-related glucose intolerance, such as occurred in septic patients. In such individuals&#xD;
      the use of standard nutritional formulations may complicate attempts to achieve and maintain&#xD;
      normoglycemia. The answer for this matter may remain in the use of enteral diets high in&#xD;
      lipids and low in carbohydrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scope of this clinical study is to evaluate the possible role of an enteral formulation&#xD;
      enriched with EPA, GLA and Antioxidants in patients diagnosed in the early stages of sepsis&#xD;
      despite pulmonary failure, as well as the impact of this diet upon glycemic control and its&#xD;
      capacity to prevent the development of sepsis into severe sepsis and septic shock.&#xD;
