  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the addition of sunitinib malate&#xD;
      (SU011248) to hormone based castration is an effective treatment for shrinking or controlling&#xD;
      the tumor before having the prostate removed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sunitinib malate is designed to block pathways that control important events such as the&#xD;
      growth of blood vessels that are essential for the growth of cancer. Hormonal treatment is&#xD;
      used to lower testosterone levels in the body because prostate cancer cells need testosterone&#xD;
      to survive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have what are called &quot;screening&#xD;
      tests.&quot; These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this&#xD;
      study. Your complete medical history will be recorded. You will have a physical exam,&#xD;
      including measurement of vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and weight). Blood&#xD;
      (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. You will have a&#xD;
      computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, a bone scan, or a&#xD;
      chest x-ray to evaluate the status of your disease. You will be asked about any medications&#xD;
      or treatments you are currently taking. You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG - a test that&#xD;
      measures the electrical activity of the heart) and an echocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses&#xD;
      sound waves to make pictures of your heart, which helps show how well your heart pumps blood.&#xD;
      You will be asked to lie on your left side while a technician places a probe with gel on your&#xD;
      chest to create images of your heart to determine the function and size. Your ability to&#xD;
      perform daily activities will also be evaluated. You will have a bone marrow aspirate and&#xD;
      biopsy. To collect a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, an area of the hip or chest bone is&#xD;
      numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a&#xD;
      large needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take the sunitinib&#xD;
      malate by mouth 1 time a day for 30 days together with hormonal ablation therapy. You will&#xD;
      receive hormone injections to lower the levels of testosterone in the blood. Hormonal therapy&#xD;
      may be given either monthly for 3 months or in a single 3-month dose. Every 30 days is&#xD;
      considered a study &quot;cycle.&quot; You may receive up to 3 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle, you will have a physical exam and you will be asked about your&#xD;
      medical history. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. You will be asked&#xD;
      about any medications you have taken and any side effects you may have experienced. You will&#xD;
      be asked questions about your ability to perform daily activities (performance status&#xD;
      evaluation.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 15 of Cycle 1, you will be asked about any side effects you have experienced. Blood&#xD;
      (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing 3 cycles of treatment, you will have surgery to remove your prostate. The&#xD;
      surgery will occur 1-2 weeks after you receive the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the last dose of the study drug, you will have a follow-up visit. You will be asked&#xD;
      about any side effects you are experiencing and you will have a physical exam. You will also&#xD;
      have digital rectal exam. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. You will&#xD;
      also have an echocardiogram. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to make pictures of your&#xD;
      heart, which helps show how well your heart pumps blood. You will be asked to lie on your&#xD;
      left side while a technician places a probe with gel on your chest to create images of your&#xD;
      heart to determine the function and size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a follow-up visit, 28 days after you stop treatment. You will have a physical&#xD;
      exam and your complete medical history will be recorded. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be&#xD;
      drawn for routine tests. You will be asked about any medications you have taken and any side&#xD;
      effects you may have experienced. You will have a performance status evaluation. You will&#xD;
      have an echocardiogram if it was abnormal at your last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 3 months after your surgery, you will return for another follow-up visit. You will have&#xD;
      a physical exam and your complete medical history will be recorded. Blood (about 2 teaspoons)&#xD;
      will be drawn for routine tests. You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first year after surgery you will have a prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test&#xD;
      every 3 months. Two (2) years after surgery you will begin having PSA tests every 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Sunitinib malate has been authorized by the FDA for&#xD;
      research purposes only. About 64 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled&#xD;
      at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
