      This study looks at HIV-infected subjects who are on methadone treatment and medicines for&#xD;
      HIV.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a history of opiate abuse (IVDU) are not only a patient population that is&#xD;
      frequently difficult to reach by the healthcare system, but it also exhibits specific&#xD;
      problems in HIV-treatment (ART). These patients frequently have a chaotic lifestyle, which&#xD;
      makes it difficult to take medications regularly. Amongst the reasons for this are housing&#xD;
      difficulties, intoxication and substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of opiate substitution treatment can help to provide some structure and&#xD;
      certainty to patients. Even so IVDU patients are often started on ART later than others and&#xD;
      have a greater tendency to have treatment interruptions and sub-optimal adherence to ART. The&#xD;
      end result can be treatment failure and the development of drug resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an unmet medical need for ART regimens that make adherence easier and may be&#xD;
      suitable for co-administration with once-daily opiate substitution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The availability of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) 300 mg offers new options in the&#xD;
      creation of once-daily regimens with reduced potential for drug-drug-interactions. It is&#xD;
      believed that it is now possible to construct viable once daily HIV treatment regimens for&#xD;
      patients who have either never received prior therapy or who have no history of drug&#xD;
      resistance. Tenofovir DF is administered as a single 300 mg tablet once daily with food for&#xD;
      the treatment of HIV infection. This once daily dosing schedule of tenofovir DF makes it an&#xD;
      attractive option for simplified dosing regimens in many subjects, including&#xD;
      methadone-maintained individuals infected with HIV. Because many opiate-maintained subjects&#xD;
      are required to have their methadone dosing directly observed in the clinic, there is&#xD;
      considerable interest in using directly-observed therapy (DOT) in such subjects. Given that&#xD;
      tenofovir is eliminated renally and methadone is predominantly hepatically metabolized, the&#xD;
      potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction is low. However, other antiretroviral agents with&#xD;
      substantial renal elimination such as didanosine and stavudine have been shown to interact&#xD;
      pharmacokinetically with methadone. Thus, it is important to demonstrate that tenofovir DF&#xD;
      and methadone can be administered together safely and without concern for a pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      interaction and/or alterations in the efficacy, safety, or tolerability of methadone&#xD;
      maintenance such that dose modifications would be required. This can also be influenced by&#xD;
      the other products in the combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV/HBV coinfection is a frequent issue in this population (&gt; 20%). Treatment with TDF, which&#xD;
      is active against HBV, could help to stabilize the chronic HBV infection, even in cases with&#xD;
      Lamivudine-resistance.&#xD;
