  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter occur frequently after most&#xD;
      types of cardiac surgeries.(1-4) Postoperative AF is associated with significant morbidity,&#xD;
      longer hospital stay, and higher related costs. Currently, it is common procedure to&#xD;
      premedicate patients with antiarrhythmic drugs for elective cardiac surgeries. Treatments&#xD;
      such as beta blockers, Amiodarone, and electrical pacing are used to help prevent the&#xD;
      morbidity associated with pot-operative AF.(5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation may contribute to AF. Several clinical trials have&#xD;
      suggested that inhibitors of this system may reduce the incidence of AF.(6-12) Patients with&#xD;
      AF are known to have increased levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and some types&#xD;
      of angiotensin receptors.(13-15) Data from animal studies performed by our group suggest that&#xD;
      cardiac ACE overexpression may lead to arrhythmic ion channel changes.(16;17) Although not&#xD;
      studied in this group yet, it would be reasonable to conclude that the use of ACE inhibitors&#xD;
      and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) would decrease the incidence of AF in post-operative&#xD;
      patients, too&#xD;

      2.0 Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the discussion above, we hypothesize that patients premedicated on ACE Inhibitors&#xD;
      and ARBs will have a decreased incidence of post-operative AF or atrial flutter. This study&#xD;
      will be a retrospective cohort analysis of all patients that underwent elective cardiac&#xD;
      surgeries between 2000-2005 at Emory University Hospital, Crawford Long Hospital, or the&#xD;
      Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center to evaluate the relationship of pre-operative ACE&#xD;
      inhibitor or ARB use to the incidence of post-operative atrial arrhythmias.. This study is&#xD;
      undertaken in preparation for a funding proposal for a prospective trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 Patient Selection 3.1 Eligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. All patients that patients who underwent elective cardiac surgery in the Emory University&#xD;
      Hospital, Crawford Long Hospital, or the VA Medical Center between 2000-2005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Ineligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Emergent operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The presence of AF or atrial flutter at the time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients without adequate documentation of atrial rhythm following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV heart failure at the time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Hyperthyroidism&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Implanted devices for designed for active management of atrial arrhythmias by pacing or&#xD;
           defibrillation&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Known illicit drug use&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Known ethanol abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Electrophysiological ablation for atrial tachycardia within 6 months of the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 Registration and randomization: none&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 Therapy: none&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0 Pathology: none&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.0 Patient assessment: none&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.0 Data collection: Data will be collected from review of the patient's hospital charts,&#xD;
      from telemetry recordings, and ECGs to document the presence or absence of AF or atrial&#xD;
      flutter during the hospital admission for cardiac surgery. The presence or absence of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation will be diagnosed on the basis of an electrocardiographic recording and&#xD;
      confirmed by a cardiologist. Demographic data collected will include: age, race, sex, body&#xD;
      mass index, blood pressure, NYHA classification, Killip classification, and the history of&#xD;
      previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, alcohol use, antiarrhythmic&#xD;
      drug use, presence and type of pacemaker if any, history of AF or atrial flutter, previous&#xD;
      cardiovascular events, type of operation, and length of operation. Patients enrolled in this&#xD;
      study will be given unique study numbers. No follow up data will be required from patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.0 Statistical considerations: This study design is a retrospective chart review of a cohort&#xD;
      of patients undergoing cardiac surgery to determine if there is an association between&#xD;
      pre-operative ARB or ACE inhibitor use and the incidence of post-operative atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation or atrial flutter. The null hypothesis is that there is no association between&#xD;
      the preoperative use of ACE Inhibitors and ARBs and postoperative AF and atrial flutter.&#xD;
      Within the cohort, those patients with AF or atrial flutter will be compared to those without&#xD;
      these atrial arrhythmias in the post-operative period. Baseline data for the two groups will&#xD;
      be expressed as mean Â± standard deviation for continuous variables, and frequencies for&#xD;
      categorical variables. Differences in baseline characteristics between the groups will be&#xD;
      examined by use of Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney tests for categorical and continuous&#xD;
      variables, respectively. Quantification of any association between pre-operative ACE&#xD;
      Inhibitors and ARBs and the presence of atrial fibrillation will modeled by logistical&#xD;
      regression analysis after adjusting for other variables that may affect arrhythmia frequency.&#xD;
