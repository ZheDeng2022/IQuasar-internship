      This study will attempt to examine whether Levetiracetam (Keppra (TM)) can help people with&#xD;
      alcohol dependence cut down on their alcohol consumption. In addition, the investigation will&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness of Keppra on reducing withdrawal symptoms post alcohol cessation.&#xD;
      Matched group of historical controls of alcohol dependent patients receiving placebo will be&#xD;
      used for comparison.Based on the mechanism of action of Keppra we hypothesize that it may be&#xD;
      effective in promoting abstinence and reducing drinking behavior in alcohol dependent&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcoholism is a chronic disease with numerous psychological, social and medical consequences.&#xD;
      Alcohol use disorders are one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in general&#xD;
      population in the US. Alcoholism not only disrupts an individual's life, health and ability&#xD;
      to function in the society, has tremendous impact on families and communities, but also is&#xD;
      associated with enormous economic cost for society. The medical and social impact of&#xD;
      alcoholism can be reduced via effective treatments. Although medical, psychological and&#xD;
      social approaches have demonstrated some efficacy, no specific method has consistently shown&#xD;
      superiority. Similarly, currently available pharmacological treatments for alcohol use&#xD;
      disorders are associated with moderate efficacy, indicating that further efforts are required&#xD;
      to develop novel interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rewarding effects of alcohol are at least partially mediated via dopamine pathways that&#xD;
      originate in the ventral tegmental area and project to the nucleus accumbens. Alcohol through&#xD;
      its effects on GABA receptor activity decreases the inhibitory effect of GABA on the&#xD;
      dopaminergic neurons in ventral tegmental area and therefore facilitates dopamine&#xD;
      neurotransmission. Medications that modulate excitatory neurotransmission in the brain&#xD;
      (glutamate) and facilitate inhibitory effects of GABA have been shown to be clinically&#xD;
      effective in treatment of alcoholism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keppra is a novel antiepileptic medication currently approved for treatment of partial onset&#xD;
      seizures as an adjunctive agent. It has a unique mechanism of action in that it reduces&#xD;
      negative allosteric effects of Zn++ and Beta- carboline in two main inhibitory receptors in&#xD;
      the CNS- the GABA A and glycine receptors. These modulators inhibit the influx of chloride&#xD;
      though both of these receptor complexes and are therefore considered excitatory mediators.&#xD;
      Keppra prevents the negative modulation and promotes chloride flux, thereby, inhibiting&#xD;
      neurotransmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limited laboratory work with levetiracetam (Keppra) has shown that the medication can reverse&#xD;
      the anxiogenic effect of benzodiazepine withdrawal in mice (Y. Lamberty et al., 2002).&#xD;
      Furthermore, Keppra was investigated for its potential to prevent alcohol withdrawal symptoms&#xD;
      in mice. In this study levetiracetam dose-dependently prevented spontaneous tremors and&#xD;
      handling induced convulsions in alcohol dependent mice. (Y. Lamberty et al., 2002). Based on&#xD;
      the mechanism of action of Keppra we hypothesize that it may be effective in promoting&#xD;
      abstinence and reducing drinking behavior in alcohol dependent patients.&#xD;
