  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that adding functional strength training&#xD;
      to UK conventional therapy improves muscle function and walking than either UK conventional&#xD;
      therapy alone or increased intensity of UK conventional therapy&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular weakness occurs frequently after stroke and the processes underlying recovery&#xD;
      are still poorly understood. Accepted practice in UK physiotherapy is to avoid training of&#xD;
      muscle strength after stroke but there is preliminary evidence that it might be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An observer-blind randomised clinical trial. Subjects will be within 3 months of first stroke&#xD;
      with some voluntary movement in the paretic lower limb. A power calculation estimated the&#xD;
      sample size as 300. Research Physiotherapists, blinded to measurement, will recruit subjects,&#xD;
      allocate subjects to one of the three intervention groups using sequentially numbered sealed&#xD;
      envelopes containing previously randomised allocated intervention cards and provide&#xD;
      interventions. The Research Assessors, blinded to intervention allocation will undertake all&#xD;
      measurements. Conventional therapy (control) will be provided as normal for the clinical&#xD;
      setting, the additional conventional therapy (experimental 1) or functional strength training&#xD;
      (experimental 2) will be provided for one hour, four times a week, for six weeks. Subjects in&#xD;
      the two experimental groups will also receive the conventional therapy standard in their&#xD;
      clinical setting. Blinded measurement will be made before randomisation, at the end of&#xD;
      intervention and 12-weeks thereafter. Primary outcomes are maximum torque around the knee&#xD;
      joint, and gait velocity. The secondary outcomes include movement analysis, functional&#xD;
      ability, corticospinal transmission (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and health related&#xD;
      quality of life (Euroqol). The primary analysis will be analysis of covariance. A multiple&#xD;
      comparison procedure (Gabriel's test) will be used to compare each pair of treatments.&#xD;
      Euroqol data will be used to estimate the relative costs of the interventions and to&#xD;
      calculate the incremental cost per QUALY gained. Every effort will be made to invite patients&#xD;
      for assessment at outcome and follow-up even if they have withdrawn from therapy to allow the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat principle to be applied.&#xD;
