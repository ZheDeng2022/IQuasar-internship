      This study will examine whether mitochondrial function is impaired in patients with bipolar&#xD;
      disorder. Mitrochondria are small organelles inside the cell that are responsible for energy&#xD;
      production. Recent studies in animals and humans suggest that abnormalities of mitrochondria&#xD;
      may be involved in bipolar depression. The study will also examine whether the food&#xD;
      supplement Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) improves mitochondrial function and symptoms such as&#xD;
      depressed mood, low energy, anxiety or slowness in thinking and movements in bipolar&#xD;
      patients. CoQ10 has been used to increase cell energy production and as an antioxidant. It&#xD;
      has had some benefit in patients with Parkinson's disease and migraine and in prolonging&#xD;
      survival in patients with cancer and heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18-65 years of age with bipolar disorder who are currently in a depressive episode&#xD;
      of at least 4 weeks duration may be eligible for this study. The study has four phases, as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Medication Withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients taper off all psychotropic medications, usually over 1 to 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Baseline Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being off all medication for about 2 weeks, patients undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The two&#xD;
           procedures are performed in an MRI scanner. Both tests use a strong magnetic field and&#xD;
           radio waves to obtain images that provide information on brain anatomy and chemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to assess mitochondrial function isolated from blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin biopsy for tests of mitochondria. A small sample of skin tissue 5 x 5 millimeters&#xD;
           is surgically removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III: Administration of CoQ10 or Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to take either CoQ10 or placebo (an inactive look-alike&#xD;
      substance) twice a day by mouth. While taking the study medication, patients have the&#xD;
      following procedures periodically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rating scales for anxiety and depression and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check of vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine sample collections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase IV: Study Completion&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 8 weeks of treatment, patients have a physical examination and&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, and the procedures in phase II are repeated. Participants may then receive&#xD;
      short-term treatment (up to 12 weeks) with medications for bipolar depression, followed by&#xD;
      referred to a community physician for long-term treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bipolar affective disorder is a common, severe, chronic and often life-threatening illness.&#xD;
      The depressive phase contributes to the majority of morbidity and mortality in this illness.&#xD;
      Impairments in physical and social functioning resulting from depression are often as severe&#xD;
      as other chronic medical illnesses. Few of the treatments in use have resulted from an&#xD;
      understanding of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. Undoubtedly, a greater&#xD;
      understanding of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder will lead to improved treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current theories of depression suggest that mood disorders are associated with impairments of&#xD;
      cellular resilience and structural plasticity possibly a result of abnormal cellular energy&#xD;
      metabolism. Studies with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) in bipolar subjects show&#xD;
      reduced brain intracellular pH and reduced ATP. Cellular energy generated by mitochondrial&#xD;
      oxidative phosphorylation from glucose via the electron transport chain is stored as ATP,&#xD;
      which provide neurons and glia with energy required to maintain their function. Mitochondrial&#xD;
      dysfunction and its inability to compensate for increase in ATP demand might lead to impaired&#xD;
      cellular resilience believed to be involved in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder.&#xD;
      Abnormal regulation of nuclear genes coding for mitochondrial proteins in the hippocampus of&#xD;
      bipolar subjects provides further evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an essential cofactor in the mitochondrial electron transport chain&#xD;
      necessary for cellular energy generation. Exogenous administration of CoQ10 attenuates ATP&#xD;
      depletion and has anti-oxidant properties. In light of the above evidence, we hypothesize&#xD;
      that bipolar disorder is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction as evidenced by impaired&#xD;
      brain energy metabolism and that administration of CoQ10, a mitochondrial enhancer, will&#xD;
      restore mitochondrial function. To accomplish these objectives, we will compare mitochondrial&#xD;
      functions in bipolar depressed subjects to 26 healthy controls matched for age, gender and&#xD;
      BMI. Measures of mitochondrial function will include brain lactate levels (a product of&#xD;
      anaerobic glycolysis) with H+ MRS, 2) assays of mitochondrial function in cultured&#xD;
      fibroblasts and platelets, and 3) gene expression of mitochondrial and nuclear genes using a&#xD;
      cDNA Microarray. Further, subjects with bipolar depression, ages 18 to 65 will be randomized&#xD;
      to either CoQ10 (300-1200 mg/day) or placebo in a double-blind placebo controlled trial for a&#xD;
      period of 8 weeks. Measures of mitochondrial function will be compared between subjects&#xD;
      randomized to placebo or CoQ10 at baseline and at the end of the 8-week trial.&#xD;
