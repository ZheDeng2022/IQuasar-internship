  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A four-level triage scale (the Geneva Emergency Triage Scale, GETS) has been used since 1997&#xD;
      in our emergency department (ED). A recent evaluation of this scale showed that our&#xD;
      instrument had an excellent intra-rater reliability but insufficient inter-rater reliability.&#xD;
      We also observed a wide variability in the way triage nurses perform (J Clin Epidemiology,&#xD;
      2006 in press). These variations in the triage process are mainly explained by a poor&#xD;
      standardization of vital signs measurement. Therefore, we have recently modified our triage&#xD;
      instrument and introduced explicit criteria for vital signs evaluation during the triage&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the inter- and intra-rater reliability of our modified triage scale using a&#xD;
           computer simulator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the impact of visual clues on the triage decisions when using the triage&#xD;
           simulator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the performance of triage nurses and chief physicians in their triage&#xD;
           decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to observe:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an improvement of the inter-rater reliability of our instrument compared to the previous&#xD;
           version&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a better standardization and more systematic use of vital signs measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a higher reliability when visual clues are given to the evaluator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lower rates of under- and over-estimation of emergency levels.&#xD;
