  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability to diagnose and surgically repair poorly functioning heart valves has yielded a&#xD;
      significant population of women that are of childbearing age with mechanical/ bioprosthetic&#xD;
      heart valves. The clinical management of pregnant women with artificial heart valves during&#xD;
      pregnancy has been difficult. Currently there have not been any controlled clinical trials to&#xD;
      provide guidelines for a safe and effective anticoagulation. Current review of the literature&#xD;
      has shown that oral anticoagulation with warfarin has been implicated to cause significant&#xD;
      fetal morbidity including prematurity, decreased birth weight, birth defects (i.e.:&quot;warfarin&#xD;
      embryopathy&quot;), abortions, still birth and neonatal mortality. Warfarin embryopathy refers to&#xD;
      characteristic anomalies (nasal hypoplasia, eye defects, hypoplasia of extremities, deafness,&#xD;
      mental and developmental retardation), that may occur when coumadin is used during first&#xD;
      trimester and/or if used in doses &gt;5mg per day during pregnancy. It has also been reported&#xD;
      that intravenous and subcutaneous heparin has not been sufficiently effective in lowering&#xD;
      maternal morbidity and mortality. Thromboembolic events, valve dysfunction leading to&#xD;
      peripartum valve replacements, and maternal death have all been observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the outcome of pregnancy in women with mechanical/bioprosthetic heart valves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the risks posed to both mother and fetus during treatment with various methods&#xD;
           of anticoagulation during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will be conducted in three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians who respond to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: A questionnaire asking physicians whether they have cared for a patient with&#xD;
      prosthetic heart valve after year 1990 will be mailed, faxed or e-mailed to all members of&#xD;
      the Society of Maternal Fetal Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Responding physicians will provide information for the investigators to contact&#xD;
      their patients and obtain a telephone/signed consent form (approved by the LBMMC IRB) to&#xD;
      participate in the study and release their medical records to the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Data will be collected by the investigators/research nurse by reviewing medical&#xD;
      records and interviewing referring physicians and the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the information may not have immediate benefit to the subject, the data collected&#xD;
      may help the medical community develop a more effective guideline of selection of prosthetic&#xD;
      valves in women in the childbearing age and care of patients with prosthetic heart valves&#xD;
      during pregnancy.&#xD;

      Title of Project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Maternal and Fetal Outcomes in Pregnancies in Women with Prosthetic Heart&#xD;
      Valves&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims and Purpose of this Descriptive Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the outcome of pregnancy in women with mechanical/bioprosthetic heart valves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the risks posed to both mother and fetus during treatment with various methods&#xD;
           of anticoagulation during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and Expected Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with prosthetic heart valves in pregnancy constitute an extremely high risk group&#xD;
      with adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. The study is expected to review and possibly&#xD;
      guide anticoagulation issues, and the risks associated with various therapeutic options, i.e.&#xD;
      coumadin vs. unfractionated heparin vs. low molecular weight heparin. In addition, the study&#xD;
      will provide information and possibly suggest an optimal way to manage such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to diagnose and surgically repair poorly functioning heart valves has yielded a&#xD;
      significant population of women that are of childbearing age with mechanical/ bioprosthetic&#xD;
      heart valves. The clinical management of pregnant women with artificial heart valves during&#xD;
      pregnancy has been difficult. Currently there have not been any controlled clinical trials to&#xD;
      provide guidelines for a safe and effective anticoagulation. Current review of the literature&#xD;
      has shown that oral anticoagulation with warfarin has been implicated to cause significant&#xD;
      fetal morbidity including prematurity, decreased birth weight, birth defects (i.e.: &quot;warfarin&#xD;
      embryopathy&quot;), abortions, still birth and neonatal mortality. Warfarin embryopathy refers to&#xD;
      characteristic anomalies (nasal hypoplasia, eye defects, hypoplasia of extremities, deafness,&#xD;
      mental and developmental retardation), that may occur when coumadin is used during first&#xD;
      trimester and/or if used in doses &gt;5mg per day during pregnancy. It has also been reported&#xD;
      that intravenous and subcutaneous heparin has not been sufficiently effective in lowering&#xD;
      maternal morbidity and mortality. Thromboembolic events, valve dysfunction leading to&#xD;
      peripartum valve replacements, and maternal death have all been observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Females with prosthetic heart valve/s who became pregnant after their surgical valve&#xD;
           replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete medical information (medical history, surgical history, medication history,&#xD;
           prosthetic heart valve information, anticoagulation history, obstetrical history,&#xD;
           delivery history, fetal outcome, complications) obtained from patients' records and/or&#xD;
           patients' physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in whom sufficient information cannot be obtained from either medical records&#xD;
           or physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who do not give written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will be conducted in three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians who respond to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: A questionnaire asking physicians whether they have cared for a patient with&#xD;
      prosthetic heart valve after year 1990 will be mailed, faxed or e-mailed to all members of&#xD;
      the Society of Maternal Fetal Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Responding physicians will provide information for the investigators to contact&#xD;
      their patients (spouse/next to kin if the patient is deceased), and obtain a telephone/signed&#xD;
      consent form (approved by the LBMMC IRB) to participate in the study and release their&#xD;
      medical records to the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Data will be collected by the investigators by reviewing medical records and&#xD;
      interviewing referring physicians and the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that the patient cannot authorize informed consent due to death, lost to&#xD;
      follow-up, or other incapacitating illness, and next of kin cannot be reached, the primary&#xD;
      doctor will be asked to provide necessary, relevant medical records without disclosure of the&#xD;
      patient's identity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters used for assessment of patients' demographics as well as maternal and fetal&#xD;
      outcome are included in the enclosed form (Form 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone interviews, if needed, will be done at the patient's convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Storage and Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research data will be stored at our office. All information that is obtained in connection&#xD;
      with this study will remain confidential. If the results of this study are published or&#xD;
      presented at meetings, the identity of the subjects will not be disclosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefits to the Subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the information may not have immediate benefit to the patient, the data collected&#xD;
      may help the medical community develop a more effective guideline of selection of prosthetic&#xD;
      valves in women in the childbearing age and care of patients with prosthetic heart valves&#xD;
      during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic Alternatives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alternative is not to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study could provide information regarding maternal and fetal risks associated with&#xD;
      pregnancy in women with prosthetic heart valves. This information will be useful for risk&#xD;
      assessment prior to pregnancy as well as for management of patients during pregnancy,&#xD;
      especially in regard to most appropriate anticoagulation.&#xD;
