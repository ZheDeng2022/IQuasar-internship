      Although Standard of Care for Hip Fractures is the Device (Dynamic Hip Screw) being studied&#xD;
      in this project, and both sizes (the 2 and the 4 hole versions) are currently in use there is&#xD;
      not widespread agreement yet whether there is an optimal number of screws (2 or 4) required&#xD;
      for the best outcomes. If it can be shown that a 2 hole version is just as successful in&#xD;
      outcomes it would allow for a smaller incision (surgical cut) at the site of the fracture.&#xD;
      This could reduce soft tissue dissection, operating time, and surgical blood loss. This in&#xD;
      turn would reduce post operative pain, blood loss, and hospital length of stay.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to prospectively evaluate the clinical results of a two-hole&#xD;
      versus four-hole dynamic hip screw in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that over 27,000 hip fractures occur in Canada each year, at an estimated&#xD;
      cost of $10,000 per patient per hospitalization. Intertrochanteric hip fractures account for&#xD;
      approximately half of all hip fractures. While many surgical treatment options exist, the&#xD;
      accepted standard fixation device for the treatment of both stable and unstable&#xD;
      intertrochanteric hip fractures is the dynamic hip screw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No consensus exists regarding the optimal number of screws required for adequate side plate&#xD;
      fixation for the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures. The most commonly used device is&#xD;
      the 135-degree four-hole side plate, however, decreasing the length of the side plate would&#xD;
      theoretically allow for a smaller incision site, minimal soft-tissue dissection, shortened&#xD;
      operating time, and reduced operative blood loss. This in turn would reduce post-operative&#xD;
      pain, blood loss, and length of hospital stay. With the majority of hip fractures occurring&#xD;
      in the frail, elderly population, a less invasive procedure potentially decreases overall&#xD;
      patient mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomechanical studies simulating stable and unstable intertrochanteric fractures have&#xD;
      suggested that fewer screws are adequate for good side plate fixation. Two clinical trials&#xD;
      have reviewed series of fractures treated with a two-hole DHS and have reported favorable&#xD;
      results. No prospective randomized study to date, however, has directly compared the clinical&#xD;
      results of the standard four-hole plate with that of the two-hole plate. We propose a study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the clinical results of the two-hole versus four-hole plate for the treatment&#xD;
      of intertrochanteric fractures with a minimum 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's aim is to develop clinical outcome data which can be used (a) determine range of&#xD;
      expected clinical outcomes resulting from current standard management of these injuries, and&#xD;
      (b) as the basis of reporting on the clinical outcomes of these injuries in the peer-reviewed&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients over the age of 65 who have sustained an isolated 2-, 3-, and 4-part&#xD;
      intertrochanteric hip fractures will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have Pathological, subtrochanteric, reverse obliquity fractures, multiple&#xD;
      injuries, and patients whose time to the operating room exceeds 48 hours will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure to be assessed is mechanical failure of fixation. Secondary&#xD;
      variables to be assessed during the hospital stay are: length of incision, post-operative&#xD;
      pain, analgesic use, operative time, and mean hemoglobin drop. Length of hospital stay and&#xD;
      medical complications will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will subsequently be followed at six weeks, 3 months, and six months post-operatively in&#xD;
      clinic with a physical exam and a pelvis and hip radiograph, and an inquiry will be made as&#xD;
      to their general medical condition and any significant medical complications since discharge.&#xD;
      A functional inquiry and quality of life score will be administered pre-operatively and at&#xD;
      each subsequent clinic visit.&#xD;
