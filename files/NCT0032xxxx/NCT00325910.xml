      To conduct a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a large randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) of metformin in patients with heart failure and type 2 diabetes and to generate initial&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality estimates in this patient population. The primary hypothesis is that&#xD;
      subjects with heart failure and type 2 diabetes who receive metformin will have a significant&#xD;
      reduction in the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalization as&#xD;
      compared to subjects who receive placebo therapy.&#xD;

      Background: Heart failure (HF) is a common complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus. There&#xD;
      are limited treatment options for patients with HF and diabetes. Although metformin is&#xD;
      considered a safe and effective medication, it is currently not recommended in patients who&#xD;
      have HF due to a perceived increased risk of lactic acidosis. There is increasing evidence to&#xD;
      suggest that HF does not predispose patients to increased risk of metformin induced lactic&#xD;
      acidosis. Moreover, recent observational research has shown that metformin may be associated&#xD;
      with reduced morbidity and mortality in diabetic HF patients as compared to sulfonylurea&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Purpose: To conduct a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a large randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) of metformin in patients with heart failure and type 2 diabetes and to&#xD;
      generate initial morbidity and mortality estimates in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A multi-centre prospective triple blinded randomized placebo controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) design. Subjects will be recruited through specialist clinics (e.g., heart failure&#xD;
      clinics, diabetes clinics), inpatient hospital admissions/emergency room visits and physician&#xD;
      referrals in the Capital Health Region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: All subjects with physician-diagnosed symptomatic heart failure (NYHA class I, II,&#xD;
      III, IV) and type 2 diabetes are eligible for the study. All subjects with the following&#xD;
      conditions will be excluded from the study: subjects currently receiving greater than 1500 mg&#xD;
      of metformin therapy per day; subjects who are unwilling to change their antidiabetic&#xD;
      regimens; subjects receiving insulin therapy; serum creatinine ≥ 180 μmol/L; A1c &lt; 7.0&#xD;
      percent; inability to communicate (language barrier); dementia/mental illness; age &lt; 18&#xD;
      years; subjects unwilling to complete self monitoring of serum blood sugars during the trial&#xD;
      period; those participating in another heart failure or diabetes clinical trial involving&#xD;
      medications; severe comorbidities or foreshortened life expectancy; subjects who do not&#xD;
      provide written informed consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan: Approximately 100 subjects will be randomly assigned to either metformin or&#xD;
      placebo therapy. It is anticipated that enrollment for this pilot study could be accomplished&#xD;
      within 12 months. Subjects will be prospectively followed for 6 months in duration as part of&#xD;
      the pilot study. At time of hospital discharge or initial clinic visit, subjects will be&#xD;
      provided with an educational package on heart failure and type 2 diabetes. They will also be&#xD;
      provided with a medication Dosette to help maintain compliance to their medications and a&#xD;
      clinical event diary to record clinical events in the community setting. To avoid medication&#xD;
      intolerance, the dose of the study medication will be titrated slowly over a 2 week period in&#xD;
      the community. Research coordinators will contact subjects weekly for the first 2 weeks to&#xD;
      recommend dosage titration if warranted. All subjects will complete a six minute walk at both&#xD;
      baseline at the final 6 month follow-up visits. Throughout the study, subjects will be&#xD;
      contacted at monthly intervals for assessment of clinical endpoints. Subjects will return to&#xD;
      the heart function clinic at 3 and 6 months for clinical assessment and to complete&#xD;
      laboratory blood work. In addition, health related quality of life measures (i.e., EQ5D,&#xD;
      KCCQ, RAND12) will also be collected at both baseline and the 6 month final follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcomes: The primary outcome of the study will be a combined endpoint of all-cause&#xD;
      mortality and all cause-hospitalization. Secondary endpoints include the individualized&#xD;
      components of the primary outcome, development of lactic acidosis requiring urgent medical&#xD;
      attention, change in A1c, change in six minute walk, and change in health related quality of&#xD;
      life measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: As a pilot/feasibility stuy, a sample size of 100 patients was selected. An a&#xD;
      priori probability of committing a type 1 error (i.e., alpha level) of 0.05 will be applied&#xD;
      for all tests of statistical significance. All analyses will be conducted from an intention&#xD;
      to treat perspective. Invesigators, patients, and data analyst will be blinded to treatment&#xD;
      assignment. The primary outcome (all-cause mortality and hospitalization), secondary outcomes&#xD;
      for the individual components, and risk of the development of lactic acidosis will be&#xD;
      assessed using relative risk (RR) calculations. Secondary outcomes of change in A1c values,&#xD;
      six minute walk, and health related quality of life from baseline to 6 months will be&#xD;
      assessed using analysis of variance.&#xD;
