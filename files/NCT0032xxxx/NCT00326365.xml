  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the homeopathic remedy Kali Bichromium is&#xD;
      effective in reducing the amount of tracheal secretions in patients intubated with a&#xD;
      conventional endotracheal tube and receiving controlled mechanical ventilation in the ICU&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Profuse and tenacious tracheal secretions are a significant factor impeding the weaning&#xD;
      process in mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). In homeopathy,&#xD;
      high dilutions of plant extracts, minerals, and other biological substances are used as&#xD;
      remedies for the treatment of illness, which is based on the &quot;Law of Similars&quot; (the higher&#xD;
      the dilution, the stronger the effect). Kali Bichromicum (potassium dichromate) is a drug&#xD;
      that is commonly used in homeopathy, mostly for conditions involving profuse, stringy,&#xD;
      tenacious mucous and tracheal secretions. A recent randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study found a statistically significant effect of this remedy on improving&#xD;
      the amount of tracheal secretion, timing to extubation and discharge from the ICU among&#xD;
      critically ill patients, with no side effects observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will compare the efficacy of Kali bichromicum 10-60 (C30) versus placebo&#xD;
      in reducing the amount of tracheal secretions in patients intubated with a conventional&#xD;
      endotracheal tube and receiving controlled mechanical ventilation in the ICU setting. Both&#xD;
      the quantity and viscoelasticity (measured by rheometry) of the secretions will be studied,&#xD;
      as well as sputum neutrophil count (using direct microscopy). Time to extubation and the need&#xD;
      for re-intubation will also be evaluated. 56 patients over the age of 18 years treated with&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation for at least 3 days will be recruited from the ICU departments of 4&#xD;
      medical centers in Israel. The preparations will be administered in the form of small&#xD;
      pellet-like globules, which will be placed on the mucosa of the mouth, to the side of the&#xD;
      endotracheal tube. Patients will be randomly allocated to either verum (n=28) or placebo&#xD;
      (n=28) treatment, with the remedies administered twice daily with an interval of 12 hours,&#xD;
      for a period of up to 14 days or until the patient is extubated. Any adverse event will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
