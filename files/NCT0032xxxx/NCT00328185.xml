  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transplantation is the preferred method of treating many forms of end-stage organ failure.&#xD;
      While short-term results have improved, long-term outcomes remain inadequate. Myocardial&#xD;
      fibrosis could potentially have an adverse effect on long-term cardiac function. We wish to&#xD;
      study the degree of fibrosis to see if we can predict survival following pediatric heart&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There has been recent evidence that demonstrates a significant racial disparity in outcomes&#xD;
      following pediatric heart transplantation.Differences in fibrosis or its regulation may offer&#xD;
      an explanation to these differences.Just as the pathologic alterations of cardiac connective&#xD;
      tissue in the ischemic heart and in cardiomyopathies support the view that the matrix plays a&#xD;
      fundamental role in ventricular function,it is likely that other forms of cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction,such as that following heart transplantation,may also be related to changes in&#xD;
      the extracellular matrix.Fibrosis has been identified in allografts following&#xD;
      transplant,although the degree and significance relative to cardiac function remains&#xD;
      unclear.Many of the regulatory substances have also been identified in the microenvironment&#xD;
      of the allograft following transplant,but their role in collagen deposition and&#xD;
      protease:anti-protease balance is unclear as well.It has been speculated that&#xD;
      individual,racial,and regional disparities in outcome following pediatric heart&#xD;
      transplantation may be the result of an underlying difference in fibrosis.This in turn&#xD;
      influences the tolerance of the recipient to the graft,and ultimately,the time for graft&#xD;
      failure to ensue.Of the 4227 pediatric heart transplants performed in the US 1987-2004,717&#xD;
      were African-American.The 1-year graft survival did not differ among groups;5-year graft&#xD;
      survival was significantly lower among African-Americans compared to other racial groups.The&#xD;
      median graft survival for African-American recipients was 5.3 years compared to 11.0 years&#xD;
      for other recipients.African-American recipients had an increased likelihood of more HLA&#xD;
      mismatches,lower median household income.After adjusting for disparities in a multivariate&#xD;
      analysis, African-American race remained significantly associated with graft failure.While&#xD;
      the cellular component of the myocardium has been extensively studied, the extracellular&#xD;
      matrix is less well examined or understood.Processes of synthesis,degradation,and turnover&#xD;
      are important for the understanding of the physiology of development and remodeling of&#xD;
      tissues and the pathology of hypertrophy and fibrosis.Collagen Fibroblasts are responsible&#xD;
      for the biosynthesis,assembly,and maintenance of the extracellular matrix. Collagen is one of&#xD;
      the components of the extracellular matrix.While collagen proteins serve primarily as an&#xD;
      inert structural support of connective tissue,they also control multiple cellular parameters&#xD;
      such as adhesion,migration,cell shape,cytoskeletal architecture,and gene&#xD;
      expression.Fibronectin is a protein of the extracellular matrix.Fibronectin primarily serves&#xD;
      as an adhesive protein,facilitating cell adhesion to fibrin,collagens,heparin,and&#xD;
      proteoglycans.Fibronectin is important in contact inhibition,cell movement,cell-substrate&#xD;
      adhesion,inflammation,and wound healing.Another function of fibronectin may be in the homing&#xD;
      of lymphocytic cells.Allograft rejection has been associated with infiltration of&#xD;
      inflammatory cells and local deposition of fibronectin.Performing immunohistochemical&#xD;
      analysis for collagen and fibronectin will determine the degree of fibrosis in serial&#xD;
      endomyocardial biopsies over the duration of graft survival.This data will determine the&#xD;
      correlation between allograft fibrosis and clinical parameters of cardiac function,and will&#xD;
      uncover differences in the degree of fibrosis that may exist between racial groups.The&#xD;
      interactions between cells,immune mediators,growth factors,and proteins that regulate&#xD;
      fibrosis have been well documented in some clinical areas.Throughout the transplant&#xD;
      literature,several points in the fibrosis cascade have been identified as potential important&#xD;
      regulatory components. These include transforming growth factor-β,tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor-α,plasminogen activator inhibitor, matrix metalloproteinase-2,and matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinase-9.All have the possibility of affecting the production of collagen and&#xD;
      fibronectin,and the degree of allograft fibrosis.Transforming growth factor-β has many&#xD;
      properties.TGF-β has potential value as an immunosuppressant in tissue.It can serve as an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory agent based on its ability to inhibit the growth of both T and B&#xD;
      cells.TGF-β has the ability to regulate growth depending on the surrounding cell type and&#xD;
      whether or not other growth factors are present.TGF-β stimulates fibroblast chemotaxis and&#xD;
      proliferation.As the most potent stimulator of collagen synthesis,it regulates deposition of&#xD;
      extracellular matrix and cell attachment to it.It induces fibronectin,chondroitin/dermatin&#xD;
      sulfate proteoglycans,collagen,and glycoaminoglycans.TGF-β promotes the formation and&#xD;
      secretion of protease inhibitors,further contributing to collagen accumulation.TGF-β&#xD;
      decreases collagenase,increases tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases,and increases PAI-1&#xD;
      production.Studies have been done implicating TGF-β in the pathogenesis of small-airway&#xD;
      fibrosis characteristic of obliterative bronchiolitis following lung transplant.TGF-β&#xD;
      expression was higher in OB patients in comparison to patients without OB,and positive TGF-β&#xD;
      staining preceded the histologic confirmation of OB by 6 months.TGF-β has been implicated as&#xD;
      a contributing factor to the overproduction of collagen characteristic of dilated&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy.Administration of neutralizing antibodies to TGF-β has been shown to limit&#xD;
      collagen accumulation in wounds.Tumor necrosis factor-α is a cytotoxic monokine produced by&#xD;
      macrophages. TNF-α is associated with the inflammatory response present following exposure to&#xD;
      bacterial endotoxin.TNF-α is produced within the first three days of wound healing.It&#xD;
      facilitates leukocyte recruitment,induces angiogenesis,and promotes fibroblast&#xD;
      proliferation.In animal models,a prominent feature of acute allograft rejection is the dense&#xD;
      deposition of fibronectin at the graft site.Administration of anti-TNF-α serum into the hosts&#xD;
      abrogated acute rejection and prolonged allograft survival.It was accompanied by a decrease&#xD;
      in intragraft TNF-α levels and down-regulated fibronectin mRNA expression.Certain serine&#xD;
      proteases are thought to be key regulators of connective tissue turnover.Plasminogen&#xD;
      activators generate plasmin,a serine protease,which has activity against a number of&#xD;
      connective tissue macromolecules,including fibronectin,proteoglycan core proteins,other&#xD;
      glycoproteins,collagen,as well as fibrin.Plasmin has been shown to initiate the&#xD;
      autoactivation of other proteinases.The activity of plasminogen activators is closely&#xD;
      regulated by specific inhibitors.The plasminogen activator inhibitors are potentially one of&#xD;
      the most important regulators of connective tissue degradation because of their control of&#xD;
      the rate of plasmin generation in local environments.PAI-1 is deposited pericellularly where&#xD;
      its function is to regulate pericellular proteolysis.The connective tissue matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinase family consists of enzymes derived from mesenchymal cells and hematopoietic&#xD;
      cells.They are metal-binding proteinases secreted in proenzyme forms requiring extracellular&#xD;
      activation.The MMPs can be divided into subgroups,one of which is the interstitial&#xD;
      collagenases.This group is responsible for regulating the extracellular collagen.Their&#xD;
      activity is further regulated by a secreted inhibitor,tissue inhibitor of&#xD;
      metalloproteinases,which forms a high-affinity irreversible complex with the active form of&#xD;
      the MMP.Whether or not matrix production and degradation occur depends on the relative&#xD;
      amounts of the metalloproteinases and inhibitors and also on the complex interplay with serum&#xD;
      inhibitors.In disease states where the control mechanisms become uncoordinated,the uaction&#xD;
      and nature of MMP activities may be one of the factors leading to an imbalance of the&#xD;
      extracellular matrix.Studies have shown an increased expression of several MMPs during&#xD;
      cardiac,renal,and pulmonary allograft rejection.In animals,allografts in the presence of&#xD;
      MMP-9 showed lower cellular infiltration and fibrosis than allografts harvested from MMP-9&#xD;
      deficient recipients.The reverse was true with MMP-2,suggesting that MMP-2 and MMP-9 may play&#xD;
      different roles in the process of allograft fibrosis and rejection.By performing&#xD;
      immunohistochemical analysis,we will determine the various amounts of these potential&#xD;
      regulatory substances in serial endomyocardial biopsies over the duration of graft&#xD;
      survival.This data will allow us to compare the changes in regulatory factors with the degree&#xD;
      of fibrosis over time.It will enable us to uncover differences in regulation that may exist&#xD;
      between racial groups.During the isovolumetric contraction phase of systole,ventricular wall&#xD;
      pressure develops rapidly.During the ejection phase,pressure is transmitted to the&#xD;
      ventricular cavity.Associated with ejection,geometric changes occur in the&#xD;
      ventricle.Transmission of force to the ventricle must involve the myocardial matrix.Of the&#xD;
      structural proteins in the heart,collagen has the physical properties necessary for force&#xD;
      transmission to the ventricle.One can conclude that a complex system composed primarily of&#xD;
      collagen is necessary for at least systolic stress distribution and tethering of myocytes one&#xD;
      to another during the spatial translocations that accompany systole.For proper ventricular&#xD;
      function,contiguous myocytes must be stretched to near the same amount.This implies a&#xD;
      mechanism for distribution of stress throughout the entire ventricular wall.It appears that&#xD;
      not only the total amount or collagen present,but also the distribution may be&#xD;
      important.Increases and decreases in collagen have been noted in various disease states and&#xD;
      affect cardiac function.The pathologic alterations of the intrinsic cardiac connective tissue&#xD;
      in the ischemic heart and in cardiomyopathies support the view that the extracellular matrix&#xD;
      plays a fundamental role in ventricular function.Ischemic damage of the myocardium is a blood&#xD;
      flow-mediated,time-dependent process.Even in the absence of tissue necrosis,there is&#xD;
      reversible loss of contractile function.Although myocytes are not morphologically damaged&#xD;
      when stunned,they may lose their interconnections through damage to collagen and the&#xD;
      extracellular matrix.The individual cells then move relative to each other without generating&#xD;
      coordinated,forceful contractions.In animals,studies have shown systolic bulging,mural&#xD;
      thinning,and regions of absent connective tissue.With congestive cardiomyopathy,there is&#xD;
      ventricular dilation,global wall thinning and diffuse contractile dysfunction.Although a&#xD;
      significant component of ventricular dysfunction may relate to loss of contractile mass,there&#xD;
      are regions of connective tissue absence within the normal myocardium in animal models.The&#xD;
      untethering of myocytes again leads to defective,uncoordinated contractile&#xD;
      activity.Similarly,the loss or damage of intrinsic connective tissue may account for the&#xD;
      characteristic global wall thinning.This may lead to a spiral of progressive damage;as the&#xD;
      ventricular cavity enlarges,end-diastolic pressure increases,thereby causing further injury&#xD;
      to the connective tissue.In contrast to congestive cardiomyopathy,some forms of heart disease&#xD;
      are associated with decreased compliance and diminished diastolic filling.Increased collagen&#xD;
      has been demonstrated in hypertrophied hearts.Rather than a thin-walled dilated heart,animal&#xD;
      models demonstrate mural hypertrophy with a small ventricular cavity.In patients with&#xD;
      hypertrophic,obstructive cardiomyopathy,biopsies of the septum revealed severe myocellular&#xD;
      hypertrophy,myocyte disorganization,and pronounced interstitial collagen deposition.There is&#xD;
      an increase in all components and disorganization in the arrangement.After quantifying the&#xD;
      degree of fibrosis and the various amounts of regulatory substances,we will correlate this&#xD;
      data to clinical parameters.We will compare changes in fibrosis over time with measurements&#xD;
      of cardiac function,and with graft survival.&#xD;
