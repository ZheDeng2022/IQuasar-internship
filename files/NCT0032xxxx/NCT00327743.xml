    <textblock>
      The goal of this phase I-II clinical research study is to find the highest safe dose of&#xD;
      XRP9881 and capecitabine that can be given in combination in the treatment of metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer in patients who have been previously treated by taxanes and anthracyclines. The&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of this combination will also be studied. Patients participating in&#xD;
      the study will be asked to give additional blood samples to look at the level of study drugs&#xD;
      in the blood.&#xD;
