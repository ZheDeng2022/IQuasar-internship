      Blood donors who have a low fingerstick hemoglobin level are usually deferred from donating.&#xD;
      A possible solution to the problem of repeated deferrals might be for Blood Banks to offer&#xD;
      donors with low hemoglobin levels oral iron supplements. To determine the feasibility of such&#xD;
      a program, this study will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the frequency of iron deficiency in first-time and repeat blood donors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the effects of long-term blood donation on donor hemoglobin levels and iron&#xD;
           stores&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare body iron stores in donors who have low hemoglobin values with that of donors&#xD;
           who have acceptable hemoglobin values at the time of donation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine what conditions other than iron deficiency lead to low hemoglobin levels in&#xD;
           blood donors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and effectiveness of giving oral iron tablets to donors with low&#xD;
           hemoglobin levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitor the effect of oral iron administration on donor satisfaction and donor&#xD;
           retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First-time and repeat blood donors at the NIH Clinical Center Blood Bank 18 years of age and&#xD;
      older may be eligible for this study. Participants include prospective donors who have an&#xD;
      acceptable hemoglobin value at the time of donation and those whose hemoglobin level is&#xD;
      determined to be too low for donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants do the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Answer medical questions about their diet, health, and family history of blood&#xD;
           disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have blood samples drawn from their arm for testing blood cell counts, iron stores, and&#xD;
           other hemoglobin-related tests as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors with low hemoglobin also:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take iron supplements (ferrous sulfate) to replenish iron stores. (Donors who have&#xD;
           previously had unpleasant side effects from ferrous sulfate are offered ferrous&#xD;
           gluconate as an alternative.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Undergo evaluation with medical screening and laboratory tests at the time of future&#xD;
           blood donations.&#xD;

      Iron is an essential element that is lost with each blood donation. In order for a donor to&#xD;
      compensate for the iron lost in donating blood, iron is mobilized from the body's iron stores&#xD;
      and absorption of iron from the diet is increased. However, this balance is often difficult&#xD;
      to maintain in premenopausal women and regular blood donors since there is ongoing blood&#xD;
      loss. Deficiency in iron results in reduced hemoglobin values, iron stores, and eventually&#xD;
      iron deficiency anemia if not treated. Iron deficiency presents a problem in blood centers&#xD;
      since the minimum allowable hemoglobin for blood donation is 12.5 g per dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the NIH, 14.6% of donors presenting for whole&#xD;
      blood donation and 7.7% of donors presenting for apheresis platelet donation are deferred on&#xD;
      at least one occasion per year due to low hemoglobin values. Overall, 7.9% of visits for&#xD;
      whole blood donation and 2.1% of visits for apheresis platelet donation result in donor&#xD;
      deferral due to low hemoglobin. Although the challenge of iron depletion in the blood donor&#xD;
      population has been known for decades, little has been undertaken to resolve this issue.&#xD;
      Several authors have reported data from successful short term projects demonstrating the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of iron replacement in donors, but larger long term studies have not been&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this protocol are to: (1) quantitate the prevalence of iron deficiency in&#xD;
      first-time presumably healthy individuals who present for blood donation; (2) study the&#xD;
      effects of long-term blood donation on donors' hemoglobin levels and iron stores; (3)&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, practicality, and efficacy of distributing oral replacement iron to&#xD;
      blood donors; (4) determine the effect of oral iron replacement therapy on the donor pool by&#xD;
      monitoring deferral rates for low hemoglobin before and after the initiation of an iron&#xD;
      replacement program. The goal of these objectives is to treat and prevent iron deficiency in&#xD;
      prospective and regular blood donors, thereby expanding the eligible donor pool and leading&#xD;
      to increased donor satisfaction and retention by decreasing deferral rates due to low&#xD;
      hemoglobin.&#xD;
