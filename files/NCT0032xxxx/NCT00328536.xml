      The purpose of the study is to determine whether a 6-week treatment with 4 g Omacor/day&#xD;
      improves the baseline and postprandial endothelial function (after a high-fat meal) in&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have a 2 to 5-fold increase in cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality compared to non-diabetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is an early messenger of atherosclerosis and is present in&#xD;
      states showing a high cardiovascular (CV) risk, such as active and passive smoking,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, arterial hypertension, obesity, hyperhomocysteinemia, coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      congestive heart failure and type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Endothelial function is a&#xD;
      variable with a large day-to-day variation and shows great excursions even within one day.&#xD;
      Several factors might play a role such as hormonal status, physical activity, sleep quality,&#xD;
      but the most important seems to be the postprandial state. Postprandial ED was demonstrated&#xD;
      not only in patients with CV disease or diabetes, but even in healthy subjects. A large body&#xD;
      of evidence has accumulated showing distinctive and cumulative effects of hyperglycemia and&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia on postprandial ED. Since postprandial dysmetabolism was linked to CVD,&#xD;
      ED was proposed to be the mechanism connecting them. Considering that the postprandial state&#xD;
      covers most of our daytime, interventions targeting a reduction in postprandial ED might play&#xD;
      a decisive role in atherosclerosis prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the treatment of postprandial ED several therapeutical approaches have been suggested&#xD;
      such as folic acid, tetrahydrobiopterin, vitamins C and E and statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some properties of omega-3 fatty acids suggest that such an impairment of postprandial&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction could be prevented by treatment with OmacorÂ® and the purpose of our&#xD;
      study is to demonstrate that a six-week therapy with Omacor prevents endothelial dysfunction&#xD;
      in fasting state and following a high-fat meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several controlled clinical studies conducted in persons with TM2DM or after myocardial&#xD;
      infarction have shown that consumption of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3&#xD;
      PUFA) have several beneficial effects such as: lowers risk of primary cardiac arrest, reduces&#xD;
      triglyceride levels, increases high-density lipoprotein levels, reduces platelet&#xD;
      aggregability, acts anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating, lowers blood pressure and&#xD;
      improves endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consumption of n-3 fatty acids was shown to positively influence platelet, fibrinolytic and&#xD;
      vascular function in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients. Mediterranean- style diet&#xD;
      restores markers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation in persons with metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome and improves endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since Omacor contains in high-dose purified n-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic and&#xD;
      docosahexaenoic acid (EPA and DHA), our first hypothesis is that a 6-week therapy with 4g/d&#xD;
      Omacor improves fasting endothelial function in persons with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with T2DM, a three-week diet with a high amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids&#xD;
      compared to a diet with a high amount of monounsaturated fatty acids, produces a&#xD;
      significantly lower increase in postprandial lipemia after an oral fat load. Since&#xD;
      postprandial lipemia induces transient endothelial dysfunction, our second hypothesis is that&#xD;
      treatment with Omacor prevents postprandial impairment of endothelial function after a high&#xD;
      fat meal.&#xD;
