      This study will examine how blood pressure in the lungs is controlled in healthy people,&#xD;
      people with HIV and people with HIV and pulmonary artery hypertension (high blood pressure in&#xD;
      the lungs, also called PAH). PAH sometimes develops in people with HIV, but it is not known&#xD;
      why this occurs or how best to treat it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and patients with HIV infection who are 18 years of age or older may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. All candidates are screened with a medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, electrocardiogram (EKG), chest x-ray, echocardiogram and blood tests.&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants have a right heart catheterization and forearm blood flow study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Catheterization study. A catheter (plastic tube) is placed in an arm vein and possibly&#xD;
           in an artery in the arm. Then a large catheter is passed through a vein in the groin,&#xD;
           neck or chest. Through this &quot;introducer&quot; catheter, another catheter is advanced into the&#xD;
           right side of the heart and to the pulmonary artery. A facemask is put in place to&#xD;
           measure the amount of nitric oxide produced by the lungs. Acetylcholine is infused&#xD;
           through the catheter and its effects on blood pressure in the lungs and on the amount of&#xD;
           nitric oxide exhaled is measured. After about 1 hour, the catheter and facemask are&#xD;
           removed and a new catheter is inserted through the introducer catheter into the&#xD;
           pulmonary artery. The subject is moved into an MRI scanner where blood flow is measured&#xD;
           after infusion of three different medications: acetylcholine (causes blood vessels to&#xD;
           expand and slows heart rate); sodium nitroprusside (causes blood vessels to expand and&#xD;
           increases blood flow to the heart); and L-NMMA (decreases blood flow by blocking&#xD;
           production of nitric oxide in cells lining the blood vessels).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood flow study. Small tubes are inserted into the artery of the patient's forearm.&#xD;
           These are used to infuse medicines and draw blood samples. Forearm blood flow is&#xD;
           measured using pressure cuffs placed on the wrist and upper arm, and a strain gauge (a&#xD;
           rubber band device) placed around the forearm. When the cuffs are inflated, blood flows&#xD;
           into the arm, stretching the strain gauge, and the flow measurement is recorded. A small&#xD;
           lamp is positioned over the hand to measure the light reflected from the hand and blood&#xD;
           flow in the forearm. Blood samples are then drawn to measure blood counts and proteins&#xD;
           and other natural body chemicals. Then, forearm blood flow is measured after&#xD;
           administration of small doses of sodium nitroprusside, acetylcholine and L-NMMA. There&#xD;
           is a 20- to 30-minute rest period between injections of the different drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, HIV-infected patients with PAH undergo the following tests to determine the&#xD;
      cause of their PAH: CT scan of the lungs, pulmonary function tests, 6-minute walk test,&#xD;
      quality-of-life assessment, assessment of difficulty in breathing, exercise testing while&#xD;
      measuring oxygen breathed in and carbon dioxide breathed out, blood tests, monitoring of&#xD;
      oxygen saturation during sleep for 1 night and ventilation/perfusion scan. For the&#xD;
      ventilation/perfusion scan, the subject breathes in a small amount of radioactive aerosol&#xD;
      while images are obtained of the radioactivity as it enters the lungs, and then pictures of&#xD;
      the lungs are taken from multiple angles. Next, the patient receives an injection of tiny&#xD;
      particles of albumin (a protein) containing a small amount of radioactivity and pictures of&#xD;
      the lungs are taken that show the pattern of blood flow to the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with HIV and PAH who may benefit from the investigational drug, sildenafil (commonly&#xD;
      known as Viagra), may continue to participate in the next stage of the study. They receive&#xD;
      the first dose of sildenafil after completing the forearm blood flow study. They continue the&#xD;
      drug for 16 weeks, returning to the clinic 1 week after the first dose and then every other&#xD;
      week to monitor the response to treatment and drug side effects. At the end of 16 weeks,&#xD;
      patients return to the clinic for a repeat evaluation, including blood tests, 6-minute walk&#xD;
      test, echocardiogram, right heart catheterization and forearm blood flow study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      HIV infection has been associated with an increased prevalence of pulmonary hypertension. In&#xD;
      addition, recent data suggests that a state of endothelial dysfunction develops in HIV&#xD;
      disease secondary to anti-retroviral therapy and associated dyslipidemia or secondary to&#xD;
      direct viral infection of the endothelium. This leads to premature atherosclerosis and&#xD;
      possibly contributes to avascular necrosis of the hip. Similar effects on the pulmonary&#xD;
      vasculature may be involved in the development of pulmonary vasculopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we plan to invasively characterize the status of pulmonary and systemic&#xD;
      endothelial function and determine the mechanisms of pulmonary vascular endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction in HIV disease. To this end we will catheterize healthy volunteers and volunteers&#xD;
      with HIV infection with and without pulmonary hypertension and directly measure&#xD;
      acetylcholine-dependent blood flow in the pulmonary and brachial artery to assess pulmonary&#xD;
      and systemic endothelium-dependent blood flow. Simultaneous measurement of exhaled NO and&#xD;
      pulmonary capillary artery NO2 - will allow for complete characterization of the contribution&#xD;
      of NO production to endothelium-dependent vasomotor control. We will also use recently&#xD;
      developed MRI techniques to measure pulmonary artery blood flow during infusion of&#xD;
      acetylcholine (ACH), sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and NG monomethyl-L-arginine (LNMMA) to&#xD;
      establish responsiveness to an endothelium dependent vasodilator, endothelium-independent&#xD;
      vasodilator and an NO inhibitor, respectively. Volunteers with pulmonary hypertension will&#xD;
      have the option to undergo open label phase I/II treatment with sildenafil for 16 weeks and&#xD;
      return for a repeat assessment of pulmonary hemodynamics as well as pulmonary and systemic&#xD;
      endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial cells will be isolated using novel flow-cytometry methodologies developed over&#xD;
      the last two years at the NIH intramural division utilizing combinations of positive and&#xD;
      negative selection based on specific surface markers for activated T cells and endothelial&#xD;
      cells and markers of cell viability. Endothelial cells will subsequently be interrogated&#xD;
      using amplified real time PCR methodologies and affymetrix based gene expression profiling&#xD;
      developed in our laboratories. The levels of expression in endothelial cells of HIV virus,&#xD;
      HHV8, eNOS, caveolin, HO-1, endothelin receptors A and B, and endothelin 1, in addition to&#xD;
      other proteins regulating vascular homeostasis and cellular host defense (i.e. epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor, transforming growth factor beta, platelet derived growth factor and&#xD;
      interleukin-6), will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies will provide insights into the mechanisms of pulmonary artery endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction and suggest rationally designed therapies targeting viral load, HHV8, and/or the&#xD;
      NO/endothelin pathways. These studies have the promise of opening the door to the study of&#xD;
      pulmonary artery endothelial dysfunction at the physiological, cellular and molecular level.&#xD;
