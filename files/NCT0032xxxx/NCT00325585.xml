  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that many drug-using minority women are vulnerable to HIV infection&#xD;
      from their husbands or other intimate male partners. The goal of this study is to develop and&#xD;
      evaluate two new HIV counseling and testing programs designed for drug-using women at risk&#xD;
      for HIV from a primary male partner. It is predicted that HIV counseling and testing programs&#xD;
      administered to couples rather than to women only, and programs that focus on intimate&#xD;
      relationships in the context of HIV risk, will result in a reduction of risky sexual and&#xD;
      drug-related behavior among drug-using women and their primary male partners. This four-year&#xD;
      study employs a randomized clinical trial (RCT) design to test the effectiveness of two new&#xD;
      HIV counseling and testing programs for women drug-users in Harlem and the South Bronx in New&#xD;
      York City.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The broad, long-term objective of this research is to establish primary preventive&#xD;
      interventions to reduce human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behavior among drug-using&#xD;
      minority women. Recent studies indicate that high rates of sexual risk behavior occur within&#xD;
      drug-using minority women's primary heterosexual relationships. Based on an integrated theory&#xD;
      of HIV risk behavior, it is predicted that (a) interventions administered to couples rather&#xD;
      than to women only, and (b) interventions that focus on relationship dynamics in the context&#xD;
      of HIV risk, will result in a reduction of sexual and drug-related risk behavior among&#xD;
      drug-using women and their primary partners. This four-year study employs a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial (RCT) 3-group design to test the efficacy of HIV intervention modality&#xD;
      (couples versus women-only) and intervention content (relationship-focused versus standard&#xD;
      HIV counseling and testing) on crack, cocaine and heroin (injected and noninjected) using&#xD;
      women's sexual risk with primary partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 390 women drug-users and their partners are recruited from the streets of Harlem&#xD;
      and the South Bronx in New York City. Participants are randomly assigned to one of three HIV&#xD;
      counseling and testing intervention conditions: (a) couples, relationship-focused; (b)&#xD;
      women-only, relationship-focused; or, (c) NIDA women-only standard HIV-CT (control). All&#xD;
      subjects are administered baseline, 3-month, and 9-month follow-up assessments using a&#xD;
      combination of computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) and computer-assisted self&#xD;
      interview (CASI) techniques. In addition to sociodemographic characteristics, the interview&#xD;
      will measure drug-use patterns, HIV risk behavior, and dyadic- and individual-level variables&#xD;
      operationalized to test specific hypotheses of women's HIV risk behavior and behavior change.&#xD;
      In addition to testing the effectiveness of the experimental interventions, data analyses&#xD;
      will determine the theory-driven psychosocial mechanisms that act to mediate and moderate any&#xD;
      observed association between intervention treatment and subsequent risk reduction.&#xD;
      Incremental cost-effectiveness analyses will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this study will allow researchers to determine whether couple-based HIV&#xD;
      counseling and testing is a more effective (and cost-effective) approach to HIV prevention&#xD;
      than individual HIV counseling and testing. Analyses will further provide information on the&#xD;
      specific components of couple-based interventions that were most effective in reducing HIV&#xD;
      risk behavior, thereby contributing to theory development regarding intimate couples' HIV&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
