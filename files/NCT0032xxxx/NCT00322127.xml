  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine how safely and well people can tolerate AMD3100 at larger than&#xD;
      normal doses to mobilize CD34+ cells, (stem cells). AMD3100 is a new drug designed to&#xD;
      mobilize stem cells for transplantation in cancer patients. It pushes those cells into the&#xD;
      circulation, making it easier to collect them, and it temporarily increases the number of&#xD;
      stem cells in a person's blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 18 to 50 in good health and who are not pregnant or breastfeeding may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. They will undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of medications, including those prescribed and over-the-counter, as well as&#xD;
           nutritional supplements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests for liver, kidneys, and other functions; and for infections including&#xD;
           hepatitis and AIDS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day they receive AMD3100, patients will be admitted to the Clinical Center. They will&#xD;
      receive two doses, injected under the skin, at intervals separated by 14 to 90 days. Dose&#xD;
      levels are 240 and 320 micrograms/kg and 400 and 480 micrograms/kg. For 24 hours following&#xD;
      the first AMD3100 administration, blood will be collected periodically through a plastic tube&#xD;
      at amounts dependent on doses of AMD3100 given. If patients receive one of the two highest&#xD;
      doses, their heart rhythm will be monitored continuously during the hospital stay. From 7 to&#xD;
      10 days following administration of AMD3100, patients will give blood samples to monitor the&#xD;
      effects. The second dose of AMD3100 will be given 14 to 90 days after the first one. Patients&#xD;
      will return to the Clinical Center for the same procedures as done previously, but the dose&#xD;
      of the drug will be higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks involve side effects of AMD3100. In previous studies, patients who received the drug&#xD;
      experienced a temporary increase in white blood cell counts. Serious side effects have&#xD;
      included abnormally low platelet clot, abnormal heart rhythm, and low blood pressure.&#xD;
      Patients will be carefully monitored for such effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) have become the preferred source of hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cells for allogeneic transplantation because of technical ease of collection and shorter&#xD;
      time required for engraftment. Traditionally, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)&#xD;
      has been used to procure the PBPC graft. Although regimens using G-CSF usually succeed in&#xD;
      collecting adequate numbers of PBPC from healthy donors, 5%-10% of subjects will mobilize&#xD;
      progenitor cells poorly and may require multiple large volume apheresis or bone marrow&#xD;
      harvesting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMD3100 is a bicyclam compound that inhibits the binding of stromal cell derived factor-1&#xD;
      (SDF-1) to its cognate receptor CXCR4. CXCR4 is present on CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor&#xD;
      cells and its interaction with SDF-1 plays a pivotal role in the homing of CD34+ cells in the&#xD;
      bone marrow. Inhibition of the CXCR4-SDF-1 axis by AMD3100 releases CD34+ cells into the&#xD;
      circulation, which can then be collected easily by apheresis. Recently, several reports have&#xD;
      demonstrated that large numbers of progenitor CD34+ cells are rapidly mobilized in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers following a single subcutaneous injection of AMD3100. The ability to collect a&#xD;
      large quantity of PBPC's with a single injection of this drug makes this an attractive agent&#xD;
      for mobilizing both autologous and allogeneic donors for hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase one dose escalating trial of AMD3100 in healthy donors done outside the NHLBI&#xD;
      suggested the peak CD34+ mobilizing effects of this agent occurred at the 240 microgram/kg&#xD;
      dose. Of note, no dose limiting toxicities were observed at the highest dose level of 320&#xD;
      mcg/kg. In two current trials at the NHLBI, AMD3100 has also proven to be well tolerated at&#xD;
      the 240 mcg/kg dose, however, the progenitor CD34+ cell yield following a matched volume&#xD;
      apheresis was lower compared to G-CSF mobilizations collected from the same healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. More importantly, the number of CD34+ cells collected following one dose of&#xD;
      AMD3100 has frequently been less than 3 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg, the previously defined&#xD;
      minimal dose of progenitor cells required to optimize allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation outcomes. In addition, preliminary data from non-human primate studies&#xD;
      suggest that higher doses of AMD3100 may improve CD34+ cell yield in an apheresis collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these data, it is possible that inter-subject variability in CD34+ cell mobilization&#xD;
      may have led investigators (in the prior phase I study) to prematurely terminate AMD3100 dose&#xD;
      escalation based on the perception that CD34+ doses had peaked. We therefore propose this&#xD;
      dose escalating study, designed to evaluate the safety and activity of AMD3100 when&#xD;
      administered in escalating higher doses (240 microgram/kg dose, 320 microgram/kg dose 400&#xD;
      microgram/kg dose 480 microgram/kg dose). Activity will be evaluated by measuring the most&#xD;
      effective dose of AMD3100 in mobilizing progenitor CD34 + cells into the circulation in&#xD;
      healthy donors. To minimize inter-subject variability, we will administer two different doses&#xD;
      of AMD3100 to each subject, evaluating the peak CD34+ cell count achieved after each dose.&#xD;
      Separate cohorts of healthy volunteers will be evaluated for each dose escalation. The short&#xD;
      half life and rapid wash-out of AMD3100 allows for this method of study.&#xD;
