    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of and immune response to a preventive&#xD;
      malaria vaccine, MSP1 42-C1/Alhydrogel, in healthy adults. This study will also compare&#xD;
      responses to two different doses of the malaria vaccine given with or without the adjuvant&#xD;
      CPG 7909.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2002, the World Health Organization reported a worldwide malaria incidence of&#xD;
      approximately 300 million clinical cases annually, with approximately 1 million deaths&#xD;
      attributed to malaria alone or in combination with other diseases. The parasite Plasmodium&#xD;
      falciparum is responsible for the majority of these infections and deaths. During P.&#xD;
      falciparum infection, liver cells are invaded by the parasite and asexual multiplication&#xD;
      occurs. The liver cells burst, and tens of thousands of infectious particles called&#xD;
      merozoites are released. A multiprotein complex on the surface of a merozoite is necessary&#xD;
      for the merozoite to infect a blood cell. MSP1 42-C1 is a malaria vaccine that mimics MSP1&#xD;
      42, a protein in the multiprotein complex. By introducing this &quot;decoy&quot; form of MSP1 42,&#xD;
      infection of additional blood cells may be blocked. The adjuvant CPG 7909 is known to elicit&#xD;
      cell-mediated immunity, the arm of the immune system that defends the body against&#xD;
      intracellular pathogens such as P. falciparum. This study will evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of MSP1 42-C1/Alhydrogel at two different doses in healthy adults. The vaccine&#xD;
      will be given either alone or with CPG 7909.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last at least 34 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A participants will receive three injections of the lower dose of MSP1&#xD;
           42-C1/Alhydrogel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B participants will receive three injections of the lower dose of MSP1&#xD;
           42-C1/Alhydrogel and CPG 7909.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C participants will receive three injections of the higher dose of MSP1&#xD;
           42-C1/Alhydrogel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group D participants will receive three injections of the higher dose of MSP1&#xD;
           42-C1/Alhydrogel and CPG 7909.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment into Groups C and D will begin only after safety review of all participants in&#xD;
      Groups A and B. All participants will receive their assigned injections at study entry, Week&#xD;
      4, and Week 8, and will be asked to return to the clinic the day after each vaccination for&#xD;
      clinical evaluation. Participants will be asked to keep a diary for 6 days after each&#xD;
      vaccination, taking note of their body temperatures and any side effects they experience.&#xD;
      There will be a total of 18 study visits over 34 weeks. A clinical evaluation will occur at&#xD;
      each visit. Blood collection, vital signs measurement, and urine collection will occur at&#xD;
      selected visits.&#xD;
