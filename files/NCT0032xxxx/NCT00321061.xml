    <textblock>
      This study will test whether a vaccination schedule of experimental HIV vaccines is safe and&#xD;
      whether it causes side effects in healthy adult volunteers. It will also compare the effects&#xD;
      of vaccine injected into the muscle (intramuscular), just under the skin (subcutaneous), or&#xD;
      into the skin (intradermal) and will monitor the social impact of being in an HIV vaccine&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers 18-50 years old may be eligible for this 42-week study. Participants are&#xD;
      screened for antibodies to adenovirus, a common virus that causes upper respiratory&#xD;
      infections, such as the common cold. Half of the participants selected will be positive and&#xD;
      half will be negative for antibodies to the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccines used in this study are known as VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP (called the &quot;DNA vaccine&quot;)&#xD;
      and VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP (called the &quot;rAd5 vaccine&quot;). The DNA vaccine codes for four HIV&#xD;
      proteins. The rAd5 vaccine is made using an adenovirus that has been modified to contain DNA&#xD;
      that codes for three HIV proteins. These vaccines cannot cause HIV or adenoviral infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to one of six possible vaccination schedules that include&#xD;
      &quot;prime&quot; and &quot;booster&quot; vaccines. The first vaccinations prime the immune system and the immune&#xD;
      response is then boosted later. The groups differ in the type of vaccines given (DNA vaccine&#xD;
      prime with rAd5 booster or rAd5 prime with rAd5 booster), in how the vaccine is administered&#xD;
      (intramuscularly, subcutaneously or intradermally) and in the schedule of administration. All&#xD;
      shots are given in the upper arm. Subjects fill out a diary card at home for 5 days after&#xD;
      each vaccination, recording their temperature and any symptoms. The cards are turned in to&#xD;
      the clinic at the first visit after all 5 days are completed. Subjects return for clinic&#xD;
      visits about 3 days after each prime vaccination and either come in or call the clinic about&#xD;
      7 days after the injection. They call a study nurse 1 or 2 days after the booster&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have 15-20 clinic visits during the course of the study, depending on their&#xD;
      vaccination schedule. At each visit, they are checked for health changes or problems, asked&#xD;
      how they are feeling and if they have taken any medications or other treatments, including&#xD;
      over-the-counter medicines, herbal supplements, etc. Blood and urine samples are collected at&#xD;
      some visits. Subjects are tested for HIV several times and asked questions about their sexual&#xD;
      behavior and drug use. Throughout the stu...&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VRC DNA vaccine and VRC recombinant adenoviral vector (rAd5) vaccine have been previously&#xD;
      shown to elicit immune responses to HIV-1-specific peptides when administered intramuscularly&#xD;
      (IM) alone and in prime-boost schedules. This Phase I, randomized, open-label exploratory&#xD;
      study will evaluate the safety and tolerability and the immune responses when IM,&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) or intradermal (ID) routes of administration are used for the priming&#xD;
      vaccinations in a prime-boost schedule. The randomization will ensure that subjects with&#xD;
      negative and positive screening adenovirus type 5 antibody (Ad5Ab) titers will be equally&#xD;
      represented in each prime-boost schedule evaluated in the study. Group 1 subjects will&#xD;
      receive three DNA prime vaccinations followed by a rAd5 boost vaccination and Group 2&#xD;
      subjects will receive one rAd5 prime vaccination followed by a rAd5 boost vaccination. It is&#xD;
      also of interest to explore whether vaccination by SC or ID route alters the functional&#xD;
      qualities of the immune response. About half of the subjects who screen for HIV vaccine&#xD;
      studies at the VRC Clinic have negative Ad5Ab titer and half have positive Ad5Ab titers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses are: 1) IM, SC and ID are all safe routes of administration for both the DNA&#xD;
      and rAd5 vaccines; 2) all regimens will elicit immune responses to HIV-1-specific peptides;&#xD;
      3) intradermal administration will allow a lower dosage of the DNA vaccine to be used for&#xD;
      eliciting an immune response; and 4) rAd5 booster administered after a rAd5 prime will boost&#xD;
      the cellular and humoral immune response. The primary objectives relate to evaluation of the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of the DNA and rAd5 vaccines when administered by IM, SC and ID&#xD;
      routes. Secondary objectives are related to evaluation of the immunogenicity of the vaccines&#xD;
      when administered by SC and ID routes as compared to the IM route and the social impact of&#xD;
      participating in an HIV-1 vaccine trial. Exploratory evaluations of the immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      vaccination regimens are also planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL DESCRIPTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP (DNA vaccine) is composed of 6 closed, circular DNA plasmids that encode&#xD;
      HIV-1 Gag, Pol and Nef (from clade B) and Env glycoprotein from clade A, clade B, and clade&#xD;
      C; each plasmid comprises 16.67 percent (by weight) of the vaccine. VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP (rAd5&#xD;
      vaccine) is composed of 4 recombinant non-replicating adenoviral vectors that encode for&#xD;
      HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyproteins (from clade B) and Env glycoprotein from clade A, clade B, and&#xD;
      clade C, which are combined in a 3:1:1:1 ratio, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty healthy adult volunteers, 18 to 50 years old, 30 subjects with negative Ad5Ab titers&#xD;
      (less than 1:12) and 30 subjects with positive Ad5Ab titers (greater than or equal to 1:12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PLAN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with negative and positive Ad5Ab titers will be equally randomized to the six&#xD;
      prime-boost schedules evaluated in the study as shown in the schema below. All injections&#xD;
      will be administered by a needle and syringe device appropriate for the route of&#xD;
      administration specified.&#xD;
