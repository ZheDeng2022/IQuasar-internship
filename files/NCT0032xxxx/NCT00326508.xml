  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether treatment with a combination of the drugs daclizumab and&#xD;
      denileukin diftitox can eliminate the need for long-term daclizumab treatment in adult&#xD;
      patients with uveitis. Denileukin diftitox kills white blood cells called lymphocytes that&#xD;
      cause inflammation and may be the cause of uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with uveitis in one or both eyes who are on daclizumab&#xD;
      therapy and have not had a disease flareup in 6 months may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, eye examination&#xD;
      (including vision test, examination of the front of the eye, and pupil dilation for&#xD;
      examination of the retina at the back of the eye), blood tests and a questionnaire about&#xD;
      their vision and daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening, participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daclizumab/ denileukin diftitox treatment. Patients receive their regular dose of&#xD;
           daclizumab intravenously (through a vein). The interval between doses is increased by 1&#xD;
           week after each dose. When the doses are 10 weeks apart, the daclizumab is stopped.&#xD;
           Patients who experience a flare or uveitis are treated with intravenous denileukin&#xD;
           diftitox and possibly local injections of steroids around the eye or increasing or&#xD;
           adding other medicines as needed to control the uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography to look for blood vessel abnormalities in the eyes. A yellow dye&#xD;
           is injected into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of&#xD;
           the retina (the back portion of the eye) are taken with a special camera that flashes a&#xD;
           blue light into the eye. The pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into&#xD;
           the retina, indicating possible abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound and urine tests at enrollment and after 1 year to check kidneys, lymph nodes&#xD;
           and pelvic area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests at enrollment and every 3-6 months for laboratory and immunology tests and&#xD;
           other research tests on blood cells to examine the immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up visits approximately every 6 weeks for 2 years for repeat examinations to&#xD;
           determine the response to treatment and drug side effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We propose to investigate the possible efficacy of combination daclizumab and denileukin&#xD;
      diftitox therapy to induce peripheral immune tolerance in participants presenting with&#xD;
      non-infectious intermediate and posterior uveitis. This will be performed using a Phase I/II&#xD;
      pilot study. Subjects whose disease is controlled on daclizumab therapy will have their&#xD;
      daclizumab-dosing interval progressively increased by one-week increments. If and when they&#xD;
      experience signs or symptoms of an ocular flare, they will be treated with denileukin&#xD;
      diftitox, 24 hours after which they will receive their usual dose of daclizumab. Participants&#xD;
      may receive up to 12 such cycles of daclizumab/denileukin diftitox therapy. When the&#xD;
      daclizumab-dosing interval is 10 weeks long or less than 10% of their CD4 T cell CD25 is&#xD;
      occupied by daclizumab, therapy will be discontinued. Following discontinuation of daclizumab&#xD;
      patients will be followed for recurrence of ocular disease. Failure to reach this study point&#xD;
      after 12 cycles or disease recurrence following discontinuation of therapy will constitute a&#xD;
      study failure. The primary outcome will be the ability of the participant to be successfully&#xD;
      tapered off daclizumab while their disease remains quiet (vitreous haze less than or equal to&#xD;
      Trace) at week 104 while receiving no concomitant systemic immunosuppressive medications.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible to enroll in this study, a prospective participant must satisfy the&#xD;
        following inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant is 18 years of age or older. (The vast majority of T cells are produced&#xD;
             before adulthood and the long-term consequences of inducing immune tolerance are&#xD;
             unknown, it would thus seem prudent to exclude juveniles from the study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant with uveitis in one or both eyes on daclizumab therapy without disease&#xD;
             flare in the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants of reproductive age agree to use acceptable birth control methods&#xD;
             throughout the course of the study and for 6 months after completion of treatment with&#xD;
             daclizumab or sirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant must be willing and prepared to travel to NIH on short notice for&#xD;
             treatment and to be hospitalized if deemed medically necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant is able to understand and sign a consent form before entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible to enroll in this study, a prospective participant must not satisfy any of&#xD;
        the following exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant with a history of hypersensitivity to denileukin diftitox.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participant with active chronic or acute infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant with a history of cardiovascular disease, significant respiratory disease,&#xD;
             coagulation disorders, or other major medical illnesses that may limit their ability&#xD;
             to tolerate the toxicities associated with denileukin diftitox.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant with a serum albumin less than 3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participant with malignancy other than squamous cell carcinoma in situ.&#xD;
