      This prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled release study will enroll&#xD;
      approximately 300 healthy adults 18-49 years of age. Eligible subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned in a 4:1 fashion to receive a single dose of bivalent vaccine or placebo by&#xD;
      intranasal spray. This study will be conducted at multiple sites in the United States.&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by site.&#xD;
