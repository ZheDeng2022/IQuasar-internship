      The hypothesis of the existence of a causal association between the systemic&#xD;
      infectious/inflammatory burden represented by periodontitis and endothelial function assessed&#xD;
      by flow mediated dilatation of the brachial artery (FMD) is the subject of the proposed&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      periodontal therapy on endothelial function assessed by Flow mediated dilatation (FMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this project is twofold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the extent of acute systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction&#xD;
           associated with the delivery of subgingival instrumentation for the treatment of chronic&#xD;
           periodontitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish whether or not improved control of chronic periodontal infections results in&#xD;
           improved endothelial function and thus the existence of a causal association between&#xD;
           periodontitis and endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last decade considerable evidence has supported the hypothesis that chronic low-grade&#xD;
      infections, periodontitis included, and the inflammatory responses associated with them may&#xD;
      play a significant role in the onset of atherosclerosis. An inflammatory alteration of the&#xD;
      normal endothelial activity is thought to be one of the mechanisms that may link infection&#xD;
      with atherosclerosis. It consists of loss of the normal vasodilation, antiplatelet and&#xD;
      antithrombotic properties of the vascular walls and it is frequently called endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction. Impaired endothelium-dependent dilatation, an early functional marker of&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction has been demonstrated in young populations with family history of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases. In the past 15 years a new non invasive and reproducible technique&#xD;
      called Flow mediated dilatation (FMD) has been used to assess endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontitis is a chronic infection of the tooth supporting apparatus caused primarily by&#xD;
      anaerobic gram negative bacteria organised in a biofilm (commonly known as sub-gingival&#xD;
      dental plaque); it leads to inflammatory destruction of the periodontal ligament and alveolar&#xD;
      bone and eventually to tooth exfoliation. Periodontitis is highly prevalent in both&#xD;
      industrialised and developing countries with 10-15% of the adult population being affected by&#xD;
      severe forms of this disease. Recognized risk factors include genetic polymorphisms in&#xD;
      inflammatory genes, environmental exposures such as cigarette smoking, and systemic diseases&#xD;
      such as diabetes. Local periodontal production of prostaglandins and pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines has been associated with activation of matrix metalloproteinases and eventually to&#xD;
      destruction of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. It is the primary cause of tooth&#xD;
      loss in adult populations and as such leads to long term disability and increased treatment&#xD;
      needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local periodontal infections have been associated with a systemic response characterized by&#xD;
      increased serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), hyper-fibrinogenemia, moderate&#xD;
      leukocytosis, as well as increased serum levels of IL-1 and IL-6 when compared with&#xD;
      unaffected control populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several epidemiological studies have associated increased levels of acute phase markers with&#xD;
      higher risk for cardiovascular atherosclerotic events. Among these markers, C-reactive&#xD;
      protein is considered to be one of the most sensitive and probably to be an independent risk&#xD;
      factor of atherosclerosis. It is produced by the liver presumably for adaptive or defensive&#xD;
      reasons in response to a variety of inflammatory stimuli, including chronic low grade&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recently completed pilot trial we have been able to establish that treatment of&#xD;
      periodontal infections resulted in a significant decrease in serum CRP. In that study,&#xD;
      treatment of periodontal infections led to a significant decrease in serum CRP (0.5 mg/L, 95%&#xD;
      CI 0.4 to 0.7 mg/L) and IL6 in otherwise healthy individuals affected with severe,&#xD;
      generalized periodontitis and indicated that periodontitis contributed to the systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment associated decrease in systemic inflammatory markers observed in this study&#xD;
      supports the hypothesis that periodontal infections, along with chronic low grade infections&#xD;
      in other body districts, contribute to the inflammatory burden of an individual and may play&#xD;
      a contributory etiologic role in atherosclerosis. It remains to be established whether or not&#xD;
      the observed improvements in serum CRP have an impact on functional vascular parameters and&#xD;
      endothelial function/dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between periodontal treatment and changes in serum CRP is likely to be&#xD;
      bimodal: an increase associated with the delivery of the standard subgingival instrumentation&#xD;
      and the associated bacteremia and tissue damage is expected shortly after treatment is&#xD;
      delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary trials from our group aimed at the establishment of the pattern of CRP changes in&#xD;
      the first days following delivery of periodontal therapy. The data indicate that serum CRP&#xD;
      levels sharply increase after treatment but that values tend to return to baseline levels by&#xD;
      one week. This bimodal pattern of changes in serum CRP levels is important since previous&#xD;
      investigations have established links between functional vascular parameters such as flow&#xD;
      mediated dilatation (FMD) and serum markers of systemic inflammation such as CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal therapy therefore may lead to an initial improve FMD parameters in subject were&#xD;
      periodontitis contributes to systemic inflammation and atherosclerosis. The hypothesis of the&#xD;
      existence of a causal association between the systemic infectious/inflammatory burden&#xD;
      represented by periodontitis and endothelial function assessed by FMD is the subject of the&#xD;
      proposed investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare the effects of an intensive periodontal treatment regimen with a community based&#xD;
      periodontal care approach in terms of changes in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flow mediated dilatation of the brachial artery (primary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute phase response in serum (CRP, IL-6,fibrinogen)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical periodontal parameters: PI, BoP, PPD (CAL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of periodontal pathogens in the periodontal pockets before and after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient perception and adverse events associated with the treatment experience This will&#xD;
           be a randomized controlled clinical trial. Its design will be parallel arm, single&#xD;
           blind; outcomes will be evaluated over a 6 months period and will include approximately&#xD;
           120 subjects. Two interventions will be compared: test treatment will be an intensive&#xD;
           regimen of periodontal therapy consisting of oral hygiene instructions and subgingival&#xD;
           debridement delivered at two appointments over a 24 hour period; control treatment will&#xD;
           consist of a community based periodontal care approach consisting of supragingival&#xD;
           removal of deposits delivered at two appointments over a 24 hour period. The control&#xD;
           group will receive the intensive regimen upon completion of the study or upon evidence&#xD;
           that periodontitis is progressing. Subjects with moderate to severe periodontitis will&#xD;
           be recruited among those referred for care to the Periodontal Clinic of the Eastman&#xD;
           Dental Hospital. The primary outcome measure of this study will be changes in Flow&#xD;
           Mediated Dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery. Secondary outcomes will include&#xD;
           changes in serum CRP and plasma fibrinogen. Periodontal, microbiological and subjective&#xD;
           outcomes will be evaluated as control outcomes. The primary and the secondary outcome&#xD;
           variables will be evaluated before treatment and at 1 day, 7 days, 2 months and 6 months&#xD;
           following completion of treatment. Subjects will be randomized to treatment stratifying&#xD;
           for smoking status by a study registrar. Treatment allocation will be concealed to study&#xD;
           personnel by using opaque envelopes and to the examiner by making treatment records&#xD;
           unavailable. All laboratory and FMD analyses will be performed by unrelated study&#xD;
           personnel blind with respect to treatment allocation or stage of progression of the&#xD;
           trial. Intent to treat analyses will be performed by a statistician blind with respect&#xD;
           to treatment allocation.&#xD;
