  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this investigation is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      viscosupplementation in treating symptomatic lumbar facet joint arthropathy. The intended use&#xD;
      of the device (Synvisc) is to alleviate pain and improve function in patients with painful&#xD;
      lumbar facet joint arthrosis by intra-articular injection into the involved joint.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will enter the study once the putatively painful joint or joints have been confirmed&#xD;
      by single blind, double local-comparative anesthetic blockade. The joint(s) suspected by&#xD;
      historical features and physical examination will be injected under fluoroscopic guidance&#xD;
      with contrast-enhancement confirming intra-articular placement. The initial injectate will be&#xD;
      1cc of 2% xylocaine. Single diagnostic lumbar facet joint injections carry a false positive&#xD;
      rate of 38%. In order to maximize the specificity of the diagnostic injections a second 1cc&#xD;
      injection of a longer-acting local anesthetic, 0.5% marcaine, will be performed on all&#xD;
      patients reporting clinically significant pain reduction (&gt; 75% VAS reduction from&#xD;
      pre-injection baseline) within 10-15 minutes after the xylocaine injection. This second&#xD;
      diagnostic injection will be completed upon return of the patient's pain back to baseline (no&#xD;
      sooner than 3 days after the initial diagnostic injection). A true positive response will be&#xD;
      defined as &gt; 50% VAS reduction after the second injection. Patients will then undergo 2 IA&#xD;
      Synvisc injections into the painful facet joint(s). An initial IA injection of 1.0cc (or a&#xD;
      volume, not to exceed 1.0cc, accepted by the joint upon reaching a capsular endpoint) of&#xD;
      Synvisc (1cc, 10mg/ml) will be injected into the painful joint(s) 7 days after the second&#xD;
      diagnostic injection after the baseline pain has returned. A 2nd injection will then be&#xD;
      performed 10 days after the initial injection. A 3rd injection may be offered to patients not&#xD;
      satisfied with the results obtained with the first 2 Synvisc injections. A 2.0cc vial of&#xD;
      Synvisc per patient will be shipped including other trial materials to the investigator for&#xD;
      implementation. A fluid dispenser connector will allow direct dispensation of 1.0cc of&#xD;
      Synvisc from the pre-packaged 2.0cc unmarked vial. Outcome measurement tools will include&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale, Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, SF-36, lumbar spine range of motion&#xD;
      (ROM), sitting and walking tolerance, analgesic usage, and patient satisfaction. Data will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline, at 7-10 days after the second Synvisc injection, and at 1, 3, 6, and&#xD;
      12 month follow up (after the final Synvisc injection) visits. For example, patient X will&#xD;
      undergo an initial 2 Synvisc injections and then be evaluated in the office 7 days later. If&#xD;
      the patient experiences significant benefit, no other injections will be pursued. However, if&#xD;
      a therapeutic benefit is achieved but is not satisfactory to the patient, a 3rd Synvisc&#xD;
      injection will be performed within 3 days. A side effect and complications questionnaire will&#xD;
      be completed by each patient within 30 minutes, 24 hours, and 72 hours after each injection&#xD;
      (including diagnostic injections).&#xD;
