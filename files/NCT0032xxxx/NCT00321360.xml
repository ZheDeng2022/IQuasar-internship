      Whether patient-maintained sedation (the patient controls his/her degree of sedation using a&#xD;
      hand-held device) using the drug propofol is safer and more effective when using&#xD;
      deteriorating reaction time as an added safeguard against the small potential for over&#xD;
      sedation in a group of healthy volunteers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients receiving conscious sedation for dentistry and endoscopy are usually treated with&#xD;
      intermittent bolus doses of intravenous midazolam (administered by the operator-sedationist).&#xD;
      The safety of such a regime has been questioned with reports of up to 13 % of patients&#xD;
      desaturating to below 80 % in the recovery area following sedation for endoscopy. Mortality&#xD;
      occurs in 0.05 % of endoscopy patients (with approximately 60 % of this being due to&#xD;
      hypoxaemia). The aim of our work, therefore, is to look at providing sedation that is both&#xD;
      safer as well as being efficacious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug propofol, the agent most commonly used to induce general anaesthesia in the UK, is&#xD;
      also frequently administered intravenously by anaesthetists in low doses to provide conscious&#xD;
      sedation for patients undergoing unpleasant procedures i.e. patients become relaxed,&#xD;
      anxiety-free, but maintain verbal contact throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique of patient maintained sedation using the drug propofol (the patient can&#xD;
      increase the amount of sedation (and propofol) they receive by pressing a demand button&#xD;
      attached to a standard infusion device) has been used by anaesthetists and evaluated since&#xD;
      1997.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several recent studies published and submitted for publication by this research group on&#xD;
      patient maintained sedation using the drug propofol have shown this method of sedation to be&#xD;
      safe and effective in dental patients (over 120 patients studied and no cases of over&#xD;
      sedation). It was also shown that this method, when compared to the established method of&#xD;
      sedation in oral surgery (the dentist administering doses of midazolam intravenously),&#xD;
      produced both quicker recovery and less anxiety prior to the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The routine use of propofol traditionally is restricted to anaesthetists, as in much higher&#xD;
      doses general anaesthesia is produced with possible loss of airway patency. Currently the&#xD;
      safety feature is predominantly that as patients become more sedated they cannot press the&#xD;
      patient demand button and hence cannot increase the amount of propofol they are receiving.&#xD;
      Also the device ensures that the blood and brain concentrations have equilibrated to within&#xD;
      10% of each other before another successful demand for propofol can be made (usually takes&#xD;
      approximately two minutes) and it only allows a maximum calculated brain concentration of 3&#xD;
      micrograms/milliliter of propofol. The device also will start to decrease the calculated&#xD;
      brain concentration of propofol if the demand button has not been pressed for six minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the encouraging results above we also found in a recent pilot study involving 20&#xD;
      healthy volunteers who were instructed to try and make themselves unconscious that there were&#xD;
      2 cases of over sedation (of these one briefly lost verbal contact and the other required&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen for a short time only). This however was not unsafe in the presence of an&#xD;
      anaesthetist. Over sedation, however, was never demonstrated with any of the oral surgery&#xD;
      patients in the previous studies. This may have been due to a higher level of anxiety in&#xD;
      dental patients affecting response to propofol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have therefore incorporated an additional safety feature into the existing and previously&#xD;
      studied patient maintained sedation system which may further decrease or eliminate this small&#xD;
      risk of over sedation. All the above safety features are retained and in addition the patient&#xD;
      demand button will now also be used to monitor reaction time at one minutely intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that propofol slows the reaction time of a given individual and in another recent&#xD;
      study of 40 patients undergoing general anaesthesia for planned surgery using propofol, the&#xD;
      patients' reaction times were recorded both awake and during induction of anaesthesia by&#xD;
      instructing the patients to press a handheld button as quickly as possible in response to the&#xD;
      handset vibrating. The calculated effect site (brain) concentration of propofol was increased&#xD;
      incrementally and reaction time monitored at each stage until the patient could no longer&#xD;
      press the button.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from this study (deteriorating patient reaction time with increased brain&#xD;
      concentration of propofol) was analysed and this information used to provide an additional&#xD;
      safeguard within the system to prevent over sedation i.e. a patient's reaction time&#xD;
      deterioration by a certain percentage will prevent himself or herself being able to&#xD;
      self-administer more propofol. Furthermore the system will actually start to decrease the&#xD;
      brain concentration of propofol once the patients' reaction time becomes too slow. The&#xD;
      patient demand button will be used to monitor reaction time at one minutely intervals as well&#xD;
      as administer more propofol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope that this will eliminate the small risk of over sedation and wish to recruit a&#xD;
      further 20 healthy volunteers to assess the safety and efficacy of this reaction time&#xD;
      safeguarded, patient-maintained sedation system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After expressing an interest to be recruited each volunteer will be given the volunteer&#xD;
      information leaflet about the research to take home and read. The volunteer will be given&#xD;
      ample opportunity to ask any questions regarding the research and to give informed written&#xD;
      consent at the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteer will then have an intravenous cannula sited and will have routine monitoring&#xD;
      applied for continuous observation (blood pressure, ECG and oxygen saturation). The cannula&#xD;
      will be connected to an effect-site controlled infusion system consisting of a Graseby 3400&#xD;
      infusion pump and a backbar microprocessor (into which the patient's age and weight are&#xD;
      entered), programmed with the pharmacokinetic data describing the distribution and&#xD;
      elimination of propofol. The microprocessor will also be connected to the investigator's&#xD;
      laptop. Whilst the volunteer is connected to the propofol infusion, an experienced&#xD;
      anaesthetist (with FRCA qualification) and a trained assistant will be in constant&#xD;
      attendance. There will be ready access to all appropriate resuscitation equipment and drugs.&#xD;
      Recordings of the patient's vital signs on a data collection sheet will be made prior to&#xD;
      sedation and then every 5 minutes until the sedation period ends (see supplements). The&#xD;
      anaesthetist will also record the volunteer's sedation score at each reaction time challenge&#xD;
      (see supplements). For each reaction time challenge the actual reaction time and&#xD;
      corresponding effect site (brain) concentration will be logged onto the laptop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The way the device works will be explained and the volunteer will be given a handset to hold&#xD;
      which has a button on top. They will hold this throughout the procedure. The handset will&#xD;
      vibrate at intervals of one minute throughout the procedure and the volunteer will be&#xD;
      instructed to press the button twice (double click) as soon as the handset vibrates in order&#xD;
      to record the volunteer's reaction time. Three baseline reaction times will be recorded prior&#xD;
      to sedation, the first value discarded and the second two values averaged to give the&#xD;
      baseline reaction time. We will also tell them that the way to demand more propofol during&#xD;
      the sedation period is by also pressing the button twice within one second.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device will then be set to achieve an effect-site (brain) concentration of 1.0&#xD;
      micrograms/millilitre (mcg/ml). Once this effect concentration has been achieved the control&#xD;
      button will be activated for administration of propofol and the volunteer will be instructed&#xD;
      to &quot;try to make yourself unconscious&quot;. The volunteer can increase the effect site&#xD;
      concentration by 0.2 mcg/ml with each successful double press (up to a maximum of 3 mcg/ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A double press will only be successful once between reaction time measurements and provided&#xD;
      blood and brain concentrations of propofol have equilibrated to within 10% of each other and&#xD;
      provided reaction time does not become more prolonged than 150% of the baseline value. In&#xD;
      this case no further drug increments will be permitted and effect site concentration will be&#xD;
      maintained at the same level for two minutes after which time a successful demand press would&#xD;
      only occur if reaction time became less than 150% again. In addition an even more prolonged&#xD;
      reaction time of greater than 200% from baseline would actually lead to a reduction in effect&#xD;
      site concentration of propofol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the volunteer becomes unresponsive to verbal command or reaches the set maximum effect&#xD;
      site concentration of 3 mcg/ml, or in the unlikely event the volunteer desaturates to a level&#xD;
      below 90% or shows any other signs of respiratory depression, the infusion will be ended. The&#xD;
      volunteer will be looked after by the anaesthetist (ensuring that the airway is maintained,&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen is given and ventilation is adequate) until awake and responsive to&#xD;
      speech and at this point they will be taken to the sedation suite recovery room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Otherwise the sedation period will end after a 30 minute period or once the device has&#xD;
      decreased the brain concentration of propofol on three successive occasions (due to reaction&#xD;
      time slowing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteer will then be transferred to a recovery area, where they will be monitored until&#xD;
      ready for discharge according to sedation suite criteria. Just prior to discharge volunteers&#xD;
      will complete a short questionnaire to assess recall and satisfaction (see supplements).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As stated on volunteer information leaflet, volunteers can withdraw from the study at any&#xD;
      time without giving a reason and without their care being in any way affected.&#xD;
