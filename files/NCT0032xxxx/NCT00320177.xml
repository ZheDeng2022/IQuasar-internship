    <textblock>
      This study will explore the eating habits of children and determine if eating behavior is&#xD;
      linked to genetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children between 8 and 17 years of age may be eligible for this study. It will include&#xD;
      children who have experienced loss of control over eating, children who report overeating&#xD;
      without loss of control, and children who report experiencing neither of the above.&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened with the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and brief physical examination, including height, weight, and body fat&#xD;
           measurements. Body fat is measured using a device called a Bod Pod. The child sits&#xD;
           inside the device for about 5 minutes and the machine determines body fat by measuring&#xD;
           air movement. The child must wear a tight-fitting swimsuit for this test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine test to look for sugar or protein in the urine and to test for pregnancy in&#xD;
           females.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests for routine chemistries and for gene studies related to eating behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires and interviews about the child's general health and eating habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acclimatization to test meal conditions for the study. The child is given a yogurt shake&#xD;
           to drink and fills out rating scales before and after the drink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will come to the Clinical Center two times at 8:30 a.m. for laboratory meal&#xD;
      testing. At each visit, the child will do the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the morning, eat a breakfast of apple juice and a buttered English muffin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., pursue activities at the Clinical Center recreation facility&#xD;
           or the NIH classroom, but may not eat or drink anything that contains calories.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 2 p.m., fill out rating scales about his or her hunger level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 2:30 p.m., eat from a food buffet that will be made available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After eating, repeat rating scales about hunger level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure for both visits will be the same, except at one visit the child will be&#xD;
      instructed to eat as much as you would eat at a normal meal, and at the other visit, the&#xD;
      instruction will be to let yourself go and eat as much as you want.&#xD;

      Little is known about the eating habits of children under laboratory conditions. In this&#xD;
      exploratory study, we aim to examine the relationships between measured food intake during&#xD;
      meals, binge eating behaviors as assessed by interview, and polymorphisms in genes believed&#xD;
      to be involved in the regulation of energy intake. We will study children who report they&#xD;
      have experienced loss of control over eating, children who report overeating without loss of&#xD;
      control, and children who report neither of these episodes, and assess the impact of two&#xD;
      different meal instructions on their eating behavior. We will ask children to eat a meal in&#xD;
      the laboratory setting on two occasions. The only difference between the two meals will be a&#xD;
      pre-meal instruction: Participants will be asked either to eat 'normally' (the 'normal meal'&#xD;
      instruction) or to 'let yourself go' (the 'binge meal' instruction). Participants will be&#xD;
      assessed for affective state; degree of hunger, fullness, and desire to binge; presence of&#xD;
      overeating or loss of control; eating attitudes and dieting; and general school and social&#xD;
      adjustment. Participants' DNA will be sequenced to seek polymorphisms in genes relevant for&#xD;
      appetite, such as the leptin and melanocortin 4 receptor genes, to examine whether genetic&#xD;
      variation in the leptin signaling pathway can account for variation in reported or actual&#xD;
      eating behaviors. Samples will also be obtained for hormones believed to be relevant for food&#xD;
      intake. By accurately describing eating behavior in children in relation to their age,&#xD;
      weight, history of dieting and/or overeating behavior, and genetic variation, we can refine&#xD;
      current theoretical models of disordered eating.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Good general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than 7 and less than 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have negative urine glucose and normal electrolytes, hepatic, and&#xD;
             thyroid function or they will be referred for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any major medical problem likely to affect caloric intake (e.g., significant cardiac&#xD;
             or pulmonary disease likely to result in hypoxia or decreased perfusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of an eating disorder, other than binge eating disorder, or a current&#xD;
             psychiatric disorder. Identification of any such illness will lead to immediate&#xD;
             referral to a mental health professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent weight change of greater than 5 lbs. within the previous three (3) months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy. If a potential participant is found to be pregnant, we will inform the&#xD;
             child, as an 'emancipated minor,' and let her inform her parent(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who have, or whose parent or guardians have, current substance abuse or a&#xD;
             diagnosed psychiatric disorder or other condition that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigators, would impede competence or compliance or possibly hinder completion of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants currently prescribed SSRI's neuroleptics, tricyclics, stimulants, or any&#xD;
             medication likely to affect caloric intake. Recent use (with six months) of weight&#xD;
             loss medications.&#xD;
