  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Failure to thrive and difficulty gaining weight is a sign of uncompensated congestive heart&#xD;
      failure (CHF). Infants with Trisomy 21 and complete atrioventricular canal defects (CAVC)&#xD;
      frequently develop uncompensated CHF and weight gain failure pre-operatively. A weight of 5&#xD;
      kg has been suggested as optimal for timing of CAVC repair. A delay in surgical repair often&#xD;
      occurs if weight gain stalls and reaches a plateau prior to reaching 5 kg. A retrospective&#xD;
      review performed by Kogon, et al, of children undergoing surgery for VSD at CHOA at Egleston&#xD;
      recently reported that age and weight at surgery may not, however, be associated with adverse&#xD;
      surgical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal timing for surgical correction of CAVC&#xD;
      in Trisomy 21 infants based on reaching a plateau of failed weight gain despite maximal&#xD;
      anti-congestive and nutritional therapy.&#xD;

      A retrospective chart review of 100 infants with Trisomy 21 and CAVC operated at CHOA at&#xD;
      Egleston between January 1, 2001 and March 24, 2006 will be performed. Graphs of birth weight&#xD;
      and rate of weight gain over time will be plotted for each patient and for the group as a&#xD;
      whole. The point of reaching a plateau of weight gain will be decided for each patient and&#xD;
      indexed for birth weight. Medical management will be detailed, i.e. all medications and all&#xD;
      dietary information (caloric density of formula, route of administration). This medical&#xD;
      management will be indexed as a function on the weight gain chart. Medical complications&#xD;
      (such as respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, hospitalizations, and additional&#xD;
      non-cardiac medications) will likewise be plotted and segmented according to position&#xD;
      relative to the weight gain plateau. Age at eventual surgery and whether surgical date was&#xD;
      delayed by complications will be noted. Surgical cardiopulmonary bypass time and morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality will be noted. Postoperative length of ventilator support, length of stay in&#xD;
      the CICU and total length of stay will be determined and also displayed as a function of body&#xD;
      weight and as a function of time at plateau weight. Postoperative morbidity and mortality for&#xD;
      the three months after repair will be noted, including all cause hospital re-admissions and&#xD;
      outpatient medical complications (such as respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, and the&#xD;
      need for continued medications for CHF).&#xD;
