      The use of performance status and LDH in combination can predict patient survival more&#xD;
      accurately than physician clinical impression or the patients' own feelings about their&#xD;
      survival&#xD;

      Patients with incurable cancer frequently ask their doctors for an estimate of survival. Such&#xD;
      estimates can assist patients in making decisions about how best to spend their time and&#xD;
      energy. Survival estimates are also required when considering patients with incurable cancer&#xD;
      for experimental treatments. However, such estimates are difficult to make. There is some&#xD;
      data to suggest that a simple clinical measure, the performance status, combined with a&#xD;
      laboratory blood test, the LDH, may assist in making the survival estimate more realistic.&#xD;
      This study is designed to test if this is the case, using patients with metastatic lung,&#xD;
      breast, colorectal, prostate, or pancreatic cancer or patients with cancer of unknown primary&#xD;
      who have exhausted life-prolonging therapy. These patients will be asked to consent to&#xD;
      entering this study. Their performance status will be assessed by the Karnofsky and WHO&#xD;
      scales, they will be asked to have their blood tested for LDH and they and their doctor will&#xD;
      be asked to estimate their survival. After study entry they will be allowed to receive&#xD;
      palliative radiotherapy, surgery or systemic therapy as indicated including protocol&#xD;
      treatment. After study entry, the only other requirement is that the date of the patients&#xD;
      death be reported so that the duration of survival can be compared with the doctors and&#xD;
      patients estimate and correlated with the performance status and LDH.&#xD;
