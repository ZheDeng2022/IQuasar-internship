  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and disproportionately prevalent in&#xD;
      patients with kidney disease. Spironolactone has been shown to improve survival in the&#xD;
      general population with heart failure by up to 30%. We wish to study the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of aldosterone blockade with spironolactone on cardiac function in a high risk&#xD;
      population of patients on hemodialysis. We will study and closely monitor subjects over a&#xD;
      period of 12 months, during which they will be receiving spironolactone for a period of 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They must understand the study purpose and give their written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They must have been stable on chronic hemodialysis for at least three months before&#xD;
             enrollment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemodialysis subjects will be included if they have had a left ventricular ejection&#xD;
             fraction measured within the past six months with a value no more than 45 percent. A&#xD;
             repeat, standardized echocardiogram will be used to confirm left ventricular ejection&#xD;
             fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with primary operable valvular heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a congenital heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with unstable angina.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with primary hepatic failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with active cancer or any life-threatening disease (other than heart failure&#xD;
             or end-stage renal disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have undergone heart transplantation or who are awaiting heart&#xD;
             transplantation are also ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects on a renal transplant list will be accepted into the study until the time of&#xD;
             successful renal transplantation and termination of dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with habitually difficult to control hyperkalemia (serum potassium &gt;6.0&#xD;
             meq/L) in the previous month while on dialysis will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The inability to complete the 6-minute walk test will not be a reason to exclude&#xD;
             subjects from this study.&#xD;
