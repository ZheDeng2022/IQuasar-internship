  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study that aims to investigate prospectively a new therapy for a cohort of&#xD;
      patients with chronic pain attributed to pancreatic cancer. The justification of this study&#xD;
      is that the pain is the most important factor for the quality of life of these patients and&#xD;
      rTMS has been shown to be significantly associated with pain improvement in patients with&#xD;
      abdominal pain due to chronic pancreatitis. This therapeutic trial will be a 10-day,&#xD;
      randomized, parallel-group design, double-blind, incomplete cross-over, placebo controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial conducted at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The principal aim of this&#xD;
      investigation is the study of pain after a therapeutic intervention. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      pain reduction indexed by pain reduction and or analgesic intake reduction. The second aim of&#xD;
      the study is to assess the safety this new treatment in patients with pancreatic cancer. The&#xD;
      third aim of this study is to investigate whether rTMS treatment is associated with a change&#xD;
      in the activity of right secondary somatosensory cortex using magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopy. Because patients with locally advanced or advanced pancreatic cancer often&#xD;
      require increasing doses of narcotic pain medications, such as morphine, oxycodone and&#xD;
      fentanyl, in order to control their pain, adverse side effects are frequent observed in this&#xD;
      population of patients. Therefore rTMS treatment might represent a new therapeutic approach&#xD;
      that might be useful not only for pancreatic cancer but also to other types of cancer.&#xD;

      The primary aim of this protocol is to investigate a possible novel treatment for visceral&#xD;
      pain in patients with locally advanced or advanced pancreatic cancer. Pain is a major&#xD;
      contributor to the poor quality of life in patients with pancreatic cancer. Most patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced or advanced pancreatic cancer have abdominal pain that requires&#xD;
      treatment with increasing doses of narcotic pain medication. The refractory nature of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer pain to pharmacologic therapy led us to hypothesize that one mechanism&#xD;
      leading to pain in these patients is dysfunction of brain cortical regulation of visceral&#xD;
      sensation. This notion is supported by the finding that deep electrical stimulation of the&#xD;
      brain can produce pain relief in patients with intractable pain due to progressive cancers of&#xD;
      various types. In addition, patients with pancreatitis, a non-malignant pancreatic condition&#xD;
      causing chronic pain, can continue to experience disabling pain even after total&#xD;
      pancreatectomy. These finding suggests that pain symptoms in pancreatic cancer can be&#xD;
      sustained by a pancreas-independent, neural-based mechanisms in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visceral sensation is processed in the secondary somatosensory area (SII). Therefore,&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer pain may be sustained by dysfunction of SII rather than by local effects of&#xD;
      the cancer alone. We hypothesize further, that dysfunction of SII is one of&#xD;
      hyper-excitability. According to this hypothesis, suppression of SII activity may help&#xD;
      control the pain in patients with pancreatic cancer and may provide synergy with&#xD;
      pharmacologic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temporary inhibition of SII activity can be obtained by a novel, non-invasive procedure&#xD;
      called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS can suppress brain excitability beyond&#xD;
      the duration of the direct application of TMS if appropriate stimulation parameters are&#xD;
      utilized. This hypothesis is supported by a sham controlled, double blind pilot trial of 5&#xD;
      subjects with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis: active rTMS applied to SII resulted in&#xD;
      significant pain improvement in three of the subjects while sham did not provide any benefit&#xD;
      in any of these patients. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that stimulation of other&#xD;
      brain areas, such as the dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex, can modulate acute, experimentally&#xD;
      invoked pain (Graff-Guerrero et al 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will rigorously test the hypothesis that pain due to pancreatic cancer is sustained by&#xD;
      dysfunction of SII characterized by hyperexcitability through two specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The first aim of this study is to examine whether 1Hz repetitive TMS (rTMS) applied to&#xD;
           SII for ten days during two consecutive weeks in patients with abdominal pain due to&#xD;
           pancreatic cancer has an analgesic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The primary outcome for this aim is the difference in pain score level on the&#xD;
                Visual Analogue Scale at Day 11 and at Day 28 compared to the week before rTMS. The&#xD;
                null hypothesis is that there is no difference in pain score between pre and&#xD;
                post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The secondary outcome for this aim is to assess the difference in the use of&#xD;
                narcotics for pain control on Day 11 and Day 28 compared to Day 1. The null&#xD;
                hypothesis is that there is no difference in narcotic use (in IV morphine&#xD;
                equivalency units) between pre and post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second aim of the study is to assess the safety of rTMS in patients with pancreatic&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The third aim of this study is to investigate whether rTMS treatment is associated with&#xD;
           a change in the activity of right SII using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Therefore&#xD;
           we will compare the levels of these substances between the two different time points&#xD;
           (baseline and post-treatment) and between left and right SII. We expect a decrease in&#xD;
           the excitatory neurotransmitters levels (Glutamine - Glx) in the stimulated area as a&#xD;
           result of the inhibitory rTMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY In a pilot study of chronic pancreatitis patients, no subject experienced adverse&#xD;
      effects from a single session of rTMS. Subjects in an ongoing study of a 10-day course or&#xD;
      rTMS in chronic pancreatitis patients also have not experienced adverse events (10 patients&#xD;
      thus far). Fifteen-day courses of rTMS have been used for the treatment of various&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric diseases without any complications if safety guidelines are carefully&#xD;
      followed. We will adhere to the current safety recommendations for rTMS endorsed by the&#xD;
      International Society for Transcranial Stimulation and the International Federation for&#xD;
      Clinical Neurophysiology. Therefore, we hypothesize that the proposed rTMS protocol will be&#xD;
      safe for our patient population.&#xD;
