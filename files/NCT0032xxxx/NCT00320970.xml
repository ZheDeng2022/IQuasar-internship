  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic nephropathy is a frequent microvascular complication that occurs in approximately&#xD;
      40% of patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The most common cause of end-stage&#xD;
      renal disease (ESRD) in the United States and in the developed world is diabetic nephropathy.&#xD;
      Currently, more than half the United States ESRD population has diabetes. More effective&#xD;
      therapies to prevent and treat diabetic nephropathy are urgently needed. One way to increase&#xD;
      therapeutic effectiveness is to refine treatment targets based on improved understanding of&#xD;
      how treatments modulate disease processes. The purpose of this study is to determine whether&#xD;
      a treatment for diabetic nephropathy, the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan, modifies&#xD;
      mediators of kidney injury independent of blood pressure and the relationships to drug dose.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is a potent inducer of extracellular matrix&#xD;
      production and of fibrogenesis and has been associated with the occurrence of diabetic micro-&#xD;
      and macrovascular complications. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have implicated&#xD;
      TGF-beta 1 in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease. Recent animal and in vitro&#xD;
      experiments have demonstrated that ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II (AT-II) receptor&#xD;
      antagonists, including candesartan, decrease the synthesis and secretion of renal TGF-beta 1&#xD;
      and prevent the development of glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and progressive&#xD;
      renal dysfunction. These protective effects appear to be unrelated to the antihypertensive&#xD;
      effects of the agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limited data in humans have supported these findings in patients with diabetic nephropathy. A&#xD;
      recent human study with the AT-II receptor antagonist losartan demonstrated that the ability&#xD;
      to correct microalbuminuria was independent of blood pressure control and correlated with&#xD;
      normalization of circulating levels of TGF-beta 1. The results were further supported by the&#xD;
      observation that markers of collagen type 1 metabolism were normalized in hypertensives in&#xD;
      whom TGF-beta 1 was normalized with treatment but remained unaltered in the remaining&#xD;
      hypertensives despite blood pressure control. Such findings are consistent with the recent&#xD;
      observation that the AT-II receptor antagonist irbesartan is renoprotective independently of&#xD;
      its blood pressure-lowering effect in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of ACE-inhibitors and AT-II receptor antagonists as a means to reduce progression of&#xD;
      renal fibrosis is becoming increasingly widespread. Dosage recommendations to achieve this&#xD;
      goal are unclear prompting some experts to ask whether TGF-beta 1 rather than blood pressure&#xD;
      should be a therapeutic target. Although not verified under chronic conditions, previous&#xD;
      short-term studies with the AT-II antagonist candesartan have demonstrated different&#xD;
      dose-response relationships to exist for blood pressure, renal plasma flow, and plasma renin&#xD;
      activity. It is likely that dose-response relationship differences also exist between the&#xD;
      aforementioned parameters (particularly blood pressure) and TGF-beta 1. In type 1 diabetic&#xD;
      patients treated with captopril a relationship was demonstrated between percent change in&#xD;
      plasma TGF-beta 1 and percent decline in GFR. In another study of 21 patients with a baseline&#xD;
      GFR of &lt;75 ml/min there was a striking correlation between the captopril-induced reduction in&#xD;
      serum TGF-beta 1 and 2-year change in GFR (r = -0.73, p =0.0001). This latter observation is&#xD;
      particularly important in demonstrating that the relationship between TGF-beta 1 and rate of&#xD;
      decline in kidney function can be modified through pharmacologic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosage range for candesartan according to the FDA approved package insert is 4 to 32 mg&#xD;
      daily, adjusted based on blood pressure response. Whether the dose that effectively lowers&#xD;
      blood pressure is sufficient to suppress urinary TGF-beta 1 concentrations is unknown. In the&#xD;
      absence of data, many experts are already suggesting doses higher than needed to control&#xD;
      hypertension. Including a maximum dose of candesartan 64 mg in a dose titration scheme will&#xD;
      be important to help resolve this issue. Furthermore, it is unclear if the candesartan&#xD;
      dose/concentration - effect relationship for TGF-beta 1 and blood pressure are dissimilar.&#xD;
      Information regarding the relationship between candesartan dose and effect on urinary&#xD;
      TGF-beta 1 concentrations in patients with diabetic nephropathy would be valuable in&#xD;
      tailoring therapy and enhancing our understanding of the optimal use of agents that modulate&#xD;
      the renin-angiotensin system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data in experimental models of diabetes indicate that the renin angiotensin system&#xD;
      interacts with advanced glycation end products (AGEs) to produce kidney damage in diabetes.&#xD;
      ACE inhibition in diabetic rats reduced circulating and renal accumulation of AGEs, possibly&#xD;
      by increasing expression of the soluble receptor for AGEs. In a rat model of normoglycemia&#xD;
      with AGE infusion, increased kidney expression of renin angiotensin system components along&#xD;
      with structural changes similar to those in diabetic models was observed. Renin angiotensin&#xD;
      system activation and kidney structural changes were reversed by valsartan. Therefore,&#xD;
      modulation of AGEs may also be an important mechanism of kidney protection by renin&#xD;
      angiotensin system inhibition in diabetes. This hypothesis is unexplored in humans. An&#xD;
      exploratory sub-study will assess whether candesartan reduces urinary excretion of&#xD;
      carboxymethyllysine, a prominent AGE, in patients with diabetic nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this study is to provide information that will improve kidney health&#xD;
      in patients with diabetes. In a population of patients with type 2 diabetes, nephropathy, and&#xD;
      hypertension the following hypotheses will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Changes in parameters of blood pressure, urinary TGF-beta 1, serum AT-II, and urinary&#xD;
           albumin demonstrate correlation with changes in chronic candesartan dose and serum&#xD;
           concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The candesartan dose and concentration response curves for BP and urinary TGF-beta 1 are&#xD;
           significantly different and not predictive of one another.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Candesartan treatment will reduce urinary excretion of carboxymethyllysine.&#xD;
