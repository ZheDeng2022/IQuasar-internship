  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ragweed MATAMPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for&#xD;
      patients with hypersensitivity to ragweed pollen (hay fever). This novel formulation is&#xD;
      designed to provide a vaccine that will be efficacious with only four escalating dose&#xD;
      injections administered before the start of the pollen season. In this Follow-up Study the&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed by exposing allergic subjects to Ragweed pollen in an environmental&#xD;
      exposure chamber EEC. Patient symptomatic response to pollen and patient quality of life in&#xD;
      the EEC will be determined. Patients who previously completed two EEC portions of study&#xD;
      Ragweed MATAMPL 204 and who had been treated with either Ragweed MATA MPL or Placebo before&#xD;
      the 2005 ragweed season will be enrolled.&#xD;

             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
