    <textblock>
      In this study we are comparing two forms of radiotherapy. This study is being done because it&#xD;
      is not clear at present time whether intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) can reduce side&#xD;
      effects of radiotherapy compared to standard radiotherapy (called 3D-Conformal Radiotherapy).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Radical radiation therapy plays an important role in the management of prostate cancer,&#xD;
      yielding comparable long-term outcomes to surgery. Unfortunately, long term disease free&#xD;
      survival data using PSA criteria have shown that less than 50% of high-risk patients are free&#xD;
      of disease at 10 years. To improve on the results of conventional dose radiotherapy dose&#xD;
      escalation with three-dimensional conformal radiation has been employed. Due to the irregular&#xD;
      shape of the prostate and the variable motion of this organ there is substantial radiation of&#xD;
      adjacent normal surrounding tissue during treatment which results in radiation-induced&#xD;
      toxicity. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a new form of radiation therapy.&#xD;
      Preliminary evidence suggests that IMRT improves the dose distribution during radiation&#xD;
      therapy of the prostate. The hypothesis of this study is that IMRT delivered using Helical&#xD;
      Tomotherapy can reduce late toxicity of radical radiotherapy as compared to three-dimensional&#xD;
      conformal radiation (3DCRT) in high-risk prostate cancer patients.&#xD;
