  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to develop an easily performed test to detect Group B&#xD;
      Streptococcus (GBS) in pregnant women at the time of delivery, which would allow health care&#xD;
      providers to make an accurate and rapid decision regarding the administration of antibiotics.&#xD;
      Administering antibiotics during delivery reduces significantly the likelihood of&#xD;
      transmission of GBS, a bacterium that can cause severe life-threatening disease in newborns.&#xD;
      Three hundred and twenty pregnant females between 18 to 44 years of age, who are admitted for&#xD;
      delivery at the time of consent, will be recruited at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de&#xD;
      Quebec. Participation involves being observed for 30 minutes. The research nurse will obtain&#xD;
      2 vaginal/anal samples using standard techniques. One sample will be used to detect GBS with&#xD;
      the approved BD GeneOhm StrepB assay and the other sample will be used for the development of&#xD;
      the new point-of-care rapid detection GBS test.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Group B Streptococcus (GBS), also known as Streptococcus agalactiae, is a gram-positive&#xD;
      diplococcus originally known for causing bovine mastitis and was not demonstrated to be a&#xD;
      human pathogen until 1938. In the 1970s, GBS emerged as the leading cause of neonatal&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. GBS causes severe invasive disease in newborns. Approximately 80% of&#xD;
      infections in young infants occur within the first week of life and are thus designated as&#xD;
      early-onset disease. Late-onset infections usually occur in infants between 1 week and 3&#xD;
      months of age. Young infants with invasive GBS disease usually have sepsis or pneumonia but&#xD;
      may, though less frequently, present with meningitis, osteomyelitis, or septic arthritis.&#xD;
      Bloodstream infections, with or without pneumonia, are the main manifestation of neonatal GBS&#xD;
      disease and are observed in approximately 90% of cases, while meningitis occurs in around&#xD;
      10%. Most early-onset disease results from ascending spread of GBS into the amniotic fluid,&#xD;
      which leads to neonatal colonization and to invasive disease in some infants. Perinatal&#xD;
      transmission of the organism can occur through both ruptured and intact membranes.&#xD;
      Transmission from mother to child has been reported to be 29 times higher in GBS-colonized&#xD;
      mothers than in noncolonized mothers. The new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#xD;
      guidelines recommend universal prenatal culture-based screening for GBS colonization in all&#xD;
      pregnant women. A more sensitive rapid-screening test for GBS that could accurately detect&#xD;
      women who carry GBS at the time of delivery would obviate the need for prenatal screening&#xD;
      while reducing the risk associated with the use of intrapartum prophylaxis with antibotics in&#xD;
      non-colonized women. The main objective of the study is to develop and optimize a micro TAS&#xD;
      prototype for rapid GBS detection directly from vaginal/anal specimens using swabs collected&#xD;
      from pregnant women admitted for delivery. It is expected that this diagnostic system can&#xD;
      replace the current &quot;gold standard&quot; which is microbiological culture in selective media for&#xD;
      determining GBS colonization. Specific objectives of this study include: (1) analytical&#xD;
      sensitivity of the micro TAS prototype (number of GBS colony forming units detected per&#xD;
      vaginal/anal specimen) will be determined by using prospectively collected vaginal/anal&#xD;
      specimens positive for GBS as well as negative vaginal/anal specimens that will be spiked&#xD;
      with various numbers of GBS cells; (2) specificity of the micro TAS prototype (ability to&#xD;
      detect specifically GBS nucleotide sequences without detecting other microbial species or&#xD;
      human sequences) will be determined by using GBS-negative vaginal/anal specimens and; (3)&#xD;
      sample analysis and performance of the micro TAS prototype will be compared to clinical&#xD;
      samples with FDA-approved BD GeneOhm StrepB assay . Study participants will include 320&#xD;
      pregnant females between 18 to 44 years of age, who are admitted to the Centre Hospitalier&#xD;
      Universitaire de Québec for delivery. Participation involves being observed for 30 minutes.&#xD;
      The research nurse will obtain 2 vaginal/anal samples using standard techniques. One sample&#xD;
      will be used to detect GBS with the approved BD GeneOhm StrepB assay and the other sample&#xD;
      will be used for the development of the new point-of-care rapid detection GBS test.&#xD;
