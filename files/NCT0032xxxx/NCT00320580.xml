  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the bleeding profile of norelgestromin/ethinyl&#xD;
      estradiol given in an extended continuous regimen to norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol given&#xD;
      in a traditional cyclic regimen&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol is a contraceptive patch shown to be safe and effective for&#xD;
      the prevention of pregnancy. The usual treatment regimen is three consecutive seven-day&#xD;
      patches followed by one patch-free week. This cyclic method is followed in order to mimic the&#xD;
      28-day menstrual cycle. An extended contraceptive regimen (administration of active hormones&#xD;
      for greater than 21 days) of oral contraceptives is a common practice among women wishing to&#xD;
      delay or prevent withdrawal bleeding for reasons such as athletic participation or going on&#xD;
      vacation. In addition to the convenience of reducing the frequency of withdrawal bleeds,&#xD;
      elimination of the hormone-free interval reportedly reduces many menstrually-related symptoms&#xD;
      (headaches, pelvic pain, breast tenderness, bloating, swelling) that occur at a greater&#xD;
      frequency during the hormone-free interval than during the rest of the cycle. Headache is one&#xD;
      of the most common adverse effects associated with hormonal contraceptive use. Studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that headaches were reduced in subjects using extended intervals of active&#xD;
      hormone. However, one of the main side effects reported with extended regimens is&#xD;
      breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting. Compared to cyclic regimens, extended oral&#xD;
      contraceptive use may be associated with an increased incidence of breakthrough bleeding and&#xD;
      spotting, especially during the first few months of use. This is a randomized (patients are&#xD;
      assigned different treatments based on chance), open-label, multicenter study comparing the&#xD;
      bleeding profile of norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol patch continuous regimen to&#xD;
      norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol patch cyclic regimen. Safety evaluations include adverse&#xD;
      event reporting, physical examinations, blood levels, and vital signs. The hypothesis of the&#xD;
      study is that norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol in an extended regimen of 84 days of active&#xD;
      hormone would result in fewer days and episodes of bleeding compared to a traditional cyclic&#xD;
      regimen of norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol. Patients receive norelgestromin/ethinyl&#xD;
      estradiol patches in a plastic sleeve. In the extended regimen patches will be applied weekly&#xD;
      for 12 consecutive weeks followed by one week patch-free and then another three consecutive&#xD;
      weeks of weekly patch applications. In the cyclic regimen patches will be applied for four&#xD;
      consecutive cycles where each cycle consists of three weekly patch applications followed by&#xD;
      one week patch-free. The total duration of treatment period is 112 days for each regimen.&#xD;
