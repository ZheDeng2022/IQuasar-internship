  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During their hospitalization, burn patients frequently require dressing changes that may be&#xD;
      painful. Deep analgesia and sedation are used but carry the risk of remnant somnolence and&#xD;
      other effects of anesthesia such as dizziness and nausea/vomiting. All these side effects may&#xD;
      delay refeeding after the procedure, ambulation and physical therapy. Drugs from the opioid&#xD;
      class are used to relieve pain during these procedures. Morphine with its slow onset and&#xD;
      remnant sedation is difficult to use in these patients. Pro-emetic properties and histamine&#xD;
      liberating effects also make this drug non optimal for iterative procedures. Fentanyl, a&#xD;
      synthetic opioid with shorter onset and lower incidence of nausea and vomiting, is the&#xD;
      standard drug used in dressing changes in burn patients. It is metabolized by hepatic&#xD;
      glucoconjugation. Remifentanil, a well known novel opioid, that has a unique metabolism&#xD;
      independent from renal or hepatic functions, is metabolized by a non specific esterase. It&#xD;
      has a very short half-life (3.5 minutes) and should therefore be administered as a continuous&#xD;
      infusion. The investigators hypothesized that the use of remifentanil for daily burn dressing&#xD;
      changes is associated with less pain during procedures and faster recovery. Studied patients&#xD;
      will be the ones requiring iterative dressing change procedures under sedation. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint will be the maximal pain during the procedure. Secondary endpoints will be: average&#xD;
      pain during and after the procedure; subjective sensation of comfort; total amount of opioids&#xD;
      received; times to feeding after the procedure and ambulation after the procedure; comfort of&#xD;
      the procedure according to the nurses; mobilisation according to the physical therapist; and&#xD;
      safety of the analgesia technique. The study will be conducted according to the&#xD;
      recommendations of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) that have been endorsed by&#xD;
      the Canadian Anaesthetists' Society (CAS). All patients who consent will fast for at least 6&#xD;
      hours before the procedure. The two following regimens will be compared: a bolus infusion of&#xD;
      fentanyl, starting with 1 µg/kg, followed by 0.5 µg/kg as needed every 5 to 10 minutes versus&#xD;
      continuous infusion of remifentanil adapted to ensure analgesia. The initial dose of&#xD;
      remifentanil will be 0.1 µg/kg/min to be adjusted between 0.05 µg/kg/min and 2 µg/kg/min. To&#xD;
      allow blinding during the study, patients will receive a double-blinded protocol with sham&#xD;
      (normal saline) in one arm. In other words: for each procedure, the patient will always&#xD;
      receive boluses, either of fentanyl or saline, and a perfusion, either of remifentanil or&#xD;
      saline. According to power calculations, 30 patients will be necessary to achieve the primary&#xD;
      end-points. The investigators plan to enroll 40 patients in the study to allow for some drop&#xD;
      outs and to increase their statistical power.&#xD;
