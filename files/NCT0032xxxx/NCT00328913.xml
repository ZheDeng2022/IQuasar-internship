  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to show evidence of the efficacy of 5-HTP to induce satiety and to&#xD;
      reduce food intake (confirmatory study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the present study is to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the effectiveness of a 5-HTP preparation on satiety markers (before intake of a meal and&#xD;
           during the day)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the present study are to determine the effectiveness of a 5-HTP&#xD;
      preparation on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  food consumption (amount and composition) during a free meal (dinner);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  wellness after one week supplementation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the intermeal interval;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body weight and waist-hip ratio (WHR).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      One of the physiological factors regulating the food intake pattern is satiety. Satiety is&#xD;
      defined as the absence of ingestive motivation, which ends when the next meal is initiated&#xD;
      (Blundell et al., 1996). Food intake affects a number of physiological objective parameters&#xD;
      in blood known to be involved in signalling satiety, such as glucose (Melanson et al, 1999;&#xD;
      Chapman et al, 1999; Campfield et al, 1996), insulin (Speechly et al, 2000) and&#xD;
      cholecystokinin (CCK) (Gutzwiller et al., 2000; Beglinger et al., 2001; French et al., 2000;&#xD;
      Degen et al., 2001; Burton-Freeman et al., 2002, 2004). More recently, the gastric hormone&#xD;
      ghrelin was identified as a marker for hunger and meal initiation (De Graaf et al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Humans do not only eat in response to a metabolic or physiological need. Humans also respond&#xD;
      to a significant extent to other internal subjective and emotional signals (clues). The exact&#xD;
      relations between the physiological internal signals and subjective and emotional internal&#xD;
      signals are not known. Besides also external and social factors modulate&#xD;
      physiological-derived hunger and satiety signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though the regulation of food intake has been studied quite extensively, the underlying&#xD;
      mechanism is not elucidated yet and still new factors involved in this regulation are being&#xD;
      found. It is known that the macronutrients such as lipids, proteins and carbohydrates affect&#xD;
      satiety differently, but this mechanism is still not very clear either.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, more and more food supplements become available suggesting to affect hunger and&#xD;
      satiety sensations, resulting in the long-term in weight loss. For example dietary fibres are&#xD;
      known for their satiating effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The food supplement 5-HTP is used for this purpose as well. The food supplement, already&#xD;
      available in the United States and in Italy, has been investigated for multiple indications&#xD;
      such as migraine, depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia, hypertension, insomnia and obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different clinical studies have been performed with 5-HTP for more than three decades now.&#xD;
      With respect to lowering of food intake, 5-HTP has been studied as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5-HTP is an amino acid produced by the human body from the essential amino acid L-tryptophan,&#xD;
      which is found in food products. Its clinical value is the ability to increase production of&#xD;
      serotonin. As a potentially valuable supplement it has been used clinically for more than 30&#xD;
      years. 5-HTP occurs naturally in two places - the human body and the seeds of the Griffonia&#xD;
      simplicifolia, a West African medicinal plant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5-HTP is the amino acid precursor of serotonin. Normal levels of serotonin are important for&#xD;
      emotional well-being, may play a role in appetite suppression, and decreased carbohydrate and&#xD;
      fat intake. Only free plasma tryptophan can cross the blood brain barrier via a carrier&#xD;
      protein to enter the central nervous system (CNS). Once in the CNS, tryptophan is converted&#xD;
      to 5-HTP and then is decarboxylated to serotonin. The levels, and possible function, of&#xD;
      several neurotransmitters can be influenced by the supply of their dietary products. A&#xD;
      reduction in tryptophan has been correlated to a reduction in serotonin (Curcio et al.,&#xD;
      2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 5-HTP metabolism is then influenced by plasma tryptophan levels, which are related to&#xD;
      food intake. Serotonin synthesis is directly dependent on the availability of the specific&#xD;
      precursor tryptophan and on the nutritional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of 5-HTP intake on food intake and mood is based on the serotonin production.&#xD;
      Numerous studies have shown that long-term consumption of 5-HTP (levels up to 900 mg daily)&#xD;
      reduced food intake and resulted in weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study by Laboratoire Oenobiol with moderately overweight men aged 20-40 years,&#xD;
      given 50 or 150 mg 5-HTP half an hour before lunch and half an hour before dinner, a reduced&#xD;
      energy intake with 300 mg 5-HTP compared to placebo was found. This was supplied acutely on&#xD;
      one day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study reported a linear dose related effect, with significant food intake inhibition&#xD;
      effect with a 300 mg/day 5-HTP dose. The dose of 100 mg/day did not produce statistically&#xD;
      significant effects compared to placebo. However, 100 mg of 5-HTP could prove to be&#xD;
      sufficient if given under chronic administration conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study therefore subjects will be supplied with 100 mg 5-HTP daily for one&#xD;
      week. Hunger and satiety feelings, food intake and wellness will be investigated. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted with overweight women, assuming that this group of subjects will be the&#xD;
      target group.&#xD;
