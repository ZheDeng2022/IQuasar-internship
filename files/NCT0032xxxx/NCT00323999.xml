  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate bipolar equipment versus monopolar, and to see if there&#xD;
      is any differences between the two types of bipolar equipment espescially regading both&#xD;
      safety and effect.&#xD;

      -  Trial design: A prospective randomised study with three arms, one arm with monopolar&#xD;
           surgery and two different arms with bipolar surgery. Its a one center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trial population: Pre-or perimenopausal women reffered to our clinic with bleeding&#xD;
           disorders and were we plan to do endometrial resection. Patients with a bleeding&#xD;
           disorder due to fibroids type 0 and 1 will be included and patients with polyps were&#xD;
           endometrial resection is planned at the same time will also be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative selection: The fibroids will be mapped using transvaginal ultrasound&#xD;
           according to the classification ESGE. Type 0 and 1 fibroids will be included. Diameter&#xD;
           of the fibroid must not extend 4cm. The endometrium size double layer will be recorded.&#xD;
           Uterine size anetrior /posterior diameter, longitudinal diameter (cavity; top fundal to&#xD;
           isthmus) will be measured. Were polyps are included these will be measured; length and&#xD;
           width. Higham score (PBAC), Se-hgb, Ferritin, FSH and Oestradiol will be documented at&#xD;
           all visits. Menstrual pain will be documented due to a VAS-scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment regimen:Randomisation in blocs of 20 between monopolar and two types of&#xD;
           bipolar surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical Technique: The cervical canal will be dilated to Hegar 10 or 11 and a rigid&#xD;
           resectoscope Ch. 26 is passed to the uterine cavity. Glycine 1,5% or Saline (Baxter) is&#xD;
           infused to irrigate the uterine cavity (Iglesias technique) Automatic pressure cuff&#xD;
           maintains an infusion pressure of 100mm Hg and suction 10-15mmHg is applied to the&#xD;
           outflow tube in order to achieve a sufficient flow.Fibroids type 0 and 1 are resected in&#xD;
           total if possible or flush to the plane of the uterine wall. The tissue chips are&#xD;
           removed at intervals by currette and forceps. The operation will be performed by&#xD;
           experienced surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary response variables: Safety is our primary response variable. Fluid absorption&#xD;
           and lowering of Se-Sodium will be analysed. These parameters are the only objective&#xD;
           parameters which can tell us about safety. Nausea will be reorded on a VAS-scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary resonse variables: Operating time, tissue removed, easisness of&#xD;
                operation, levels of vaginal bleeding measured by the methosd of Hgham(PBAC)before&#xD;
                and at follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 month and one year we will look at secondary intervention like repeated resection or&#xD;
      hysterectomy.&#xD;
