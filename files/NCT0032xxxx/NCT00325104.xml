  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the benefits and side effects of a new medication called Cinacalcet&#xD;
      for treating patients with primary hyperparathyroidism associated with multiple endocrine&#xD;
      neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) or type 2A (MEN2A). Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have&#xD;
      elevated levels of blood calcium caused by too much parathyroid hormone released by one or&#xD;
      more parathyroid tumors. The parathyroids are small glands located in the neck. Most cases of&#xD;
      primary hyperparathyroidism are due to a single overactive parathyroid gland, but in MEN1 and&#xD;
      MEN2A, several glands are overgrown and overactive. Cinacalcet decreases the secretion of&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with primary hyperparathyroidism and MEN1 or MEN2A and who&#xD;
      are not candidates for parathyroid surgery may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are admitted to the Clinical Center for 1 week blood and urine tests and imaging&#xD;
      studies, and initiation of Cinacalcet treatment. They take the drug by mouth and have daily&#xD;
      blood tests until the dosage required to achieve normal blood calcium levels is determined.&#xD;
      Patients return to the hospital 2 weeks later for 1 week to evaluate the response to the drug&#xD;
      and make any necessary adjustments. Treatment may continue for as long as 1 year with 1-week&#xD;
      admissions every 3 months to monitor the benefits and side effects of Cinacalcet. Evaluations&#xD;
      may include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of gastric acid secretion. For this test, a soft plastic tube is inserted&#xD;
           into the nose or mouth and then swallowed and then gently removed about an hour later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Injections of secretin, calcium and arginine into a vein and collection of blood samples&#xD;
           to measure the responding increase in levels of gastrin, calcitonin and insulin,&#xD;
           respectively. These tests are used to diagnose and monitor hormone secretion from&#xD;
           endocrine tumors and are used in this study to assess the response to Cinacalcet&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radioisotope test to evaluate tumors of the endocrine organs. A radioactive substance&#xD;
           injected into a vein is taken up by the endocrine tissue and the concentrated&#xD;
           radioactivity is measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging tests, such as MRI and CT, to detect or follow growing tumors in the pituitary,&#xD;
           neck, and abdomen. CT is a special type of x-ray machine that visualizes tissues, such&#xD;
           as thyroid or parathyroid tumors. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to obtain&#xD;
           pictures of different tissues in the head, neck and abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA scan to assess bone density. This test uses standard low-intensity x-rays.&#xD;

      This study will evaluate safety and efficacy of short- and long-term Cinacalcet in treatment&#xD;
      of hypercalcemia of familial primary hyperparathyroidism. The study population will include&#xD;
      patients with primary hyperparathyroidism caused by multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 or&#xD;
      type 2A. This is a prospective unblinded pilot study, where each patient will serve as&#xD;
      his/her own control. It will include 6 one-week-long admissions, over a 1 year period. Main&#xD;
      measurements will be tests of hyperparathyroidism such as parathyroid hormone and serum&#xD;
      calcium as well as tests of nonparathyroid tumors. The latter tests may include hormones&#xD;
      released by the tumors and images of the tumors.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Criteria for inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
