      This study will identify changes that occur in the part of the brain that controls hand&#xD;
      movements in patients with cervical (neck) dystonia. Patients with dystonia have muscle&#xD;
      spasms that cause abnormal postures while trying to perform a movement. In focal dystonia,&#xD;
      just one part of the body, such as the hand, neck or face, is involved. The study will&#xD;
      compare findings in healthy volunteers and patients with cervical dystonia to learn more&#xD;
      about the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and patients with cervical dystonia 18 years of age and older may be&#xD;
      eligible to participate. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical&#xD;
      examination. Participants undergo the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Somatosensory evoked potentials (Visits 1 and 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This test examines how sensory information travels from the nerves to the spinal cord and&#xD;
      brain. An electrode placed on an arm or leg delivers a small electrical stimulus and&#xD;
      additional electrodes placed on the scalp, neck and over the collarbone record how the&#xD;
      impulse from the stimulus travels over the nerve pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (Visits 2, 3 and 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This procedure maps brain function. A wire coil is held on the scalp. A brief electrical&#xD;
      current passes through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The&#xD;
      stimulation may cause a twitch in muscles of the face, arm, or leg, and the subject may hear&#xD;
      a click and feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nerve conduction studies (Visits 2, 3 and 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This test measures how fast nerves conduct electrical impulses and the strength of the&#xD;
      connection between the nerve and the muscle. Nerves are stimulated through small wire&#xD;
      electrodes attached to the skin and the response is recorded and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surface electromyography (Visits 2, 3 and 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrodes are placed on the front and back of the neck muscles to measure the electrical&#xD;
      activity of the muscles.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this proposal is to evaluate plasticity in patients with cervical&#xD;
      dystonia. Neither abnormal Hebbian nor non-Hebbian plasticity has been studied for cervical&#xD;
      dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific objectives are to show that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In patients with cervical dystonia, Hebbian plasticity can be induced by using paired&#xD;
           associative stimulation (PAS) of the dystonic sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) muscle&#xD;
           and will be enhanced compared to that of healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In patients with cervical dystonia, non-Hebbian plasticity can be induced by using&#xD;
           transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) of the dystonic SCM muscle and will&#xD;
           be enhanced compared to that of healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In patients with cervical dystonia, Hebbian and non-Hebbian plasticity can be induced by&#xD;
           dual stimulation (DS) of the dystonic SCM muscle, this effect will be greater than PAS&#xD;
           or TENS alone, and it will be enhanced compared to that of healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study 22 patients with cervical dystonia and 22 healthy subjects for a total of 44&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will participate in 4 different sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: clinical screening (1 hour) and sensory evoked potential (SEP) assessment (2 hours,&#xD;
      total of 3 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: PAS session of the target muscle and monitoring of cortical excitability before&#xD;
      (T0), immediately after (T1), 45 minutes after (T2) and 90 minutes after T(3) (Total of 4&#xD;
      hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: TENS session of the target muscle and monitoring of cortical excitability before&#xD;
      (T0), immediately after (T1), 45 minutes after (T2) and 90 minutes after T(3) (Total of 4&#xD;
      hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: DS session of the target and monitoring of cortical excitability before (T0),&#xD;
      immediately after (T1), 45 minutes after (T2) and 90 minutes after T(3) (Total of 4 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electrophysiological effects of the interventions will be assessed by the size of motor&#xD;
      evoked potentials (MEP), resting and active motor threshold (RMT and AMT), and a transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) input-output curve. The activity of intracortical interneurons&#xD;
      mediating long intracortical inhibition (LICI) will be assessed by paired-pulse TMS. The&#xD;
      effect of afferent input on intracortical processes (long afferent inhibition, LAI) will be&#xD;
      assessed by stimulating the skin overlying the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM).&#xD;
