  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nerve blocks for arm and hand surgery provide many advantages for patients including&#xD;
      excellent pain control and reduction in general anesthesia-related adverse effects.&#xD;
      Infraclavicular block is possibly the best method for performing regional anesthesia of the&#xD;
      arm because of the consistent anesthesia of the whole arm and low incidence of serious&#xD;
      adverse effects. Normally the anesthetist uses nerve stimulation to identify nerves supplying&#xD;
      the forearm and hand. Recent research has indicated that to improve success from 60% to 79%&#xD;
      two types of muscle stimulation must be sought before injection of local anesthetic. This can&#xD;
      be time consuming, requires a significant learning process, increases complications and&#xD;
      leaves 21% of patients with inadequate anesthesia requiring supplementation or general&#xD;
      anesthesia. More recently practitioners have been using ultrasound imaging to direct the&#xD;
      needle and watch local anesthetic spread around the nerves. Preliminary reports have&#xD;
      documented that this technique is associated with much greater success than the nerve&#xD;
      stimulation method. However a good quality study comparing the dual-endpoint infraclavicular&#xD;
      technique with an ultrasound-guided technique has not been performed. This randomized study&#xD;
      aims to rectify this deficiency by determining if ultrasound-guided infraclavicular block has&#xD;
      a significantly greater success than the current standard, dual end-endpoint nerve&#xD;
      stimulation technique.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing elective upper limb surgery at or below the elbow.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients aged &gt; 18 and &lt; 80 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ASA I-III.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI &lt; 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to read, write or speak English. (This is necessary because subjects will&#xD;
             have to follow detailed instructions to allow testing of motor and sensory function.&#xD;
             it is not feasible to have an interpreter present in the block room during performance&#xD;
             of these procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to brachial plexus block.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Existing neurological deficit in the area to be blocked.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known loco-regional malignancy or infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Coagulopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to local anesthetic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chest or shoulder deformities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe respiratory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healed but dislocated clavicle fracture.&#xD;
