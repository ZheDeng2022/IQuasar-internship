  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through the TRIAD Project: Pennsylvania Adolescent Intervention Research Study (PAIRStudy;&#xD;
      Project 3a) we aim to test the efficacy of a brief treatment aimed at treating depression and&#xD;
      family conflict among a population of adolescents with depression, and thereby reducing the&#xD;
      future chance of these adolescents initiating smoking. We will examine Attachment-Based&#xD;
      Family Therapy (ABFT) for the treatment of depression in comparison with Enhanced Usual Care&#xD;
      for Depression (EUCd). Reduction of depression will be measured by a clinically significant&#xD;
      reduction of score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Second, we will examine how&#xD;
      reduction of family conflict mediates the effect of ABFT on depression. The third aim will be&#xD;
      an exploratory look at the potential prevention of the onset of smoking. Specifically, we&#xD;
      will examine if reduction of depression and/or reductions in family conflict regardless of&#xD;
      treatment type reduces the initiation of smoking or reduces smoking behavior at 52 weeks.&#xD;
      These aims will be accomplished by randomizing 240 adolescents to one of two treatment&#xD;
      conditions: a) Attachment-Based Family Therapy or b) Enhanced Usual Care for Depression.&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the ABFT condition will receive 6-12 weeks of family therapy. Patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the EUCd condition will be referred for outpatient psychological services at an&#xD;
      agency that fits their geographic and financial needs. Research staff will help patients&#xD;
      navigate the referral process. All participating therapists will have carried out the full,&#xD;
      manualized treatment with 2-3 pilot cases prior to treating any randomized cases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TRIAD project aims to address the persistent and acute problem of depression in a&#xD;
      population largely made up of low-income disadvantaged youth. There are numerous treatment&#xD;
      studies available for depression, but few exist studying the treatment of depression via the&#xD;
      reduction of family conflict. Through this clinical trial, we aim to investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      of a treatment for depression for adolescents largely recruited through primary care. The&#xD;
      primary aim of this study is to test whether Attachment-Based Family Therapy reduces&#xD;
      depression more effectively than enhanced usual care for depression. Attachment-Based Family&#xD;
      Therapy (ABFT) is a manualized therapy designed exclusively for anxious and depressed&#xD;
      adolescents. Secondly, we intend to examine how reduction in family conflict mediates the&#xD;
      effect of ABFT on depression. We will, furthermore, examine whether reduction in depression&#xD;
      or reduction in family conflict, regardless of treatment type reduces the likelihood of&#xD;
      smoking initiation at one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These aims will be accomplished through a randomized clinical trial of 240 adolescents who&#xD;
      meet criteria for a DSM-IV depressive disorder (Major Depressive Disorder, Dysthymia, or&#xD;
      Depression NOS). Participants will be randomized into one of two treatment conditions. The&#xD;
      two treatment conditions are as follows: Attachment-based Family Therapy for depression or&#xD;
      Enhanced Usual Care for Depression. Treatment for Attachment-Based Family Therapy includes&#xD;
      anywhere from 6-12 sessions. Some of the 6-12 sessions will include the patient and or the&#xD;
      parent meeting alone with the therapists, others will include the family meeting together for&#xD;
      family therapy sessions. The Enhanced Usual Care condition will include referrals to outside&#xD;
      counseling or therapy, and the number of sessions will vary by patient and practitioner&#xD;
      desire. In addition to their treatment sessions, patients and their parents will be required&#xD;
      to complete intake, 6-week, 12-week, 26-week, and 52-week assessments. These assessments will&#xD;
      include a large battery of self-report measures covering numerous topics around family&#xD;
      conflict, risk-taking behavior (including smoking) and depression. The intake, 12, 26 and 52&#xD;
      week assessments will include a diagnostic interview. Additionally, bi-weekly for 12 weeks,&#xD;
      adolescent's will be asked to complete a brief set of questionnaires that will help monitor&#xD;
      their progress and safety.&#xD;
