  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Agents that increase HDL-C via reverse cholesterol transport could provide a new therapeutic&#xD;
      option for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to investigate the effects of LY518674 on components that may likely affect&#xD;
      atherogenesis in patients with the metabolic syndrome including HDL-C metabolism and reverse&#xD;
      cholesterol transport pathways, the inflammatory response, and oxidative stress in human&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an agonist of the nuclear peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) alpha,&#xD;
      LY518674 may affect the transcription of genes that encode various proteins involved in&#xD;
      atherogenesis. This study will explore the consequences of altered transcription such as&#xD;
      changes in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein levels as well as protein activity.&#xD;

      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of LY518674 on the Apo A-I production rate (calculated from the&#xD;
           fractional synthetic rate and the fractional catabolic rate) in subjects with the&#xD;
           metabolic syndrome and low HDL-C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of LY518674 on markers of reverse cholesterol transport by&#xD;
           analyzing changes in serum cholesterol efflux capacity (an in vitro cell-based assay).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of LY518674 on the activity of lecithin cholesterol&#xD;
           acyltransferase (LCAT), cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), lipoprotein lipase,&#xD;
           hepatic lipase, and endothelial lipase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of LY518674 on plasma lipids, lipid subfractions, free fatty&#xD;
           acids, and the free fatty acid metabolite, beta-OH butyrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of LY518674 on high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density&#xD;
           lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particle size using nuclear&#xD;
           magnetic resonance (NMR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of LY518674 on Apo A-II and Apo B-100 kinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effects of LY518674 on hsCRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of LY518674&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study H8D-MC-EMBG is a single site, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel&#xD;
      study. A minimum of 40 subjects with low HDL cholesterol and metabolic syndrome will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive double-blind administration of LY518674 100 mcg/day or placebo for 8&#xD;
      weeks. There is a safety visit every 2 weeks after treatment has been initiated, resulting in&#xD;
      7 visits over 10 weeks. There are 2 inpatient visits at zero and eight weeks.&#xD;
