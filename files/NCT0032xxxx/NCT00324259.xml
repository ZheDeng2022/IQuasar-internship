  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine whether estradiol is an appropriate for future Phase 3 studies as&#xD;
      second or third line endocrine treatment. In addition the protocol explores several&#xD;
      approaches to enhance the safety of estrogen therapy, including the establishment of the&#xD;
      efficacy of a lower dose than that currently recommended and through the early identification&#xD;
      of non-responders to avoid drug exposure in patients who are unlikely to benefit to estrogen&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of two doses (6 mg and 30 mg) of&#xD;
      Estradiol, a type of estrogen. This and other forms of estrogen used at doses much higher&#xD;
      than those used for postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy have been shown to cause tumor&#xD;
      growth stabilization or shrinkage in patients with breast cancer.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Postmenopausal women with advanced hormone receptor positive (ER and or PgR) breast&#xD;
             cancer, has received prior treatment with an aromatase inhibitor in the advanced&#xD;
             disease setting, and experienced at least 24 weeks of progression free survival. As&#xD;
             long as the patient experienced an aromatase inhibitor response as defined this way,&#xD;
             she is still eligible even if she has received further lines of endocrine therapy,&#xD;
             which may include other aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen, even if these subsequent&#xD;
             lines of treatment were unsuccessful (see below for permitted chemotherapy and&#xD;
             trastuzumab therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Postmenopausal women with systemic or unresectable local relapse after taking at least&#xD;
             two years of adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical diagnosis of postmenopausal status is defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Age greater than 50 years and amenorrhea for 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Bilateral Surgical ovariectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Serum FSH and estradiol level in the postmenopausal range before the initiation&#xD;
                  of AI therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. If the patient was receiving an LHRH agonist to maintain a postmenopausal state&#xD;
                  during AI therapy this should be continued since recovery of menses would lead to&#xD;
                  uncontrolled estrogen exposure and pregnancy during estrogen therapy is&#xD;
                  contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor cell expression of ER and/or PgR can be ascertained on either the primary or the&#xD;
             metastatic site. However when both types of tissue are available, the metastatic site&#xD;
             should be used to determine eligibility. ER and/or PgR positive are defined as at&#xD;
             least 10% of malignant cells with positive nuclear staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patients may have received adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiotherapy is permitted as long as it was planned before the start of the&#xD;
             study medication and is completed within 3 weeks of trial medication starting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior tamoxifen therapy is also permitted as adjuvant or advanced disease therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with ER+ HER2+ disease are eligible even of they have received trastuzumab in&#xD;
             the past (and even if it was administered in combination with endocrine treatment) as&#xD;
             long as they meet all other eligibility criteria. Trastuzumab therapy must be held&#xD;
             during estradiol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of prior experimental agents alone or in combination with endocrine therapy is&#xD;
             also permissible, but a wash out of one month is required if the immediate prior&#xD;
             therapy involved a study medication that had not been subject to regulatory approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior adjuvant chemotherapy is permitted as well as one line of chemotherapy for&#xD;
             advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have at least one measurable lesion defined by RECIST criteria. To be&#xD;
             considered measurable, a baseline lesion must have a minimum diameter to compensate&#xD;
             for measurement error: 1 cm for soft tissue lesions, 1 cm for lung lesions including&#xD;
             pleural lesions measured by CT scan, 1 cm for liver lesions measured by CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with bone only disease can also be enrolled if they meet the following&#xD;
             criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Four or more lesions more than one cm, measurable on CT scan bone windows.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. At least one tumor marker that is elevated to at least two times the upper limit&#xD;
                  of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. All patients should have a baseline bone scan with X-ray evaluation of all hot&#xD;
                  spots, CT chest abdomen and pelvis (with bone windows), and tumor marker&#xD;
                  assessment. Also CT scan of the extremities should be done on suspicious areas&#xD;
                  seen on X-ray evaluation of all hot spots if these extremity lesions are to be&#xD;
                  followed for response.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have an ECOG performance status of 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient should have a life expectancy of &gt; 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have adequate hematologic function, defined as ANC &gt;1000/mm3 and&#xD;
             platelets &gt; 75,000/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have adequate renal function, defined as serum creatinine less than&#xD;
             or equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have adequate liver function defined as serum bilirubin less than or&#xD;
             equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (three times the upper limit of normal&#xD;
             for patients with hereditary benign hyperbilirubinaemia), transaminases (ALT, AST)&#xD;
             less than or equal to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal in patients without liver&#xD;
             metastasis or less than or equal to 5 times the upper limit of normal in patients with&#xD;
             liver metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with bone metastasis, treatment with i.v. bisphosphonates during the&#xD;
             trial is mandatory because of the risk of hypercalcemia. Bisphosphonate therapy must&#xD;
             be started before the patient begins protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preexisting hypercalcemia should be treated and calcium normalized prior to study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must give written informed consent prior to initiation of any invasive&#xD;
             study-related procedures that would otherwise not be performed, and must be able to&#xD;
             comply with scheduled visits and evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusion of Women and Minorities: Entry to this study is open to women of all racial&#xD;
             and ethnic subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;

        <description>Surveyed using a 6 item estrogen adverse effect questionnaire (headaches, bloating, breast tenderness, retention of fluid, nausea, and vomiting).&#xD;

The FACT-B (version 4) questionnaire consists of 36 items with five-point scale, ranging from 0-4, where a total score ranges from 0-144 and higher scores indicate better QoL. The total FACT-B score is the sum of scores for five subscales including: physical well-being (7 items), social/family well-being (7 items), emotional well-being (6 items), functional well-being (7 items), and specific breast cancer concerns (9 items).</description>
