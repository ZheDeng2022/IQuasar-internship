      This study assessed whether naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, might be effective in reducing&#xD;
      excessive gambling behavior in people who also drink heavily. The efficacy of naltrexone was&#xD;
      evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Fifty-two subjects who had&#xD;
      significant problems with both gambling and alcohol received 11 weeks of either naltrexone or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      With the growing popularity of gambling, there has been an increase in the number of&#xD;
      individuals with problem gambling. As we learn more about the way we can help problem&#xD;
      gamblers, there is a great interest developing effective medications for this problem.&#xD;
      Although there is much to learn about the factors that lead to gambling problems, there is&#xD;
      some research showing that one of the reasons why gambling may be so rewarding and difficult&#xD;
      to stop is due to the release of endogenous opioids, a specific brain chemical that is&#xD;
      associated with the feeling of pleasure. It is possible that medications known to affect the&#xD;
      opioidergic neurotransmitter system which produces endogenous opioids may be beneficial in&#xD;
      reducing pathological gambling. One such medication is naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, that&#xD;
      has been shown to be effective in reducing alcohol consumption and approved for use in the&#xD;
      treatment of alcohol dependence. This study assessed whether naltrexone might be effective in&#xD;
      reducing excessive gambling behavior in people who also drink heavily. The efficacy of&#xD;
      naltrexone was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Fifty-two&#xD;
      subjects who had significant problems with both gambling and alcohol received 11 weeks of&#xD;
      either naltrexone or placebo. Everyone also received 7 weeks of cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      counselling to help them reduce or stop drinking and gambling. Changes in alcohol and&#xD;
      gambling behavior were measured at the beginning of treatment, at the end-of-treatment and 3,&#xD;
      6 and 12-months after treatment follow-up. The results showed that there were no significant&#xD;
      differences between those who received placebo versus those who received naltrexone on any&#xD;
      alcohol or gambling measure (i.e., frequency of drinking/ gambling, amount of drinking/&#xD;
      gambling, money spent of gambling, urges to drink/ gamble). However, treatment in general was&#xD;
      effective as everyone, regardless of the treatment they received, were gambling and drinking&#xD;
      significantly less at the end-of-treatment and during the year follow-up. The conclusion of&#xD;
      the study was that naltrexone was not an effective treatment for concurrent alcohol use and&#xD;
      gambling problems.&#xD;
