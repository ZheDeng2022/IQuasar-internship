  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of methylphenidate HCl&#xD;
      extended-release tablets at five dose levels compared to placebo in adults with Attention&#xD;
      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on chance),&#xD;
      placebo-controlled , double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician knows whether drug&#xD;
      or placebo is being taken), parallel-group, dose-titration, multicenter study to determine&#xD;
      the effectiveness and safety of five doses of methylphenidate HCl extended-release tablets,&#xD;
      36 mg, 54 mg, 72 mg (two 36 mg tablets), 90 mg (one 36 mg tablet plus one 54 mg tablet), or&#xD;
      108 mg (two 54 mg tablets) administered orally once per day in adults with Attention Deficit&#xD;
      Hyperactivity Disorder. Patients will be randomized to receive either placebo or&#xD;
      methylphenidate HCl extended-release tablets for seven weeks. Patients assigned to&#xD;
      methylphenidate HCl extended-release tablets will start treatment with 36 mg and continue to&#xD;
      receive incremental increases of 18 mg of methylphenidate HCl extended-release tablets every&#xD;
      seven days (+/-2 days) until an individualized dose is achieved. The individualized dose is&#xD;
      achieved when Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS) decreases by 30% and a&#xD;
      Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) score is 1 or 2, or titration to the maximum&#xD;
      dose of 108 mg is achieved. If a limiting adverse event occurs, the dose will be titrated&#xD;
      downward by 18 mg. This dose is then the patient's individualized dose. Once an&#xD;
      individualized dose has been achieved, patients will remain on that dose for the duration of&#xD;
      the titration period and for the two weeks prior to Final Visit/2-Week Efficacy Assessment&#xD;
      Visit. Patients assigned to placebo will follow the same dosing schedule and procedures as&#xD;
      the patients randomized to methylphenidate HCl tablets. Safety assessments include monitoring&#xD;
      adverse events, blood pressure, pulse, weight, and electrocardiograms (ECG) throughout the&#xD;
      study. The primary hypothesis is that methylphenidate HCL extended-release tablets at an&#xD;
      individualized dose will be superior to placebo with respect to improvement in the primary&#xD;
      efficacy endpoint defined by change from baseline in the Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom&#xD;
      Rating Scale. Patients will initiate methylphenidate HCl extended-release tablets with 36 mg&#xD;
      and continue to receive increases in 18 mg increments for 7 days until an individualized dose&#xD;
      or maximum dose of 108 mg is achieved. Patients will remain on this dose for the duration of&#xD;
      the titration period and for 2 weeks prior to Final Visit/2 Week Efficacy Assessment; a&#xD;
      maximum of 51 days. Patients receiving placebo will follow the same dosing&#xD;
      schedule/procedures as patients receiving methylphenidate HCL tablets&#xD;
