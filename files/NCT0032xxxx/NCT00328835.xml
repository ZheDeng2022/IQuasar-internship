  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness and visual loss in the developed&#xD;
      world. It is a condition where long term exposure to high eye pressures (intra-ocular&#xD;
      pressure) damages the nerve fibres in the eye. This damage can be seen by examiners as&#xD;
      changes in the optic nerve. The exact mechanism of how the high intra-ocular pressure causes&#xD;
      nerve damage is unknown. Both physiological and mechanical mechanisms are thought to play a&#xD;
      role. Previous authors have reported structural changes in the connective tissue of optic&#xD;
      nerves of eyes with glaucoma. Structural changes in the optic nerve head which affect the&#xD;
      mechanical compliance of the nerve may be significant in the cause of glaucomatous nerve&#xD;
      damage. This study aims to assess the compliance of the optic disc in subjects with and&#xD;
      without glaucoma. We would test compliance by imaging the optic discs of participants before&#xD;
      and during a brief (less than two minutes) increase in intra-ocular pressure. We would aim to&#xD;
      repeat the tests on the same subjects 3 years later to see how compliance changed. We would&#xD;
      also seek to correlate other important parameters such as corneal thickness and visual field&#xD;
      changes with our findings&#xD;

      Chronic glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness and visual loss in the developed&#xD;
      world (the following reference gives rate of visual impairment/blindness caused by glaucoma&#xD;
      in one cross-section of an older Australian population as 6% - Foran S, Wang JJ, Mitchell P.&#xD;
      Causes of visual impairment in two older population cross-sections: the Blue Mountains Eye&#xD;
      Study. Ophthalmic Epidemiol. 2003 Oct;10(4):215-25). Glaucoma is a condition where long term&#xD;
      exposure to high eye pressures (intra-ocular pressure) damages the nerve fibres in the eye.&#xD;
      The exact mechanism of how the high intra-ocular pressure causes nerve damage is unknown&#xD;
      (Albon J, Purslow PP, Karwatowski WS, Easty DL. Age related compliance of the lamina cribrosa&#xD;
      in human eyes. Br J Ophthalmol. 2000 Mar;84(3):318-23). Both physiological and mechanical&#xD;
      mechanisms are thought to play a role. Previous authors have reported structural changes in&#xD;
      the connective tissue of optic discs of eyes with glaucoma, and postulated that this may&#xD;
      contribute to changes in the compliance of the optic nerve head (Pena JD, Netland PA, Vidal&#xD;
      I, Dorr DA, Rasky A, Hernandez MR. Elastosis of the lamina cribrosa in glaucomatous optic&#xD;
      neuropathy. Exp Eye Res. 1998 Nov;67(5):517-24). Structural changes in the optic nerve head&#xD;
      which affect the mechanical compliance of the nerve may be significant in the cause of&#xD;
      glaucomatous nerve damage. This study aims to assess the compliance of the optic disc in&#xD;
      subjects with and without glaucoma. We would test compliance by imaging the optic discs of&#xD;
      participants before and during a brief increase in intra-ocular pressure. We would aim to&#xD;
      repeat the tests on the same subjects 3 years later to see how the optic nerve compliance&#xD;
      changed. We would also look to correlate changes with other ocular parameters such as corneal&#xD;
      thickness and visual field defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Non-glaucoma group&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Age over 18&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Previous eye surgery Best corrected visual acuity &lt;6/9 Chronic eye disease (including&#xD;
           glaucoma) Glaucomatous optic disc Ocular perfusion abnormalities (e.g. previous retinal&#xD;
           artery or vein occlusion; or abnormal vasculature including those whose retinal&#xD;
           circulation might be compromised by pressure on the eye).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Glaucoma group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age over 18 Diagnosis of glaucoma (visual field proven) Stable, well controlled glaucoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary glaucoma (eg uveitis, neovascular glaucoma, etc) Advanced or fixation-threatening&#xD;
      visual field changes Previous eye surgery Chronic eye disease (not including glaucoma) Ocular&#xD;
      perfusion abnormalities (e.g. previous retinal artery or vein occlusion; or abnormal&#xD;
      vasculature including those whose retinal circulation might be compromised by pressure on the&#xD;
      eye).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two different groups of participants will be studied, those with glaucoma, and those without&#xD;
      glaucoma. Participants will have a routine eye examination performed by an experienced&#xD;
      doctor. Information such as visual acuity, intra-ocular pressure, corneal thickness, and&#xD;
      optic nerve appearance will be obtained. Then participants will have their optic nerves&#xD;
      imaged by a Heidelberg retinal tomograph (HRT). The intra-ocular pressure will then be&#xD;
      artificially raised to approximately 50 mmHg for approximately two to four minutes using a&#xD;
      suction cup oculopressor. The optic nerve will be imaged again by the HRT during that time.&#xD;
      From the HRT images we will calculate the optic nerve compliance using measures such as mean&#xD;
      position of the disc, and optic cup area and volume. This data will then be analysed&#xD;
      statistically to look for a significant difference in the optic nerve compliance of the two&#xD;
      groups. Participants will then undergo the same testing procedure 3 years later to see how&#xD;
      their optic nerve compliance has changed. We will then examine these changes to see how they&#xD;
      correlate with changes in their vision. These changes would include: development of glaucoma;&#xD;
      decreased visual acuity; reduced visual field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical methods - history and examination. Visual field testing (in those with glaucoma)&#xD;
      using an automated visual field testing machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-ocular pressure measurement using a Goldmann tonometer. Corneal thickness measurement&#xD;
      using a &quot;Pachmate&quot;, pachymeter. Optic disc images using a Heidelberg retinal tomograph (a&#xD;
      confocal scanning diode laser ophthalmoscope).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a theoretical risk that a short term rise in intra-ocular can compromise the blood&#xD;
      supply to the optic nerve and cause optic nerve damage. However a previous study looking at&#xD;
      optic nerve compliance found no side-effects after a short term rise in intraocular pressure&#xD;
      induced with a suction cup (Augusto, A., Harris, A., Cantor, L., Abreu, M., &amp; Weinland, M.&#xD;
      Effects of short term increase of intraocular pressure on optic disc cupping. British Journal&#xD;
      of Ophthalmology. 1998. 82, 880-883). Also a recent study has shown that a short term rise in&#xD;
      intra-ocular pressure does not alter the response of retinal and optic nerve head blood flow&#xD;
      (Garhofer, G., Resch, H., Weigert., Lung, S., Simader, C. &amp; Schmetterer, L. Short-term&#xD;
      increase of intraocular pressure does not alter the response of retinal and optic nerve head&#xD;
      blood flow to flicker stimulation. Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science. 2005. 46(5),&#xD;
      880-883). We also know from clinical experience that patients with short term rises in&#xD;
      intra-ocular pressure caused by vitreo-retinal surgery and acute angle closure glaucoma do&#xD;
      not have long term side effects from raised pressure for hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further reduce the risk of side-effects we will exclude those with advanced or fixation&#xD;
      threatening glaucoma changes. We will also exclude those whose retinal circulation is seen to&#xD;
      be compromised by digital pressure on the eye during examination.&#xD;
