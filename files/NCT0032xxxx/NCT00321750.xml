  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and hypothesis. Oral erosive lichen planus (OELP) is a severe form of mucosal&#xD;
      lichen planus. Lesions often induce intense pain and limit feeding. Its course is chronic&#xD;
      with flares and spontaneous remissions are rare. Treatment is difficult: topical steroids are&#xD;
      usually used first but antimalarials, oral retinoids, systemic steroids, immunosuppressive&#xD;
      drugs and even extracorporeal photochemotherapy can be necessary for treating severe forms.&#xD;
      The need for novel therapies with less morbidity is obvious. Calcineurin inhibitors have a&#xD;
      theoretical interest in treating OELP: this has been emphasized by several open studies&#xD;
      performed with topical tacrolimus. The effectiveness of 1% pimecrolimus cream has been&#xD;
      suggested by a few case reports and by one recent comparative study which confirmed the&#xD;
      potential interest of topical pimecrolimus in treating OELP. The absorption of pimecrolimus&#xD;
      through human mucosa is still unknown. Its application on ulcerative lesions such as OELP&#xD;
      ones, could lead to significant systemic levels of the molecule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of 1% pimecrolimus cream in treating oral erosive lichen&#xD;
      planus (OELP) and to assess its tolerance.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Design: Double blind randomized trial with placebo control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings: Outpatients of the Department of Dermatology of the University hospital of Nice,&#xD;
      France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Fourteen consecutive patients with OELP confirmed by histological examination and&#xD;
      with a clinical score superior to 3. 1% pimecrolimus cream or its vehicle were applied on&#xD;
      ulcerated lesions twice a day for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures; the efficacy of the treatment was quantified using a 12 points&#xD;
      clinical score. Blood level of pimecrolimus was analyzed at D0, D14 and D28.&#xD;
