  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a genetic disease, caused by mutations in the FMF gene,&#xD;
      entitled MEFV. The disease is characterized by painful attacks of inflammation in sites lined&#xD;
      by serous membranes (e.g. abdominal pain caused by inflammation of the peritoneum, a serous&#xD;
      membrane surrounding all internal organs within the abdomen). Continuous colchicine treatment&#xD;
      prevents attacks in most patients. The pathogenesis of the disease, what leads to the attacks&#xD;
      and how colchicine helps, are questions not yet resolved. Elucidating the role of the&#xD;
      inflammatory proteins is an important step towards the understanding of these questions. To&#xD;
      date only small numbers of cytokines and inflammatory proteins have been studied&#xD;
      individually. We propose to study a large number of these proteins in the RNA and protein&#xD;
      levels addressing the interaction between them and the effect of colchicine on their&#xD;
      expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be drawn from consenting patients in remission, during attacks, under and&#xD;
      without colchicine treatment. (20 patients in each category).Twenty healthy volunteers will&#xD;
      donate control blood samples for the study. RNA will be produced from the neutrophils, and&#xD;
      cytokines and various proteins' RNA expression will be determined. Major expressed proteins&#xD;
      will be measured in the same samples and the results will be analyzed with regard to the&#xD;
      activity of the disease, MEFV mutations and colchicine treatment status. The information&#xD;
      obtained by the study may allow us to determine the sequence of events associated with FMF&#xD;
      attack development, and perhaps take us one step further in the understanding of the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of the disease.&#xD;
