      We sought to determine the efficacy of NAET® in permanently eliminating milk allergy for a&#xD;
      sample of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the subjects in the experimental group will show similar level of&#xD;
      allergies and sensitivities initially on all nine diagnostic measures used here. After&#xD;
      receiving the NAET treatments, the Experimental group will demonstrate a significant&#xD;
      reduction in the milk sensitivities and allergies when compared to the control group at the&#xD;
      final evaluation using same diagnostic measures.&#xD;

      Background: Although several standard clinical techniques are used to detect and treat common&#xD;
      allergic conditions, each one is limited in scope and requires to follow repeated treatment&#xD;
      protocols. The non-invasive system known as NAET® does not generally have such limitations&#xD;
      and has over the last twenty-three years been demonstrated to be effective clinically in&#xD;
      thousands of cases. NAET® is a natural treatment that utilizes standard medical diagnostic&#xD;
      measures along with kinesiolgocal, chiropractic and oriental testing, procedures to identify&#xD;
      the allergens, as well as the intensity of reactions to the allergens which vary from&#xD;
      individual to individual. Treatment consists of a sequence of spinal manipulations at&#xD;
      specific thoracic and lumbar spinal levels along with acupuncture acupressure on&#xD;
      configurations of standard acupuncture points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In a double blind study, 26 patients with diagnosed milk allergy (13 males, 13&#xD;
      females, age range between 18-65 years) were randomly assigned to 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. NAET®/Experimental group, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Placebo/control group The study was conducted by 12 volunteer-clinicians from NAET&#xD;
           Research associates, divided into six investigator groups. Each group conducted a&#xD;
           designated sequential part of the study independently from all other groups, that is,&#xD;
           was blinded from all other groups for the duration of the study. Subjects from both&#xD;
           groups (Experimental and Control) were evaluated immediatedly before treatment and eight&#xD;
           weeks thereafter using the following nine diagnostic measures: Subjective history&#xD;
           (Allergy Symptom Rating Scale or ASRS); ALCAT Test; antibodies to milk protein in the&#xD;
           blood serum by Immunoglobulins G, Immunoglobulins A, Immuno-globulins M, and&#xD;
           Immunoglobulins E (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE) by Elisa method (enzyme linked Immunozorbant&#xD;
           Assay); Intradermal testing for milk sensitivity. NSTRS (Kinesiological muscle response&#xD;
           testing also known as Neuromuscular Sensitivity Testing) and Pulse difference Rating&#xD;
           Scale (PDRS) were tested by two well trained NST clinicians at two different times&#xD;
           before and after the treatments. Both groups demonstrated allergic sensitivities to&#xD;
           whole milk test sample in varying degrees. After completing the evaluations, the&#xD;
           Experimental group received 2 NAET® treatments on whole milk, on two consecutive&#xD;
           Saturdays. The Placebo group received two treatments on placebo samples on the same days&#xD;
           along with the experimental group on two consecutive Saturdays as well. At the end of&#xD;
           the treatment phase, once again both groups were evaluated for whole milk test sample&#xD;
           using all of the nine diagnostic measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results On the nine diagnostic measures there was a significant difference in the means of&#xD;
      the before and after measures of the Experimental group, while they remained almost the same&#xD;
      for the Placebo group. At 95% CI, p-values were less than 0.05 in all tests except for IgG&#xD;
      study (p-value=1.30). NSTRS and PDRS were evaluated by two clinicians at different time to&#xD;
      evaluate the intertester relability among two clinicians for these two tests. A significant&#xD;
      correlation was noticed with the results both testers received on these two testing-NST and&#xD;
      PDRS (p-value &lt;0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion The study demonstrated the efficacy of eliminating or reducing milk allergy using&#xD;
      the NAET® treatment protocol. This study also evaluated the reliability of performing two&#xD;
      testing procedures (NST &amp; PDRS) by two independent examiners in testing the subjects for milk&#xD;
      at two different times. There was a significant correlation in the results they received as&#xD;
      shown above, when the two clinicians tested the subjects independently, demonstrating that&#xD;
      there is a good reliability between these well trained clinicians in their performance while&#xD;
      doing these two evaluations.&#xD;
