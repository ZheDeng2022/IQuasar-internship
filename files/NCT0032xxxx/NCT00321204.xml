  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that abnormal heart beats from the top parts of the heart, atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (Aflut), occur frequently after most types of cardiac&#xD;
      surgeries. Postoperative AF and Aflut are associated with significant morbidity, longer&#xD;
      hospital stay, and higher related costs. Currently therapies are marginally effective at&#xD;
      preventing this abnormal heart beat. The incidence of abnormal heart beats after cardiac&#xD;
      surgery seems to be a function of the amount of inflammation and oxidative stress induced.&#xD;
      Our group and others have shown that atrial abnormal heart beats are associated with&#xD;
      increased oxidative stress. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are medications used to treat diabetes.&#xD;
      Beside their glucose lowering effects, TZDs are shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      antioxidant properties. Therefore, we propose to retrospectively analyze the effect of&#xD;
      pre-operative TZDs on the incidence of post-operative AF or Aflut. This study will involve&#xD;
      retrospective chart reviews without further patient contact of all patients having undergone&#xD;
      cardiac surgery in Emory University Hospital, Crawford Long Hospital, or the VA Medical&#xD;
      Center from 2000 to 2005. This study is preparatory to a funding proposal for a prospective&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

      1.0 Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac surgery is associated with many perioperative complications, including&#xD;
      supraventricular arrhythmias.(1-4) Atrial fibrillation occurs in 15 to 40% of patients after&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and up to 60% after CABG and valve repair. It can lead&#xD;
      to significant complications such as stroke, prolonged hospitalizations, increasing mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity.(1;5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative atrial arrhythmias seem to be related to the degree of inflammation and&#xD;
      oxidative stress induced during surgery.(2-4) Our group and others have shown that atrial&#xD;
      arrhythmias are associated with increased oxidative stress.(6-10) Moreover, increased&#xD;
      oxidative stress associated with angiotensin II-mediated NADPH oxidase activation leads to&#xD;
      electrical abnormalities likely to propagate arrhythmias.(11;12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are antidiabetic agents that enhance insulin sensitivity through&#xD;
      activating peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma. Beside their glucose&#xD;
      lowering effects, TZDs are shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant&#xD;
      properties.(13-17)&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the discussion above, we hypothesize that pre-operative use of TZDs will decrease&#xD;
      post-operative AF or Aflut incidence. This study will be a retrospective cohort analysis of&#xD;
      all patients that underwent elective cardiac surgeries between 2000-2005 at Emory University&#xD;
      Hospital, Crawford Long Hospital, or the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center to evaluate&#xD;
      the relationship of pre-operative TZD use to the incidence of post-operative atrial&#xD;
      arrhythmias.. This study is undertaken in preparation for a funding proposal for a&#xD;
      prospective trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 Patient Selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Eligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. All patients that patients who underwent elective cardiac surgery in the Emory University&#xD;
      Hospital, Crawford Long Hospital, or the VA Medical Center between 2000-2005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Ineligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Emergent operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The presence of AF or Aflut at the time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients without adequate documentation of atrial rhythm following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV heart failure at the time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Hyperthyroidism&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Implanted devices for designed for active management of atrial arrhythmias by pacing or&#xD;
           defibrillation&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Known illicit drug use&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Known ethanol abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Electrophysiological ablation for atrial tachycardia within 6 months of the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 Registration and randomization: none&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 Therapy: none&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0 Pathology: none&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.0 Patient assessment: none&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.0 Data collection: Data will be collected from review of the patient's hospital charts,&#xD;
      from telemetry recordings, and ECGs to document the presence or absence of AF or Aflut during&#xD;
      the hospital admission for cardiac surgery. The presence or absence of atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      will be diagnosed on the basis of an electrocardiographic recording and confirmed by a&#xD;
      cardiologist. Demographic data collected will include: age, race, sex, body mass index, blood&#xD;
      pressure, NYHA classification, Killip classification, and the history of previous myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, alcohol use, antiarrhythmic drug use, presence&#xD;
      and type of pacemaker if any, history of AF or Aflut, previous cardioversions, type of&#xD;
      operation, and length of operation. Patients enrolled in this study will be given unique&#xD;
      study numbers. No follow up data will be required from patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.0 Statistical considerations: This study design is a retrospective chart review of a cohort&#xD;
      of patients undergoing cardiac surgery to determine if there is an association between&#xD;
      pre-operative TZD use and the incidence of post-operative atrial fibrillation or Aflut. The&#xD;
      null hypothesis is that there is no association between the preoperative use of TZDs and&#xD;
      postoperative AF and Aflut. Within the cohort, those patients with AF or Aflut will be&#xD;
      compared to those without these atrial arrhythmias in the post-operative period. Baseline&#xD;
      data for the two groups will be expressed as mean Â± standard deviation for continuous&#xD;
      variables, and frequencies for categorical variables. Differences in baseline characteristics&#xD;
      between the groups will be examined by use of Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney tests for&#xD;
      categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Quantification of any association between&#xD;
      pre-operative TZD and the presence of atrial fibrillation will modeled by logistical&#xD;
      regression analysis after adjusting for other variables that may affect arrhythmia frequency.&#xD;
