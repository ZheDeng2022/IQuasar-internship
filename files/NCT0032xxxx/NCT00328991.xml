    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blinded, controlled clinical intervention trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of duct tape occlusions therapy for the treatment of common warts. 80 patients&#xD;
      completed this study, and were randomized 1:1 to receive pads which contained either&#xD;
      moleskin+transparent duct tape or moleskin alone. The patients wore the pad over the target&#xD;
      wart for 7 days at a time, removed the pad on the evening of the 7th day, and replaced the&#xD;
      pad on the 8th day. This cycle was repeated for 8 weeks or until the wart resolved. The&#xD;
      hypothesis was that duct tape occlusion therapy would be more therapeutic than moleskin for&#xD;
      the treatment of the common wart. However, in our study there was only 21% resolution rate in&#xD;
      the duct tape arm vs. 22% in the control group.&#xD;

      ABSTRACT (233 word count)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of duct tape occlusion therapy for the treatment of&#xD;
      common warts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A double-blinded, controlled, clinical intervention trial. Setting: Veterans Affairs&#xD;
      Medical Center. Participants: A total of 90 immunocompetent adult volunteers with at least&#xD;
      one wart measuring between 2-15 mm were enrolled in this study between October 2004 and July&#xD;
      2005; 80 patients completed the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients were randomized using a computer-generated code to receive either pads&#xD;
      consisting of moleskin with transparent duct tape (active) or moleskin alone (control).&#xD;
      Patients were instructed to wear the pads for 7 consecutive days and leave the pad off on the&#xD;
      7th evening. This process was repeated for 2 months or until the wart resolved, whichever&#xD;
      occurred first. Follow-up visits occurred at 1 and 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measure: 100% resolution of the wart. Secondary outcomes included change in size&#xD;
      of the target wart and recurrence rates at 6 months for warts with complete resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the proportions of patients&#xD;
      with resolution of the target wart (duct tape=8/39, 21% vs. control=9/41, 22%). Of patients&#xD;
      with complete resolution, 75% (6/8) in the duct tape group and 33% (3/9) of those in the&#xD;
      control group had recurrence of the target wart by the sixth month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions: Occlusive therapy with transparent duct tape is not significantly better than&#xD;
      moleskin alone for treatment of common warts in adults.&#xD;
