      This study is a multi-centered, multi-country, prospective, non-randomized, observational&#xD;
      study, without concurrent or matched controls, conducted under a common protocol. Bayesian&#xD;
      methods will be used for the design and analysis of this study. The Bayesian model will&#xD;
      determine if the data for the valve configurations are poolable. Bayesian methods also&#xD;
      provide a means of determining the appropriate stopping time for the study based on the&#xD;
      amount of information generated. The objectives of this study are to confirm the clinical&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of the SJM Epic Valve by establishing the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  adverse effect rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical status as indicated by NYHA functional classification&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hemodynamic performance&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient requires replacement of the aortic and/or mitral valve (Note: Patients&#xD;
             undergoing concomitant procedures, e.g. coronary artery bypass grafting, valve repair,&#xD;
             are eligible for this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient (or legal guardian) has signed a study-specific informed consent, agreeing&#xD;
             to the data collection and follow-up requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is of legal age in host country.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient already has a prosthetic valve, other than the aortic and/or mitral valve&#xD;
             being replaced at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient requires replacement of the tricuspid or pulmonary valve.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has active endocarditis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is actively participating in the study of an investigational drug or device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has had an acute preoperative neurological event.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is undergoing renal dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is an intravenous drug abuser, alcohol abuser or prison inmate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has an inability or unwillingness to return for the required follow-up&#xD;
             intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient had the SJM Epic Valve implanted during the clinical study but then had&#xD;
             the bioprosthesis explanted.&#xD;
