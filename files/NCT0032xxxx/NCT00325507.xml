    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of TroVax® investigational&#xD;
      vaccine injections when given as first or second line treatment in conjunction with&#xD;
      subcutaneous low dose IL-2 to patients with locally advanced or metastatic clear cell or&#xD;
      papillary cell renal carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TroVax® is the experimental product in this trial and its value as a medicine has not yet&#xD;
      been proven. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a standard treatment for cancer, which means that it can&#xD;
      be received even if one chooses not to participate in this study. TroVax® is being studied as&#xD;
      a possible treatment for patients with cancer of the kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TroVax® belongs to a class of medicines called vaccines. A vaccine helps the body's immune&#xD;
      system to recognize and kill foreign invading organisms effectively. It is believed that one&#xD;
      of the reasons why cancer can spread through the body is that the immune system cannot&#xD;
      recognize cancer cells as being different from normal tissues and therefore cannot kill the&#xD;
      cancer cells. A vaccine that alerts the immune system to the presence of cancer cells in the&#xD;
      body could lead to the immune system being able to target and kill those cancer cells&#xD;
      effectively. This trial is of a completely new way of trying to treat cancer in the future by&#xD;
      the use of vaccination injections. TroVax® consists of a virus that has been changed so that&#xD;
      it is no longer infectious and carries a gene for a protein called 5T4. This protein is&#xD;
      carried by many kidney cancer cells. When the virus is injected, it makes the protein, and&#xD;
      the body's immune system is then able to recognize this protein and kill the cells that have&#xD;
      it (i.e. the cancer cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of TroVax® injections and&#xD;
      to understand whether TroVax® could make such an immune response happen in patients with&#xD;
      renal cell cancer while receiving interleukin-2 (IL-2). This study will also observe and&#xD;
      monitor any side effects experienced in patients who receive TroVax® while being treated with&#xD;
      IL-2.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of TroVax® injections when given as first or&#xD;
           second line treatment in conjunction with subcutaneous low dose IL-2 to patients with&#xD;
           locally advanced or metastatic clear cell or papillary cell renal carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immune responses induced by treatment with TroVax® and subcutaneous low&#xD;
           dose IL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess tumour response rates, time to progression, survival and progression free&#xD;
           survival at 6, 12 and 24 months after commencement of treatment with subcutaneous low&#xD;
           dose IL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the ability of the reintroduction of low dose subcutaneous IL-2 to induce&#xD;
           further disease responses or stabilisation in patients being treated with TroVax® alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an open label evaluation in patients with clear cell or papillary cell renal&#xD;
      carcinoma requiring immunotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. A single dose&#xD;
      level of TroVax® in combination with a clinically accepted regimen of subcutaneous low dose&#xD;
      IL-2 will be tested in 25 evaluable patients and their immunological responses to TroVax®&#xD;
      (antibody and cellular) will be assessed. If immunological activity is observed after two&#xD;
      cycles of TroVax®/IL-2 in 70% or more of these patients, further randomised trials will be&#xD;
      undertaken to determine the clinical efficacy of TroVax® in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosage schedule of subcutaneous low dose IL-2 will be an initial dose schedule of 250,000&#xD;
      U/kg/dose for 5 days in week 1 followed by 125,000 U/kg/dose for 5 days in each of weeks 2&#xD;
      though 6 inclusive. There will then be a two-week recovery period before the next cycle&#xD;
      commences. The dosage regimen of TroVax® will be injections given prior to the first cycle on&#xD;
      two occasions (weeks -2 and 1), and one injection given at the beginning of week 4 of the&#xD;
      first cycle. In subsequent cycles, booster injections of TroVax® will be given at week 1&#xD;
      only, prior to commencement of subcutaneous IL-2 therapy. After the first and second cycles&#xD;
      of combined treatment, patients will be evaluated by CT scan for their response to treatment.&#xD;
      If their disease has progressed after the second cycle, they will be withdrawn from the trial&#xD;
      if they require alternative therapy (deterioration of one level of the Karnofsky score or&#xD;
      appearance of disease in a new site). If they are experiencing progressive disease that does&#xD;
      not require alternative therapy or stable disease or better, they will be treated with cycles&#xD;
      of TroVax®/IL-2 as described above for up to a further four cycles. The tumour status will be&#xD;
      evaluated by CT scan after every cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be monitored for up to 6 cycles (48 weeks) to assess tolerability,&#xD;
      induction of humoural and cellular immunity to 5T4 cell surface antigen, immune response to&#xD;
      the vector, tumour response rates, survival, time to progression and progression free&#xD;
      survival. Patients who are intolerant of further treatments with subcutaneous IL-2 during&#xD;
      this part of the study will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are still stable or experiencing a tumour response at 48 weeks will be offered&#xD;
      further boosts with TroVax® without IL-2 every three months at weeks 52, 64, 76, 88 and 100.&#xD;
      During this period, if disease progression recurs, two further cycles with subcutaneous IL-2&#xD;
      as described above may be given in combination with TroVax® as described above with the&#xD;
      objective of inducing further disease response or stabilisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following termination of all patients' participation in the trial (including those with&#xD;
      progressive disease after two cycles of TroVax®/IL-2), contact will be kept by the&#xD;
      Investigators with their families in order to determine the date of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 25 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal criteria from the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Non-compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient withdraws consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Progressive disease with new sites of disease demonstrated on CT scan and/or requiring&#xD;
           other cancer treatment (deterioration in Karnofsky performance score of 10% or more).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Serious IL-2 related adverse events or lack of tolerance to further treatment with IL-2&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Serious TroVax® related adverse events (DLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment plan and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients complying with the entry criteria will be invited to enter the study. After&#xD;
           giving fully informed consent, patients will be subjected to a physical examination to&#xD;
           document general fitness to proceed with the trial. Vital signs will be recorded.&#xD;
           Performance status (Karnofsky) will be documented. At that time, metastases will be&#xD;
           documented using chest, abdominal and pelvic CT scans and an MRI scan of the brain will&#xD;
           be obtained. Blood samples will also be obtained for clinical pathology (10 mL; safety&#xD;
           testing). A urine sample will be tested for protein and blood (safety testing). A 12&#xD;
           lead ECG and echocardiogram will be obtained. This screen should not occur more than two&#xD;
           weeks before treatment with TroVax® begins. If available, tumour tissue from earlier&#xD;
           biopsies will be obtained and tested for the presence of tumour antigens, e.g. 5T4. CT&#xD;
           scans must be compared with scans obtained within the previous three months in order to&#xD;
           determine that the disease is progressing.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
           Obtain blood for safety testing (blood and urine) CT scan. Physician examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the end of cycle 2 to 6 inclusive, if disease has progressed and requires other&#xD;
           treatment (deterioration in Karnofsky performance score by 10% or more, disease appears&#xD;
           in a new site), withdraw patient from trial. Also withdraw patient if intolerant of&#xD;
           subcutaneous low dose IL-2 at the lowest permissible dose or if the patient experiences&#xD;
           DLT. Patients withdrawing before they receive the first four doses of TroVax® and give&#xD;
           blood for immunology testing in cycle 2, week 2 will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If disease is stable, responding or progressing (but Karnofsky score unchanged, no new&#xD;
           disease sites) and patient is tolerant of treatment, continue with further therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After six cycles of combined study drugs (48 weeks), assess with CT scan at week 48 day&#xD;
           1:&#xD;
&#xD;
           If disease has progressed and requires alternative treatment (deterioration in Karnofsky&#xD;

           from trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If disease is stable or responding or progressing (but Karnofsky score stable and no new&#xD;
           disease sites) and patient is tolerant of treatment, continue with further therapy. This&#xD;
           therapy will be TroVax® injection every three months, on weeks 52, 64, 76, 88, 100.&#xD;
           Perform physician examination on each occasion and assess Karnofsky score prior to&#xD;
           injection. Obtain samples for safety testing (blood 10 mL and urine) and immunological&#xD;
           evaluation (10 mL sample only for antibody testing) prior to each injection. A further&#xD;
           10 mL sample for immunological evaluation will be obtained one week after each TroVax®&#xD;
           injection. CT scans will be obtained at weeks 63, 75, 87, 99. At each CT scan, assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
           If disease has progressed, recommence subcutaneous low dose IL-2 treatment (6 weeks on,&#xD;
           two weeks off IL-2) at week 64, 76, 88 as appropriate and give a further 2 cycles of&#xD;
           subcutaneous low dose IL-2.&#xD;

           Week 79 (or 91 or 103) day 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Physician examination. CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the second cycle of IL-2, if disease has progressed and requires other treatment&#xD;
           (deterioration in Karnofsky score by 10% or more, disease appears in a new site),&#xD;
           withdraw patient from trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the treatment cycles with IL-2 end before week 104 and the patient is responding,&#xD;
           stable or progressing but not in need of alternative therapies (Karnofsky stable, no new&#xD;
           disease sites), recommence TroVax® on the original schedule (see Flow Chart). If disease&#xD;
           is progressing and requires further therapy (deterioration in Karnofsky score by 10% or&#xD;
           more, disease appears in a new site), withdraw patient from trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Four weeks after the final treatment, all patients will, if possible, attend for a final&#xD;
           follow up visit. The following will be obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Physical examination. Karnofsky score Safety testing (blood 10 mL and urine).&#xD;
&#xD;
           All study visits must occur within +/- 3 days of the day stipulated in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If patients withdraw at any time during the trial, a final follow up visit, if possible,&#xD;
           will be obtained four weeks after withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Concomitant medication and adverse events will be recorded at each visit.&#xD;
