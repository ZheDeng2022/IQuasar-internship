  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to perform Phase 1 (safety/toxicity and pharmacokinetic)&#xD;
      Studies of an investigational aminoquinoline antimalarial (AQ-13) in human subjects. The&#xD;
      compound to be studied (AQ-13) is being examined because it is active in vitro against&#xD;
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites resistant to chloroquine (CQ) and other antimalarials&#xD;
      (multi-resistant P. falciparum), and because its safety was similar to that of CQ in&#xD;
      preclinical studies performed by SRI International (IND 55,670). AQ-13 was also selected for&#xD;
      study because it is active in vivo in two monkey models of human malaria: 1] P. cynomolgi in&#xD;
      the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), a model of human infection with P. vivax, and 2]&#xD;
      CQ-resistant P. falciparum in the squirrel monkey, a model of human infection with&#xD;
      CQ-resistant P. falciparum.&#xD;

      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy young men and women 21-45 years of age who are taking no chronic medications with the&#xD;
      exception of birth control pills will be invited to participate in this Phase 1 Study at the&#xD;
      Tulane/LSU/Charity Hospital General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) in New Orleans. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria include pregnancy, breast feeding, abnormal liver or kidney function tests, anemia&#xD;
      (Hb &lt; 12 gm per dL), chronic medications other than birth control pills, and an abnormal&#xD;
      baseline ECG or Holter recording. Because the purpose of this testing is to determine whether&#xD;
      AQ-13 is likely to have significant toxicity in Africans (Malians), ≥ 25% of the volunteers&#xD;
      studied in New Orleans will be African-Americans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug allocation codes will be generated by the study biostatistician in blocks of size 4 and&#xD;
      6, using computer software, and will be sealed in numbered, opaque envelops. Block sizes will&#xD;
      be determined at random so that they will not be known to the study personnel. The envelopes&#xD;
      containing the randomization codes will be hand-delivered to the study pharmacist and kept in&#xD;
      the Research Pharmacy, which is outside the GCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants, investigators and staff will be blinded to the type of the drug&#xD;
      administered throughout the study. The interim reports to the DSMB after completion of each&#xD;
      dose level will be presented without breaking the code, unless deemed necessary by the DSMB.&#xD;
      The envelope containing the drug allocation code will be opened by the study pharmacist and&#xD;
      the appropriate drug will be dispensed to the GCRC on the morning of its administration. With&#xD;
      the exception of the 600 mg CQ tablets (Aralen™) tablets, the two drugs (AQ-13 and CQ) will&#xD;
      be administered in identical capsular form and number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be obtained from each participant before screening. As per the IRB&#xD;
      regulations, the informed consent form will be updated and reviewed at yearly intervals or&#xD;
      whenever new pertinent information on the study drugs or their side effects becomes&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine their eligibility, each volunteer will have a complete physical exam, including&#xD;
      an eye examination (visual acuity, visual fields, indirect ophthalmoscopy), panels of&#xD;
      standard chemical tests (BUN, Creatinine, AST, ALT, LDH, Alkaline Phosphatase, Glucose,&#xD;
      Bilirubin, Creatine Kinase) and hematologic tests (Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, White Cell Count&#xD;
      and Platelet Count), and a cardiac examination (physical exam, baseline ECG and 24-hour&#xD;
      Holter recording) for arrhythmias and other evidence of cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-patient Studies at the Tulane-LSU-Charity Hospital GCRC:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be hospitalized the night before drug administration at the GCRC, prior to&#xD;
      randomization to receive either AQ-13 or CQ capsules orally (po) the next morning. Doses will&#xD;
      begin at 10 mg base with 8 volunteers per drug x dose group, and will escalate in subsequent&#xD;
      groups to 100, 300 and 600 mg base (8 subjects per drug x dose group for the 10, 100 and 300&#xD;
      mg doses [subtotal of 48 subjects]; 12 subjects per drug x dose group at the 600 mg dose in&#xD;
      order to compare the pharmacokinetics of CQ and AQ-13 before proceeding to the equivalent&#xD;
      therapeutic dose). At the request of FDA, a third group will be added at the 600 mg dose to&#xD;
      determine whether the blood levels obtained with CQ capsules are equivalent to the blood&#xD;
      levels obtained with commercially available FDA-approved Sanofi-Winthrop CQ tablets (Aralen™,&#xD;
      i.e., 12 subjects per drug x dose group at 600 mg x 3 drug groups [AQ-13 capsules, CQ&#xD;
      capsules and Aralen™ CQ tablets] = subtotal of 36 subjects]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the absorption and metabolism of AQ-13 with the absorption and metabolism of CQ,&#xD;
      blood samples will be obtained for AQ-13, CQ and metabolite blood levels immediately before&#xD;
      and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96 and 120 hours after the 600 and the&#xD;
      1500 mg doses using a heparin lock. At the 1500 mg dose, three 24-hour urine collections will&#xD;
      be obtained on days 1-3 after beginning dosing on day 1 to compare the urinary excretion of&#xD;
      AQ-13, CQ and their metabolites. Volunteers receiving 600 and 1500 mg doses of AQ-13 or CQ&#xD;
      will return for blood samples twice weekly during the ensuing 4 weeks to define the terminal&#xD;
      half-lives of AQ-13, CQ and their metabolites. After measurement of AQ-13, CQ and metabolite&#xD;
      levels following the 600 mg dose, the doses given in the second set of studies (equivalent&#xD;
      therapeutic course - i.e., 1500 mg CQ) will be adjusted (Dose Adjustment, see below) to&#xD;
      obtain blood levels of AQ-13 similar to those obtained with CQ. In these studies, volunteers&#xD;
      will receive the equivalent of 600 mg CQ base on the mornings of days 1 and 2, and an&#xD;
      additional 300 mg CQ base equivalent on day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous experience with CQ (a structurally similar aminoquinoline) suggests that massive&#xD;
      overdoses of AQ-13 may produce arrhythmias, although there has been no previous human&#xD;
      experience with AQ-13. Although the arrhythmiagenic effects of CQ have been reported only&#xD;
      with massive ingestions or rapid intravenous infusions, these Phase 1 Studies will provide an&#xD;
      excellent opportunity to test for this potential toxicity. Therefore, investigators will use&#xD;
      Holter monitoring during the Phase 1 Studies in New Orleans to ensure that there is no&#xD;
      evidence of arrhythmias with AQ-13. Conventional electrocardiograms will be used to test for&#xD;
      the T wave flattening and QTc prolongation, typically seen in persons receiving therapeutic&#xD;
      courses of CQ. Continuous Holter monitoring will be performed to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      AQ-13 and CQ on the QT interval after the 1500 mg dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' Out-patient Follow-ups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge from their in-patient stay at the GCRC (2½ days for the 10, 100, 300 and 600&#xD;
      mg doses; 3½ days for the 1500 mg dose), participants will be asked to return to the GCRC&#xD;
      twice weekly for a total of 4 weeks after discharge in order to obtain blood for drug and&#xD;
      metabolite blood levels, and for the evaluation of adverse events (AEs). An ECG and chemistry&#xD;
      and hematology lab tests will be repeated at the 2 week and 4 week follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Adjustment for AQ-13:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained by SRI International during GLP preclinical toxicologic and pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      studies indicate that the oral bioavailability of AQ-13 is less than that of CQ in rats and&#xD;
      monkeys. Therefore, it is possible (perhaps likely) that the oral bioavailability of AQ-13 in&#xD;
      humans will be less than that of CQ, and thus that it may be necessary to increase the oral&#xD;
      dose of AQ-13 in order to provide molar blood levels of AQ-13 similar to those produced by&#xD;
      the established oral doses of CQ. To estimate the amount of AQ-13 necessary to obtain similar&#xD;
      oral bioavailability, investigators will compare blood levels and areas under the curve&#xD;
      (AUCs) for AQ-13 and CQ at the 600 mg dose. Based on these results, researchers will estimate&#xD;
      the dose adjustment (increment or decrement) necessary for AQ-13 and test that adjustment in&#xD;
      12 additional volunteers. After the dose of AQ-13 necessary to produce equimolar blood levels&#xD;
      and AUCs has been established, investigators will compare that adjusted dose to 1500 mg CQ&#xD;
      base for the equivalent therapeutic dose of AQ-13.&#xD;
