    <textblock>
      The Expanded Breast Cancer Registry and Tissue Repository Research Team (EBCR-RT) is&#xD;
      comprised of University of Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center faculty and staff whose goals&#xD;
      are to improve the outcomes and quality of life of patients with breast cancer, and&#xD;
      ultimately to eradicate and cure breast cancer. One focus of the EBCR-RT is the creation an&#xD;
      infrastructure that can potentially be adopted as a model for a statewide registry and tissue&#xD;
      repository for the discovery of biomarkers for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of the EBCR are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To register patients diagnosed with breast cancer and information relevant to their&#xD;
           diagnosis (such as stage, grade, hormone receptor status, etc), treatment (surgery,&#xD;
           radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, etc), and survivorship (Quallity of Life,&#xD;
           etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To collect relevant demographics including age, menopausal status, race/ethnicity, body&#xD;
           mass index (BMI), place of residence, behaviors (smoking, alcohol intake, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To establish a paired tumor tissue and blood sample for each relevant time-point (as&#xD;
           defined in the protocol), which will be stored in the Tissue Bank Shared Resource&#xD;
           Facility for future hypothesis-driven research.&#xD;

      Institutions and/or physicians are required to report each new diagnosis of breast cancer to&#xD;
      the New Mexico Tumor Registry (NMTR). The NMTR is a valuable database that provides&#xD;
      information on breast cancer, including trends in incidence and survival. However, relevant&#xD;
      information on breast cancer prognosis and treatment is either not routinely collected or not&#xD;
      readily available to the NMTR. We propose to establish an Expanded Breast Cancer Registry and&#xD;
      Tissue Repository (EBCR) at this institution that could serve as an infrastructure for&#xD;
      collection of this information. Furthermore, a tissue bank will be established for collection&#xD;
      of paired tissue (tumor, buccal cells and blood sample) from patients diagnosed with breast&#xD;
      cancer who consent to providing excess/extra tissue and additional blood for the Tissue&#xD;
      Repository. This tissue bank will serve as a repository from which researchers can access&#xD;
      tissue samples to conduct laboratory-based studies of genetic determinants of breast cancer&#xD;
      risks, prognosis and survival in women with breast cancer seen in this institution.&#xD;
