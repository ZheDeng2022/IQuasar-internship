      This study will examine the effects of long-term practice of repeated finger movements in&#xD;
      people with focal hand dystonia, as compared with healthy volunteers. Patients with dystonia&#xD;
      have muscle spasms that cause abnormal postures while trying to perform a movement. In focal&#xD;
      dystonia, just one part of the body, such as the hand, neck or face, is involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right-handed healthy volunteers and patients with focal hand dystonia of the right hand 18&#xD;
      years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical&#xD;
      history and neurological and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are trained daily for 11 days (excluding weekends) at the NIH and are asked to&#xD;
      continue with daily 15 minutes of practice over a 12-week period to perform sequential finger&#xD;
      movement task (key presses) with their left hand. They practice initially at NIH and then at&#xD;
      home. At each clinic visit, their learning of the motor skill is assessed by recording their&#xD;
      performance of 20 consecutive trials of the eight sequences (a total of 160 key presses) in&#xD;
      the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate long-term motor learning of the sequential movements, participants are asked to&#xD;
      do different task tests at Day 2, Week 4 and Week 12. Brain wave activity, and brain&#xD;
      excitability are also measured during these days. In one task, they see a random series of&#xD;
      letters on a screen during the sequential finger movements and are asked to say the number of&#xD;
      times they see a specific letter. In another task, they are asked to focus on each specific&#xD;
      movement while performing the sequential finger movements. During each visit, they are&#xD;
      questioned and evaluated for the development of any abnormal movements that may be suggestive&#xD;
      of early dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants have an electroencephalogram (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS) at Day 1, and Day 2 and at Week 4 and Week 12 to evaluate brain activity. For the EEG,&#xD;
      electrodes are placed on the subject's scalp and the electrical activity of the brain is&#xD;
      recorded while the subject performs the sequence of finger movements. For TMS, a wire coil is&#xD;
      held on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating&#xD;
      a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected with&#xD;
      small electrodes taped to the skin of the subject's arms or legs.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this proposal is to provide new insights into long-term motor learning by&#xD;
      studying patients with focal hand dystonia (FHD) and healthy controls. Long-term motor&#xD;
      learning has never been studied in FHD patients. Our central hypothesis is that dystonia is&#xD;
      caused by abnormal long-term motor learning. Specifically, the aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To show that FHD patients have abnormal motor learning, and in particular, have slower&#xD;
           motor skill acquisition compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To show that FHD patients have difficulty in performing newly acquired motor skills&#xD;
           automatically.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study brain dynamics (i.e. cortico-cortical connectivity and motor cortex&#xD;
           excitability) in FHD patients and healthy controls while learning a sequence of finger&#xD;
           movements over a 3-month period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will follow 10 patients with FHD affecting their dominant hand and 10 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have devised this case-control experimental study to evaluate the long-term learning of&#xD;
      sequential finger movements in FHD patients and healthy controls. We will study FHD patients&#xD;
      and healthy volunteers for 12 weeks as they learn a 4 finger sequence of eight key presses&#xD;
      with their left hand using a metronome to mark the rhythm. All subjects will be right-handed&#xD;
      and age-matched. They will be asked to practice this sequence of 8 key presses daily for 30&#xD;
      minutes for the first week and then for 15 minutes for the remainder of the study. For the&#xD;
      first 3 weeks of the study, subjects will come to the Clinical Center (CC) 10 times at&#xD;
      regular intervals based on their availability. They will practice daily at the CC or at home&#xD;
      during this period. They will then come to the CC every 2 weeks (plus or minus 3 days) for&#xD;
      the remainder of the study while practicing daily for 15 minutes. At each visit, learning&#xD;
      will be assessed by measuring the sequence error rates (SER) and variability in the interval&#xD;
      between key presses. All subjects will be asked to keep a log of daily practice during the 12&#xD;
      weeks. At each visit patients will be carefully questioned and evaluated for the development&#xD;
      of abnormal movement patterns suggestive of early dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study will be to measure the SER at baseline, week 4 and week 12&#xD;
      using 20 consecutive trials of the 8 sequences. We will measure multiple secondary outcomes:&#xD;
      (a) variability in the interval between key presses; (b) automaticity of the movement&#xD;
      evaluated by a dual task; (c) constrained action evaluated by a thinking task; (d)&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) studies to explore&#xD;
      changes in brain physiology.&#xD;
