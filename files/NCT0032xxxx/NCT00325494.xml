  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the safest doses of an investigational drug called&#xD;
      MORAb-009 in subjects with pancreatic cancer, mesothelioma, or certain types of ovarian or&#xD;
      lung cancer. MORAb-009 is a monoclonal antibody that is directed to an antigen on the surface&#xD;
      of these cancers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MORAb-009 is a high-affinity monoclonal antibody raised against human mesothelin, a membrane&#xD;
      glycoprotein thought to be involved in cell adhesion and tightly associated with a range of&#xD;
      cancers. It has been shown that mesothelin is over-expressed in pancreatic cancers,&#xD;
      mesotheliomas, and ovarian or mesothelin-expressing ovarian or non-small cell lung cancers,&#xD;
      while showing little expression in normal tissues. Preclinical experiments indicate that&#xD;
      MORAb-009 is a potentially useful anti-cancer agent. This clinical trial is being performed&#xD;
      to determine the safety of MORAb-009 in subjects with mesothelin-expressing tumors, as well&#xD;
      as to establish serum pharmacokinetics of the antibody, and to assess tumor antigens that may&#xD;
      serve as predictors of a response to MORAb-009.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female or male subjects, ≥ 18 years of age, with a histologically confirmed diagnosis&#xD;
             of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, mesothelioma, or mesothelin-positive ovarian or&#xD;
             non-small cell lung cancer. As nearly 100% of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and&#xD;
             mesotheliomas express mesothelin, immunohistochemical confirmation of&#xD;
             mesothelin-positivity is not necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have disease, as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
             (RECIST) or evaluable by clinical signs/symptoms (e.g., ascites, pleural effusion, or&#xD;
             lesions of less than 2 cm) supported by biomarker, radiologic, or pathologic studies&#xD;
             conducted within 4 weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have failed at least one standard chemotherapy regimen. Patients with&#xD;
             pancreatic cancer must have received gemcitabine as part of prior therapy and be&#xD;
             considered refractory, or in the case of ovarian cancer be considered platinum&#xD;
             refractory or resistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy ≥ 3 months, as estimated by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status or 0, 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential and all male subjects must consent to use a&#xD;
             medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the study period and for 28&#xD;
             days after MORAb-009 administration. A barrier method of contraception must be&#xD;
             included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other significant medical conditions must be well controlled and stable in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator for at least 30 days prior to Study Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory and clinical results within the 2 weeks prior to Study Day 1 as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L; Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L; Hemoglobin ≥ 9&#xD;
        g/dL; Serum bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL; Aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤ 5 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
        (ULN); Alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 5 x ULN; Alkaline Phosphatase ≤ 5 x ULN; Serum&#xD;
        creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL. If the elevations of liver functions are due to obstruction of the&#xD;
        common bile duct extrinsic to the liver, the subject may be enrolled at the discretion of&#xD;
        the investigator even if the elevations are greater than the limits above. Stenting to&#xD;
        reduce liver functions to qualifying levels is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Subject must be willing and able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known central nervous system (CNS) tumor involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of other active malignancy requiring treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant heart disease (e.g., congestive heart failure of New York Heart&#xD;
             Association Class III or IV, angina not well controlled by medication, or myocardial&#xD;
             infarction within 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECG demonstrating clinically significant arrhythmias (Note: Subjects with chronic&#xD;
             atrial arrhythmia, i.e., atrial fibrillation or paroxysmal SVT, are eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active serious systemic disease, including active bacterial or fungal infection.&#xD;

          -  Active hepatitis or HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment within three months with immunomodulatory therapy (e.g. interferons,&#xD;
             immunoglobulin therapy, IL-1RA or systemic corticosteroids). Short term systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids or topical or intra-articular steroids are acceptable, subject to the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or immunotherapy within 3 weeks prior to dosing with&#xD;
             MORAb-009.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breast-feeding, pregnant, or likely to become pregnant during the study.&#xD;
