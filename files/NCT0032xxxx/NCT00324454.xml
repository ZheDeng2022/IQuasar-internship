  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Levetiracetam (Keppra) is used to treat partial onset seizures. Its biological effects&#xD;
      suggest it might also be useful in treating 3 aspects of human motor neuron diseases (MNDs)&#xD;
      for which no effective therapy exists: cramps, spasticity, and disease progression.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cramps in MNDs are believed to occur as a result of high-frequency burst firing of alpha&#xD;
      motor neurons. Levetiracetam inhibits burst firing in epileptic rat hippocampus.&#xD;
      Levetiracetam has never been tested against cramps in humans; however, it has helped another&#xD;
      condition believed to result from burst firing of a motor nerve: hemi-facial spasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms underlying spasticity in MNDs likely involve imbalance between excitatory and&#xD;
      inhibitory influences on the alpha motor neurons. Levetiracetam may modulate these influences&#xD;
      in a number of ways, including reducing the effects of zinc and beta-carbolines in GABA and&#xD;
      glycine receptors. Levetiracetam reduces phasic (but not tonic) spasticity in patients with&#xD;
      multiple-sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levetiracetam may have neuroprotective properties. In a model of cerebral ischemia induced by&#xD;
      occlusion of the rat internal carotid artery, pre-treatment with levetiracetam reduced&#xD;
      infarct size in a dose-dependent manner. In rats injected with kainic acid to induce calcium&#xD;
      overload, oxidative stress and neurotoxicity, pretreatment with levetiracetam offset kainic&#xD;
      acid's effects. The mechanisms for these effects may relate to levetiracetam's ability to&#xD;
      influence calcium currents, or its ability to increase the release of growth factors from&#xD;
      astrocytes, mechanisms that would be relevant in MNDs. Levetiracetam's ability to inhibit&#xD;
      histone deacetylase may also help slow MNDs progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: 1. Assess the safety and tolerability of levetiracetam over 9 months in patients&#xD;
      with MNDs. 2. Determine whether treatment with levetiracetam is associated with a reduction&#xD;
      in cramps, spasticity or motor neuron disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:Open-label, Phase 2 trial of 20 adult patients with MNDs (ALS, PLS or PMA) at Duke&#xD;
      University ALS Clinic. Eligible patients have cramps with average severity 50/100 points, are&#xD;
      able to provide informed consent, have normal renal functions and are on a stable riluzole&#xD;
      dose. Exclusions include pregnancy, unstable mental illness, dementia, drug abuse or&#xD;
      non-compliance. The first 3 months of the study are a baseline period. Over the remaining 9&#xD;
      months, patients take levetiracetam at increasing doses up to 3000mg per day. Outcome&#xD;
      measures include adverse events, tolerability,cramp-pain-severity score, cramp-frequency&#xD;
      score, modified Ashworth Spasticity Score, Penn Spasm Score, FVC, ALSFRS-R and MMT.&#xD;
