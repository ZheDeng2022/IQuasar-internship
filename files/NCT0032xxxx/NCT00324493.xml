    <textblock>
      Hemophilia, which results from deficiency of factor VIII or IX, is a common hereditary&#xD;
      X-linked bleeding disorder affecting up to 10/100,000 population. About 60-70% of them have&#xD;
      severe disease (factor level &lt;1%). This group is characterized by the occurrence of frequent&#xD;
      spontaneous bleeding into joints and soft tissues. If inadequately treated, it results in&#xD;
      progressive damage to joints and muscles leading to crippling deformities. Close clinical&#xD;
      observation of these patients over many years has shown that those with &gt;1% levels have much&#xD;
      less bleeding compared to those with less than 1%. This observation has gained immense&#xD;
      clinical importance in planning therapy for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prevent progressive joint damage, the missing factor needs to be replaced. Much has&#xD;
      evolved in this practice in the last 50 years. From administration of whole blood in the&#xD;
      beginning, to plasma and cryoprecipitate, to purified plasma-derived concentrates and finally&#xD;
      recombinant factor concentrates. The standard of therapy now is to replace factors frequently&#xD;
      enough to maintain &gt;1% factor levels at all times (&quot;prophylaxis&quot;) or administer immediately&#xD;
      on premonition or earliest signs of bleeding (&quot;on demand&quot; therapy). This has greatly enhanced&#xD;
      the quality of life of people with hemophilia. However, the optimal regimens of factor&#xD;
      replacement remain to be defined. The definition of what is optimal management of this&#xD;
      chronic condition, currently incurable for the vast majority of patients, varies&#xD;
      significantly in different parts of the world, depending on practicality and social&#xD;
      expectations. Models have care have been developed in Western countries based on careful&#xD;
      documentation of outcome over many years. Such data is lacking from developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center study aims to systematically record the outcome of musculoskeletal function&#xD;
      in people with hemophilia in developing countries for the first time and provide information&#xD;
      that can help plan care for the 80% of all hemophiliacs in the world who live in these&#xD;
      countries. Currently there is no well documented model of care at the range of factor&#xD;
      replacement practiced in these countries nor is there any significant information on the&#xD;
      long-term outcome of musculo-skeletal function among these patients.&#xD;

      3.1 Musculoskeletal function in hemophilia - natural history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe hemophilia is characterized by recurrent bleeding into large joints and muscles&#xD;
      resulting in progressive damage and deformity by the time the patient reaches the end of the&#xD;
      second decade ultimately leading to severe functional disability in many of the affected&#xD;
      people. This fact has been well known for long. The orthopedic outcome of a person with&#xD;
      severe hemophilia was perhaps not very different in different parts of the world till the&#xD;
      1960s. However, in the last three decades, the ability of factor replacement therapy to&#xD;
      completely modify the clinical outcome of severe hemophilia has been recognized. Factor&#xD;
      replacement therapy itself has evolved much over this period and infusion of large quantities&#xD;
      of factor concentrates has transformed the outlook of this condition. A person with&#xD;
      hemophilia can now lead a nearly normal life without fear of frequent bleeding into joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Factor replacement for preserving musculoskeletal functions - the current models&#xD;
&#xD;
      As late as the early 1960s, factor replacement in large quantities was difficult because only&#xD;
      fresh plasma could be used. With the discovery of cryoprecipitate in 1964, (1) larger&#xD;
      quantities could be infused. Further purification and lyophilization made home-therapy&#xD;
      possible. (2) It was soon obvious that early factor replacement could reduce joint damage&#xD;
      significantly. Two schools of practice evolved: on-demand therapy where factor concentrates&#xD;
      were infused at the earliest evidence of bleeding and prophylactic therapy aimed at&#xD;
      maintaining factor level above 1% at all times. Both approaches required very large&#xD;
      quantities of factor concentrates but could completely alter the expression of disease by&#xD;
      preventing recurrent bleeding into joints. (3,4) What has facilitated this approach is the&#xD;
      enhanced safety of plasma derived and recombinant factor concentrates. (5,6) Improved methods&#xD;
      of donor selection and the introduction of viral inactivation steps in the manufacturing&#xD;
      process have made these concentrates safer than ever before. (7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most convincing data on the effectiveness of prophylactic factor replacement in&#xD;
      hemophilia is from Sweden. As shown with carefully documented long-term data, perfect joint&#xD;
      architecture can be preserved with large quantities of factor concentrates ranging in doses&#xD;
      from 4,000-9,000 IU/kg annually. (3) More recently, similar data from the Netherlands has&#xD;
      shown that with much lower doses ranging from 1,400-2,500 IU/kg annually, joint damage can be&#xD;
      very significantly reduced. (13) Unfortunately, both these studies have not reported the&#xD;
      disability status of their patients in relationship to the extent of joint damage. In other&#xD;
      words, it is not clear from this data whether the person with a joint score showing mild&#xD;
      damage is necessarily worse functionally that someone with joint cores showing moderate&#xD;
      damage. However, there is often a very large difference among them in terms of the total&#xD;
      quantity of factor replacement therapy. In fact, clinical experience suggests that there is&#xD;
      often a poor correlation between joint scores and functional disability in the joint. Optimal&#xD;
      regimens for factor replacement therefore still remain to be defined. Two large multi-center&#xD;
      studies to evaluate regimens for prophylactic therapy are underway in Italy and Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Models for factor replacement in developing countries&#xD;
&#xD;
      While these models of replacement therapy are very effective in preventing arthropathy, they&#xD;
      have also made hemophilia one of the most expensive diseases to treat. (8) Therefore the&#xD;
      benefits of such an approach have been limited to those people with hemophilia who live in&#xD;
      developed countries. (9) For three quarters of people with hemophilia in the world who live&#xD;
      in developing countries, treatment of this nature remains a distant dream. Most of them&#xD;
      receive very little or no factor concentrates. Blood bank products continue to be used for&#xD;
      factor replacement therapy. (10) As efforts are made to improve their care, it is necessary&#xD;
      to develop more practical models for management of hemophilia in these countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Aim of factor replacement therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The predominant cause of morbidity in hemophilia is the damage resulting from repeated&#xD;
      bleeding into joints. It has therefore been the aim of therapy to establish a standard where&#xD;
      there is no evidence of damage to the joints, clinically and radiologically. (11) The&#xD;
      effectiveness of this approach in preserving joint integrity has been so good that it has now&#xD;
      become the standard for therapy in economically developed countries. Unfortunately, the&#xD;
      annual cost of such therapy at $50-100,000/person has been so high that it has been difficult&#xD;
      even for countries with developed economies to adopt it universally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is certainly desirable for all people with hemophilia all over the world to have the same&#xD;
      level of care. However, the reality is that it is simply not economically feasible. While the&#xD;
      per capita GDP of developed economies are above $20,000, that of developing economies is in&#xD;
      the range of $500-3,000. (12) Apart from this, attitude towards health care varies&#xD;
      considerably with many countries spending less than $10 per person annually. In such&#xD;
      situations, it is necessary to establish a different philosophy for factor replacement. The&#xD;
      aim shifts from maintaining perfect joint integrity to reasonable joint function that will&#xD;
      allow the person to remain functionally independent. Out of necessity and not out of choice,&#xD;
      people with hemophilia in developing countries and their physicians have to accept this fact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The situation with factor replacement for joint bleeding in developing countries is variable.&#xD;
      The limited data available suggest that the total quantity of factor concentrate used varies&#xD;
      from about 2-30,000 IU/person annually corresponding to about 25-500 iu/kg/year. (14,15) Some&#xD;
      of these centers that use factor concentrates in the intermediate range have reported&#xD;
      preservation of reasonable joint function and functional independence. However, this is not&#xD;
      backed by carefully documented data on orthopedic outcome. A systematic evaluation of&#xD;
      orthopedic outcome with the different replacement protocols will help develop suitable models&#xD;
      for treatment of hemophilia in these countries and will also assist health care planners in&#xD;
      determining the cost of care. In recent years, considerable efforts are being made in many&#xD;
      developing countries to get support from governments or insurance agencies for hemophilia&#xD;
      care but the absence of adequate data on outcome with protocols that are practical in these&#xD;
      situations makes it difficult to convince the authorities that even lower doses can preserve&#xD;
      long-term functional independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A unique aspect of this study will be the assessment of functional independence of people&#xD;
      with hemophilia and its correlation with joint scores. Unfortunately assessment of functional&#xD;
      independence measure in hemophilia has not been standardized. After much discussion at the&#xD;
      WFH Congress at Seville and the subsequent meeting of the SSC of the ISTH with the&#xD;
      prospective co-investigators and advisors, including Drs.Donna DiMichele, H. Marijke van den&#xD;
      Berg, Bruce Evatt and Carol Kasper, it was decided to apply a generic instrument such as the&#xD;
      WeeFIM® till a more hemophilia specific instrument becomes available. This instrument is easy&#xD;
      to administer and has been shown to have excellent consistency. (16)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline factor levels and quantum of factor replacement may not be the only determinants of&#xD;
      musculo-skeletal outcome in hemophilia. Levels of other coagulation proteins, including&#xD;
      presence of prothrombotic markers, can also alter clinical outcome. Polymorphisms of various&#xD;
      modulators of the inflammatory response may play a role. Though it is not envisaged to study&#xD;
      these parameters in this study, it has been planned to collect blood samples with informed&#xD;
      consent for evaluating these some of these parameters in future, if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis While it is likely that there will be good correlation between joint scores and&#xD;
      functional independence at low joint scores, this correlation is unlikely to be linear or&#xD;
      even significant, with increasing joint scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to document the outcome of musculo-skeletal function in a large number of&#xD;
      children with severe hemophilia receiving varying levels of factor replacement therapy over a&#xD;
      long period of time with particular emphasis not only on joint scores but on the functional&#xD;
      independence status of these patients.&#xD;
