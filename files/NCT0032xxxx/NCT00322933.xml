      This multicentre SHARF4 (Stuivenberg Hospital Acute Renal Failure) study aims to investigate&#xD;
      outcome in patients with acute renal failure (ARF), stratified according to severity of&#xD;
      disease (SHARF score) and randomised to different treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adult patients with a serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dl were included. Patients were stratified&#xD;
      according to disease severity and those in need for RRT were randomised to intermittent&#xD;
      (IRRT) or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)&#xD;

      Subjects. Hospitals qualified for participation if they had at least 600 beds, a centre for&#xD;
      the treatment of End Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD) patients, a multipurpose ICU with at least&#xD;
      12 beds, at least 30 patients with ARF treated by RRT during the last year and regular use of&#xD;
      both intermittent and continuous techniques. A centre questionnaire was sent to candidate&#xD;
      centres in order to check qualifying criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualified Belgian ICU units included all adult (age Â³ 18 years old) patients with a serum&#xD;
      creatinine &gt;2 mg/dl that were consecutively admitted. All patients with known pre-existing&#xD;
      chronic renal disease, defined as a serum creatinine above 1.5 mg or with clearly reduced&#xD;
      kidney size on ultrasound were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity was defined by calculating the SHARF score in all subjects that fulfilled the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. Patients were stratified in 3 classes (SHARF&lt;30, 30-60, &gt;60). Within each&#xD;
      stratum, those in need for renal replacement therapy were randomised to daily IRRT&#xD;
      (intermittent haemodialysis during 4-6 hours daily) or CRRT (continuous veno-venous&#xD;
      hemofiltration), if none of the predefined contraindications for randomisation were present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection. The following basic data were collected: demographic (age, sex, weight and&#xD;
      height), course of hospitalisation (date of admission to hospital and to ICU, date of&#xD;
      discharge from ICU and from hospital or date of death), date of ARF diagnosis, type of ARF&#xD;
      (prerenal, renal, postrenal, acute on chronic disease), cause of ARF (acute tubular necrosis,&#xD;
      acute glomerulonephritis, acute interstitial nephritis, systemic disease), primary disease&#xD;
      type (medical - toxic, medical - other, surgical, obstetric) and serum creatinine at&#xD;
      different time points during hospitalisation. Parameters of the SHARF score were collected at&#xD;
      the first day that the criteria of ARF were met. For patients referred to the ICU later in&#xD;
      the course of their ARF, the day of admission to the ICU was the starting day. Overall&#xD;
      severity was evaluated with the APACHE II score at baseline and with the SOFA score at&#xD;
      diagnosis of ARF and after 24 and 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following short-term outcome parameters were measured: hospital mortality, length of stay&#xD;
      at ICU and hospital and GFR at hospital discharge according to the Cockroft and Gault&#xD;
      formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation of treatment. From the previous SHARF studies, we learned that about 50 % of&#xD;
      patients would need RRT treatment. The decision to treat conservatively or to start RRT was&#xD;
      at the discretion of the attending physician, taking into account the rules of good clinical&#xD;
      practice in this field. The choice of RRT treatment modality was randomised within each&#xD;
      stratum of the SHARF score. Randomisation was performed electronically per centre. In order&#xD;
      to avoid selection bias, all consecutive patients had to be included. If a patient could not&#xD;
      be randomised for some reason, the reason had to be documented in the electronic Case Report&#xD;
      Form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal Replacement Therapy. The techniques used to perform RRT were in agreement with the&#xD;
      standard procedures of the participating hospitals. Therefore, all candidate centres&#xD;
      completed a questionnaire about their current renal replacement strategy in ARF. The strategy&#xD;
      chosen in the protocol was the result of this questionnaire. For IRRT a central venous&#xD;
      access, a synthetic membrane (polysulfone or AN 69), and a bicarbonate dialysate were used.&#xD;
      Daily dialysis was performed during 4-6 hours per session with a blood flow of 100-300 ml/min&#xD;
      and a dialysate flow of 100-500 ml/min. For CRRT a central venous access and a synthetic&#xD;
      membrane (polysulfone or AN 69) were used. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was&#xD;
      the preferred method. It was continued during 24 hours per day with a blood flow rate of&#xD;
      100-200 ml/min, a substitution rate of 1-2 L per hour and either lactate or bicarbonate&#xD;
      solutions were used. For both modalities, anticoagulation was performed according to the&#xD;
      centre practice with either unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin or citrate.&#xD;
      The randomly assigned treatment modality of IRRT or CRRT had to be continued daily during at&#xD;
      least 3 consecutive days. Thereafter treatment could be continued according to the needs of&#xD;
      the patients and at the discretion of the investigator. The motivation for any change in the&#xD;
      randomised or planned treatment was recorded in the electronic CRF. Data of all RRT&#xD;
      treatments were recorded including date, type of treatment, effective duration,&#xD;
      ultrafiltration rate and artificial kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation The sample calculation was based on the assumption that the overall&#xD;
      mortality would be 50 % as in the former SHARF studies and that a difference of 10 % in&#xD;
      mortality between IRRT and CRRT had to be detected to be clinically relevant. With a first&#xD;
      order error of 5 % and a power of 80 % a sample size of 407 patients was needed in each renal&#xD;
      replacement group. Since about 50 % of included patients would be considered for renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy, a total of 1628 patients had to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. The data analysis was performed according to the intention-to-treat&#xD;
      principle. Univariate analysis was performed on all parameters in order to find significant&#xD;
      differences between groups using Student's t-test and Chi square test. Life table analysis&#xD;
      was used to compare hospital survival in both treatment groups with Cox proportional hazards&#xD;
      regression to control for covariates. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic&#xD;
      regression with mortality as dependant outcome variable. Confounding factors were selected if&#xD;
      they show significant difference in the comparison between both treatment options and&#xD;
      contribute effectively and independently to the observed outcome. For subgroup analysis,&#xD;
      selection was based on reported evidence that these subgroups included the most complicated&#xD;
      patients showing the highest co-morbidity and mortality. Statistical significance was set at&#xD;
      the .05 level (two-sided). All analyses were performed using SPSS, version 12.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board The protocol has been approved initially by the Ethics Committee&#xD;
      of the Public Sector of Antwerp and by the Ethics Committee of each participating centre. A&#xD;
      written informed consent has been asked from each patient or his representative in case the&#xD;
      patient was unconscient or intubated.&#xD;
