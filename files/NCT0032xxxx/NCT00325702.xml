  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will develop, implement, and evaluate a community-level intervention for Black&#xD;
      and White substance-using MSM between the ages of 15 and 29. The intervention is designed to&#xD;
      change both social norms and risk behavior using persuasive media communication and&#xD;
      interpersonal networking as primary intervention strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data from focus groups and interviews will inform the development of the&#xD;
      intervention. The effects of the intervention will be assessed through annual interviews with&#xD;
      young Black and White MSM in Philadelphia where the intervention will be implemented and in&#xD;
      Baltimore, our comparison community.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) have unique needs for targeted and tailored HIV&#xD;
      prevention messages. HIV infection rates among MSM remain high, particularly among men under&#xD;
      the age of 30 and for Black YMSM, whose HIV infection rates are over four times those of&#xD;
      White YMSM. The use of drugs and alcohol has been linked to increased sexual risk for HIV&#xD;
      among MSM yet no intervention addressing substance use and sexual risk within this population&#xD;
      has been rigorously evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will develop, implement, and evaluate a community-level intervention for Black&#xD;
      and White substance-using MSM between the ages of 15 and 29. The intervention, implemented&#xD;
      with the collaboration of a community service organization, the Mazzoni Center, will be&#xD;
      designed to change both social norms and risk behavior using persuasive media communication&#xD;
      and interpersonal networking as primary intervention strategies. The proposed project aims&#xD;
      to: 1) examine patterns and contexts of episodic substance use among YMSM; 2) compare&#xD;
      patterns of substance use for Black and White YMSM, and differences by age, sexual identity&#xD;
      and socio-economic status; 3) clarify the association between patterns and contexts of&#xD;
      substance use and sexual risk behaviors; 4) evaluate the efficacy of a community-level&#xD;
      intervention for substance-using YMSM to decrease sexual risk for HIV, through strengthening&#xD;
      social norms, increasing perceived risk, and enhancing self-efficacy and positive attitudes&#xD;
      to HIV prevention; 5) measure the differential impact of intervention messages on sexual risk&#xD;
      behavior for subgroups of YMSM; 6) determine if a reduction in substance use leads to a&#xD;
      decrease in sexual risk behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the formative research phase, qualitative data will be obtained through focus groups&#xD;
      and in-depth interviews to refine the conceptual model and the media materials. The&#xD;
      intervention evaluation will collect quantitative data from YMSM in both Philadelphia PA and&#xD;
      the comparison community of Baltimore MD, using geocoding and census tract data to control&#xD;
      for demographic and socio-economic differences. A Solomon four-group design will be used to&#xD;
      collect data from panel and cross-sectional samples in intervention and comparison&#xD;
      communities. Four annual waves of interviews (baseline, 12, 24, and 36 months) will enable us&#xD;
      to examine exposure to the intervention, changes in norms and behavior, and long-term&#xD;
      intervention effects. A total of 650 men will be interviewed in Philadelphia and 400 in&#xD;
      Baltimore. The data will be analyzed using multivariate techniques, including generalized&#xD;
      linear model (GLM) repeated measures analysis and cumulative logit models. The study results&#xD;
      will provide needed information on substance use and sexual risk of Black and White YMSM and&#xD;
      have direct implications for implementing effective interventions to this high-risk&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
