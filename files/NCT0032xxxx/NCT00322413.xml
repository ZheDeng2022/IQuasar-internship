  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The two epoetins, Epoetin alfa, a well established drug to treat renal anemia and Epoetin&#xD;
      Omega, that differs from Epoetin alfa in the sugar moiety of the molecule were compared in&#xD;
      regard of efficacy and safety to treat end stage renal disease anemia. Study hypothesis was&#xD;
      that Epoetin Omega is non-inferior to Epoetin alfa in correcting renal anemia in dialysis&#xD;
      patients. A 12-weeks randomized comparative efficacy study was performed including 77 end&#xD;
      stage renal disease patients (epoetin omega:n=39, epoetin alfa: n=38). In the intent-to-treat&#xD;
      analysis, average weekly difference in hemoglobin versus baseline value was higher in&#xD;
      omega-treated patients: 1.94+-0.81 vs. 1.23+-0.62 g/dl. The unadjusted and adjusted&#xD;
      omega-alfa differences were 0.71 g/dl (95%CI 0.38 to 1.04; p&lt;0.001) and 0.78 g/dl (0.49 to&#xD;
      1.08;p&lt;0.001), respectively. Average weekly epoetin dose was lower in the omega group: 87+-25&#xD;
      vs. 108+-21 IU/kg. The unadjusted and adjusted omega-alfa differences were -21IU/kg (-32 to&#xD;
      -11; p&lt;0.001) and -24IU/kg (-35 to -13; p&lt;0.001), respectively. Epoetins were comparably well&#xD;
      tolerated. In dialysis patients, subcutaneous epoetin omega apparently provides a greater&#xD;
      anti-anemic effect per administered dose (IU) than epoetin alfa.&#xD;

      The two epoetins, Epoetin alfa, a well established drug to treat renal anemia and Epoetin&#xD;

      that Epoetin Omega is non-inferior to Epoetin alfa in correcting renal anemia in dialysis&#xD;
      patients. A 12-weeks randomized comparative efficacy study was performed including 77 end&#xD;
      stage renal disease patients (epoetin omega:n=39, epoetin alfa: n=38). All patients were&#xD;
      anemic (Hemoglobin &lt; 90 g/L), treated by regular hemodialysis and without signs of bleeding,&#xD;
      hemolysis, inflammation or history of major surgery.Treatment was started with 50 IU/kg body&#xD;
      weight subcutaneously per week and thereafter adjusted according to the hemoglobin response.&#xD;
      In the intent-to-treat analysis, average weekly difference in hemoglobin versus baseline&#xD;
      value was higher in omega-treated patients: 1.94+-0.81 vs. 1.23+-0.62 g/dl. The unadjusted&#xD;
      and adjusted omega-alfa differences were 0.71 g/dl (95%CI 0.38 to 1.04; p&lt;0.001) and 0.78&#xD;
