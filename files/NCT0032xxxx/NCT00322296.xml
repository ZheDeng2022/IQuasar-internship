  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parapsoriasis is a term that refers to a precursor stage of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma&#xD;
      (CTCL)/mycosis fungoides(MF). Complete responses (clearing) of early presentations of CTCL/MF&#xD;
      have been shown to be associated with long-term survival and cure. Induction of a complete&#xD;
      response in parapsoriasis, therefore, would seem to be a desirable therapeutic endpoint.&#xD;
      Bexarotene 1% gel has been approved for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis&#xD;
      fungoides). The goal of this study is to evaluate the tolerability, safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      bexarotene 1% gel in patients with parapsoriasis.&#xD;

      Parapsoriasis is a term that refers to a red, scaling (papulosquamous) eruption on the skin&#xD;
      characterized by its distribution (trunk and proximal extremities), asymptomatic nature and&#xD;
      chronic course. Histologically, parapsoriasis is characterized by variable degrees of&#xD;
      parakeratosis and epidermal spongiosis with a superficial, sparse, patchy, lichenoid&#xD;
      infiltrate of lymphocytes and varying degrees of epidermal involvement (epidermotropism). No&#xD;
      definitive studies have defined its etiology or epidemiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, the term &quot;parapsoriasis&quot; was introduced into the dermatology literature by&#xD;
      Brocq in 1902. Brocq used the term to clinically characterize a variety of papulosquamous&#xD;
      eruptions that were first reported in the late 19th century. In 1905, he attempted to&#xD;
      categorize parapsoriasis in relationship to other papulosquamous diseases of the skin. In his&#xD;
      model, Brocq delineated a relationship between some variants of parapsoriasis (parapsoriasis&#xD;
      en plaques or large plaque parapsoriasis) and mycosis fungoides or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma&#xD;
      (CTCL). The first cases of mycosis fungoides (MF) were reported early in the 19th century.&#xD;
      Progressive stages of MF (&quot;premycotic&quot; patch phase, plaque phase and tumor phase) were&#xD;
      defined later in the 19th century, while the neoplastic nature of the disease remained&#xD;
      unknown. Brocq's model sought to emphasize clinical similarities between some variants of&#xD;
      parapsoriasis (large plaque) and early, patch phase MF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunohistochemical (IHC) studies have demonstrated that parapsoriasis shares a similar&#xD;
      immunophenotype with early stage CTCL in that the lymphocytic infiltrate is predominantly&#xD;
      composed of CD4 lymphocytes. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- based T-cell receptor (TCR)&#xD;
      gene rearrangement studies have demonstrated that parapsoriasis is a lymphoproliferative&#xD;
      disorder characterized by the detection of clonal populations of T-cells, as is CTCL.&#xD;
      Knowledge of the natural history of parapsoriasis stems from a series of longitudinal outcome&#xD;
      studies published over the last 40 years. Progression to unequivocal CTCL ranged from 0% to&#xD;
      35% of parapsoriasis cases. Typically, cases associated with progression to CTCL tend to have&#xD;
      larger plaques with clinical features of atrophy and/or poikiloderma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the clinicopathologic similarities of parapsoriasis and early stage CTCL, the exact&#xD;
      nosology of parapsoriasis has been challenged, with a hypothesis that all variants of&#xD;
      parapsoriasis (large plaque, small plaque and digitate) are synonymous with early MF.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, parapsoriasis is recognized as a distinct precursor stage (T0N0M0) in the TNM&#xD;
      staging schema of CTCL. T0 CTCL is defined by the presence of lesions clinically and/or&#xD;
      histologically suggestive of CTCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No definitive studies have been published regarding therapy of parapsoriasis. When treated,&#xD;
      most patients are initiated empirically on topical steroids or phototherapy. Typically,&#xD;
      patients will have partial responses and/or relapse off any therapy. A rational therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy for parapsoriasis is lacking because there are no longitudinal studies that&#xD;
      correlate treatment response and impact on progression to CTCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bexarotene is a resinoid, a subclass of retinoids that binds preferentially to nuclear&#xD;
      retinoic X receptors (RXR), and has therapeutic activity in CTCL. Bexarotene 1% gel has been&#xD;
      approved for treatment of CTCL and found to have up to a 63% response rate in Stage Ia to IIa&#xD;
      CTCL. The goal of this study was to evaluate the tolerability, safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      bexarotene 1% gel in patients with parapsoriasis and to evaluate the anti-tumor host response&#xD;
      in pre- and post-treatment skin biopsies.&#xD;
