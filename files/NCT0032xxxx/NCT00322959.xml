      Tai-Chi-Chuan (TCC), a branch of traditional Chinese martial arts, has been widely practiced&#xD;
      since the 17th century. Recent studies have shown that TCC can improve cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      function, muscle strength, humoral and cellular immunity, metabolic response and mental&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cultured monocytes from blood or bone marrow can be triggered to differentiate to myeloid&#xD;
      dendritic cells (DC). DCs are specialized leukocytes for presenting antigens to quiescent,&#xD;
      naive, and memory T cells, and they play pivotal roles in the induction of cell-mediated as&#xD;
      well as humoral immune responses in vivo. Mature DCs have a capacity for initiating immunity&#xD;
      or tolerance, which depends on their activation state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will investigate the effect of TCC on DC differentiation in the peripheral&#xD;
      blood obtained from the healthy donors who take part with and without TCC exercise. The&#xD;
      distribution of various DC sub-populations (myeloid DC and plasmacytoid cell) will be&#xD;
      analyzed by detecting surface marker expression.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tai-Chi-Chuan (TCC), a branch of traditional Chinese martial arts, has been widely practiced&#xD;
      since the 17th century. TCC gradually evolved into many styles, the Chen style is the oldest&#xD;
      and the Yang style is the most popular. The practice of TCC was originally related to&#xD;
      concerns about physical fitness and the capacity for self defense. Over the centuries, it has&#xD;
      become far more focused on the homoeostasis of the body's internal environment. The&#xD;
      interaction between mind and body has long been seen as more important than the development&#xD;
      of any martial arts skills. Classical TCC consists of many complex postures, and performing a&#xD;
      complete set takes 20 to 30 minutes. A simplified form of TCC was developed to facilitate&#xD;
      promotion in 1956 (1), however, simplified TCC have lesser training benefits owing to&#xD;
      reduction of exercise intensity and duration. TCC has been considered as a practice of&#xD;
      medico-athletics, which can improvement of physical condition and treatment of certain&#xD;
      chronic diseases. Exercise has definite effects on the health of human, but appropriate forms&#xD;
      are scarce. Recent studies have shown that TCC can improve cardiorespiratory function (2-4),&#xD;
      muscle strength (5), humoral and cellular immunity (6-8), metabolic response (9), and mental&#xD;
      control (10). Studies used TCC postures for training showed that the exercise intensity of&#xD;
      TCC training is moderate (2). A well designed study for TCC on human health, especially&#xD;
      whether TCC improve immune response or not, will be processed in this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized leukocytes for presenting antigens to quiescent, naive,&#xD;
      and memory T cells, and they play pivotal roles in the induction of cell-mediated as well as&#xD;
      humoral immune responses in vivo (11). The exceptional ability of DCs to stimulate T cells in&#xD;
      vitro and in vivo is attributed, at least in part, to their ability to capture antigen, to&#xD;
      migrate into lymphoid organs, and to express high levels of immunostimulatory molecules, such&#xD;
      as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, B7-1, B7-2, and IL-12 (11,12). Immature&#xD;
      DCs, such as Langerhans cells of the skin, capture and process antigens very efficiently&#xD;
      (13). Upon exposure to various microbial and inflammatory products (eg, lipopolysaccharide&#xD;
      [LPS], IL-1, TNF-alpha), DCs mature and migrate into lymphoid tissues to interact with T and&#xD;
      B cells (14-17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will investigate the effect of Tai-Chi-Chuan (TCC) on DC differentiation in&#xD;
      the peripheral blood obtained from the healthy donor who take part with and without TCC&#xD;
      exercise. Subjects who practice with or without Yang TCC will be assessed their distribution&#xD;
      of various DC sub-populations (myeloid DC and plasmacytoid cell) and their activation state&#xD;
      will be analyzed by detecting surface marker expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential of this study is to demonstrate the immunomodulatory activity of TCC, a novel&#xD;
      sport in Chinese for thousand years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects and study design. Yang TCC practitioner who keep practicing at least 3 times a&#xD;
           week for more than 3 years will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cardiopulmonary fitness measurement during TCC practice. To determine the exercise&#xD;
           intensity and cardiopulmonary fitness of the classical form of Yang TCC, HP responses&#xD;
           and VO2max will be measured during TCC exercise. Lactate response before and immediately&#xD;
           after TCC practice will be measured. The Cosmed K4 system (Cosmed s.r.l., Rome, Italy)&#xD;
           consists of a photoelectric turbine flowmeter will be used to calculate the minute&#xD;
           ventilation, and measure the number of expiratory cycles per minute. Cardiorespiratory&#xD;
           parameters including heart rate, minute ventilation (VE), oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide&#xD;
           production (VCO2), will be also measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cell preparation. The mononuclaer cells of blood will be isolated by using&#xD;
           centrifugation on a density gradient (Ficoll-Hypaque, 1.077 gm/ml, Pharmacia Fine&#xD;
           Chemicals). DCs will be isolated by using CD11c-conjugated MACS magnetic beads.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess the distribution of various DC sub-populations. Myeloid DC (CD11c+) and&#xD;
           plasmacytoid cells (CD123+), which are excluded by lineage markers&#xD;
           (CD3，CD14，CD16，CD19，CD20，CD56) will be analyzed by detecting surface marker expression&#xD;
           with flow cytometer.&#xD;
