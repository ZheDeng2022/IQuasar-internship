      This proposal seeks to use DNA analyses to understand how racial and genetic factors&#xD;
      influence interferon (treatment) response in HCV infection in African Americans. A better&#xD;
      understanding should allow rational design of new therapies or better use of existing&#xD;
      therapies. Patients will provide medical history and undergo a physical exam, blood draws,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, possible chest x-ray, and abdominal ultrasound. Patients will be admitted&#xD;
      to the hospital for 5 days and undergo 2 liver biopsies, sedation, and multiple blood draws.&#xD;
      Twenty adult male volunteers (10 Caucasians,10 African Americans) ages 18 - 65 years will&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;

      This proposal uses sophisticated DNA microarray analyses of the transcriptional changes&#xD;
      induced in hepatocytes (cellular locus of viral replication) and peripheral blood lymphocytes&#xD;
      (one compartment of immune responder cells) in an effort to better understand how racial and&#xD;
      host genetic factors influence interferon response in HCV infection. A better understanding&#xD;
      of these underlying mechanisms should allow rational design of new therapies or better use of&#xD;
      existing therapeutic modalities. The variables to be investigated are racial differences in&#xD;
      interferon induced: 1) HCV viral kinetics and 2) intrahepatic and PBL transcriptional&#xD;
      responses. Specific Aim 1: (a) To compare the phase 1 and early phase 2 decline of the viral&#xD;
      titer in serum in African-Americans and Caucasians following a single dose of IFN-alpha (10&#xD;
      MU sc). (b) To determine the hepatic HCV RNA abundance in both a baseline liver biopsy and in&#xD;
      a repeat liver biopsy taken 24 hrs after administration of interferon, and to determine how&#xD;
      this correlates with the HCV RNA decline in serum over the 24 hr period. (c) To compare the&#xD;
      rates of viral decline in the liver and serum in African-Americans and Caucasians 24 hours&#xD;
      after interferon, and to relate this to the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the initial dose of&#xD;
      interferon. A total of 10 Caucasian and 10 African American patients with chronic hepatitis C&#xD;
      and HCV genotype 1 will be enrolled in this study. All study patients will undergo a baseline&#xD;
      percutaneous liver biopsy on day 1 of the study. On day 3, a single dose of IFN-alpha 2a (10&#xD;
      MU sc) will be administered and a repeat liver biopsy will be done 24 hours after the&#xD;
      injection. Specific Aim 2: (a) To utilize Affymetrix HG-U133A&amp;B Human GeneChips® to determine&#xD;
      global mRNA profiles in liver tissue collected from patients before and 24 hrs after a single&#xD;
      10 MU dose of IFN-alpha and thereby assess the intrahepatic transcriptional response to&#xD;
      IFN-alpha. (b) To characterize differences in the early intrahepatic transcriptional response&#xD;
      to interferon in Caucasians and African Americans. Specific Aim 3: (a) To utilize Affymetrix&#xD;
      HG-U133A&amp;B Human GeneChips® to determine global transcription profiles in peripheral blood&#xD;
      lymphocytes pre-treatment, 24hrs, and 48hrs after the initial dose of interferon and to&#xD;
      compare these results in Caucasians and African Americans at these time points. (b) To&#xD;
      compare global gene profiles in lymphocytes and liver at baseline and 24hrs after interferon,&#xD;
      and determine whether lymphocytic transcriptional profiling is a valid surrogate for&#xD;
      intrahepatic gene profiling. Specific Aim 4: To use sophisticated bioinformatics approaches&#xD;
      and HCV kinetic modeling to determine whether differences in early intrahepatic or&#xD;
      lymphocytic transcriptional profiles correlate with early changes in the level of viremia&#xD;
      (observed antiviral response) in the period immediately following administration of the 10 MU&#xD;
      dose of IFN-alpha.&#xD;
