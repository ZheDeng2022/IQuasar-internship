      This study will attempt to find out what effect mosquito insecticides have on the&#xD;
      transmission of malaria in The Gambia. Eight hundred healthy men and women, aged 18 to 40&#xD;
      years, living in selected villages east of Farafenni town in The Gambia, West Africa will be&#xD;
      screened for parasites. About 552 of these people are expected to be free of malaria and will&#xD;
      form the study group. These people will participate in the study for 7 months and will be&#xD;
      checked for the malaria-causing parasite every two weeks by finger prick blood sample.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Malaria remains one of the world's greatest childhood killers and is a substantial obstacle&#xD;
      to social and economic development in the tropics. The overwhelming bulk of the world's&#xD;
      malaria burden rests upon the population of sub-Saharan Africa because of the unique&#xD;
      coincidence of expanding human populations, weak health systems, the world's most effective&#xD;
      vector mosquito species and environmental conditions ideal for transmission. At the start of&#xD;
      the new millennium malaria is still deeply entrenched in Africa and effective malaria control&#xD;
      is under threat from the inexorable spread of parasite strains resistant to antimalarial&#xD;
      drugs and the emergence of mosquitoes resistant to the pyrethroid insecticides used to&#xD;
      impregnate bednets. Larval control may offer a new alternative for effective control.&#xD;
      Mosquito larval control strategies (environmental management and larviciding) have&#xD;
      historically been shown to be successful in reducing the abundance of mosquitoes. This study&#xD;
      plans to apply a larvicide in an effort to control malaria and reduce the burden of malaria.&#xD;
      While it is abundantly clear that this product will kill mosquito larvae in the laboratory&#xD;
      and in the field, it is not certain that doing so will reduce the burden of malaria for the&#xD;
      human population. Briefly, the steps involved include survival and development of immature&#xD;
      mosquito stages, emergence of adult mosquitoes, blood feeding by those mosquitoes,&#xD;
      acquisition and development of malaria parasites by adult mosquitoes and transmission of&#xD;
      parasites to susceptible humans. The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the use of&#xD;
      the time-to-infection end point as a measure of malaria transmission in The Gambia, while&#xD;
      mosquito larvicides are used to control malaria vectors. The main outcomes of this study are&#xD;
      (1) the proportion of adults with detectable parasitemia (Plasmodium falciparum) that is a&#xD;
      binary variable and (2) time-to-infection with malaria parasites that will be treated as a&#xD;
      continuous variable. This experimental design takes place over 7 months. The target sample&#xD;
      size is 800 adults (aged 18-40 years, approximately half will be women and half men) living&#xD;
      in 50 villages east of Farafenni town in The Gambia, West Africa. It is estimated that 552 of&#xD;
      the adults will have no detectable parasites in their blood at the beginning of the&#xD;
      transmission season (June). These parasite negative individuals will be followed either for&#xD;
      the duration of the transmission season (June through November) or until they become positive&#xD;
      for parasites.&#xD;
