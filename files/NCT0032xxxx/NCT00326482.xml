  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide a basis for research on the impact of liver injury caused by&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients. Elevated liver enzymes called AST and ALT&#xD;
      are common in HIV-infected patients taking antiretroviral medications and can indicate liver&#xD;
      damage. Although there are a number of possible causes for these elevations, such as&#xD;
      infections with a hepatitis virus, antiretroviral medications alone can lead to the&#xD;
      elevations. The study will focus particularly on evidence of liver fibrosis, which is a sign&#xD;
      of progressive liver damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients 18 and older who 1) have been taking combination antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      for at least 12 months and have been on a stable regimen for at least 3 months, and 2) have&#xD;
      had elevated AST or ALT levels for at least 6 months may be eligible for this study. Patients&#xD;
      who have had liver biopsies performed in the past may be eligible for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures over a 12-month period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance test: The patient drinks a glucose (sugar) drink. Blood samples&#xD;
           are then drawn over 2 hours through an intravenous (IV) line in the patient's arm. This&#xD;
           test measures how high the patient's blood sugar and insulin levels rise after drinking&#xD;
           a standard glucose load.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transient elastography: This ultrasound test uses vibration (sound waves) to measure&#xD;
           liver stiffness (fibrosis). Vibrations move faster through a fibrotic liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Triple-phase CT scan and single slice CT scan of L4-5: Patients fast for 4 hours before&#xD;
           the CT scan. A contrast material is injected through a catheter placed in an arm vein to&#xD;
           improve the visibility of the liver in the specialized X-ray images obtained in the CT&#xD;
           scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver biopsy: This test removes a small sample of liver tissue for microscopic&#xD;
           examination, particularly for evidence of fibrosis. The skin over the biopsy site is&#xD;
           numbed and a needle is passed through the skin and rapidly in and out of the liver.&#xD;
           Patients may be given a sedative for the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up visits. Patients return for follow-up visits 1 to 4 weeks after the liver&#xD;
           biopsy and three more times over the course of the study for a medical history, physical&#xD;
           examination and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may participate in an additional 4-year follow-up, during which they have visits&#xD;
      every 3-12 months and are offered the opportunity to repeat the biopsy no sooner than 1 year&#xD;
      after the first biopsy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      At present, there are no clear guidelines as to when antiretroviral therapy for human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection should be stopped in the setting of elevated liver&#xD;
      enzymes. In large part, this is due to a limited understanding of the natural history of&#xD;
      antiretroviral-related hepatotoxicity. Although several antiretrovirals have been reported to&#xD;
      cause fatal acute hepatitis, more often they cause an asymptomatic elevation in transaminase&#xD;
      levels, the optimal management of which is uncertain. This pilot study seeks to create a&#xD;
      foundation for research on the impact of antiretroviral-induced liver injury by providing an&#xD;
      estimate of the prevalence of hepatic fibrosis in a cohort of sixty HIV-infected patients who&#xD;
      have chronically elevated transaminases while on antiretroviral therapy in the absence of&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) coinfection. Liver biopsy specimens will be evaluated&#xD;
      for fibrosis by microscopic examination, the current gold standard for assessing the nature&#xD;
      and severity of liver disease.[1] The presence of fibrosis, as well as other histopathology,&#xD;
      will be described using a validated scoring system. Primarily, this will be a crosssectional&#xD;
      study, but subjects will be offered the opportunity to participate in an extended follow-up&#xD;
      period and undergo another liver biopsy. Individuals will not be excluded on the basis of&#xD;
      alcohol abuse, insulin resistance, or lipodystrophy, but data will be collected on these&#xD;
      potentially confounding variables. Noninvasive measures, such as transient elastography (an&#xD;
      ultrasonic technique), will be assessed for their ability to predict fibrosis in this&#xD;
      population. Correlations will also be sought with laboratory markers of fibrosis. The&#xD;
      identification of fibrosis (and its precursors) in association with antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      may be very clinically relevant as it may slowly regress with cessation of the causal&#xD;
      agent(s). If the causal agent is continued, however, cirrhosis may develop, the reversal of&#xD;
      which is thought to be rare.&#xD;
