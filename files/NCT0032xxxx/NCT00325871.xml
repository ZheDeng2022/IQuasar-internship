  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the common malignancies worldwide, accounting for a&#xD;
      significant percentage of cancer mortality. Concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) is now a&#xD;
      standard treatment for unresectable malignancies of anorectum. To improve quality of life,&#xD;
      CCRT is also commonly applied in treatment of lower rectal and anal canal cancer to preserve&#xD;
      anal sphincter function. The most commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs combined with&#xD;
      radiation as radiosensitizers is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Circulating endothelial progenitor&#xD;
      cells (EPC), which contribute to the tumor vessel formation, reflect the response to&#xD;
      chemotherapy both in animal model and clinical trial. Thus, circulating EPC can be used as a&#xD;
      marker for optimizing and monitoring the anti-angiogenesis therapy including angiogenesis&#xD;
      inhibitors and chemotherapy. Whether circulating EPC can be served as a marker of CCRT&#xD;
      efficacy or not remains undetermined. Since CCRT is now a standard treatment of locally&#xD;
      advanced and high-risk CRC, the development of a surrogate marker for monitoring CCRT&#xD;
      response and optimize treatment intensity is very important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this grant we intent to monitor the levels of circulating EPC in locally advanced and&#xD;
      high-risk CRC patients before, during and after CCRT. To further characterize the changes in&#xD;
      function and biology of EPC caused by CCRT, a syngeneic animal model will be also used to&#xD;
      evaluate the clonogenecity and specific gene expression of EPC in tumor-bearing mice&#xD;
      receiving CCRT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the common malignancies worldwide, accounting for a&#xD;
      significant percentage of cancer mortality. The incidence in both developing and developed&#xD;
      countries has been increasing over the past few decades (1). Radiation therapy, either as&#xD;
      post-operative adjuvant treatment for resectable disease or definitive treatment along with&#xD;
      chemotherapy for unresectable disease, has an important role in management of this cancer&#xD;
      (1-4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) is now a standard treatment for cervical cancer (bulky and&#xD;
      locally advanced lesions) (5) and unresectable malignancies of gastrointestinal system origin&#xD;
      (esophagus, stomach, pancreas and anorectum) (6-9). To improve quality of life, CCRT is also&#xD;
      commonly applied in treatment of lower rectal and anal canal cancer to preserve anal&#xD;
      sphincter function (9). The most commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs combined with radiation&#xD;
      as radiosensitizers are cis-platinum, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin C (6-9). These&#xD;
      drugs are myelosuppressive and prone to cause life-threatening neutropenia, anemia or&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia, which are more severe than those with radiotherapy alone (5-9). To avoid&#xD;
      unnecessary over-treatment in CRC, the optimization of CCRT is of critical importance.&#xD;
      Herein, the development of a surrogate marker for monitoring treatment efficacy is pivotal to&#xD;
      optimize CCRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiogenesis is a heavily regulated process, which is involved by complex interactions&#xD;
      between inhibitory and stimulatory angiogenic factors. It is essential for tumor growth,&#xD;
      progression and metastasis and is correlated with poor prognosis in cancer patients including&#xD;
      CRC. Many novel compounds that potently inhibit formation of neoplastic blood vessels have&#xD;
      been recently developed. There is increasing interest in developing angiogeneis-suppressive&#xD;
      agents for colorectal cancer treatment and growing number of anti-angiogenesis drugs&#xD;
      currently being evaluated in clinical trials for CRC. Promising results have been reported&#xD;
      include an increase in overall survival and reduction in the risk of death (Bevacizumab),&#xD;
      reversal of cellular resistance (Cetuximab) and activity as second-line therapy in patients&#xD;
      who have exhausted other available treatment options (Cetuximab, ABX-EGF, PTK-787, Gefitinib,&#xD;
      Erlotinib) (10,11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the therapeutic role of angiogenesis target therapy has been approved in cancer&#xD;
      treatment including CRC, the way to optimize the dose of angiogenesis inhibitors remains to&#xD;
      be determined because of the lack of reliable surrogate markers of tumor angiogenesis. Shaked&#xD;
      et al. reported that the levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), which&#xD;
      contribute to the tumor vessel formation, reflect the anti-tumor efficacy of&#xD;
      anti-angiogenesis regimens (12). Growing evidence suggests that the levels of circulating EPC&#xD;
      reflect the response to chemotherapy both in animal model and clinical trial (13,14). Thus,&#xD;
      circulating EPC can be used as a marker for optimizing and monitoring the anti-angiogenesis&#xD;
      therapy including angiogenesis inhibitors and chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether circulating EPC can be served as a marker of CCRT efficacy or not remains&#xD;
      undetermined. Since CCRT is now a standard treatment of locally advanced and high-risk CRC,&#xD;
      the development of a surrogate marker for monitoring CCRT response and optimize treatment&#xD;
      intensity, again, is very important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this grant we intent to monitor the levels of circulating EPC in locally advanced and&#xD;
      high-risk CRC patients before, during and after CCRT. To further characterize the changes in&#xD;
      function and biology of EPC caused by CCRT, a syngeneic animal model will be also used to&#xD;
      evaluate the clonogenecity and specific gene expression of EPC in tumor-bearing mice&#xD;
      receiving CCRT.&#xD;
