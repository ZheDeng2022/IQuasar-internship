  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of multiple doses of once daily&#xD;
      tramadol HCl ER (100, 200, 300 and 400 mg) to placebo in patients with moderate to severe&#xD;
      pain due to OA. The study hypothesis is that tramadol HCl ER is safe and effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with moderate to severe pain due to OA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immediate release (IR) tramadol has demonstrated efficacy in several pain conditions&#xD;
      including: obstetrical, gynecological, orthopedic, abdominal, and oral surgery. The short&#xD;
      elimination half-life of tramadol IR necessitates every 4-6 hour dosing to maintain optimal&#xD;
      levels of analgesia in chronic pain. The study medication in this study is a once-daily,&#xD;
      extended-release tramadol formulation. This is a 12-week multi-center, double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized, dose-ranging, parallel-group, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled study. Patients with&#xD;
      OA Functional Class I-III of the knee or hip (index joint) are eligible for participation, if&#xD;
      appropriate criteria are met. During a 2-7 day washout period, the use of all analgesic&#xD;
      medications will be discontinued. Eligible patients experiencing moderate to severe pain&#xD;
      (&lt;=40 mm on a 100 mm visual analog scale) in the index joint to be evaluated and who meet all&#xD;
      other study criteria will enter in a 2-week,double-blind titration period. During this&#xD;
      period, patients will be randomly assigned to receive treatment with tramadol HCl ER 100 mg,&#xD;
      200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg or placebo, once a day. Patients will be titrated to their assigned&#xD;
      dose between study days 1 - 15 and will continue at that dose for the remainder of the study&#xD;
      (Week 12). Efficacy and safety evaluations will be collected at study visits occurring at&#xD;
      Weeks 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 or at early termination. Study medication will be discontinued at&#xD;
      Week 12 and patients will return after 1 week for a post-treatment visit (Week 13). Patients&#xD;
      with unmanageable pain or with unacceptable side effects will be discontinued from the study&#xD;
      and alternate analgesic therapy initiated, as appropriate.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Functional Class I-III OA of the&#xD;
             knee or hip&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with involvement of at least one knee or hip joint that warrants treatment&#xD;
             with COX-2 inhibitors, NSAIDS, acetaminophen, or opioid analgesics for at least 75 of&#xD;
             the 90 days preceding the screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a pain intensity score in index joint &gt;=40 mm on the visual analog scale&#xD;
             (VAS) at the baseline visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are able to discontinue acetaminophen, NSAIDS, COX-2 selective&#xD;
             inhibitors, and other analgesics during the washout period and throughout the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are able to understand the study procedures and complete pain scales&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a medical condition, other than OA, uncontrolled with treatment or any&#xD;
             clinically significant condition that, in the investigator's opinion, precludes study&#xD;
             participation or interferes with the assessment of chronic pain and other OA symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis, gout, pseudo-gout or Paget's&#xD;
             disease, that, in the investigator's opinion, interferes with the assessment of pain&#xD;
             and other symptoms of OA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a diagnosis of chronic pain syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
