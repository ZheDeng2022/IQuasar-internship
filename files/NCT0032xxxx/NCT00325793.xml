      Hypertension (high blood pressure) can often cause neurological worsening in patients with&#xD;
      stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intravenous infusion of&#xD;
      nicardipine (Cardene) for control of hypertension is FDA approved. The disadvantage of&#xD;
      Nicardipine IV drip is the relative large volume of fluid needed (up to 150 cc/hr). The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of double or triple concentrated&#xD;
      peripheral intravenous (IV) Nicardipine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hypertension can often cause neurological worsening in patients with either ICH or SAH.&#xD;
      Hypertension has been related to increased incidence of intracranial hemorrhage in patients&#xD;
      who are treated with thrombolytics or on anticoagulation. Timely control of hypertension is&#xD;
      directly related to the outcome of these patients. Furthermore, unlike in the conditions of&#xD;
      hypertensive emergency or urgency, gentle titration to control the blood pressure is&#xD;
      recommended in patients with either ischemic cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Therefore the&#xD;
      ideal agent to control hypertension in these patients would have these characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rapid onset of action&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Predictable dose response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Titratable to desired BP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minimal dosage adjustments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minimal adverse effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No increase in INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE (ICP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Easy transition to oral formulation for long-term maintenance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, only IV sodium nitroprusside, nitroglycerine, enalapril and esmolol are used for&#xD;
      controlling blood pressure in patients with IS, ICH and SAH. These agents are difficult to&#xD;
      titrate and may potentially be harmful to brain cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nicardipine offers several advantages in blood pressure control. It may cause dilatation of&#xD;
      the coronary vessels while has no effect on cardiac conduction. It is not associated with&#xD;
      coronary steal. As the only IV calcium channel blocker approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      hypertension, nicardipine is vasoselective, and has a rapid onset and precisely controllable&#xD;
      in a variety of patient types. It is as effective as sodium nitroprusside with fewer dose&#xD;
      adjustments. It has documented safety with a low incidence of side effects. It requires&#xD;
      minimal dose adjustments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disadvantage of Nicardipine IV drip is the relative large volume of fluid needed (up to&#xD;
      150 cc/hr). In patients with ischemic cerebral stroke (IS) or hemorrhage (ICH), intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of large volume can contribute to cerebral edema or increase in intracranial&#xD;
      pressure (ICP). If the infusion of nicardipine can be double or triple concentrated without&#xD;
      the need of a central line, it not only offers titratable BP control, but also less overall&#xD;
      volume to infuse the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase IV prospective, open-label, dose regimen study of double or triple&#xD;
      concentration nicardipine infusion for controlling blood pressure in patients with either&#xD;
      ischemic cerebral infarction (IS) or intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage (SAH). Once the patient has the need for rapid control of blood pressure, he or&#xD;
      she will be eligible for the study. The first 25 patients will be consented for the double&#xD;
      dose treatment and the next 25 patients will be consented for the triple dose treatment. The&#xD;
      patient will be followed during the infusion period for efficacy and safety.&#xD;
