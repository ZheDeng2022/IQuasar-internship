      The purpose of this study is to determine the average dosage of oral vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation to maintain optimal vitamin D levels in the body and to see if there are&#xD;
      differences in the response to oral vitamin D supplementation between African-American and&#xD;
      Caucasian subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There is ample evidence that improvement in vitamin D nutrition retards bone loss and&#xD;
      prevents fractures in the elderly. It is clear that many people living in areas of northern&#xD;
      latitude have less than optimal levels of vitamin D. The current recommendations for vitamin&#xD;
      D intake are not enough to bring a large majority of the population to the desired adequate&#xD;
      level. Furthermore, differences have been observed in the amount of Vitamin D produced in the&#xD;
      skin in whites and blacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the evidence from literature and our experience from prior studies we hypothesize&#xD;
      that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the dose of oral vitamin D3 supplement exceeds current recommendations to achieve&#xD;
           adequate desired level;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. there may be differences in the dose-response to vitamin D supplement between Blacks and&#xD;
           Whites; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. vitamin D supplementation that produces serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels in the&#xD;
           range proposed is safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims for this pilot study are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the average dose of vitamin D3 needed to attain 25-OHD levels between 80-140 nmol/L in a&#xD;
           healthy population of mixed races; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. if there are differences in response to vitamin D3 supplementation between African&#xD;
           American and Caucasians subjects.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy African-American and Caucasian adults aged 18-65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are not either African-American or Caucasian. The investigators plan to&#xD;
             examine racial differences in response to oral vitamin D dosing and, therefore, have&#xD;
             chosen the most affected (African-American) and the least affected (Caucasian) racial&#xD;
             groups. Including other racial/ethnic groups may confound the results unless they are&#xD;
             studied as separate groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any chronic medical illness including diabetes mellitus, history of myocardial&#xD;
             infarction or heart failure, malignancy, hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] &gt;&#xD;
             140), obesity (body mass index [BMI] &gt; 35 kg/m2), history of anemia, leukemia, or&#xD;
             other hematologic abnormalities, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or other rheumatologic&#xD;
             disease, or kidney disease of any kind as determined by history and physical&#xD;
             examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with osteoporosis or taking medications for osteoporosis such as&#xD;
             bisphosphonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of medication that influences bone metabolism (i.e. anticonvulsant medications,&#xD;
             steroids, diuretics).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant deviation from normal in either history, physical examination, or&#xD;
             laboratory tests, as evaluated by the primary investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of hypercalciuria, hypercalcemia, nephrolithiasis, and active&#xD;
             sarcoidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another investigational trial in the past 30 days prior to the&#xD;
             screening evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unexplained weight loss of &gt; 15% during the previous year or history of anorexia&#xD;
             nervosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medications that interfere with vitamin D metabolism. Oral contraceptive use will be&#xD;
             allowed, but will be appropriately documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Smokers greater than 1 pack per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients reporting alcohol intake greater than 2 drinks daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with baseline 25-OHD level greater than 80 nmol/L or less than 20 nmol/L.&#xD;
