      This study will evaluate the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using different&#xD;
      magnet strengths (1.5, 3 and 7 Tesla) to detect damage in different parts of the brain in&#xD;
      patients with multiple sclerosis. The higher the Tesla, the greater the ability to see brain&#xD;
      changes. Healthy subjects will also be studied to compare findings in patients with those of&#xD;
      normal volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and patients with multiple sclerosis 18-65 years of age may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Patients should have minimal clinical disability. Candidates are&#xD;
      screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo three MRI examinations. The first is on a 1.5 Tesla machine. The second&#xD;
      and third - at 3 Tesla and 7 Tesla - are done within 30 days of the first. Each procedure&#xD;
      takes about 2 hours. Before and after the 7 Tesla examination, subjects have an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (EKG), their blood pressure and temperature are measured and a blood sample&#xD;
      is drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. This&#xD;
      test has several advantages over x-ray methods, such as the ability to see more clearly&#xD;
      inside the brain and to see chemical changes that might occur in specific neurological&#xD;
      diseases. Also, since x-rays are not used, there is no radiation risk. Radio waves are&#xD;
      generated and changes in magnetic fields are measured and analyzed by computer. For the&#xD;
      procedure, the subject lies on a table that is moved into a metal cylinder (the MRI scanner)&#xD;
      that has a strong magnetic field. Earplugs are worn to muffle loud thumping noises caused by&#xD;
      the electrical switching of the radio frequency circuits. During the MRI, subjects receive an&#xD;
      injection of a contrast agent called Gadolinium, which brightens the images.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE: Among the factors contributing to the poor identification of grey and white matter&#xD;
      pathology of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, the low signal-to-noise ratio and&#xD;
      consequential poor resolution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained at conventional&#xD;
      magnetic fields (i.e. 1.5 Tesla) play a significant role. Preliminary results suggest that&#xD;
      7T-MRI has the capability to disclose characteristics of chronic white matter lesions'&#xD;
      heterogeneity in MS, not seen at lower field MRI. We now aim to extend those results by&#xD;
      investigating whether lesions' heterogeneous appearance pertain not only to chronic lesions,&#xD;
      i.e. those studied thus far, but also to newly formed lesions, i.e. those enhancing upon&#xD;
      gadolinium injection. The latter can be identified only by imaging at 7T with contrast&#xD;
      injection those MS patients known to already have active lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION: Up to 145 patients (age range: 18-65, range in the Expanded Disability&#xD;
      Status Scale: 0-4.5) with definite MS according to Poser criteria or other diseases of the&#xD;
      central nervous system resembling MS from an imaging stand point and up to 120&#xD;
      age/gender-matched healthy volunteers will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: Patients previously shown to meet both the clinical and MRI criteria for MS and an&#xD;
      equivalent number of gender- and age-matched healthy volunteers will be studied. Initially,&#xD;
      both patients and healthy individuals will have conventional 1.5Tesla MRI T1-weighted scans&#xD;
      without contrast, whereas patients will also have post-contrast scans. Next, both groups of&#xD;
      subjects will be imaged on both the 3 Tesla and 7 Tesla MRIs in a random order. In each 3&#xD;
      Tesla and 7 Tesla MRI study the examination will include the following sequences: 3&#xD;
      dimensional inversion-recovery-prepared fast spoiled gradient recalled images,&#xD;
      3D-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and double inversion recovery in addition to T1 and T2&#xD;
      conventional weighted images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second group of 15 patients with or without clinical relapse who are known to be in an&#xD;
      active stage of MS as seen by post-contrast MRI will be imaged. Each patient may undergo a&#xD;
      standard 3T MRI within the two weeks before the 7T MRI (if needed, as no information&#xD;
      regarding his/her disease status are otherwise available from 3T MRI performed under other&#xD;
      NIB protocols). The former will allow ascertaining in advance his/her status of lesions&#xD;
      activity, thus providing an adequate number of patients with active lesions imaged at 7T.&#xD;
      Each patient may need to repeat his/her scan three times in case of magnetic instability&#xD;
      during image acquisition. Additional 3T and 7T MRIs will be performed after 1 and 6 months to&#xD;
      follow active lesions evolution over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third group of patients with MS or any other disease of the central nervous system&#xD;
      manifesting in magnetic resonance imaging with lesions of the white matter and grey matter&#xD;
      which could mimic MS will be included. Each patient will undergo a 3T MRI inclusive of&#xD;
      post-contrast sequences as well as a 7T MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of cortical lesions as well as white matter and deep grey&#xD;
      abnormalities will be computed on images obtained at 1.5, 3 and 7 Tesla MRIs. The study will&#xD;
      not aim at conducting a formal comparison of cortical or white matters lesions seen on 3&#xD;
      Tesla and 7 Tesla. Instead, the goal is to provide preliminary information that can be used&#xD;
      to design a formal analysis of the sensitivities of the two platforms in studying those&#xD;
      abnormalities seen in MS. Active lesions found to be conspicuous upon contrast injection will&#xD;
      be compared between T1 and gradient echo images at 7T. Additionally, the evolution of active&#xD;
      lesions over time at 7T will be evaluated.&#xD;
