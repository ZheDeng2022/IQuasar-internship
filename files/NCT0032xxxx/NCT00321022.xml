  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if emergency department patients with&#xD;
      Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) that are managed using a TIA &quot;accelerated diagnostic&#xD;
      protocol&quot;, or &quot;ADP&quot;, demonstrate a significant decrease in their index visit length of stay&#xD;
      and cost, with comparable diagnostic and 90-day clinical outcomes relative to TIA patients&#xD;
      randomized to traditional inpatient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the potential role of a TIA risk stratification tool&#xD;
      and to determine the time to a diagnostic endpoint in both groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as a neurological deficit lasting less than 24&#xD;
      hours, with most lasting less than one hour, brought on by focal cerebral or retinal&#xD;
      ischemia. TIAs are common, with an estimated 300,000 events occurring annually and an&#xD;
      estimated 5 million Americans having been given the diagnosis of TIA. Furthermore, a TIA is&#xD;
      essentially the &quot;smoke before the fire&quot; for these patients. Studies have shown that within 90&#xD;
      days of an emergency department diagnosis of TIA, 10.5% of patients will suffer a stroke,&#xD;
      with most occurring within two days of the ED visit. Twenty one percent of these strokes are&#xD;
      fatal and 64% are disabling. Additionally, 2.6% of TIA patients will die, 2.6% will suffer&#xD;
      other adverse cardiovascular events, and 12.7% will have recurrent TIAs. Roughly 15% of&#xD;
      patients who have had a stroke report a history of TIA. For many patients, stroke is&#xD;
      considered to be a devastating event that is worse than death. In 1999 stroke was the third&#xD;
      leading cause of death in the United States (National center for health statistics, U.S. dept&#xD;
      of health and human services). The national direct and indirect cost of stroke is estimated&#xD;
      to be $51 billion annually.7&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management and disposition of emergency department patients with TIA is not entirely&#xD;
      clear. It is mutually agreed upon in guidelines written by the American Heart Association&#xD;
      (AHA) and the National Stroke Association (NSA) for the management of TIA, and standard&#xD;
      emergency medicine textbooks, that patients with symptoms suggestive of a stroke or TIA&#xD;
      require urgent evaluation in a setting such as the emergency department. Furthermore, that&#xD;
      this evaluation should include a history, physical, and ECG. AHA guidelines and emergency&#xD;
      medicine texts recommend that the initial evaluation include appropriate blood testing based&#xD;
      on the history and CT imaging of the brain. All agree that patients with noncardioembolic&#xD;
      causes of TIA should receive antiplatelet therapy and that TIA patients with atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation should receive anticoagulation. &quot;Prompt&quot; or &quot;Urgent&quot; imaging of the carotid&#xD;
      arteries to detect stenosis greater than 70% is also agreed upon since urgent carotid&#xD;
      endarterectomy is believed to be most beneficial in this group. However the optimal timing of&#xD;
      endarterectomy in patients with high-grade carotid stenosis is unclear. NSA guidelines and&#xD;
      emergency medicine texts recommend hospitalization of patients with new onset TIA if imaging&#xD;
      studies, such as carotid doppler, can not be performed urgently. However in a separate review&#xD;
      of TIA management, hospitalization was identified as an area of uncertainty and it was&#xD;
      suggested that management in a setting such as an Emergency Department Observation Unit&#xD;
      (EDOU) might be a more cost effective alternative.&#xD;
