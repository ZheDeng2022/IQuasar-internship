      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the use of (1) 'malaria prevalence', (2)&#xD;
      'malaria incidence' and (3) 'malaria mortality' as a measure of malaria transmission in The&#xD;
      Gambia, while mosquito insecticides (larvicides) are used to control malaria-carrying&#xD;
      mosquitoes. Two thousand children aged 6 months to 10 years of age will be recruited from&#xD;
      villages in the study area. They will be monitored over 7 months for the presence of malaria&#xD;
      parasites and signs and symptoms of the disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Malaria remains one of the world's greatest childhood killers and is a substantial obstacle&#xD;
      to social and economic development in the tropics. The overwhelming bulk of the world's&#xD;
      malaria burden rests upon the population of sub-Saharan Africa because of the unique&#xD;
      coincidence of expanding human populations, weak health systems, the world's most effective&#xD;
      vector mosquito species and environmental conditions ideal for transmission. At the start of&#xD;
      the new millennium malaria is still deeply entrenched in Africa and effective malaria control&#xD;
      is under threat from the inexorable spread of parasite strains resistant to antimalarial&#xD;
      drugs and the emergence of mosquitoes resistant to the pyrethroid insecticides used to&#xD;
      impregnate bednets. Larval control may offer a new alternative for effective control. We plan&#xD;
      to apply a larvicide in an effort to control malaria and reduce the burden of malaria. While&#xD;
      it is abundantly clear that this product will kill mosquito larvae in the laboratory and in&#xD;
      the field, it is not certain that doing so will reduce the burden of malaria for the human&#xD;
      population. There are several steps which intervene between the survival of mosquito larvae&#xD;
      in aquatic breeding sites and the human end points that we hope to achieve. Briefly, the&#xD;
      steps involved include survival and development of immature mosquito stages, emergence of&#xD;
      adult mosquitoes, blood feeding by those mosquitoes, acquisition and development of malaria&#xD;
      parasites by adult mosquitoes and transmission of parasites to susceptible humans. Once&#xD;
      infected, the human population may either clear the infection over time or go on to develop&#xD;
      symptoms. Among those who develop symptoms, some receive prompt and successful treatment,&#xD;
      while some others go on to either develop chronic symptoms or to progress through severe&#xD;
      malaria to death. Primary outcomes are: 1) the proportion of subjects with malaria parasites&#xD;
      (Plasmodium Falciparum), 2) the incidence of clinical malaria, and 3) the age-standardized&#xD;
      overall and malaria-specific mortality. Secondary outcomes are: 1) prevalence of a clinical&#xD;
      episode of malaria (presence of malaria parasites plus an axillary temperature of 37.5 C or&#xD;
      greater during examination or a history of fever during the last 48 hours); 2) prevalence of&#xD;
      high parasitemias (defined as equal to of greater than 5000 parasites per mcl); 3) prevalence&#xD;
      of enlarged spleen (defined using Hackett's classification); and 4) prevalence of severe&#xD;
      anemia (defined as hemoglobin less than or equal to 5 g/dl). Within a broad area of eastern&#xD;
      Gambia, zones have been identified for application of larvicide, with matched control zones&#xD;
      where no larval control have been applied. In each area, the human population will be&#xD;
      monitored to determine whether one of four specific malariometric end points will provide a&#xD;
      valid assessment of larvicidal effectiveness. In this study 2000 children, 6 months to 10&#xD;
      years of age, will be recruited. These pilot studies will inform subsequent (not included in&#xD;
      this NIH project) large scale evaluations of larviciding for malaria control. This protocol&#xD;
      is designed to determine whether prevalence and incidence of malaria attacks and deaths can&#xD;
      be used to evaluate the impact of Bti for malaria transmission control.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All children living in the defined areas for intervention and between the age of 6 months&#xD;
        and 10 years will be invited to participate. No distinctions will be made regarding gender&#xD;
        or ethnic group. Moreover, as the target population is all people living in the areas of&#xD;
        intervention, and in order of the results from this study to be as generalizable as&#xD;
        possible, no distinctions will be made in terms of medical condition or physical health.&#xD;
        Moreover, we believe that any children with a medical condition would be especially favored&#xD;
        by the participation in the study.&#xD;
