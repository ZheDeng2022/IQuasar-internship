  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe malnutrition is associated with a high rate of mortality, even when using the latest&#xD;
      WHO recommendations. Watery diarrhea as observed in cholera is an additional vital risk to&#xD;
      those children. The fragility of the children together with the complexity of the&#xD;
      pathophysiology and the simplicity of the medical environment where the treatment is&#xD;
      delivered are serious constraints for the development of new therapies. Dehydration is a&#xD;
      special immediate risk in those children who already displayed altered body distribution of&#xD;
      water with potassium, magnesium, zinc and other nutrient deficiency. Dehydration is also&#xD;
      often associated with a decrease in appetite. In addition, the intestinal function is altered&#xD;
      both by the infectious agent and the nutritional status of the child. Recommended therapy for&#xD;
      those children comprises oral rehydration with ReSoMaL (modified ORS for use in severely&#xD;
      malnourished children recommended by WHO), at a relatively low rate, with permanent&#xD;
      monitoring; in addition, breastfeeding should not be interrupted and feeding with F100 (Milk&#xD;
      based formula diet for use in severely malnourished children recommended by WHO) is&#xD;
      recommended. Recently, amylase-resistant starch added to a standard WHO-ORS has been shown to&#xD;
      reduce the duration and severity of adults with cholera. The rationale for using&#xD;
      amylase-resistant starch was that when starch enters the colon it is metabolized by the&#xD;
      bacteria. The short-chain fatty acids thus produced stimulate sodium absorption in the colon,&#xD;
      just like glucose stimulates water absorption in the small intestine. In addition, this&#xD;
      treatment would be of particular interest in malnutrition because short-chain fatty acids are&#xD;
      specific energetic substrate for the colon.In the present project, we propose to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that addition of amylase-resistant starch to the already recommended treatment of&#xD;
      severely malnourished children with cholera reduces the severity and duration of diarrhea;&#xD;
      this could be achieved through the effect of short-chain fatty acids on colonic sodium&#xD;
      absorption. In addition, a better recovery from malnutrition could be achieved through the&#xD;
      energy provided by short-chain fatty acids to the colon and improved appetite through&#xD;
      improved rehydration. Thus, the aim of the study is to measure the effect of&#xD;
      amylase-resistant starch added to an already accepted treatment (with minimal changes) at the&#xD;
      rehydration and rehabilitation phases of the treatment. A total of 210 children aged 6 mo to&#xD;
      60 mo will be studied in three groups : a) glucose based ORS and amylase-resistant starch; b)&#xD;
      glucose based ORS without amylase resistant starch ; c) rice based ORS . The major outcome&#xD;
      variables on the first phase (diarrhoeal duration and stool output), and second phase (food&#xD;
      intake, weight gain) will be compared between the two treatment groups. The result of the&#xD;
      study if found effective in reducing the duration of diarrhoea, enhance recovery from&#xD;
      diarrhoea and malnutrition in severely malnourished children, will contribute to better case&#xD;
      management of these children.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN This is a randomized controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. History of acute watery diarrhoea of &lt;72 hrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Either sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Age - 6m to 60 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Some or severe dehydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Wt for Ht &lt;70% of NCHS median: with or without edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Dark field examination positive for Vibrio cholerae.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Consent given by the patient or legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bloody diarrhoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Severe infection (e.g. severe pneumonia, clinical sepsis, meningitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Those who received antibiotics/antimicrobial for the current illness Sample Size Sample&#xD;
           size is calculated on the basis of duration of diarrhoea of recently completed study&#xD;
           with WHO-ORS vs. ReSoMaL in severely malnourished children with diarrhoea (65±46 vs.&#xD;
           61±45). Expecting 35% reduction of duration of diarrhoea with the proposed new treatment&#xD;
           considering 5% level of significance and 80% power, the sample size in each group is 70.&#xD;
           Considering the stool weight, with reference of (stool wt. 158±95 when treated with WHO&#xD;
           ORS) in severely malnourished children with cholera, the sample size was estimated to be&#xD;
           65 in each group, expecting 30% reduction in stool weight during the first 24 hours with&#xD;
           the new treatment and considering 5% level of significance and 80% power. Finally we&#xD;
           consider to study 70 patients in each treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrollment into the study the patients will be randomized to receive one of the&#xD;
      following three solutions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Modified glucose based WHO ORS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Modified glucose WHO ORS plus 50 g/L amylase resistant starch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Modified rice based ORS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since a significant proportion of children might present with ALRI, randomization will be&#xD;
      stratified into two strata:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Children with ALRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Children without ALRI Accordingly, two randomization list will be prepared. The&#xD;
           randomization list will be prepared using random table of permuted block of variable&#xD;
           length.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline information&#xD;
&#xD;
           A baseline history and examination will be obtained in order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
           4determine the subject's eligibility for inclusion in the study; 4collect the relevant&#xD;
           data prior to beginning the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The baseline history and examination will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
           4identification of the patient; 4a description of the symptoms prior to admission and&#xD;
           their duration; 4detail of any treatment given for the illness before admission;&#xD;
           4results of physical examination including the state of hydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessment of dehydration This will be done according to the modified WHO guideline used&#xD;
           in ICDDR,B. (Appendix-III).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Laboratory tests After admission blood for Hct, total protein, glucose, and serum&#xD;
           electrolytes will be sent before initiation of the assigned ORS. Serum electrolytes will&#xD;
           be repeated after 24 and 48 hours after initiation of ORS therapy. Stool sample will be&#xD;
           sent for microscopy (including cryptosporidium and giardia) and culture for shigella,&#xD;
           salmonella, Vibrio cholerae and ELISA for rotavirus will be done. Other relevant&#xD;
           investigations like Total WBC count, Differential count and urine microscopy will be&#xD;
           done routinely. Chest X-ray and/or Blood culture will be done, if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For all blood tests 3 ml of blood will be drawn from a suitable vein in the hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Estimation of fecal Starch and SCFAs Feces from 50 patients will be collected in&#xD;
           buckets. The first 24 h collected feces will be weighed and aliquot will be taken and&#xD;
           stored at -20o C until the analysis of SCFAs by HPLC. The second and third stool samples&#xD;
           will be collected from 24-48 h and 48-72 h respectively. The feces will be weighed and&#xD;
           aliquot will be stored at -20oC for the determination of SCFAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fecal starch will be measured enzymatically with a starch-assay kit (Total Starch Assay&#xD;
           Procedure, Megazyme, Warriewood, Australia).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Case Management (Acute Phase) After randomization the children will be treated following&#xD;
           the standardized protocol for management of severely malnourished children used at&#xD;
           ICDDR,B hospital (2,12).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fluid Therapy (oral) Dehydration assessment will be done according to the WHO guideline&#xD;
           modified for in our last multicentre clinical trial of reduced osmolarity ORS in adult&#xD;
           cholera and children with watery diarrhoea (17). In children with some dehydration, the&#xD;
           fluid deficit will be corrected with the assigned ORS @ 10 ml/kg/hour for the first two&#xD;
           hours, then 5 ml/kg/hour until the deficit will be corrected. In addition, on going&#xD;
           stool losses will be corrected @ 5-10 ml/kg/ after each watery stool. For high purging&#xD;
           patient, the ORS intake will be adjusted according to the on going stool loss. ORS&#xD;
           therapy will be continued until diarrhoea ceased. Randomization of patient, taking&#xD;
           consent and darkfield report collection will not take more than 20 minutes. If delayed&#xD;
           more than 20 minutes the children will be offered glucose based ORS and subsequently&#xD;
           switched over to the assigned ORS. Children with severe dehydration, initial rehydration&#xD;
           will be done with IV fluid (cholera saline; Na 133 mmol/L, Cl 98 mmol/L, K 13 mmol/L and&#xD;
           Acetate equivalent to HCO3 48 mmol/ L) until the patient is out of shock or&#xD;
           disappearance of signs of severe dehydration then the rest of rehydration will be done&#xD;
           as for rehydration in patients with some dehydration as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Infection Control&#xD;
&#xD;
           As a routine practice in ICDDR,B hospital the antibiotic treatments for the study&#xD;
           children are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Children without apparent extraintestinal infection will receive Inj ampicillin @ 100&#xD;
           mg/kg/24 h in 4 divided doses and Inj. gentamicin @ 5mg/kg/24h in 2 divided doses for 5&#xD;
           days. Patients with lower respiratory tract infection will receive Inj: ceftriaxone 75&#xD;
           mg/kg/24 h I/M or I.V one daily doses and Inj. gentamicin 5 mg/kg/24 h in 2 divided&#xD;
           doses for 5 days. All patients will receive erythromycin 50 mg/kg/24 h in 4 divided&#xD;
           doses for 3 days. Patients with oral thrush will be treated with oral nystacin&#xD;
           suspension 100,000 units (1ml) 6 hourly until cured.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Diet Mother's will be advised to continue breast feeding. Supplementary feeding with&#xD;
           F100 diet will be given @ 10 ml/Kg/ Feed two hourly for day 1 and increased slowly up to&#xD;
           150 Kcal/ Kg/Day over 7 days according to the patient's demand. If the child has a poor&#xD;
           appetite, or is weak, or has painful stomatitis/glossitis, the food will be introduced&#xD;
           through nasogastric tube until the patient will take normal oral feeding. In addition to&#xD;
           F100, semisolid food (Rice, lentil, vegetable etc.) will be given to older children&#xD;
           during convalescent and rehabilitation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Vitamin and Mineral Supplements ( As a routine hospital practice in ICDDRB) Children&#xD;
           without xeropthalmia and above 1yr of age, will be given vit A 200,000 units and 6-12&#xD;
           months age children will be given 100,000unit on admission. Children with xeropthalmia&#xD;
           the same dose will be given on admission, 2nd day and on discharge. Folic acid 1.25 mg&#xD;
           and elemental zinc 2 mg/kg will be given for 15 days. In addition children will be given&#xD;
           multivitamin supplements (1 ml contains it A palmitate 5000 IU, vitamin D 1000 IU,&#xD;
           thiamine hydrochloride 1.6 mg, riboflavin 1 mg, pyridoxine hydrochloride 1 mg,&#xD;
           nicotinamide 10 mg, calcium D-pantothenate 5 mg, ascorbic acid 50 mg). 1 ml twice daily&#xD;
           for 15 days for 1 yr. and above and half the dose will be given to infants less than &lt;1&#xD;
           yr. of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypoglycemia (blood glucose &lt;3 mmol/L) will be managed with 50 ml 10% glucose orally or&#xD;
           by nasogastric tube. Hyponatraemia (serum sodium, &lt;115mmol/L with or without symptoms&#xD;
           will be managed with Inj. 3% Nacl 12 ml/kg I/V slowly over 4 hrs. Children with serum&#xD;
           sodium between 115 - 125 with symptoms will be treated with 3% NaCl in addition to&#xD;
           adjunct therapy, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measurements All intakes ( ORS, water, and food) and outputs (stool, urine and vomit)&#xD;
           will be measured every 6 hours until diarrhoea stops or upto 7 days . Body weight and&#xD;
           vital signs will also be measured 6 hourly.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reasons for withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Any patient developing severe complication such as severe pneumonia, clinical&#xD;
                sepsis, meningitis requiring intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Parents/legal guardian withdraws consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Patients who will continue diarrhoea more than 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
           Management of withdrawal cases The withdrawal cases will be transferred to general ward&#xD;
           or ICU and appropriate management will be provided according to routine hospital&#xD;
           practice. Regular follow-up will be done and final outcome of the children will be&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collected up to the time of withdrawal will be included for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Management after cessation of diarrhoea ( Convalescent / Rehabilitation Phase) All&#xD;
           patients after cessation of diarrhoea and control of other associated infection will be&#xD;
           transferred to nutrition rehabilitation unit(NRU) They will be managed with F100 diet&#xD;
           according to their requirements. Older children will get semisolid food in addition to&#xD;
           F100. During the stay at NRU Vital signs and body weight will be measured once in the&#xD;
           morning daily. Food intake will be measured in every feed until the children stay at&#xD;
           NRU. After seven days the patients will be discharged from the nutrition rehabilitation&#xD;
           unit and will be followed up for next fifteen days at home. They will be supplied with&#xD;
           standard diet according to the protocol. The health workers will visit every alternate&#xD;
           day and will interview the mother about any illness and approximate amount of diet the&#xD;
           child consumed. The health worker will carry a portable electronic balance with a&#xD;
           precision of 1 g and record the body weight of the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Definition End of study ( acute phage)- The study end point will be considered when&#xD;
           diarrhoea stops or 7 days of initiation of the ORS whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cessation of diarrhoea - Diarrhoea will be considered to have stopped when the last&#xD;
           watery stool is passed followed by soft or formed stool and/or no stool for 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypokalaemia- Hypokalaemia is defined as serum potassium level &lt;3.5 mmol/l. Persistence&#xD;
           of hypokalaemia - If the serum potassium level is &lt;3.5 mmol/l on admission and it&#xD;
           remains at the level even after 48 hours of therapy with ORS, it will be considered as&#xD;
           persistence of hypokalaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Over hydration - As there are no standard criteria for defining over hydration, we have&#xD;
           developed a working definition of over hydration for this protocol based on previous&#xD;
           study reports and our clinical experience. Over hydration will be considered in a child&#xD;
           who has more than a 5% weight gain than expected after correction of dehydration and /&#xD;
           or at least any one of the following signs:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Development of periorbital oedema; Increased heart rate (&gt;160/min); Increased&#xD;
           respiration rate (&gt;60/min); {in the absence of signs suggestive of pneumonia(fever, CXR&#xD;
           abnormalities etc.)} Hypoglycaemia - will be defined as blood glucose £ 3 mmol/l&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hyponatraemia - will be defined as serum sodium &lt; 130 mmol/l&#xD;
&#xD;
           Severe pneumonia:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient aged 6 m - 12 m&#xD;
&#xD;
           - respiratory rate &gt; 50/minute with chest in drawing&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient aged 13 m - 60 m&#xD;
&#xD;
           - respiratory rate &gt; 40/minute with chest indrawing (WHO guideline)&#xD;
&#xD;
           - 'ORS failure' - If after randomization any patient needs I/V rehydration therapy will&#xD;
           be labelled as ORS failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Organization of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study site - The study will be done in the study ward of the Clinical Service Centre of&#xD;
           ICDDR,B.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study schedule - The study period will be 2 years from starting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruiting and training of study personnel - First one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection - 23 months ( Estimated on the basis of bed allotment per protocol and&#xD;
           patient availability)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data analysis and reporting - 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
           OUTCOME VARIABLES&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Duration of diarrhoeal course and stool output.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Calorie intake per day&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Daily weight gain&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Time to attain 80% weight for height SIGNIFICANCE If the ORS containing amylase&#xD;
                resistant starch is found to reduce the severity diarrhoea and increase the&#xD;
                recovery in patients with acute diarrhoeal illness in severely malnourished&#xD;
                children, it will have a major public health significance as regard to better case&#xD;
                management for malnourished children with diarrhoea.&#xD;
