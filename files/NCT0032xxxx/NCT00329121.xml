    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the topical application of PEP005 is safe&#xD;
      and effective for the treatment of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCIS, Bowen's&#xD;
      disease).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are a common skin problem largely caused by long term sun&#xD;
      exposure. Current treatments include surgery, curettage/desiccation and some topical&#xD;
      pharmaceutical therapies, which are often cosmetically disfiguring. Non-invasive alternative&#xD;
      therapy for treatment of SCC lesions is thus being researched. Sap from the plant Euphorbia&#xD;
      peplus has been used for many years in Australia as a &quot;folk&quot; remedy to treat a number of skin&#xD;
      conditions. The active component of Euphorbia peplus has been isolated and made into a gel&#xD;
      applied directly to the skin by Peplin Ltd. To date, three well-controlled studies with&#xD;
      PEP005 gel in humans have been completed. In the first and second completed studies, sixteen&#xD;
      (1st study) and sixty-four (2nd study) patients received one or two applications of PEP005&#xD;
      0.0025% or 0.01% or 0.05% or vehicle gel to actinic keratoses. In the third completed study,&#xD;
      sixty patients received two applications of PEP005 0.0025% or 0.01% or 0.05% or vehicle gel&#xD;
      to superficial basal cell carcinomas. Results from all studies show good tolerance and&#xD;
      evidence of activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two applications of&#xD;
      0.05% PEP005 gel in patients with SCCIS on the extremities, trunk or face. Approximately 24&#xD;
      patients are planned to be included from multiple Australian centers. Patients will have two&#xD;
      visits for treatment application and will return for check-up visits the day after the first&#xD;
      application and several times thereafter for 2-3 months.&#xD;
