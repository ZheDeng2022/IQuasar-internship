      This study will identify biomarkers (genes and proteins) in patients with relapsing-remitting&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis (MS) and link them with clinical disease parameters, such as the extent of&#xD;
      inflammation and rate of disease progression, to try to better understand the disease. It&#xD;
      will examine how the biomarkers may be related to disease development and progression and&#xD;
      differences among patients' symptoms and response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with relapsing-remitting MS between 18 and 60 years of age who are enrolled in the&#xD;
      multi-institutional MS-CombiRx trial may be eligible for this sub-study. Participants have&#xD;
      blood tests when they enter the MS-CombiRx study and again after 6 months, 1 year, and 3&#xD;
      years for analysis for genetic and protein analysis.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE: To identify biomarkers (by gene- and protein expression profiling, single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) haplotype determination, HLA typing) and link these with&#xD;
      clinical- and MRI phenotypes in a large cohort of relapsing-remitting (RR-) MS patients. To&#xD;
      identify biomarkers that separate MS patients and healthy, matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION: Up to 1000 patients who are enrolled in and treated under a multi-center&#xD;
      trial of combination therapy (MS-CombiRx) using two approved disease-modifying therapies&#xD;
      (interferon-beta, IFN-b, Avonex; glatiramer-acetate, GA) as single treatments or in&#xD;
      combination. 200 healthy, matched control individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: Samples of serum and white blood cells will be obtained on each patient prior to&#xD;
      randomization in the MS-CombiRx study and then at 6 months 1, and 3 years following&#xD;
      randomization. Samples will be analyzed for SNP haplotype, gene and protein expression, and&#xD;
      HLA haplotype. Samples from controls will be analyzed in the same fashion, however, only one&#xD;
      time point will be analyzed, and there will be no treatment of controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES: The results of the biomarker studies will be assessed in relationship to&#xD;
      both the clinical and MRI phenotype at baseline and to change in disability, relapse rate,&#xD;
      response to therapy and change in MRI measures of disease during the 3-year treatment period.&#xD;
      Each of the biomarker study components will be analyzed with respect to biomarkers that&#xD;
      discriminate between MS patients and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE: Similar to rheumatoid arthritis or autoimmune diabetes multiple sclerosis (MS)&#xD;
      is considered a complex disease with autoimmune pathogenesis as well as vulnerability of the&#xD;
      target tissue, i.e. the central nervous system (CNS). The results of the biomarker study&#xD;
      should provide a better understanding of the disease pathogenesis, of the inter-individual&#xD;
      disease heterogeneity, and finally identify biomarkers such as gene- and protein expression&#xD;
      signatures and individual genes and proteins that are correlated with responsiveness or&#xD;
      non-responsiveness to single drug treatment or the combination of the two drugs. The three&#xD;
      years duration of the combination therapy trial will further allow us to gather information&#xD;
      on the longitudinal evolution of the identified biomarkers under treatment of MS.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA - PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible for entry into this study, candidates must meet the following eligibility&#xD;
        criteria at the time of enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Between the ages of 18 and 60 years, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;

        McDonald MRI criteria for dissemination in time (a new Gd-enhancing lesion demonstrated on&#xD;
        a scan done at least 3 months following onset of a clinical attack or a new T2 lesion or&#xD;
        Gd-enhancing lesions on a follow-up scan after an additional 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Give written informed consent prior to any testing under this protocol, including screening&#xD;
