    <textblock>
      The study is an Open Label, Prospective, Non Comparative, Pilot, clinical trial design.&#xD;
      Patients with inadequate relief in GI symptoms associated with GERD despite PPI treatment&#xD;
      will be screened and those who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will perform a&#xD;
      glucose breath test for bacterial overgrowth . Each patient will then complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire to record their GERD related symptoms. Each patient will then receive a daily&#xD;
      intake of 30 mL two times daily, 30 minutes before meals for a period of 4 weeks. During the&#xD;
      course of the trial, they will have 4 visits with the study physician to assess treatment&#xD;
      compliance and occurrence of adverse events, and will complete periodic daily diaries to&#xD;
      record compliance.&#xD;

             at least 60 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient with positive or negative glucose breath test for bacterial overgrowth unless&#xD;
             they are not able to do this secondary to diabetes. Diabetics will have a lactulose&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Able to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Candidate will be available for the next 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pregnant, breast-feeding, or not using approved methods of contraception (if of&#xD;
        childbearing potential) 2. Unstable medical disorder 3. Patient has had E. coli strain M17&#xD;
        administered in the past month 4. History of major psychiatric disorder or substance abuse&#xD;
        within the previous 2 years, including psychiatric illnesses requiring medication that may&#xD;
        cause doubt in the validity of the signed Informed Consent form 5. Existing illness or&#xD;
        medical condition that will prevent the patient from participating in the study (such as&#xD;
        severe heart disease, insulin dependent diabetes, hyperactive thyroid gland, HIV positive,&#xD;
        etc.) 6. Participation in another clinical study during the past four weeks. 7. Any use of&#xD;
        a probiotic supplement within 30 days of the screening period (with the exception of&#xD;
        standard food yogurt products) 8. Any use of antibiotics within 30 days of the&#xD;
        screening/enrollment period (however, candidate may wait to initiate screening exam until&#xD;
        30 days have lapsed since antibiotic course was completed)&#xD;
