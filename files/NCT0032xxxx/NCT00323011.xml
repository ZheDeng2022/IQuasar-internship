  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for people with colorectal cancer, who have tumors that cannot be completely&#xD;
      removed by surgery. Blood clots are a problem in patients with cancer. Blood clots are also a&#xD;
      problem in patients receiving cancer drugs. Studies have shown that up to 17% of patients&#xD;
      receiving cancer drugs experienced blood-clotting problems. One purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      find if the drug combination of irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), bevacizumab and leucovorin&#xD;
      (LV) affect blood-clotting factors. A second purpose of this study is to find out what&#xD;
      effects the drug dalteparin has on clotting factors in the blood in patients receiving the&#xD;
      drug combination of irinotecan, 5-FU, bevacizumab and LV. It is hoped that adding dalteparin&#xD;
      to chemotherapy may benefit patients with colorectal cancer by preventing blood clots&#xD;
