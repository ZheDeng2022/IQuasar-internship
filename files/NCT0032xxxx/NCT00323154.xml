      Itching is a frequent and disturbing side effect of the use of pain medication such as&#xD;
      morphine. In the post-operative period, it can be more distressing to pediatric patients than&#xD;
      their pain. The current first line treatment, an antihistamine (Benadryl), has a low&#xD;
      efficacy. This treatment causes sleepiness and may be dangerous when used in combination with&#xD;
      other drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nalbuphine has analgesic properties similar to morphine as well as the ability to reverse&#xD;
      some morphine-induced side effects, such as respiratory depression and itching. Nalbuphine&#xD;
      has been used effectively for patients undergoing Caesarean sections. However, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of nalbuphine in the pediatric population has not been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to determine the efficacy of nalbuphine in the treatment of itching after morphine&#xD;
      for postoperative pain relief. We will use a novel method to measure the effect of the&#xD;
      treatment using an intensity scale before and after the drug, to determine the intensity&#xD;
      difference.&#xD;

      PURPOSE Primary To determine the efficacy of nalbuphine (50 - 100 mcg/kg intravenously) in&#xD;
      the treatment of opioid induced pruritus in a multi-center tertiary care pediatric patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Determine the effect of treatment with nalbuphine on a subjects analgesia and level&#xD;
      of sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nalbuphine will be effective in the treatment of opioid induced pruritus; a 50% reduction in&#xD;
      pruritus intensity will be considered clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with nalbuphine will not result in attenuation of analgesia or an increase in&#xD;
      sedation&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION Itch is a frequent and disturbing side effect of opioid use. A recent internal&#xD;
      review of the pediatric pain service at the University of Alberta Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta&#xD;
      found a 40% incidence of pruritus in patients receiving opioids. A similar review at British&#xD;
      Columbia Children's Hospital demonstrated a 22% of patients incidence of pruritus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES The compare the efficacy of nalbuphine to placebo for the treatment of&#xD;
      opioid-induced pruritus. It is anticipated that nalbuphine will result in a greater than 50%&#xD;
      reduction in pruritus intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH METHOD This study will be a randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled trial of&#xD;
      nalbuphine for the treatment of opioid-induced pruritus. Pruritus intensity will be measured&#xD;
      using a standardized assessment tool / Color Analog Scale (CAS). This is a metric scale which&#xD;
      will be used to quantify pruritus on a scale of zero to ten. Using this scale a score of zero&#xD;
      is represented by white, increasing pruritus severity being represented by darker shades of&#xD;
      the color red, along a ruler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be based on intenton to treat. It will be a multi-center study involving&#xD;
      tertiary care centers with acute pediatric pain services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be divided into two groups by computer generated block randomization; one group&#xD;
      will receive treatment with nalbuphine while the other will receive placebo. The patient and&#xD;
      investigator will be blinded to the treatment administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REASON FOR PLACEBO CONTROLLED STUDY DESIGN Current first line therapy for opioid induced&#xD;
      pruritus, with diphenhydramine is associated with a low efficacy (33%) (1). Recognizing that&#xD;
      there can be up to 30% self report response to placebo, it is felt that conducting this study&#xD;
      as a placebo-controlled trial will be necessary for the demonstration of significant&#xD;
      improvement in pruritus intensity.&#xD;
