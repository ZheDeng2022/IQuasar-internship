      The goal of this protocol, broadly stated, is to use targeted manipulations with intranasally&#xD;
      administered oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in conjunction with neurocognitive&#xD;
      and neuroimaging paradigms to evaluate claims that OT and AVP inhibit and facilitate,&#xD;
      respectively, the effective processing of aversive signals. Moreover, we wish to examine&#xD;
      whether increased vasopressin levels will increase, and increased oxytocin levels decrease,&#xD;
      the neural response in the amygdala and other limbic structures to aversive stimuli. In&#xD;
      addition, we wish to assess whether OT and AVP administration will lead to the facilitation&#xD;
      of conspecific recognition as appears to be the case for other mammalian species....&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this protocol, broadly stated, is to use targeted manipulations with intranasally&#xD;
      administered oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in conjunction with neurocognitive&#xD;
      and neuroimaging paradigms to evaluate claims that OT and AVP inhibit and facilitate,&#xD;
      respectively, the effective processing of aversive signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 216 healthy male and female adults between 20-40 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will involve a series of independent studies. Each study will require one visit&#xD;
      in addition to a screening visit, involves a physical and psychiatric assessment. The study&#xD;
      visit itself will involve pharmacological challenge followed by neurocognitive or&#xD;
      neuroimaging testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, we wish to examine whether increased vasopressin levels will increase, and&#xD;
      increased oxytocin levels decrease, the neural response in the amygdala and other limbic&#xD;
      structures to aversive stimuli. In addition, we wish to assess whether OT and AVP&#xD;
      administration will lead to the facilitation of conspecific recognition as appears to be the&#xD;
      case for other mammalian species.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Age: Participants will be healthy males and females, 20-40 years of age.&#xD;
                  Approximately equal numbers of males and females will be included in each study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. IQ: IQ, as measured by 4 subscales from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence&#xD;
                  Scale-Revised (WAIS-R), must be greater than 80. Prior testing in our laboratory&#xD;
                  has indicated that this cutoff allows for maximally generalizeable results while&#xD;
                  ensuring that all participants will understand and be able to complete the&#xD;
                  testing procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Menstrual phase: Female participants will be tested only during the follicular&#xD;
                  phase of their menstrual cycle (defined as days 6-12 after the first day of the&#xD;
                  last menstrual period and confirmed using ovulation testing kits).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because factors such as psychiatric disease or CNS disease can influence functional brain&#xD;
        activity, these factors are exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Psychiatric history: Participants will be assessed using DSM-IV criteria via&#xD;
             standardized psychiatric interviews conducted by trained examiners (SCID). All&#xD;
             participants will be free of any current or past major affective disorder, psychotic&#xD;
             disorder, substance dependence, anorexia, somatoform disorder, or anxiety disorders&#xD;
             including specific phobias.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Medical Illnesses: Moderate or severe acute or chronic medical illnesses (e.g. cardiac&#xD;
             disease, diabetes, epilepsy, influenza).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Cardiovascular risk factors: History of hypertension with baseline blood pressure&#xD;
             above 140 mm Hg (systolic) over 85 mm Hg (diastolic). Also any history of syncope&#xD;
             and/or baseline blood pressure below 100 mm Hg (systolic).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. CNS disease: Known history of brain abnormalities (e.g., neoplasms, subarachnoid&#xD;
             cysts), cerebrovascular disease, infectious disease (e.g., abscess), other central&#xD;
             nervous system disease, or history of head trauma which resulted in a persistent&#xD;
             neurologic deficit or loss of consciousness greater than 3 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Medication status: Currently on regular medication that would interfere with study&#xD;
             results. This includes contraceptive hormones, psychotropic medications or&#xD;
             benzodiazepines, alpha and beta adrenergic medications, other anti-hypertensive&#xD;
             medications, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid medications, and medications causing&#xD;
             sedation or stimulation. For example, current use of acetaminophen or ibuprofen is&#xD;
             permitted, while current use of benadryl or methylphenidate is not.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnancy or Nursing Status: Currently breast feeding or pregnant (as documented by&#xD;
             pregnancy testing which will be performed at screening and on the day of the challenge&#xD;
             study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        ADDITIONAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR FMRI STUDIES:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Metal or electronic objects: Metal plates, certain types of dental braces, cardiac&#xD;
             pacemakers, etc., that are sensitive to electromagnetic fields contraindicate MRI&#xD;
             scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Claustrophobia: Participants will be questioned about potential discomfort in being in&#xD;
             an enclosed space, such as an MRI scanner.&#xD;
