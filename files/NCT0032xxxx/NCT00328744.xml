  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rising prevalence of obesity in the United States is believed to be due to increased&#xD;
      exposure to adverse environmental factors, such as food portion sizes and increased dietary&#xD;
      variety. Although decreasing portion sizes is a strategy used in weight loss programs,&#xD;
      research has not studied the effects of decreasing dietary variety. Cross-sectional studies&#xD;
      show a positive association between variety and body weight and in our own studies the&#xD;
      investigators have shown that greater reductions in the number of different snack foods&#xD;
      (i.e., cookies, chips) consumed predicted greater decreases in overall caloric and fat intake&#xD;
      and greater weight loss. Limiting variety may reduce intake through long-term&#xD;
      sensory-specific satiety and/or monotony. Reducing dietary variety is a novel dietary&#xD;
      approach with the potential to improve long-term weight loss, which has not been studied as a&#xD;
      clinical strategy in obesity research. The objective of this application is to conduct a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial of a behavioral weight loss intervention limiting the number of&#xD;
      different snack foods consumed. Two hundred overweight and obese participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to a standard behavioral intervention (Standard) or to a standard behavioral&#xD;
      intervention that also limits the number of different snack foods consumed (Limited Variety).&#xD;
      Both conditions will receive an 18-month standard behavioral intervention, using behavioral&#xD;
      techniques (i.e., self-monitoring) to change eating behaviors. Participants in the Limited&#xD;
      Variety condition will also limit variety in snack foods to only two chosen snack foods&#xD;
      throughout the intervention. Measures of weight, snack food consumption and hedonics, and&#xD;
      diet satisfaction will be taken at 0, 6, 12, and 18 months. This investigation will&#xD;
      determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. if the Limited Variety condition produces greater weight loss than the Standard&#xD;
           condition at 18 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. if the Limited Variety condition consumes fewer servings and calories from snack foods&#xD;
           than the Standard condition;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. if limiting snack food variety produces long-term sensory-specific satiety and/or&#xD;
           monotony.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: Experimental studies show that limiting dietary variety profoundly reduces intake.&#xD;
      To date, there is no dietary prescription that has been tested that capitalizes on the effect&#xD;
      of variety on intake that can be maintained. This will be the first investigation to examine&#xD;
      methods of manipulating dietary variety that can be adhered to over time and that influence&#xD;
      intake, weight loss, and weight loss maintenance.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age between 21 and 65 years. Older adults may have more medical co-morbidities,&#xD;
             requiring greater medical supervision. Although pediatric obesity is a significant&#xD;
             concern, this group has different nutritional needs and requires different levels of&#xD;
             therapist and parental involvement than are proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Body mass index (BMI) between 27 and 45 kg/m2. Based upon the Evidence Report (72),&#xD;
             weight loss is recommended for individuals with a BMI &gt; 25. A BMI of &gt; 27 was chosen&#xD;
             as eligibility criteria for this investigation because this level of BMI will allow&#xD;
             for a 10% weight loss to occur prior to reaching a BMI of &lt; 25. Individuals with a BMI&#xD;
             of &gt; 45 have more medical co-morbidities and require greater medical supervision, and&#xD;
             thus will be considered ineligible for this investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Report a heart condition, chest pain during periods of activity or rest, or loss of&#xD;
             consciousness on the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) (73).&#xD;
             Individuals endorsing joint problems, prescription medication usage, or other medical&#xD;
             conditions that could limit exercise will be required to obtain written physician&#xD;
             consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have an allergy to a food commonly found in snack foods (i.e., nuts, milk and egg&#xD;
             proteins).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Report major psychiatric diseases or organic brain syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Are currently participating in a weight loss program and/or taking weight loss&#xD;
             medication or lost &gt; 5% of body weight during the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Intend to move outside of the metropolitan area within the time frame of the&#xD;
             investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Are pregnant, lactating, less than 6 months post-partum, or plan to become pregnant&#xD;
             during the time frame of the investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Consume &lt; 5 different types of snack food per week. Pilot data indicated that upon&#xD;
             screening 44 participants, mean weekly variety of snack foods was 8.7 (range 2 to 14,&#xD;
             with only two participants consuming &lt; 5 snack foods per week).&#xD;
