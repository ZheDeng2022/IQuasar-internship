  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a worldwide leading cause of blindness. The key feature of this ocular neuropathy&#xD;
      is characterized by an excavating optic nerve head. Loss of retinal ganglion cells is the&#xD;
      final end point in blinding diseases of the optic nerve such as glaucoma. It is known that&#xD;
      neuronal cell death in glaucoma occurs by apoptotic mechanism. In earlier studies, the&#xD;
      investigators demonstrated that the process of apoptosis is reflected in circulating&#xD;
      leukocytes by different parameters, like differential messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)&#xD;
      expression and an increased fragmentation of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Such&#xD;
      alterations point out a relationship between cellular stress and apoptotic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of mRNA-expression, the investigators also expect alterations on the&#xD;
      protein level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is, therefore, designed to characterize the proteome related to the proteins&#xD;
      involved in cell death related pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the expression pattern of several proteins in leukocytes from patients with primary open&#xD;
      angle glaucoma will be analyzed by techniques like Western-blot and tandem mass spectrometry.&#xD;
      These samples will be compared with healthy controls. In addition, they will be also compared&#xD;
      with samples from patients with Parkinson's disease. Since glaucoma is a neurodegenerative&#xD;
      disease, these patients will be included as a positive control in this study.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with pseudoexfoliation syndrome in combination with glaucoma may have an altered&#xD;
      activity of plasma matrix-metalloproteinase activity and a higher degree of DNA fragmentation&#xD;
      in the leukocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of the level of plasma matrix-metalloproteinase activity and of the degree of&#xD;
      DNA fragmentation of leukocytes in patients with pseudoexfoliation syndrome glaucoma (PEX) in&#xD;
      comparison to patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main pathogenic factors for the development of glaucoma is an increased&#xD;
      intraocular pressure (IOP), which leads to a direct or indirect damage of the nerve fibers in&#xD;
      the area of the optic disk. The raise of IOP is based on the increased outflow resistance of&#xD;
      the trabecular meshwork due to an excessive accumulation of extracellular material in the&#xD;
      juxtacanalicular tissue of the meshwork in eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), and&#xD;
      an impaired turnover of the trabecular meshwork matrix, which is of paramount importance to&#xD;
      the regulation and maintenance of aqueous humor outflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pseudoexfoliation (PEX) syndrome is a systemic disorder of the extracellular matrix, which&#xD;
      represents the most common identifiable cause of open-angle glaucoma. There is increasing&#xD;
      evidence suggesting that PEX syndrome may be a type of fibrosis associated with excessive&#xD;
      synthesis and deposition of an abnormal elastic fibrillar material in many intra- and&#xD;
      extraocular tissues. Active involvement of the trabecular meshwork in this abnormal matrix&#xD;
      process leading to progressive accumulation of PEX material in the juxtacanalicular tissue is&#xD;
      considered to be the primary cause of chronic pressure elevation in eyes with PEX syndrome.&#xD;
      However, the mechanisms responsible for this aberrant matrix process remain unknown.&#xD;
      Excessive production and accumulation of abnormal matrix components may be due to increased&#xD;
      de-novo synthesis, decreased turnover of matrix components, or both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracellular matrix turnover is mediated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a large family&#xD;
      of endopeptidases with variable substrate spectra, the presence of which has been described&#xD;
      in human aqueous humor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The activity of these enzymes is regulated in part by specific endogenous inhibitors, the&#xD;
      tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Dysregulated expression of MMPs and TIMPs&#xD;
      has been implicated in many disease processes accompanied by abnormal matrix production, such&#xD;
      as fibrotic disorders, and a variety of other disease states. In the eye, abnormal expression&#xD;
      of MMPs has been implicated, among many other disorders, in glaucoma, in proliferative&#xD;
      vitreoretinopathy, secondary cataract formation, and the pathogenesis of pterygia. Therefore,&#xD;
      MMPs and TIMPs are likely candidates to be involved in the abnormal extracellular matrix&#xD;
      metabolism characteristic of PEX syndrome/glaucoma (PEXG) and POAG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEX seems to be an independent risk factor for glaucoma. Possibly, this may be due to an&#xD;
      altered perfusion. So, PEX syndrome represents not only the most common identifiable cause of&#xD;
      open-angle glaucoma, but also a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. PEX syndrome and&#xD;
      iris trans-illumination defects are seen in patients with transient ischemic attacks. At the&#xD;
      microcirculatory level, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is thought to be initiated by&#xD;
      chemotactic accumulation of circulating leukocytes, their activation and interaction with the&#xD;
      endothelium of postcapillary venules. In addition, oxygen free radicals are thought to play a&#xD;
      pivotal role in the pathogenesis of I/R injury. A variety of experimental models of ischemic&#xD;
      injury have shown that free radicals induce post-ischemic oxidative damage to DNA. Although&#xD;
      several human studies have revealed that oxygen radicals generated by other mechanisms like&#xD;
      irradiation, only few data exist that demonstrate the influence of reperfusion-associated&#xD;
      oxygen radicals on DNA in humans. We hypothesize that the pathogenic processes in PEX may be&#xD;
      reflected in leukocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the results that glaucoma patients differ on the level of their mRNA expression&#xD;
      for various MMPs in peripheral leukocytes and that PEX syndrome is often seen with transient&#xD;
      ischemic attacks, we assume differences in the activity of MMPs in the plasma as well as&#xD;
      changes in the DNA stability in peripheral leukocytes of patients with PEX glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is, therefore, designed to analyze the activity of gelatinases (MMP-2 and -9) in&#xD;
      plasma and the degree of DNA fragmentation in peripheral leukocytes of patients with PEX&#xD;
      syndrome and PEXG compared to POAG and controls.&#xD;
