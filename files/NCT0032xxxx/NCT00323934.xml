        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically documented advanced or metastatic&#xD;
             solid malignancy or aggressive NHL with no reasonable likelihood of achieving clinical&#xD;
             benefit with existing therapies, that has failed to respond to standard therapy, has&#xD;
             progressed despite standard therapy, or for which no standard therapy exists.&#xD;
             Aggressive forms of NHL eligible for the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Burkitt's lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mantle cell lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Follicle-center cell lymphoma, large cell&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known central nervous system (CNS) metastases may be enrolled if they&#xD;
             have received radiotherapy for their CNS disease, if they have been on a stable dose&#xD;
             of steroids for at least 1 month prior to study entry, if they have had computed&#xD;
             tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain within 1 month of&#xD;
             study entry that shows stable disease and if they are free of neurological symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapies allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cytotoxic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hormonal therapy/other therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adjuvant therapy - Patients may have had unlimited prior adjuvant therapy. A&#xD;
                  minimum of 28 days must have passed since the end of last treatment and study&#xD;
                  initiation. Patients must have recovered from any treatment-related toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minimum life expectancy of at least 3 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of another cancer other than basal cell carcinoma or cervical&#xD;
             intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN/cervical in situ) unless the previous cancer was&#xD;
             treated and the patient has remained disease free for five years or more prior to the&#xD;
             current cancer diagnosis. Investigators desiring to enter patients with a second&#xD;
             malignancy must discuss with and obtain written approval in advance from the&#xD;
             MethylGene Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             serum pregnancy test documented within 7 days prior to registration on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients and their partners, if either are of child-bearing potential, not using&#xD;

             contraception during the study and for 90 days following the last dose of study&#xD;
             medication. An effective form of contraception is an oral contraceptive or a double&#xD;
             barrier method, such as condom with diaphragm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known meningeal metastasis(es)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active or uncontrolled infections, or with a fever &gt; 38.5 degrees&#xD;
             Celsius on the day of scheduled dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with serious illnesses, medical conditions, or other medical history,&#xD;
             including laboratory results, which, in the investigator's opinion, would be likely to&#xD;
             interfere with a patient's participation in the study, or with the interpretation of&#xD;
             the results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have been treated with any investigational drug within 30 days prior to&#xD;
             study initiation (an investigational drug is one for which there is no approved&#xD;
             indication), or who are receiving concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs&#xD;
             or anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors or any of the&#xD;
             components of MGCD0103&#xD;

          -  Known HIV or hepatitis B or C (active, prior treated, or both).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition (e.g., known or suspected poor compliance, psychological instability,&#xD;
             geographical location, etc) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may affect the&#xD;
             patient's ability to sign the informed consent and undergo study procedures.&#xD;
