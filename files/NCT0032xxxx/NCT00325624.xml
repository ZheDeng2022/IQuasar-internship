      The purpose behind the proposed research is that diabetes care in First Nations people can be&#xD;
      improved by involvement of a Home Care team providing diabetes education and management,&#xD;
      supported by emerging technology, specifically Bluetooth-enabled glucometers and blood&#xD;
      pressure monitors, capable of transmitting their data to a web environment in tabulated and&#xD;
      graphical format available for remote viewing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is a systemic disease that produces a diverse array of complications. The&#xD;
      pathogenesis of these complications refers back to two factors, one of which (high blood&#xD;
      glucose) alters proteins leading to tissue and blood vessel damage, while the other (high&#xD;
      blood pressure), exacerbates the vascular damage causing further damage to target organs. Our&#xD;
      long term goal is to achieve targets for blood glucose and blood pressure as outlined by&#xD;
      Clinical Practice Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite current Clinical Practice Guidelines and evidence-based practice by the medical&#xD;
      community, including family physicians and the Home Care team, blood glucose control in&#xD;
      general and in the First Nations community specifically is not meeting targets. Poor control&#xD;
      of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes dramatically increases the risk of heart disease, stroke,&#xD;
      vascular limb loss, blindness, kidney disease and the need for dialysis. Control of blood&#xD;
      glucose levels prevents these complications. Additionally, the intensification of diabetes&#xD;
      control, including the initiation of insulin, is not easily done during a regular primary&#xD;
      care visit. The lack of intensification of diabetes management in people with poorly&#xD;
      controlled diabetes has been referred to as 'clinical inertia'. While subjects referred to&#xD;
      specialists have somewhat better control of diabetes, more than 50% still failed to have&#xD;
      intensification of diabetes management within four months of a lab report showing a high&#xD;
      level of A1c. Multidisciplinary care can overcome clinical inertia, even in difficult&#xD;
      practice settings. Finally, the emerging technology of Bluetooth-enabled devices and secure&#xD;
      web-based monitoring logs allows health care providers for the first time to remotely monitor&#xD;
      progress providing a higher level of confidence in self blood glucose monitoring (SBGM) and&#xD;
      blood pressure results. Based on these facts, the experimental focus of this proposal is on&#xD;
      the introduction of a Home Care Team diabetes management program that can provide&#xD;
      intensification of diabetes management right in the patient's home, supported by the emerging&#xD;
      technology of Bluetooth- enabled devices. The specific aims are designed to provide a&#xD;
      comprehensive assessment of the impact of the introduction of this program.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Type 2 Diabetes with baseline A1c &gt; 8.0 % on diet or medical therapy with no history&#xD;
             of diabetic ketoacidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent must be obtained prior to admission to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypoglycemic therapy and A1c&lt;8.0%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  New York Heart Association Stage III-IV congestive heart failure. This will eliminate&#xD;
             approximately 2% of people with diabetes based on the Strong Heart Study Data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspected secondary hypertension due to any cause (e.g. pheochromocytoma,coarction of&#xD;
             the aorta or renal insufficiency.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or revascularization within the last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Angioedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cerebrovascular event, including stroke or transient ischemic attack, within the last&#xD;
             six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine &gt;250 umol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cerebral Vascular event, including strike or transient ischemic attack, within the&#xD;
             last six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Connective tissue disorders (e.g.lupus, rheumatoid arthritis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active hepatic disease as indicated by AST and ALT &gt;2X the upper limit of normal;&#xD;
             serum bilirubin &gt;1.5X upper limit of normal, or serum albumin &lt;3.0 gm/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe systemic or malignant disease(which could reasonably be expected to be fatal or&#xD;
             life-threatening during the course of the study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy. It is expected that some women will want to exit the study to become&#xD;
             pregnant (5% of female enrollees).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Factors suggesting low likelihood of compliance with the protocol (e.g current alcohol&#xD;
             abuse, history of unreliability in keeping appointments or taking medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical condition that study physicians believe would interfere with study&#xD;
             participation or evaluation of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mental incapacity and/or cognitive impairment on the part of the patient that would&#xD;
             preclude adequate understanding of, or cooperation with, the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in any clinical trial of any investigational medication within 3 months&#xD;
             prior to this trial. This is unlikely because clinical trials among First Nations&#xD;
             people are rare.&#xD;
