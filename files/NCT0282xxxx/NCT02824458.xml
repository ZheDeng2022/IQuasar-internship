    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Apatinib in&#xD;
      combination with Gefitinib as compared to placebo in combination with Gefitinib in&#xD;
      participants with stage ⅢB-IV Non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring an&#xD;
      activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (Del19 and L858R). Safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of Apatinib in combination with Gefitinib will be assessed in the first portion&#xD;
      (Part A) before proceeding to the second portion of this study (Part B).&#xD;

    <measure>(Part A) Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Apatinib in Combination With Gefitinib</measure>
    <time_frame>1 months</time_frame>
    <description>MTD was determined by testing increasing doses up to 750 mg daily (qd) on dose escalation cohorts 1 to 3 with 3 patients each. MTD reflects highest dose of drug that did not cause an unacceptable side effect (= Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) in more than 30% of patients; e.g., hematologic toxicities like Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 4 Neutropenia in specific conditions, platelets &lt; 25,000 cells/mL; specific non-hematologic/biochemical toxicities CTC Grade 3 or 4; additionally, any toxicity considered by the investigator severe enough was designated a DLT); CTC Version 2 were used.</description>
