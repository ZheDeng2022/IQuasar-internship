  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Essential tremor (ET) is the most frequent movement disorder. Its prevalence is about 1/200&#xD;
      implying that at least 300 000 peoples are concerned in France. Its frequency increase with&#xD;
      age (14% of patients 65 yo). The diagnostic criteria are postural and kinetic tremor that can&#xD;
      be associated with head/voice tremor. ET induces a social impairment but also difficulties to&#xD;
      perform any task requiring dexterity. With time, tremor can be so severe that every activity&#xD;
      of daily living is impaired with loss of autonomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment such as betablockers, primidone or antiepileptics might have some efficacy at the&#xD;
      beginning. But as the severity of the tremor increases, there is lack of efficacy. Deep Brain&#xD;
      stimulation (DBS) of the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) of the thalamus can be proposed.&#xD;
      However, in case of medical or surgical contra-indication, Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery&#xD;
      thalamotomy can be an alternative option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included with a minimum of 12 months after having the first thalamotomy&#xD;
      (Gamma Knife 1) (done on the most annoying side) subject to no significant deterioration in&#xD;
      cognitive assessment, voice assessment and balance and postural assessment or&#xD;
      neuroradiological abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed with Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cerebral, clinical assessment&#xD;
      (tremor rating scale) impairment of activity of daily living, neuropsychological evaluation,&#xD;
      voice assessment and balance and postural assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second thalamotomy (Gamma Knife 2) will be proposed and a monitoring at M6 and M12 will&#xD;
      be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will demonstrate the feasibility and tolerance of bilateral GK radiosurgery&#xD;
      thalamotomy in ET patients with severe impairment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with essential tremor defined criteria Consensus statement of the movement&#xD;
             Disorder Society on Classical Essential Tremor (1998), with trembling of the upper&#xD;
             limbs causing functional impairment justifying surgical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Man or woman aged 20 to 85 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient having an absolute contraindication against or on Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)&#xD;
             of the VIM.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient who received a first effective unilateral thalamotomy on tremor with a&#xD;
             satisfactory clinical outcome (no cognitive impairment, lack of postural disorder&#xD;
             Musculoskeletal severe lack of dysarthria). The first effective thalamotomy will be&#xD;
             characterized by an improved score of tremor ≥ 45% and improved functional gene ≥ 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient who received a first unilateral thalamotomy with satisfactory radiological&#xD;
             evolution. Unsatisfactory radiological evolution will be characterized by a contrast&#xD;

             internal capsule.&#xD;
