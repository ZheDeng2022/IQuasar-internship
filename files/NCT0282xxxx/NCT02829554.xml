      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers are testing new methods for research projects. They want to see how people&#xD;
      respond to different types of communication, including videos. They also want to learn how&#xD;
      people respond to life events and how they pay attention to computer tasks. They want to&#xD;
      learn about how various risks and threats affect the way people make decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn how different stimuli and events affect the way people make decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with a U.S. computer address&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take one of three studies online. Each study will take about a half hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Study 1 will watch a short video from a popular movie then answer questions.&#xD;
      They will also complete 2 questionnaires. One will be about how likely they think it is that&#xD;
      they will experience different risks and threats. The other will be about goals for behavior&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Study 2 will write in detail about a life event. Then they will answer&#xD;
      questions. They will also complete the same 2 questionnaires as Study 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Study 3 will pay close attention to words and images on a computer. They will&#xD;
      answer questions about attitudes toward different behaviors, products, and experiences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite evidence that both integral (i.e., related to the decision) and incidental (i.e.,&#xD;
      unrelated to the decision) emotions influence cancer-related decision making, no research has&#xD;
      systematically examined whether these two types of emotion generate similar patterns of&#xD;
      influence, as predicted by decision-making models. This is important because incidental&#xD;
      emotions are often used experimentally to draw causal conclusions about how emotions&#xD;
      influence cancer-related decisions with the notion that results will generalize to produce&#xD;
      knowledge about integral emotions as well. Across three studies, we plan to directly compare&#xD;
      integral and incidental emotional influences on judgments and decisions related to cancer&#xD;
      control. We plan to examine whether effects are contingent on the type of emotional influence&#xD;
      (the discrete emotions anger and fear, or general positive affect) or type of emotion&#xD;
      induction (video, autobiographical induction, or evaluative conditioning). Across&#xD;
      experiments, we predict that emotion will influence both judgment and decision-making&#xD;
      outcomes when the induced emotion is integral as well as when it is incidental. However, we&#xD;
      predict that the magnitude of the effect of emotion on these types of responses will be&#xD;
      significantly greater when emotions are integral to a judgment or decision, compared to when&#xD;
      emotions are incidental.&#xD;
