  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study, to evaluate the&#xD;
      tolerability, safety and efficacy of the Vibrant Capsule in relieving constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One arm will be assessed: Vibrant Capsule administered with a sequence of one per day for 2&#xD;
      days, followed by one day without, one per day for 2 days followed by one day without, etc.&#xD;
      (14 capsules in 3 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have one interim analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will follow a 2 weeks baseline period and then take the Vibrant Capsule for a&#xD;
      treatment period of 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data reporting will be done on an electronic Case Report Form and an eDiary. During the 2&#xD;
      weeks of baseline, patients will be asked to refrain from taking any medication or supplement&#xD;
      to relieve their constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 14 days the patients will return and eligibility will be re-assessed. Patients will be&#xD;
      trained on how to use the base unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed to complete a simple patient eDiary each day throughout the&#xD;
      duration of the study. After 3 weeks of treatment, the patient will attend for evaluation and&#xD;
      to receive new capsules. A final visit will take place at the end of the 6 week treatment&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive phone calls up to twice per week and patient compliance will be&#xD;
      monitored during the 8 weeks of the study.&#xD;
