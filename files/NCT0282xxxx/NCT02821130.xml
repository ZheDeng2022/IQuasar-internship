  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shortness of breath (dyspnea) during exercise is a major source of distress and is a commonly&#xD;
      reported symptom in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). A recent treatment option known as&#xD;
      Orkambi, which combines the drugs lumacaftor and ivacaftor, may be used in patients with CF&#xD;
      to help improve lung health. However, the effects of this combination therapy on dyspnea and&#xD;
      exercise performance, a known predictor of survival in CF, are not clear. The investigators&#xD;
      aim to understand the effects of Orkambi on these symptoms and to gain new insight into the&#xD;
      potential health improvements in CF from using this treatment option.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advances in therapies and patient care have led to dramatic improvements in cystic fibrosis&#xD;
      (CF) survival. Consequently, CF patients are living longer with varying degrees of lung&#xD;
      function impairment. Dyspnea is a commonly reported symptom in CF that adversely impacts&#xD;
      quality of life. Recently, lumacaftor/ivacaftor (Orkambi), a combination drug therapy, was&#xD;
      approved by Health Canada for use in CF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the various factors that cause shortness of breath&#xD;
      (or dyspnea) in patients with CF and to determine how treatment with Orkambi can manipulate&#xD;
      these factors to improve shortness of breath and exercise capacity. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that lumacaftor/ivacaftor will reduce dyspnea intensity ratings and improve&#xD;
      exercise capacity. These improvements will be associated with improvements in the ventilatory&#xD;
      response to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise capacity is an important outcome parameter in CF and is a strong predictor of&#xD;
      disease prognosis including survival. While previous studies have reported improved&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms in CF patients taking Orkambi, it remains uncertain as to whether this&#xD;
      translates into improvements in exercise performance. Furthermore, the improvement in lung&#xD;
      function parameters observed in these studies evaluating Orkambi in CF were modest compared&#xD;
      to ivacaftor in CF and therefore stressing the respiratory system to its physiologic limits&#xD;
      through exercise might provide a more sensitive outcome measure to evaluate the response to&#xD;
      the Orkambi treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to perform detailed cardiopulmonary exercise testing before&#xD;
      and after the initiation of lumacaftor/ivacaftor to evaluate its effect on exertional dyspnea&#xD;
      and exercise capacity, and to evaluate potential physiological mechanisms of improvement in&#xD;
      patients with CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Overview: Participants with CF will report to the laboratory on four separate&#xD;
      visits. Visit 1 and 2 will occur before the participants go on drug (Orkambi) and will be&#xD;
      separated by a minimum of 2 days between visits. Visit 3 and 4 will occur at 1 month and 3&#xD;
      months after initiating full dose of drug, respectively. On visit 1, participants will&#xD;
      complete medical history screening, anthropometric measurements, pulmonary function&#xD;
      assessment, and a symptom limited incremental cycle exercise test to determine peak&#xD;
      incremental work rate. On visit 2, participants will complete chronic activity-related&#xD;
      dyspnea, quality of life, and physical activity questionnaires, perform pulmonary function&#xD;
      testing followed by a constant-load cycle exercise test at 80% of peak incremental work rate.&#xD;
      Visits 3 and 4 will include chronic activity-related dyspnea, quality of life, and physical&#xD;
      activity questionnaires, pulmonary function testing, and a constant-load cycle exercise test&#xD;
      at 80% of peak incremental work rate. Detailed physiological and sensory measurements will be&#xD;
      obtained during the exercise test sessions. Data from the constant-load cycle exercise tests&#xD;
      performed on visits 2, 3, and 4 will address our hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Protocol: All exercise testing will occur in the Cardiopulmonary Exercise Physiology&#xD;
      Laboratory (CPEP lab). The CPEP lab is located on the 4th floor of the Burrard Building at&#xD;
      St. Paul's Hospital (Vancouver, BC). A symptom-limited incremental exercise test will be&#xD;
      performed on visit 1 using an electronically braked cycle ergometer (Ergoslect 200P; Ergoline&#xD;
      GmbH, Bitz, Germany) according to recommended guidelines. The test will consist of&#xD;
      steady-state rest for 6 minutes, a 1 minute warm-up of unloaded pedaling, and 15 watt&#xD;
      stepwise increases in work rate every 2 minutes until symptom-limitation. Constant-load&#xD;
      exercise tests on visits 2, 3, and 4 will include rest and warm-up periods followed by an&#xD;
      immediate increase in work rate to 80% of maximal work (determined on visit 1) until symptom&#xD;
      limitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary Function: Spirometry, plethysmography, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon&#xD;
      monoxide (DLCO), maximum respiratory pressures, and impulse oscillometry will be performed on&#xD;
      all study visits according to standard recommendations. A commercially available&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary testing system will be used, and all measurements will be expressed as % of&#xD;
      predicted normal values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyspnea Evaluation: Dyspnea intensity (defined as &quot;the sensation of laboured or difficult&#xD;
      breathing&quot;) and perceived leg discomfort will be evaluated at rest, every minute during&#xD;
      exercise, and at peak exercise using the modified 10-point Borg scale on all testing visits.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to describe their dyspnea during exercise after the intensity&#xD;
      ratings at end-exercise using the following 3 descriptors: (1) &quot;my breathing requires more&#xD;
      work and effort&quot; (work and effort); (2) &quot;I cannot get enough air in&quot; (unsatisfied&#xD;
      inspiration); (3) &quot;I cannot get enough air out&quot; (unsatisfied expiration). None to all 3 of&#xD;
      the descriptors can be chosen at any one time. Upon exercise cessation, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to verbalize their main reason(s) for stopping exercise (i.e., breathing discomfort,&#xD;
      leg discomfort, combination of breathing and legs, or some other reason) and to select&#xD;
      qualitative descriptors of breathlessness using an established questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardio-respiratory Responses to Exercise: Standard cardio-respiratory measures will be&#xD;
      recorded on a breath-by-breath basis and averaged over 30-second epochs, including minute&#xD;
      ventilation (V'E), oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (CO2), tidal volume,&#xD;
      and breathing frequency using a commercially available metabolic cart. Operating volumes&#xD;
      (i.e., end-expiratory and end-inspiratory lung volumes) will be derived from dynamic&#xD;
      inspiratory capacity (IC) manoeuvres as previously described. For safety purposes,&#xD;
      electrocardiography will be monitored using a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure&#xD;
      will be measured using a manual sphygmomanometer, and arterial oxygen saturation will be&#xD;
      monitored using pulse oximetry. All exercise tests will be administered by experienced&#xD;
      exercise physiologists. All exercise tests will be supervised by either Dr. Quon, Dr. Wilcox,&#xD;
      Dr. Goodwin or another qualified physician. Exercise tests will be terminated based on&#xD;
      established criteria as per American College of Sports Medicine guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed Tomography Phenotyping: Existing chest computed tomography (CT) scans, obtained&#xD;
      through routine clinical practice, will be used for descriptive exploratory purposes to&#xD;
      examine the relationship between the extent of bronchiectasis vs. mucus plugging vs. air&#xD;
      trapping (based on CF-specific CT scoring) on the physiological and sensory responses to&#xD;
      exercise in patients with CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Data Collection: The following clinical data (collected as part of routine clinical&#xD;
      care) will be obtained via chart review: Medication review (Visit 1), Co-morbidities (Visit&#xD;
      1), Respiratory microbiology (Visit 1), Sweat Chloride (Visits 1, 3 and 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants: The study will include 16 participants in total. Participants satisfying&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited from the University of British Columbia&#xD;
      Adult CF Clinic located on the 8th floor of the Providence Building within the Division of&#xD;
      Respiratory Medicine at St. Paul's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Data will be presented as means ± standard deviation unless otherwise&#xD;
      specified. Within-group comparison of exercise responses during constant-load exercise tests&#xD;
      will be performed using paired t-tests with Bonferroni corrections where appropriate,&#xD;
      comparing exercise responses during constant-load exercise tests performed before (visit 2)&#xD;
      and after (visits 3 and 4) initiating full dose of Orkambi. Within-group comparison of&#xD;
      exertional dyspnea will be based on Borg dyspnea ratings taken at iso-time, defined as the&#xD;
      maximum time achieved on constant-load exercise tests performed on visits 2, 3, and 4. An&#xD;
      additional analysis will include adjustment for potential covariates including age, sex, and&#xD;
      baseline lung function (FVC and DLCO). Pearson correlation coefficients will be used to&#xD;
      examine the association between measured variables (e.g. breathing patterns, ventilatory&#xD;
      responses, operating lung volumes, pulmonary function variables, etc.) with changes in Borg&#xD;
      ratings and endurance time. Reasons for stopping exercise and qualitative descriptors of&#xD;
      dyspnea will be analyzed as frequency statistics and compared between constant -load exercise&#xD;
      tests performed on visits 2, 3, and 4 using the McNemar's test at iso-time. A P-value less&#xD;
      than 0.05 will be regarded as statistically significant. Statistical analysis of the data&#xD;
      will be performed using Stata v11.2 (StataCorp, Texas, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Power Calculation: A sample size of 16 per group provides 80% power to detect&#xD;
      a 1 Borg unit difference between groups in dyspnea intensity at a standardized work rate&#xD;
      during incremental cycle exercise, based on a standard deviation of 1 unit, α=0.05 and a&#xD;
      2-tailed test of significance. This sample size is also adequate to detect statistically&#xD;
      significant differences in our other outcomes (operating lung volumes) based on previous&#xD;
      studies in humans.&#xD;
