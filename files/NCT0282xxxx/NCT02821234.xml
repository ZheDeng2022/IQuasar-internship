  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One-tenth of the population suffers from insomnia, increasing their risk on other health&#xD;
      problems such as depression. Self-reported sleep quality only was historically leading for&#xD;
      insomnia diagnosis, but more recently a state of 24-hour hyperarousal has been associated&#xD;
      with insomnia, either physiological (increased heart rate, higher frequency EEG) or&#xD;
      predominant cognitive-emotional hyperarousal (worry, rumination, repetitive thoughts). Strong&#xD;
      evidence shows that those suffering from insomnia with physiological hyperarousal are at&#xD;
      higher risk of short and long term severe health problems such as inflammation and&#xD;
      hypertension than the group without physiological hyperarousal. The neurophysiological basis&#xD;
      of these insomnia phenotypes has however barely been investigated, although its results can&#xD;
      have major consequences for how this limiting condition will be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To support the development of a differential diagnosis of insomnia, structural and functional&#xD;
      brain connectivity in insomnia patients with different levels of hyperarousal will be&#xD;
      investigated and related to sleep variables. Investigators will compare the insomnia group to&#xD;
      a normal sleeping control group. Investigators expect that the emotion processing circuit&#xD;
      (amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex) is a) more affected in insomniacs compared to&#xD;
      normal sleeping controls and b) the directionality of this effect to depend on the level and&#xD;
      type of hyperarousal in insomniacs. Further, investigators expect c) amygdala activity to be&#xD;
      positive correlated with physiological hyperarousal level and d) prefrontal activity to be&#xD;
      positively correlated with cognitive-emotional hyperarousal level. Investigators expect a&#xD;
      higher physiological hyperarousal level to be reflected in affected afferent pathways of the&#xD;
      amygdala towards the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and investigators expect higher&#xD;
      cognitive-emotional hyperarousal to be related to affected efferent pathways from the&#xD;
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex to the amygdala. Investigators expect sleep quality to play a&#xD;
      mediating role in both types of hyperarousal and their brain activation patterns in insomnia&#xD;
      patients and normal sleeping controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data can lead to the definition of new insomnia phenotypes and to new customized and&#xD;
      effective insomnia treatment, focused not only on improving sleep but also on changing&#xD;
      dysfunctional hyperarousal levels that currently put insomniacs at risk of numerous severe&#xD;
      health problems.&#xD;
