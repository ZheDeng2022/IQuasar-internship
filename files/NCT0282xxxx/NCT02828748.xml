      Chronic intestinal inflammation characterizes inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which&#xD;
      consist mainly of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The exact etiology is unknown for&#xD;
      both diseases and therapeutic attempts aimed at down-regulating intestinal inflammation use&#xD;
      both mediator-specific and nonspecific immune suppression. These attempts cause considerable&#xD;
      side effects. Also, IBD patients are different in their genetic background and pathology. It&#xD;
      was previously shown that products based on marijuana (Cannabis sativa) produce beneficial&#xD;
      effects for patients with IBD, and medical cannabis-based products were formerly proven to&#xD;
      have anti-inflammatory activity in laboratory experiments and in clinical tests. However, it&#xD;
      is unknown how C. sativa-based medical products exert their effect in IBD and additional&#xD;
      research and development should be done. One issue to be resolved in the process of&#xD;
      medicalization of C. sativa is the base for the differences in patient response to different&#xD;
      C. sativa lines, in order to fine-tune C. sativa -based treatment to IBD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this aim of fine-tuning C. sativa -based treatment to IBD patients, we characterized the&#xD;
      chemical composition of different C. sativa lines and their anti-inflammatory activities on&#xD;
      colon cells lines. Extracts of C. sativa lines were prepared using various methods and&#xD;
      cannabinoids and terpenoids profile was determined by chemical analysis. We found that&#xD;
      different compounds have different effects on inflamed colon cell lines, leading to changes&#xD;
      in interleukin secretion, inflammation markers and gene expression in the treated colon&#xD;
      cells. In addition, we have developed a unique system relevant for personalized medicine in&#xD;
      IBD. This system allows a patient-specific determination of the effect of C. sativa -based&#xD;
      treatment. Following, clinical tests will be conducted aiming to develop cannabis-based&#xD;
      products from different C. sativa lines, with anti-inflammatory activity that is effective&#xD;
      and optimized for the different IBD patients.&#xD;

      Title of the project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy of cannabinoids in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question to be investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The marijuana plant, Cannabis sativa has been used as a medicinal treatment for a variety of&#xD;
      diseases. Cannabinoids have been reported to alleviate neurological conditions including&#xD;
      MS-related symptoms such as spasticity, pain, tremor and bladder dysfunction . Other&#xD;
      neurological conditions, such as chronic intractable pain, dystonic movement disorders, and&#xD;
      Tourette's Syndrome were also reported to be alleviated by cannabis use . Cannabis has been&#xD;
      used to treat anorexia in AIDS and cancer patients. In gastroenterology, cannabis has been&#xD;
      used to treat anorexia, emesis, abdominal pain, gastroenteritis, diarrhea, intestinal&#xD;
      inflammation, and diabetic gastroparesis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cannabis plant contains over 60 different compounds which are collectively referred to as&#xD;
      cannabinoids . Of these, the two compounds delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol&#xD;
      (CBD) seem to be the most active.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cannabinoids have a profound anti-inflammatory effect, mainly through the CB2 receptor. Cell&#xD;
      mediated immunity was found to be impaired in chronic marijuana users . A potent&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect of cannabis was observed in rodents. Studying the functional roles&#xD;
      of the endocannabinoid system in immune modulation reveals that it is involved in almost all&#xD;
      major immune events. Cannabinoids shift the balance of pro-inflammatory cytokines and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory cytokines towards the T-helper cell type 2 profiles (Th2 phenotype) and&#xD;
      suppress cell-mediated immunity, whereas humoral immunity may be enhanced. Cannabidiol was&#xD;
      shown to reduce inflammation in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis and type I diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, cannabinoids can be used to treat various inflammatory conditions including&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis and asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the gut, Endocannabinoids are produced by both the serosal and mucosal component of the&#xD;
      human intestine, and studies on cell lines have shown that human intestinal epithelial cells&#xD;
      can produce endocannabinoids; additional sources of endocannabinoids in the gut include human&#xD;
      endothelial cells, platelets, resident macrophages and other immune cells such as&#xD;
      lymphocytes. CB1 and CB2 receptors are be upregulated in experimental models of inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel disease. In a mouse model of colitis, cannabinoids were found to ameliorate&#xD;
      inflammation, and in the human intestine, levels of Anandamide are increased during&#xD;
      inflammation. The inflamed small intestine also has significantly elevated activity of FAAH&#xD;
      as well as expression of CB1 cannabinoid receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact cellular targets implicated in the reduction of inflammation by cannabinoids are&#xD;
      unknown. In a model of bronchopulmonary inflammation in mice administration of anandamide&#xD;
      decreased TNF alpha levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol&#xD;
      (THC) inhibits synthesis of IL-12, IL-2, IL-6, INF gamma, and T cell proliferation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients with IBD report that smoking marihuana ameliorated their symptoms, but there&#xD;
      are no clinical studies investigating that observation. We have recently published the first&#xD;
      reported observation of use of medical cannabis in Crohn's disease. In our study, of 30&#xD;
      patients, 21 improved significantly after treatment with cannabis. The average Harvey&#xD;
      Bradshaw index improved from 14 ± 6.7 to 7 ± 4.7 (P &lt; 0.001). Number of bowel movements was&#xD;
      reduced from an average of eight a day to five a day and the need for other medication,&#xD;
      particularly steroids, was significantly reduced. In view of those results we conducted a&#xD;
      double blind placebo controlled trial in 20 active Crohn's disease patients. Patients with a&#xD;
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI)&gt;200 who did not respond to steroids, immunosuppressants&#xD;
      or anti-TNF were randomized to receive 2 cigarettes of cannabis or placebo daily. Each&#xD;
      cigarette contained 0.5 g of cannabis, corresponding to 11.5mg Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).&#xD;
      The placebo contained cannabis leaves from which THC was extracted. During treatment the CDAI&#xD;
      changed in the cannabis group from 358 ± 99 to 139±111 (p&lt;0.05) and in the placebo group from&#xD;
      373 ± 94 to 306±143 (p=Non significant). Five patients in the cannabis group and one in the&#xD;
      placebo group went into complete remission (CDAI &lt;100). Three steroid dependent patients in&#xD;
      the cannabis group stopped steroids during the study. Patients reported improved appetite and&#xD;
      sleep, with no serious side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These preliminary data indicate that cannabinoids have a great potential in the treatment of&#xD;
      Crohn's disease, but further investigation of their influence, mode of action, active and non&#xD;
      active cannabinoids and alternative routs of application is clearly needed. Most important is&#xD;
      the question whether the improvement observed with cannabis consumption is only symptomatic&#xD;
      or whether there is a real improvement in inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed study is to evaluate inflammation and cytokine levels in explants of&#xD;
      colonic tissue from IBD patients with and without cannabidiol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients with either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis scheduled for&#xD;
      colonoscopy as deemed necessary by their physician will be eligible for the study. After&#xD;
      obtaining informed consent, biopsies from inflamed and normal tissue will be taken and&#xD;
      processed in a tissue culture media as described further. There will be 6 biopsies from each&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explants will be cultured in groups of three with the villus surface up on microporous&#xD;
      membranes (0.45-_m pore size) contained in Millicell-HA tissue culture inserts (Millipore).&#xD;
      The inserts will be placed inside 6-well plastic tissue culture dishes (Costar 3506) along&#xD;
      with 1.5 ml of tissue culture medium. Tissue culture medium will be Dulbecco's modified&#xD;
      Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin&#xD;
      (100units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), leupeptin (50 μg/ml), PMSF (1 mM), soybean trypsin&#xD;
      inhibitor (50 μg/ml), and dexamethasone (200 μg/ml). Cultures will be incubated at 37°C&#xD;
      incubator and gassed hourly with95% oxygen 5% carbon dioxide. Six biopsies from each site&#xD;
      will be obtained. Three biopsies will serve as a control and three will be cultured with the&#xD;
      addition of Cannabidiol (1 μg/ml). After 24 hours tissue viability will be assessed by&#xD;
      addition of Alamar to one of each 3 samples. Change of color from purple to pink indicates&#xD;
      viable tissue. The supernatant from the other 4 biopsies will be collected and frozen at&#xD;
      -20°C. The biopsies will than be placed in formalin for pathology inspection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The supernatant from controlled and cannabis treated samples will be analyzed for the&#xD;
      presence and level of TNF alpha, Interferon gamma,IL-23, IL-12, IL-2, IL-10, IL-17 and IL-6.&#xD;
