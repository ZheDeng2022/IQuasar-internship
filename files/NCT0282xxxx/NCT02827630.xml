      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a new digital health offering,&#xD;
      Proteus Discover to lower blood pressure and glycated hemoglobin in patients with&#xD;
      uncontrolled hypertension and type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      &quot;Cardiometabolic diseases&quot; as defined in this protocol refer to diseases that increase risk&#xD;
      for cardiovascular disease. Proteus® Digital Health is operationally defining cardiometabolic&#xD;
      (CMB) conditions for this study as including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia. The prevalence of metabolic diseases is growing. Factors contributing&#xD;
      to this rise include the obesity epidemic and the aging population. In particular, because of&#xD;
      the costs and risk of complications associated with diabetes and hypertension, many health&#xD;
      systems and payers are increasing focus on interventions to reduce the burden of these&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study was to evaluate the ability of a new digital health offering,&#xD;
      Proteus Discover to lower blood pressure and glycated hemoglobin in patients with&#xD;
      uncontrolled hypertension and type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study enrolled subjects with uncontrolled hypertension and type 2 diabetes failing at&#xD;
      least 2 antihypertensives and metformin and/or a sulfonylurea. Subjects were randomized to&#xD;
      one of 3 arms: use of Proteus Discover for 4 weeks, use of Proteus Discover for 12 weeks, or&#xD;
      usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to the intervention arms, used a digital health offering to (1) provide&#xD;
      automatic and passive electronic documentation of medication adherence and patterns of&#xD;
      medication taking, (2) assist providers in distinguishing inadequate medication adherence or&#xD;
      pharmacologic unresponsiveness as the root cause for uncontrolled hypertension and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes, and (3) inform management decisions (dose adjustment, medication addition or&#xD;
      substitution, adherence counseling, referral to a hypertension specialist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to usual care, received usual medical care such as medication changes,&#xD;
      adherence counseling, and lifestyle coaching. Providers could also schedule additional visits&#xD;
      without restrictions.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adults (18 to 75 years old) who are diagnosed with essential hypertension and type 2&#xD;
             diabetes mellitus with or without hypercholesterolemia (defined as taking statin&#xD;
             therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both hypertension and diabetes are suboptimally controlled at Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. SBP is ≥ 140 mm Hg (and his/her BP goal is &lt; 140/90 mm Hg).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A1C is ≥ 7% and ≤ 11% at Screening (A1C is above goal by ≥ 0.5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On a stable anti-hypertensive regimen (on current regimen for at least 30 days) with&#xD;
             at least 2 anti-hypertensive medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to manage the subject during the 12-week study with anti-hypertensive&#xD;
             medication(s) and dose forms (or same drug classes and comparable doses for Usual Care&#xD;
             subjects) used within the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently on metformin and/or glipizide for diabetes for at least the past 60 days&#xD;
             prior to Screening. Subjects can be managed on other noninsulin diabetes medicines&#xD;
             (including sulfonylureas other than glipizide) during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a Proteus test pill (IS used to test that the Proteus Patch is&#xD;
             correctly placed on the body and paired with the mobile device) detected as part of&#xD;
             onboarding on the Proteus device (during the Proteus Onboarding Visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the Investigator's opinion inadequate medication adherence is a potential factor in&#xD;
             the subject's uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 as subjects may be more likely to have secondary reasons for out of&#xD;
             control blood pressure (BP) and/or diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of skin sensitivity to adhesive medical tape or metals for subjects in the&#xD;
             Intervention Arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of acute or chronic dermatitis for subjects in the Intervention Arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that in the investigator's opinion could preclude safe participation in&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Secondary cause for hypertension (eg, renal impairment or renal artery stenosis) or&#xD;
             uncontrolled diabetes (eg, corticosteroid use).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mean SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg, if associated with evidence of&#xD;
             hypertensive emergency..&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or recent (within past year) treatment with insulin or other injectables for&#xD;
             diabetes.&#xD;
