      A phase I study to establish the highest safe dose that induces HPV16 E6-specific T-cell&#xD;
      responses, using the highly promising novel therapeutic vaccine concept named: Hespecta (HPV&#xD;
      E Six Peptide Conjugated To Amplivant®) to induce HPV16 E6-specific T-cell responses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been found to be associated with several types of premalignant&#xD;
      lesions and cancer. HPV16 is the far most common HPV type detected in these tumors and&#xD;
      premalignant lesions. HPV16 encodes the two tumor-specific oncoproteins E6 and E7. In most&#xD;
      humans the virus is cleared. However, in some individuals, infection results in an&#xD;
      uncontrolled persistent HPV16 infection that due to expression of the viral oncoproteins E6&#xD;
      and E7 may lead to the formation of malignancies. Moreover, these oncoproteins maintain the&#xD;
      malignant state of the transformed cells. The virus-specific interferon-γ (IFNγ)-producing&#xD;
      cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) helper T cells (Th1 cells) and cluster of differentiation&#xD;
      8 (CD8+) cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) are able to recognize peptides processed from the&#xD;
      highly immunogenic E6 and play a critical role in the elimination and/or control of the&#xD;
      virus. Studies in patients with HPV associated tumors showed that the spontaneous&#xD;
      HPV-specific T-cell responses, are weak and fail to sufficiently control tumor outgrowth.&#xD;
      Preexisting specific T-cell responses against E6 and E7 in patients with HPV related tumors&#xD;
      such are associated with better outcome after treatment. Since the HPV16-transformed tumor&#xD;
      cells constitutively express the two HPV16 encoded E6 and E7 oncoproteins, these viral&#xD;
      antigens are considered to be excellent targets for immunotherapeutic vaccine strategies&#xD;
      aiming at reinforcing the tumor-specific T-cell response. Previous vaccination studies showed&#xD;
      that the use of our first generation HPV16 synthetic long peptides vaccine (HPV16-SLP) was&#xD;
      safe and highly immunogenic in patients with HPV-induced ano-genital lesions. Vaccination of&#xD;
      patients with cervical cancer (CxCa) also resulted in the induction of HPV16-specific T-cell&#xD;
      responses but the nature and strength of the induced T cell responses was not sufficient for&#xD;
      the regression of these tumors. Specifically, it was concluded that the polarization of the T&#xD;
      cell response to Th1 (IFNγ-response) was not optimal and a much stronger CD8+ T cell response&#xD;
      was required for clinical efficacy. These results initiated the development of new HPV16&#xD;
      vaccination strategies that are able to polarize the induced Th1 response and obtain strong&#xD;
      CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity. One of these developments consists of conjugating two of the HPV16&#xD;
      E6 SLP to Amplivant® a synthetic Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 ligand. These two peptides cover&#xD;
      the most immunodominant regions of the overlapping HPV16-SLP set and contain both Th and CTL&#xD;
      epitopes. Peptide conjugated Amplivant® has been selected because it is acknowledged for its&#xD;
      capacity to strongly enhance antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DCs), enhance T-cell&#xD;
      priming and cause superior induction of effective anti-tumor CTL responses in mouse tumor&#xD;
      models, compared to a mixture of free TLR ligand and peptide. In preclinical murine studies,&#xD;
      Amplivant®-conjugated SLP showed 10 to 100 times higher bioactivity compared to unconjugated&#xD;
      SLP, in terms of induced immune responses. In addition, the quantity and quality of human&#xD;
      T-cell responses, and especially the HPV16-specific CD8+ T-cell response, in cancer patients&#xD;
      could be markedly enhanced by ex vivo stimulation with Amplivant®-conjugated SLPs.&#xD;
