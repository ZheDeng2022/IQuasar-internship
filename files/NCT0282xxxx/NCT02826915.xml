      Epilepsy in children is a major public health issue. It is the first neurological disease of&#xD;
      the child. The specific incidence of epilepsy rates were highest during the first year of&#xD;
      life, between 75,105 and 250,105 hab.an hab. year and remain high in the age group between 0&#xD;
      and 10 years. Epilepsies predictions are varied. They can be spontaneously benign, drug-,&#xD;
      chemically dependent or drug-resistant. These, refractory epilepsies, represent 20% of&#xD;
      epilepsy as a child and adolescent than adult is about 1200 children and 1200 adults Picardy.&#xD;
      The validation of non-invasive investigative tools is becoming a necessity in the management&#xD;
      of drug-resistant epilepsies especially when a surgical decision is envisaged. The aftermath&#xD;
      (motor, cognitive, sensory) appear to rule early; but they are sometimes limited to learning&#xD;
      deficits detected later in the school curriculum. The investigators know that defects in&#xD;
      neuronal electrical activity (eg critical discharges) induce a metabolic response and&#xD;
      conversely metabolic disturbances can cause abnormal electrical activity. It is therefore&#xD;
      important to have tools to better characterize the interactions between these two mechanisms&#xD;
      to better understand brain function in the brain during development and during pathological&#xD;
      situations. The investigators lack quantitative criteria regarding the impact of crises on&#xD;
      the metabolic activity and thus predictive criteria consequences of crises on brain function.&#xD;
      The deleterious hazard must be considered at all ages in both structures to causing seizures&#xD;
      than in those where the crisis spread. The functional characterization, electrical, metabolic&#xD;
      and anatomic pathology of these networks is necessary and contributes to a better&#xD;
      understanding of physiological and pathological brain function, and helps to define the most&#xD;
      appropriate treatment strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About childhood epilepsy, analysis of the EEG allows in 75% of cases to find predictive&#xD;
      patterns characteristic of becoming. However in 25% of cases, we lack predictive objective&#xD;
      criteria. This highlights the importance of developing analysis tools for more accurate and&#xD;
      efficient brain function and to improve the management and evaluation of the prognosis of&#xD;
      these children.&#xD;
