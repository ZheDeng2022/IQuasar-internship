  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended to compare expectant management and on presentation labor induction in&#xD;
      women with premature rupture of membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The means of labor induction and cervical ripening are either oxytocin or dinoprostone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expectant management in this obstetrical state means waiting 24 hours from the onset of&#xD;
      rupture of membranes and then commencing labor induction with either oxytocin or dinoprostone&#xD;
      depending on the patient's obstetrical history and cervical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' hypothesis is that active management will lead to a higher rate of vaginal&#xD;
      deliveries, a shorter interval between the time of rupture of membranes and the time of&#xD;
      delivery, a lower rate of cesarean sections and a better obstetric result for the mother and&#xD;
      the fetus/newborn.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the setting of premature rupture of membranes in term pregnancies, it is customary in&#xD;
      women who are not in active labor to wait for 24 hours before attempting to induce labor. The&#xD;
      means of labor induction used at our medical center are either intravenous oxytocin or&#xD;
      per-vaginal dinoprostone, depending on patient's obstetric history and cervical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that commencing induction of labor at presentation in these&#xD;
      women by either means of induction will lead to higher rates of vaginal delivery, shorter&#xD;
      intervals between the time of onset of rupture of membranes and the time of delivery and&#xD;
      lower rates of cesarean sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the study, upon signing informed consents, will be randomized to 4&#xD;
      groups-2 groups of expectant management in which labor induction will be commenced after 24&#xD;
      hours with either oxytocin or dinoprostone and 2 groups of active management in which labor&#xD;
      induction will be commenced at presentation with either oxytocin or dinoprostone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be followed from the time of presentation with rupture of membranes at&#xD;
      the delivery room and until the time of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further obstetric, clinical and demographic information will be acquired from the patient's&#xD;
      electronic medical file for analysis accuracy and sub-analysis.&#xD;
