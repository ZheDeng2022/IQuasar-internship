  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fragility, geriatric concept recent identification is defined by simple physical indicators.&#xD;
      The literature suggests that it is related to the risk of hospitalization, falls,&#xD;
      institutionalization and death. Some studies have shown a link with heart disease, including&#xD;
      heart failure. The link with the TIA (transient ischemic attack) has however never been&#xD;
      studied. A fortiori, the impact of the fragility of the risk of recurrent stroke after TIA is&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several questions need to be asked: Among older patients hospitalized for TIA, what&#xD;
      proportion of those completing the criteria of frailty? In this same population, is there a&#xD;
      correlation between fragility and scores ABCD2 score itself predictive of the risk of&#xD;
      subsequent ischemic stroke? In other words, fragile subjects who have a TIA Have a higher&#xD;
      risk of ischemic stroke (which could cause a strengthening of prevention measures)?&#xD;

      Hypotheses :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frailty is common among the elderly patient population who have a TIA. Compared to&#xD;
           control groups of literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with high fragility score ABCD2 also have a high score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a high score of fragility also have a significant number of vascular risk&#xD;
           factors (including atrial fibrillation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a high score of fragility also have an average length of stay (ALOS)&#xD;
           higher than the others. So underlying the question is: can we learn to better identify&#xD;
           patients who are going to need a bigger structure their output at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the feasibility of placing a fragile test in acute phase of AIT in USINV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the frequency of frailty among the population of elderly patients who have a&#xD;
           TIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare in AIT over 70 years those with fragile high score to those with low scores,&#xD;
           especially for ABCD2 score, vascular risk factors and the DMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statements parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
           o The fragility score:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Choice of fragility score: among the fragility of scores, the most used in international&#xD;
           literature is the score of Linda Fried. Moreover, the stress of the study is related to&#xD;
           the environment of the USINV (shortly, short DMS, often tired patients). It is therefore&#xD;
           important to use this study for a test only, but quick handover. The score Fried also&#xD;
           has the advantage (J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci 2001, 56 (3): M146-56) The first 4&#xD;
           items are simple clinical evaluation. The 5th (grip test) will be performed with a&#xD;
           device (single gauge measuring the fingers bending strength) loan from the geriatric&#xD;
           ward.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The TIA is defined pragmatically: any sudden deficit with blood systematization ≤ 1&#xD;
             hour. Among these &quot;TIA&quot;, we know that a subgroup may possibly have an MRI with&#xD;
             diffusion lesion, indicating a recent ischemic stroke. This subgroup of transient&#xD;
             accident is recognized as being at higher risk of recurrence. This criterion will be&#xD;
             taken into account in the data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  history of stroke with Rankin score of ≥ 2.&#xD;
