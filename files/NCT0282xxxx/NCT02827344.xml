  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy is probably, since the development of therapies targeting EGFR mutations or ALK&#xD;
      rearrangement, the most attractive therapeutic perspective in the management of metastatic&#xD;
      lung cancer. Among the compounds tested, the inhibitors of the immune checkpoint PROGRAMME&#xD;
      DEATH 1 / PROGRAMME DEATH LIGAND 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) have been tested in numerous clinical trials&#xD;
      with recently published positive results leading to the approval of one drug in the USA and&#xD;
      an expanded access program for two drugs in France. PROGRAMME DEATH LIGAND 1 (PD-L1)&#xD;
      expression by tumor cells is strongly associated with the response to such molecules so that&#xD;
      the participation in various clinical trials is currently reserved for patients expressing&#xD;
      this biomarker and therefore justifies a new invasive biopsy (bronchoscopic or CT-guided)&#xD;
      representing a considerable drag on the access to these treatments. Circulating tumor cells&#xD;
      (CTCs) isolated by Isolation by Size of Tumor Cells (ISET) offer a direct and non-invasive&#xD;
      access to the tumor. It has already been demonstrated that molecular characterization (EGFR,&#xD;
      ALK) on these blood samples is possible. We propose to demonstrate the feasibility of the&#xD;
      analysis PDL-1 expression in these cells by immunocytochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs) are immature myeloid cells that inhibit T cell&#xD;
      functions and thus promote tumor growth. These cells frequently express PD-L1. We propose to&#xD;
      test whether MDSCs level and its evolution during treatment with PD1 inhibitor is correlated&#xD;
      to the response to these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of the analysis of PD-L1&#xD;
      expression on CTC&#xD;
