      Brief Summary: This randomized clinical pilot will test the feasibility of having individuals&#xD;
      self-monitor for 12 weeks and based on what the participants record be given feedback&#xD;
      messages. The investigator will use this information to refine the questions and data&#xD;
      collection procedures for the larger study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into 3 groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  self-monitoring only&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  self-monitoring w/ feedback messages&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  self-monitoring w/feedback messages and group sessions Feedback messages will be&#xD;
           delivered up to 4 times per day using a different schedule. The group sessions will be&#xD;
           held in the 2nd, 4th and 8th week of the 12-week study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to complete questionnaires and 2 assessment visits at baseline&#xD;
      and 12 weeks.&#xD;

      Research Strategy. The investigator will randomize 45 overweight/obese adults to one of 3&#xD;
      groups: (1) Control (Con) - no FB, no Behavioral Lifestyle Program (BLP), (2) FB Only, no&#xD;
      BLP, and (3) FB+BLP. All subjects will use a smartphone to self-monitor diet and PA. The&#xD;
      subjects will download a feedback system onto the Android operating system smartphone that&#xD;
      was developed for this study called the SMARTER. The algorithm was developed by Dr. Lora&#xD;
      Burke of the University of Pittsburgh. All groups will attend a one-time how to self-monitor&#xD;
      using the smartphone session and receive education materials at baseline. The FB Only and&#xD;
      FB+BLP groups will receive up to 4 daily FB messages, based on progress in attaining target&#xD;
      behavior. The FB will be delivered on a variable ratio schedule and tailored to data in&#xD;
      subjects' recordings. FB+BLP participants will receive a face-to-face BLP intervention that&#xD;
      will include 3 group sessions over 12 weeks. Also to not confound the effect of the daily FB,&#xD;
      the interventionists will not provide feedback to the weekly diaries. Sample. The&#xD;
      investigator will recruit from the community 45 adults, over the age of 18. All participants&#xD;
      need to be randomized prior to the beginning of the 3 BLP sessions since the sessions are&#xD;
      conducted as a closed group. The randomization scheme will be implemented via a computerized&#xD;
      program (Visual Basic 6.0) using minimization method. The randomization will be overseen by a&#xD;
      statistician (Co-I: S Sereika). Each of the 3 conditions will be assigned a total of 15&#xD;
      subjects with randomization stratified by gender and ethnicity/race. Intervention. Those in&#xD;
      the Con and FB Only groups will receive a 1-hr session on provided calorie prescription for&#xD;
      weight loss and self-monitoring and associated education materials. Only those in FB+BLP will&#xD;
      receive a 3-session BLP for a healthful lifestyle and weight loss. The groups will meet in&#xD;
      the School of Nursing and will be led by a trained interventionist. Protocol for&#xD;
      Self-monitoring: All participants will be subscribed to LoseIt!, an online self-monitoring&#xD;
      service that can be accessed via the smartphone and computer. This will be used in place of&#xD;
      the traditional paper diary. This software permits self-monitoring of diet, PA, and weight;&#xD;
      it also provides feedback on up to 9 macronutrients based on a database of 60,000 foods.&#xD;
      Because of the investigator's ongoing working relationship with the developers of LoseIt!&#xD;
      program, the investigator will have access to LoseIt! Connect, a custom portal created by&#xD;
      LoseIt! for centralized user management. This permits the investigators to view participants'&#xD;
      entries and set custom controls on participants use, (e.g., disabling particpants' ability to&#xD;
      share data with outsiders). All participants will be encouraged to self-monitor diet and&#xD;
      self-report weight. Participants who do not have scales will be given one for the duration of&#xD;
      the study and be ask to return it at the completion of the study. Participants see the&#xD;
      nutrient value of each food and the calculated subtotals. The interventionists will have&#xD;
      access to the diaries so participants can contact a participant if there is any concern about&#xD;
      the reported eating behaviors. This is the same procedure used for the past 4 years in the&#xD;
      EMPOWER Study (IRB - PRO10100504). At the training session, participants will be advised on&#xD;
      how to change the privacy settings on Lose It!. General Information about Feedback Algorithm.&#xD;
      The FB algorithm programmed in the FB app will use real-time synced self- monitoring data to&#xD;
      send messages that are responsive to the participants' entries. The server will deliver a&#xD;
      message that will be displayed on the screen of the smartphones so the person does not need&#xD;
      to make extra clicks to view it. The FB messages will address one target behavior at a time,&#xD;
      e.g., self-monitoring or calorie intake. At the baseline education session for the FB Only&#xD;
      group or the first BLP session for FB+BLP, the individual will make a diary entry; the system&#xD;
      will send a FB message shortly thereafter to provide immediate reinforcement for&#xD;
      self-monitoring. Then the FB will be delivered on the incremental 1-4 x/d schedule,&#xD;
      contingent on progress in self-monitoring and in attaining the person's daily calorie goal.&#xD;
      Rules will be applied to the delivery of messages to FB Only and FB+BLP, e.g., messages will&#xD;
      be delivered between the hours set by the participants on particpants phone, e.g., 8 AM and&#xD;
      9:30 PM, and content will be guided by the parameters built into the algorithm. In the&#xD;
      implementation of the proposed FB intervention, the investigators will exercise caution and&#xD;
      sensitivity regarding participants' reception of the messages. In the SMART Trial, the&#xD;
      messages were motivating and reinforcing, not noting deficiencies in behavior or progress not&#xD;
      made; however, the messages will provide guidance for corrective action when the person is&#xD;
      not following the behavior that would be consistent with the pre-established goals. Space&#xD;
      does not permit extensive message samples but examples might be as follows. Excellent job on&#xD;
      increasing fruits in your diet. OR Super job staying within the fat limits. Go easy on high&#xD;
      fat foods tonight; consider having a big salad with nonfat dressing. Protocol for the&#xD;
      Behavioral Lifestyle Program (BLP) intervention: Group Sessions: Participants will receive&#xD;
      nutritional and behavioral counseling; practical hands-on experiences to develop skills to&#xD;
      implement a healthy lifestyle (e.g., practice mindful eating, portion size, modify foods or&#xD;
      meals to reduce fat content) in three 1 hour group sessions. The groups will meet evenings&#xD;
      and will be led by the multidisciplinary team (behavioral scientists, nutritionists that has&#xD;
      been trained by the PI and Co-I (Burke and Ewing). The group sessions will be held in the&#xD;
      2nd, 4th and 8th week of the 12-week study. Behavior Goals: Calorie: The calorie goal will be&#xD;
      calculated from the individual's baseline body weight (1200 - 1800 kcal for &lt;250 lbs or 1800&#xD;
      to 2000 kcal for &gt;250 lbs). Calorie goals can be adjusted if necessary for participants&#xD;
      struggling to meet the goa;s or for maintenance. Fat: Fat gram goals will 40 - 60 grams per&#xD;
      day depending on calorie goal. Screening Measures - administered only at baseline.&#xD;
      Sociodemographic Form will be used to collect data on individual characteristics, e.g.,&#xD;
      ethnicity, marital status. Rapid Eating Assessment for Patients (REAP) will be used to assess&#xD;
      current diet to inform the goals for lifestyle improvement. It has 31 items that ask about&#xD;
      weight, PA and sedentary habits, variety in diet, excess food intake. Participants Online&#xD;
      Screening Questionnaire will be used to assess Qualtric systems as a screening tool. It will&#xD;
      be given with the other screening questionnaires at their Baseline Assessment. Outcome or&#xD;
      Dependent Measures. Unless otherwise noted, all measures will be conducted at 0 and 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Trained staff will perform these in the Clinical Research Suite in the School of Nursing.&#xD;
      Participants will be compensated for completing the 12-week assessment. BMI- Weight -&#xD;
      measured with the Tanita Scale and Body Fat Analyzer with subjects in light clothing standing&#xD;
      bare foot on the scale's footpads. Height (centimeters) measured with stadiometer for BMI&#xD;
      (kg/m2) calculation. Cardiometabolic risk factors Blood pressure (BP). BP assessment will&#xD;
      follow the standard AHA guidelines and measured using an Omron BP Monitor with ComFit cuff&#xD;
      with the subject in a sitting position after at least a 5-min rest. Whole body composition.&#xD;
      To describe % fat mass, we will measure body composition (fat mass, % fat, fat-free mass) by&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance analysis on the Tanita Scale and Body Fat Analyzer.120 Waist&#xD;
      circumference will be measured twice with a Gullick II measuring tape. If the two values are&#xD;
      within 2 cm of each other, a mean is calculated; if not, measurements are taken again until&#xD;
      they are within 2 cm. Psychosocial surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight Efficacy Lifestyle (WEL) is a 20-item scale used to assess level of confidence to&#xD;
      resist eating in varied situations or emotional states. It has established psychometric&#xD;
      properties 135 and takes 5 min to complete. This scale has added explanatory value in weight&#xD;
      loss behavior in our previous studies. The Newest Vital Sign, a brief test of literacy&#xD;
      applied to reading a food label. At the completion of study, the groups that were not&#xD;
      randomized into the group sessions will receive the session material via email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group that did not receive feedback messages will be given the option of receiving&#xD;
      messages for 12 weeks. If the participant chooses to have the feedback messages, it will be&#xD;
      loaded on the participant's phones at the 12 weeks assessment.&#xD;
