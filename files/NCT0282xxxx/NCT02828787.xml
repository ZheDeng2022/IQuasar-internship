      The main objective of this study is to identify by functional and structural MRI which are&#xD;
      the brain areas activated in various pruritic situations to deduct a model describing the&#xD;
      different causes of pruritus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are going to compare two chronic pruritus conditions (histaminergic&#xD;
      urticaria and non histaminergic: psoriasis) to a healthy control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to specify a classification index from the&#xD;
      physiological results obtained by brain imaging to differentiate multiple types of pruritus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Particularly invalidating in some cases, pruritus is defined as an unpleasant sensation that&#xD;
      causes the need to scratch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiologically, it is a common disorder as a third of the population feels in a given&#xD;
      week. Treatment is difficult, especially as the pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly&#xD;
      understood, particularly in the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific pathways, or at least selective of the pruritus of transmission have been&#xD;
      identified. From the skin to the brain, two ways exist: a histaminergic pathway (classical),&#xD;
      and a non-histaminergic pathway (related to the activation of PAR-2 receptors by serine&#xD;
      proteases). If urticaria belongs to the first track, the respective share of each channel is&#xD;
      unknown to other causes of pruritus. The pruriceptors, located in the skin, transmit&#xD;
      information by specific fibers at the spinal cord, which then project through the lateral&#xD;
      spinothalamic tract to the thalamus. Then at midbrain and cortex, a vast network involving&#xD;
      sensorial areas, motor and emotional areas was identified by functional neuroimaging, with&#xD;
      activation zones which may be different depending on two channels (with overlapping zones ).&#xD;
      The contribution to the perception of pruritus of these brain regions is the focus of current&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A promising non-invasive method to study the pruritus channels with neuroimaging is to use&#xD;
      the phenomenon of &quot;contagious pruritus': seeing other people scratching, itching and&#xD;
      sometimes scratching is induced in the observer, and the activated brain network is similar&#xD;
      to that which is activated by pruritus usually. This phenomenon is even more important in&#xD;
      subjects with atopic dermatitis than in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators plan to characterize pruritus central pathways in patients&#xD;
      with different types of chronic pruritus compared to healthy subjects, particularly regarding&#xD;
      the respective contributions of histaminergic pathways (pathway involved in pruritus of&#xD;
      hives) and &quot;PAR-2-ergic&quot; (pathway involved in the itch of psoriasis).&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is to highlight fMRI brain areas activated during a mentally induced pruritus in 3 different populations: healthy subjects (no pre-existing pruritus), patients with chronic urticaria (pruritus related to histaminergic pathway), and psoriasis patients (activation pathway pruritus probably PAR2-ergic but to be confirmed by the study).</description>

    <description>The study will take place in two phases. The first phase consists of a meeting of inclusion. During this phase, the principal investigator of the study will verify the inclusion criteria for patients using a questionnaire and an interview. Then, the effects of video on each person will be tested to verify that they well induce itch and measure it using visual analogue scales. This phase will also test the benefit of the relief by scraping and cold.&#xD;
The second phase will be carried out only if the mental induction of pruritus has been possible in the first session. It involves acquiring the corresponding physiological signals fMRI. It will also be achieved during this phase an anatomical image of the brain of each participant and an image in DTI.&#xD;
The phases will be carried out in this order in each participant. They will be separated at least one night.</description>
