  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed research project is to assess the safety (dose limiting toxicity,&#xD;
      DLT) of the combination of pembrolizumab and high-dose stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)&#xD;
      in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. Both the SBRT dose and pembrolizumab dose will&#xD;
      be fixed, but the timing of the combination will be varied. Secondary objectives include&#xD;
      response rates, local control, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
      Exploratory endpoints include immunologic responses and response rates in PD-L1- TIL- tumors.&#xD;
      The combination sequence with the most promising response rates and the best safety profile&#xD;
      will be selected to continue in a Phase II trial.&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
