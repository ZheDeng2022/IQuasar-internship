  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experience of face and hand composite tissue transplantations reported in the&#xD;
      international community have mainly concerned trauma patients. Feasibility and individual&#xD;
      benefit have been demonstrated for these indications, in properly selected patients. The&#xD;
      first laryngeal transplantation also concerned a case of post-traumatic reconstruction. A&#xD;
      certain number of patients, who have suffered direct (extended period of intubation during a&#xD;
      stay in the ICU, road traffic accident etc.) or indirect trauma (thermal or chemical burns)&#xD;
      to the larynx, present irreversible trauma or injury to the larynx in which conventional&#xD;
      treatments are unable to restore laryngeal function. These patients find themselves severely&#xD;
      disabled, with a significant reduction in their quality of life. They suffer from&#xD;
      stigmatization which leads to social isolation (professional and personal). In some&#xD;
      circumstances, providing healthy tissue and anatomical or functional components (cartilage,&#xD;
      muscle, nerves, blood vessels) by means of an allogeneic laryngeal transplantation, is the&#xD;
      only way of allowing patients, whose quality of life has been seriously affected, to speak,&#xD;
      breath and swallow normally. The extremely promising results from other international teams&#xD;
      in this area have encouraged the investigators to present this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specificities of the protocol compared to previous transplantations carried out by other&#xD;
      teams are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The technique for nerve re-innervation which should make it possible to decannulate all&#xD;
           patients and improve functional outcomes in the graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A dual therapy immunosuppressive regimen will be used, if the patient's clinical and&#xD;
           biological status permits, which can be adjusted according to the type of tissue&#xD;
           grafted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It might be thought that the need for immunosuppressive therapy means the indications will&#xD;
      remain rare, representing an incidence of less than five patients a year in France. However,&#xD;
      the interest of this research project does not reside in the number of patients concerned but&#xD;
      rather the total lack of any existing therapeutic solution. Conducting a case series will&#xD;
      help determine whether, under certain conditions, laryngeal transplantation can improve the&#xD;
      management of patients for whom the usual reconstructive surgery options are unsatisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is intended to provide a descriptive analysis of a case series of three laryngeal&#xD;
      transplantations before and after comparisons, each patient serving as their own control.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients presenting with the permanent loss of laryngeal functions. Loss of laryngeal&#xD;
             function is considered when a patient is permanently tracheotomized, is mutic and&#xD;
             presented failure for each of the three conventional treatment. Conventional treatment&#xD;
             lines are organized in the following manner firstly laser, then prosthesis and lastly&#xD;
             surgery) Diet may be normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adults aged between 18 to 60 years;&#xD;
