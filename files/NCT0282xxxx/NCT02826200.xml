  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RETORIC study is a prospective cohort study with a primary aim to assess the incidence&#xD;
      and independent predictors of reduced leaflet motion and valve thrombosis after TAVI&#xD;
      procedure using multimodality imaging strategy comprising cardiac CT, transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography (TEE) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). As a secondary aim we will&#xD;
      assess the incidence of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) in patients with reduced&#xD;
      leaflet motion and/or thrombosis when compared with those with normal leaflet function. In&#xD;
      addition we will randomize patients with reduced leaflet motion and/or valve thrombosis to&#xD;
      single antiplatelet therapy plus oral anticoagulation therapy versus standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the nested randomized trial will be the presence of reduced leaflet&#xD;
      motion and/or valve thrombosis after 4 months, the secondary outcome is the presence of&#xD;
      ischemic changes in brain demonstrated by MRI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an established treatment for severe aortic&#xD;
      stenosis in patients non-eligible for surgical aortic valve replacement. Prosthetic valve&#xD;
      thrombosis is defined as a thrombus that is attached to any part of the prosthesis, and is&#xD;
      not caused by infection. This may result in valve dysfunction and/or thromboembolisation.&#xD;
      Most patients with prosthetic valve thrombosis are asymptomatic, whereas some patients&#xD;
      present with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Obstructive prosthetic valve&#xD;
      thrombosis may lead to overt congestive heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no strict guideline recommendation regarding therapeutic anticoagulation&#xD;
      after TAVI. Per institutional protocol dual antiplatelet therapy is used during the first 6&#xD;
      months after THV implantation and single antiplatelet therapy is used after after 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosing transcatheter heart valve (THV) thrombosis is of clinical importance even in&#xD;
      asymptomatic patients, because it may lead to thromboembolism and can cause THV dysfunction.&#xD;
      Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment may prevent future TIA or stroke and THV&#xD;
      dysfunction. Current standard clinical practice and guidelines are inconsistent regarding the&#xD;
      antithrombotic treatment of patients who underwent TAVI procedure. Accordingly, determining&#xD;
      the true incidence and potential causative factors of THV thrombosis is of great importance&#xD;
      and would facilitate further investigations and large clinical trials in order to develop&#xD;
      optimal antithrombotic treatment of patients following TAVI procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RETORIC study is a prospective cohort study with a primary aim to assess the incidence&#xD;
      and independent predictors of reduced leaflet motion and valve thrombosis after TAVI&#xD;
      procedure using multimodality imaging strategy comprising cardiac CT, transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography (TEE) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). As a secondary aim we will&#xD;
      assess the incidence of stroke and TIA in those with reduced leaflet motion and thrombosis&#xD;
      when compared with those with normal leaflet function. In addition we will randomise patients&#xD;
      with reduced leaflet motion to unchanged standard therapy versus single antiplatelet plus&#xD;
      oral anticoagulation therapy. The primary outcome of this nested randomized trial will be the&#xD;
      presence of novel ischemic lesions in brain demonstrated by MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings of the RETORIC study may alter current post-TAVI diagnostic work up and treatment&#xD;
      algorithm regarding anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total 200 patients who underwent or are undergoing TAVI procedure will be included into&#xD;
      the RETORIC study. The institutional standard of care post-TAVI antithrombotic medication&#xD;
      consists of six months dual antiplatelet treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin followed by&#xD;
      lifelong aspirin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the TAVI procedure number at our institution is approximately 80 patients/year.&#xD;
      Therefore, to reach our enrolment goal of 200 patients, subjects will be enrolled from two&#xD;
      cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A: Patients who underwent TAVI procedure in the past will be selected from the&#xD;
      Semmelweis TAVI Registry. For this cohort a median TAVI-to-CT time will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B: Patients undergoing TAVI procedure will be enrolled consecutively. In this group&#xD;
      the imaging will be performed 3 months after the prosthesis implantation in every patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four-dimensional cardiac CT, TTE and brain MRI data will be obtained in all patients. In case&#xD;
      the cardiac CT identifies reduced leaflet motion or THV thrombosis TEE exam will be performed&#xD;
      even in asymptomatic patients and patients will enter the randomized control trial. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1, standard therapy plus oral anticoagulant therapy; Group 2, standard therapy. After 4&#xD;
      months patients will undergo four-dimensional cardiac CT, TTE and brain MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the randomized trial will be the presence of reduced leaflet&#xD;
      motion/valve thrombosis, secondary outcome will be the presence of ischemic lesions on brain&#xD;
      MRI images.&#xD;
