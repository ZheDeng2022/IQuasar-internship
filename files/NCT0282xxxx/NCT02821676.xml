      Regional Anesthesia is a procedure in which numbing medication is injected around nerves that&#xD;
      transmit pain from areas involved in a surgery. The objective is to block the nerves so a&#xD;
      patient does not feel pain after surgery. Regional nerve blocks offer many advantages over&#xD;
      traditional anesthetic techniques, including faster recovery time, fewer side effects and a&#xD;
      dramatic reduction in post-surgical pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of regional anesthesia in breast reconstructive surgery, such as the latissimus dorsi&#xD;
      flap, has led to major improvements in patient care. Today, the most common regional&#xD;
      anesthetic used in latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction is the intercostal nerve block, where&#xD;
      numbing medication is injected around the nerves supplying the chest wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While intercostal nerve blocks have been used successfully in breast surgery, they do not&#xD;
      provide a complete nerve block to the chest wall, as there are some nerves that are&#xD;
      unaccounted for in the block which can contribute to a patients pain after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mixed pectoral one / serratus plane block (PECI/SPB) block is another regional nerve&#xD;
      block that has been successfully used by anesthesiologists at The Ottawa Hospital and offers&#xD;
      a more complete pain blockade than the intercostal nerve block, as it includes more nerves&#xD;
      that supply the breast. In addition to this, the intercostal nerve block is a so-called&#xD;
      &quot;blind-technique&quot; compared to the PECI/SPB block, which is more accurately guided by&#xD;
      ultrasound. Blind techniques are associated with higher failure rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the intercostal nerve block and the PECI/SPB nerve block have been used successfully at&#xD;
      the Ottawa Hospital. In this study, the investigators propose a prospective, double blinded,&#xD;
      randomized controlled, head to head comparison of the PECI/SPB and intercostal nerve block to&#xD;
      determine which block is associated with the best pain blockade and patient satisfaction in&#xD;
      lattissimus dorsi flap surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent literature has unequivocally demonstrated that postoperative pain remains&#xD;
      under-treated in hospitals. While breast surgery remains one of the most common surgeries&#xD;
      performed in hospitals today, it has been shown that 40% of women still experience meaningful&#xD;
      pain postoperatively. It is well known that poor pain control is not only associated with&#xD;
      slower recovery, longer admission in hospital and poor patient satisfaction but it also can&#xD;
      lead to the development of chronic post surgical pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, regional nerve blocks have emerged as a promising adjunct to standard&#xD;
      postoperative analgesic ladder protocols. The main advantage of regional anesthesia is the&#xD;
      reduction of postoperative pain while limiting the amount of oral and intravenous narcotic&#xD;
      use. The reduction of postoperative narcotic use is advantageous for the patient and&#xD;
      caregiver alike as it reduces common side effects associated with such medications, such as&#xD;
      drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, upset stomach and dizziness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anesthesia in breast reconstruction surgery commonly include thoracic epidurals,&#xD;
      intercostal nerve blocks and paravertebal nerve blocks. To date, there remains no standard of&#xD;
      care for perioperative pain management and it is usually left to the discretion of the&#xD;
      surgeon and anesthesiologist involved to decide which pain blockade is preferable on a case&#xD;
      by case basis. While paravertebral and intercostal nerve blocks have shown promising results,&#xD;
      they do not provide a complete sensory block to the anterior chest wall, as innervation is&#xD;
      supplied not only from the thoracic spinal nerves but also via medial and lateral pectoral&#xD;
      nerves off the brachial plexus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pectoral nerve block is a novel interfascial block placed into the plane between&#xD;
      pectoralis major and minor muscles and is particularly useful in reconstructive breast&#xD;
      surgery involving subpectoral prosthesis. It has been associated with minimal analgesia&#xD;
      postoperatively and is thought to be particularly useful in the daycare setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of the knowledge of the investigators, the utility of the pectoral nerve block in&#xD;
      pedicled Latissimus Dorsi breast reconstruction has not been investigated. A mixed PEC I/&#xD;
      Serratus Plane Block provides analgesia to the lateral and medial pectoral nerves, lateral&#xD;
      and anterior branches of the T2-T4 spinal nerves, long thoracic nerve and thoracodorsal&#xD;
      nerve, theoretically offering a more comprehensive block than the midaxillary intercostal&#xD;
      block and with no additional morbidity to the patient. Furthermore, the intercostal nerve&#xD;
      block is a blind technique that may be associated with higher failure rates compared to the&#xD;
      more precise, ultrasound guided, PECI/SPB block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators plan to systematically investigate these two blocks in&#xD;
      latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction in order to document optimal postoperative pain&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
