  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Labor pain is complex to understand and challenging to define because of the interaction of&#xD;
      multiple maternal and fetal factors. Poorly controlled acute post-procedural pain may result&#xD;
      in harmful physiological and psychological consequences for both mother and baby. It is&#xD;
      therefore important to understand the prelabor factors that may affect the labour pain to&#xD;
      facilitate the intrapartum pain management. The goal of this prospective observational study&#xD;
      is to verify if expectations regarding pain experience translate to actual pain outcomes for&#xD;
      women who are undergoing induction of labor.&#xD;

      A prospective observational cohort study. 100 parturients having induction of labor that&#xD;
      match inclusion criteria will be asked to participate. After written informed consent, vital&#xD;
      signs and patient demographics will be obtained and recorded. A 3 question survey will be&#xD;
      given. Patients will be asked to rate, using a 0-10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), their&#xD;
      anxiety level (&quot;On a scale of 0-10 cm, with 0 being not anxious at all through 10 being&#xD;
      extremely anxious, how anxious are you about your upcoming labor and delivery?&quot;), their&#xD;
      anticipated pain (&quot;On a scale of 0-10, with 0 being no pain at all and 10 being pain as bad&#xD;
      as you can imagine, how much pain do you anticipate experiencing during your upcoming labor&#xD;
      and delivery?&quot;), and using a categorical scale, to rate their anticipated epidural analgesic&#xD;
      need (&quot;On a scale of 0-5, with 0 being none at all, 1 being much less than average, 2 being&#xD;
      less than average, 3 being average, 4 being more than average, and 5 being much more than&#xD;
      average, how much epidural pain medication do you anticipate needing during your upcoming&#xD;
      labor and delivery?&quot;). Then 24 hours after delivery, patient VAS scores will be recorded,&#xD;
      number of boluses, total number of hours of labor, patient comfort level and satisfaction&#xD;
