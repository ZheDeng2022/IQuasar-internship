  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nalmefene is the first drug to obtain Marketing Authorisation in France for reduction of&#xD;
      alcohol consumption. It appears to be significantly more effective in the group of heavy&#xD;
      drinkers, while the mean alcohol consumption in studies conducted in cirrhotic patients is&#xD;
      greater than 120 g/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No data are available concerning nalmefene in alcohol-dependent patients with alcoholic&#xD;
      cirrhosis. However, nalmefene could represent an attractive alternative to reduce heavy&#xD;
      drinking in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, with potential improvement of liver function.&#xD;
      No comparator is available for nalmefene, as all other molecules require abstinence prior to&#xD;
      starting treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Drug : 'Nalmefene (Selincro®) 18 mg tablet is a white, oval, biconvex, 6.0 x 8.75 mm film-coated tablet engraved with &quot;S&quot; on one side. It contains 18.06 mg nalmefene (in the form of hydrochloride dihydrate).&#xD;
Nalmefene must be taken as-needed: on each day the patient perceives a risk of drinking alcohol, one tablet should be taken, preferably 1-2 hours prior to the anticipated time of drinking. If the patient has started drinking alcohol without taking nalmefene, the patient should take one tablet as soon as possible.&#xD;
The maximum dose of nalmefene is one tablet per day. Nalmefene can be taken with or without food.</description>
