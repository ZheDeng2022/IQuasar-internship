      Title: Collection of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) from Healthy People for the&#xD;
      Expansion of T Cells for Adoptive Cell Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      New therapies are being developed that use a person s own immune system to fight tumors. Some&#xD;
      of the tumors being studied include cancers caused by viruses. Researchers want to use the&#xD;
      healthy cells of volunteers to perform research studies. To do this, they are collecting&#xD;
      lymphocytes through leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect healthy cells from volunteers for research studies for new cancer therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 18 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a standard donor questionnaire. It asks about their health&#xD;
      and past medical problems. It also asks about risky behaviors that could increase their&#xD;
      exposure to viruses or bacteria that could be transmitted through a transfusion. Participants&#xD;
      will give a blood sample to make sure they are able to donate. They will have a physical&#xD;
      exam. A finger stick test will check their hemoglobin, or red blood cell, level. They might&#xD;
      give a urine sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo apheresis. For this, a needle is placed in a vein in each of their&#xD;
      arms. Their blood is taken from one arm. A machine separates the white cells from the red&#xD;
      cells and plasma by a spinning process. The white cells are removed and directed into a&#xD;
      plastic bag. The red cells and plasma are returned through the needle in the other arm. The&#xD;
      entire procedure takes 4 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may donate every 21 days in this protocol if they choose to.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adoptive T cell therapies are being used to treat patients with cancer and hematological&#xD;
           malignancies. Some of these therapies require that the patients T cells be expanded over&#xD;
           100-fold.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This cell expansion can be accomplished by culturing autologous T cells with peripheral&#xD;
           blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from healthy subjects. This process is known&#xD;
           as the Rapid Expansion Protocol (REP) and makes use of pooled irradiated&#xD;
&#xD;
      PBMCs from healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide a mechanism for the collection of PBMCs from healthy subjects to use for the&#xD;
           expansion of autologous T cells from patients with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve and develop new methods to isolate PBMCs and to expand T cells for adoptive&#xD;
           cellular therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects must be greater than or equal to 18 years old and able to provide informed&#xD;
           consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects must have adequate clinical parameters (all of the following):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Afebrile (temperature less than or equal to 37.5 degree C)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 180 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 100 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Weight greater than or equal to 110 lbs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Heart rate between 50-100 beats/minute&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adequate bilateral antecubital venous access for a 2 arm apheresis procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Females of child-bearing potential should not be pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This protocol will provide a mechanism for banking frozen PBMCs that can be used for the&#xD;
           expansion of clinical T cell therapies and for developing new expansion procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The PBMCs will be collected in the Dowling Apheresis Clinic and processed in the Cell&#xD;
           Processing Section (CPS) Laboratory both of which are located in the Department of&#xD;
           Transfusion Medicine (DTM), Clinical Center following their established procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the PBMCs are collected and processed, they will be cryopreserved. When needed,&#xD;
           they will be thawed in the Cell Processing Laboratory, irradiated, pooled and used for&#xD;
           the expansion of patient T cells over 2 to 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 500 subjects for PBMC collection will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
