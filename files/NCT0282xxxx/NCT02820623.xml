      The objective is to compare the accuracy, costs, and cost-effectiveness of three fidelity&#xD;
      measurement methods to assess fidelity to cognitive-behavioral therapy for youth. The&#xD;
      investigators will randomize 135 therapists, implementing cognitive-behavioral therapy, to 3&#xD;
      conditions: self-report, chart stimulated recall, and behavioral rehearsal (N = 45 for each&#xD;
      group). To calculate the outcomes of interest, each condition will be compared to the&#xD;
      gold-standard fidelity measurement method, direct observation.&#xD;

      To achieve the primary objective, the investigators plan to (1) identify the most accurate&#xD;
      fidelity measurement method; (2) estimate the economic costs and cost-effectiveness of the&#xD;
      fidelity measurement methods; and (3) compare stakeholders' motivation to use each method, as&#xD;
      well as identify their perceived barriers and facilitators to use of each method. This study&#xD;
      will have a significant positive impact in two ways. First, it will validate fidelity&#xD;
      measurement methods that can be used for research. Second, it will produce tools that can be&#xD;
      used by community mental health clinics to monitor therapist fidelity, an indicator of&#xD;
      therapy quality.&#xD;

    <description>Therapists randomized to this condition will complete a brief self-report measure, the Therapy Process Observational Coding System for Child Psychotherapy Strategies Scale-Self Report version (TPOCS-SR) for each of the recorded clinical encounters with enrolled youth. The TPOCS-SR will be a self-report version of the Therapy Process Observational Coding System for Child Psychotherapy-Strategies Scale (TPOCS-S) and will be created in collaboration with the instrument developer (McLeod). In this condition, the investigators will (a) provide an operational definition for each item on the TPOCS-SR (e.g., cognitive education: teaches client the cognitive model (e.g., thoughts influence behavior)/identifies how the cognitive model applies to a specific aspects of the client's life), and (b) provide therapists with a 30-minute training session that includes sample vignettes of particular behaviors and information about how those vignettes should be rated.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Chart Stimulated Recall</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Therapists randomized to this condition will be asked to bring the charts of three enrolled youth to the chart-stimulated recall interview. A trained interviewer will ask the therapists how well they recall the encounter (rating of memory quality) followed by an open-ended question (&quot;Talk me through your last session with your client. Tell me what you did.&quot;). While the therapists are speaking, the interviewer will note any elements that represent a prescribed CBT strategy. The interviewer will go through a list of cognitive-behavioral strategies based upon the TPOCS-S and probe to determine if the therapists completed any of the strategies. Follow-up questions will be used to explore to what degree an element was used and how skillfully and responsively the strategies were used.</description>

    <description>Therapists randomized to this condition will be asked to engage in role-plays demonstrating the CBT strategies used with the three enrolled youth. The investigators will provide therapists with a list of the TPOCS-S CBT strategies and ask them to identify the CBT strategies used in their recorded encounter. The investigators will randomly select one of the strategies they report for each role-play. The investigators will then tell them, &quot;Please role-play how you used this strategy in session with your client, with the trained actor in front of you.&quot; Later, an independent rater will rate therapists' adherence and skill based on established scoring criteria.</description>
