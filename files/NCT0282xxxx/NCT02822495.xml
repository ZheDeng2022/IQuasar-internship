  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this protocol is to provide expanded access to tabelecleucel to&#xD;
      participants with Epstein-Barr virus-associated diseases and malignancies for whom there are&#xD;
      no other appropriate therapeutic options, and who are not eligible to enroll in clinical&#xD;
      studies designed to support the development and registration of tabelecleucel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants for whom there are no other appropriate therapeutic options and who are not&#xD;
      eligible to enroll in other tabelecleucel clinical studies, may be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
      After the screening period, participants will receive intravenous infusions of tabelecleucel&#xD;
      (1.6 to 2 × 10^6cells/kg) on Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15 of every 35-day cycle. Clinical&#xD;
      assessment of disease response is recommended approximately 15 days after the last dose of&#xD;
      tabelecleucel to assess the need for additional treatment. The end of expanded access&#xD;
      protocol (EAP) visit should be performed at 30 days after the last dose of tabelecleucel.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any of the following diagnoses of EBV+ malignancies or disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. EBV+ PTLD following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. EBV+ PTLD following solid organ transplant (SOT)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Persistent EBV viremia and known or suspected immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. EBV+ LPD that has developed in the setting of an AID&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. EBV+ LPD that has developed in the setting of a known or suspected PID&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. EBV+ LMS&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. EBV+ NPC&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The evidence of EBV positivity&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Relapsed or refractory disease, defined as failure to achieve response (ie, complete&#xD;
             response or partial response) or recurrent disease following first line therapy, ie,&#xD;
             systemic therapy for EBV-related malignancy or viremia for which there are no&#xD;
             appropriate therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Not eligible for any other Atara clinical development study&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For participants developing PTLD following allogeneic HCT for acute leukemia, the&#xD;
             underlying acute leukemia must be in morphologic remission&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Adequate organ function per the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 500/μL, with or without cytokine support&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Platelet count &gt;= 20,000/μL, with or without transfusion support&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participant or participant's representative is willing and able to provide written&#xD;
             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma, classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, or any T-cell&#xD;
             lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior treatment with any investigational product within 4 weeks of first treatment&#xD;
             with tabelecleucel, or within 5 half-lives from the most recent dose to first&#xD;
             treatment with tabelecleucel&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ongoing need for methotrexate or extracorporeal photopheresis; steroid doses &gt; 1&#xD;
             mg/kg/day of prednisone (or equivalent)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Need for vasopressor or ventilatory support, unless deemed to be caused by the&#xD;
             EBV-driven process that tabelecleucel is intended to treat&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Antithymocyte globulin, alemtuzumab, or similar anti-T-cell antibody therapy, or&#xD;
             T-cell immunotherapy (donor lymphocyte infusion, other cytotoxic T lymphocytes [CTLs])&#xD;
