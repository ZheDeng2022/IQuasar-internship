             classifier;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only the following patients may be referred for BRCA1-like testing: all patients that&#xD;

             primary breast cancer patients with a histological grade III breast cancer; Breast&#xD;
             cancer patients carrying a BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 germ line mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pretreatment containing an anthracycline and/or taxane in the (neo-)adjuvant or&#xD;
             metastatic setting received, or if not, then discussed with the patient whether it is&#xD;
             justified to forego these treatments;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Maximum of one prior line of chemotherapy for advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years;&#xD;

             antitumor activity;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable or evaluable disease according to RECIST 1.1 criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minimal acceptable safety laboratory values&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ANC of ≥ 1.5 x 109 /L&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL (6.21mmol/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hepatic function as defined by total serum bilirubin ≤ 1. 5 x ULN (except&#xD;
                  elevated bilirubin due to Gilbert's disease or a similar syndrome involving slow&#xD;
                  conjugation of bilirubin), ASAT and ALAT &lt; 2.5 x ULN or &lt;5 x ULN in case of liver&#xD;
                  metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal function as defined by serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 50&#xD;
             mL/min (by Cockcroft-Gault formula);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative pregnancy test (urine/serum) for female patients with childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any treatment with investigational drugs within 28 days prior to receiving the first&#xD;
             dose of investigational treatment; or within 21 days for standard chemotherapy; or&#xD;

             platinum compounds or high dose alkylating agents with autologous stem cell rescue,&#xD;

             epigenetic modifications, or as yet unknown mechanisms. Platinum-sensitive or&#xD;
             PARP1-inhibitor-sensitive patients who stopped for reasons other than progression are&#xD;
             eligible;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received high-dose alkylating agents with autologous stem cell rescue in&#xD;

             abstinence);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiotherapy within the last four weeks prior to receiving the first dose of&#xD;
             investigational treatment; except 1x8 Gray for pain palliation then a seven days&#xD;
             interval should be maintained;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have any known history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or other&#xD;
             cytogenetic abnormality associated with MDS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have known persistent (&gt; 4 weeks) ≥ Grade 2 toxicity from prior&#xD;
             cancer therapy (except for alopecia gr 2).&#xD;

             chemotherapy regimen&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Recent myocardial infarction (&lt; six months) or unstable angina;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. If adequately treated with&#xD;
             resection and/or irradiation and patients are at least four weeks completely free of&#xD;
             symptoms of these metastases and without medication related to these metastases&#xD;
             (steroids are allowed) patients could be eligible if all other in- and exclusion&#xD;
             criteria are obeyed;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical condition not yet specified above that is considered to possibly, probably&#xD;
             or definitely interfere with study procedures, including adequate follow-up and&#xD;
             compliance and/or would jeopardize safe treatment.&#xD;
