    <textblock>
      Motherhood Our Lady of Good Help is from the 2006 merger of three hospitals, St. Joseph, Our&#xD;
      Lady of Good Help and Saint-Michel. She was transferred to a new building in the heart of&#xD;
      Paris Saint-Joseph Hospital Group website in March 2011. The premises of the birth room are&#xD;
      spacious and nice. All delivery rooms are supposed to welcome the mother and child when the&#xD;
      birth goes smoothly. There is a resuscitation room (called &quot;Nursery&quot;) for newborns requiring&#xD;
      medical care. But since the installation in the new building, the investigators had the&#xD;
      impression that a number of children born without pathology futures and with good adaptation&#xD;
      at birth passed through this room for no apparent medical reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wanted to make an inventory of home practice healthy newborns in our&#xD;
      maternity, evaluate the reasons for a possible separation and appreciate the feelings of&#xD;
      mothers cope with this separation.&#xD;

      Objective of the study Evaluation of home practices of a healthy newborn in the delivery&#xD;
      room: skin processing conditions skin, reasons for separation between mother and child and&#xD;
      maternal felt appreciation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study single-center observational descriptive, carried out over a period of 8 weeks during&#xD;
      the months of January and February 2015 in the Maternity Our Lady of relief&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acquisition of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - From a survey conducted in puerperium the 2nd day of life during the interview with the&#xD;
      parents on the basis of a semi-structured interview about the progress of the birth and the&#xD;
      immediate postpartum period using memories of parents. The questionnaire included a section&#xD;
      on skin to skin layout with the newborn (information on skin to skin, original maturity), the&#xD;
      output or not the child of the delivery room (reason given, period of separation , felt the&#xD;
      mother), the conditions of return (naked or dressed, delivered or not skin to skin,&#xD;
      conditions the first feeding), the place of the first examination of the newborn and the&#xD;
      overall satisfaction of the mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reasons for the release of children were classified as routine care (weight,&#xD;
      measurements, toilet or exam), clinical monitoring of the Child (declogging, monitoring of&#xD;
      respiratory discomfort or poor adaptation), warming the child, simple or complicated maternal&#xD;
      care) and implementation of a levy (gastric, Rh, pH). The traceability of the reason for&#xD;
      leaving the newborn in the delivery room was searched in the newborn monitoring sheet&#xD;
      (production of a levy, the child's warming, clinical monitoring of the child) and in the&#xD;
      medical record of the mother (complicated birthing suites with uterus bleeding or tearing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      - And from the collection of the passage of newborns in the &quot;nursery&quot; of the delivery room of&#xD;
      11 days. The collection form was filled by the auxiliary of the delivery room should note&#xD;
      that with each pass of a newborn in the &quot;nursery&quot;, the time of birth, time of arrival and&#xD;
      departure and the main reason for the passage of the newborn in the &quot;nursery.&quot; The reasons&#xD;
      were categorized (routine care, achieving a levy, the child's warming, clinical monitoring of&#xD;
      the child, the mother care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: This is primarily a descriptive analysis. A comprehensive description of the sample&#xD;
      was carried out by giving the frequencies of different categories for qualitative variables.&#xD;
