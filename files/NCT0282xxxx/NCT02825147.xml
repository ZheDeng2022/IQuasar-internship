      Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma is an aggressive tumor with higher incidence in&#xD;
      Asia.Traditional CHOP/CHOP-like regiment can't produce satisfied outcome for the patients.&#xD;
      Asparaginase-based treatment has been demonstrated as promising response rate and survival&#xD;
      superiority. Stage-specified regimen may bring out exciting efficacy with good safety.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma is a kind of tumor more prevalent in Asia and South America&#xD;
      than that in the Western world, which is almost invariably EBV- associated and often presents&#xD;
      as localized disease in and around the nasal structures. The disease frequency was higher in&#xD;
      Asian countries with no differences in age, gender or immunophenotypic profile between nasal&#xD;
      and extranasal cases. EBV is a constant finding, particularly in the cases presenting as&#xD;
      localized nasal disease and assumed involved in the pathogenesis. During the past decades the&#xD;
      disease, historically termed as &quot;lethal midline granuloma&quot; was very aggressive with poor&#xD;
      survival. Five-year OS for extra-nasal disease is reported as 9% compared to 42% for&#xD;
      localized disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although radiotherapy combined with or without anthracycline-based chemotherapy has been&#xD;
      considered as the treatment for extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma in the past, numerous data&#xD;
      suggest that this tumor is not very chemosensitive due to the p-glycoprotein expression,&#xD;
      which may mediate the drug resistance. CHOP/CHOP-like schedules presented with low CR rates&#xD;
      and frequent failures during chemotherapy. Disseminated involvement is much poorer in&#xD;
      prognosis than localized disease with the latter is benefit more from radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the nearest ten years, many new agents have been used in the treatment of extranodal NK/T&#xD;
      cell lymphoma, in which the most promising one is asparaginase. Asparaginase-containing&#xD;
      regiment has demonstrated about 50% responses rates and 5-year overall survival of 65% in&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory disease. The impressive outcome indicates its value in the newly&#xD;
      diagnosed patients, especially in the disseminated cases. Pegaspargase as a new form of&#xD;
      asparaginase displays equivalent bioactivity as L- asparaginase with longer half-time and&#xD;
      lower incidence of allergy. Its clinical efficacy has been verified in the patients with&#xD;
      acute lymphocytic leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pegaspargase and&#xD;
      methotrexate based regimens with or without radiotherapy in the newly diagnosed patients with&#xD;
      extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, including localized and disseminated cases.&#xD;
