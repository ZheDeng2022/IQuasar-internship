    <textblock>
      The present clinical trial is performed in the field of vascular surgery. The aim of the&#xD;
      study is the economical and clinical comparison of two different access ways to the femoral&#xD;
      artery with intention of endovascular repair of aortic aneurysm. The usual access is a&#xD;
      surgical cutdown to the femoral artery and is compared to a percutaneous access which is&#xD;
      closed via a suture mediated device (Perclose ProGlide, Abbott).&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms (EVAR) is a routine procedure in vascular surgery and&#xD;
      associated with less perioperative complications compared to open aortic repair. Continuous&#xD;
      improvement of endovascular techniques is crucial for sufficient patient care, especially in&#xD;
      elderly with serious comorbidities. Percutaneous access (pEVAR) to the femoral artery is&#xD;
      associated with less wound complications when performed in suitable patients. Prospective&#xD;
      data about economic feasibility and exact duration of the technique itself compared to the&#xD;
      open access during the surgery are missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints of this prospective randomised single center trial are cost and time&#xD;
      differences of open vs. percutaneous access. Each Patient enrolled in the study will receive&#xD;
      percutaneous on one side and surgical access on the other side of the groin for femoral&#xD;
      artery access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The punction site will be closed using the Perclose ProGlide Suture-Mediated Closure System&#xD;
      manufactured by Abbott Vascular. This device works through stiff wire guided delivering of a&#xD;
      monofilament suture to the femoral artery punction site. After finishing endovascular&#xD;
      procedures for aneurysm repair, the thereby laid sutures are tightened to achieve hemostasis.&#xD;
      This system is suitable for sheath sizes up to 21 F (.28 inch).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open access on the other side is performed with a cutdown to the femoral artery and closure&#xD;
      after finished procedure, with a polypropylene suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who undergo endovascular aortic repair at the Department of Vascular Surgery of&#xD;
      Wilhelminenspital Vienna are recruited for the study after informed consent and fulfilled&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. Included are men and women from the age of 18 - 90 years with any&#xD;
      indication for endovascular aneurysm repair (thoracic, infrarenal aortic or iliac artery&#xD;
      aneurysm, or combinations of these). Indication for aneurysm repair is not a part of this&#xD;
      study and is set in accordance to international guidelines. Women in childbearing years could&#xD;
      be included after detailed explanation of special risks for further pregnancy after EVAR and&#xD;
      after proof of negative pregnancy test. Exclusion criteria are occlusive aortic disease,&#xD;
      aneurysm of the femoral artery, diameter &lt; 5mm or severe calcification, patients with&#xD;
      keloided inguinal site, adipositas per magna or demented patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to a prior power analysis a optimum number of 50 cases was determined. Randomization is&#xD;
      performed by lot (patients draw an envelope which contains either left or right side is done&#xD;
      by pEVAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data is collected preoperatively with a case report form (CRF) including detailed health&#xD;
      information about the patient. During the surgery, femoral artery access and wound closure&#xD;
      time is measured separately for each side (in minutes). Material costs are also documented&#xD;
      separately for each side (in â‚¬). Postoperative data about wound healing and pain of each&#xD;
      inguinal side are collected descriptive using the CRF. Data management and analysis is&#xD;
      anonymous using random patient numbers on the forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main targets of the study are cost and time difference of percutaneous and open access&#xD;
      techniques. Possible difference in both groups will be analyzed using the Wilcoxon Signed&#xD;
      Rank Test. Postoperative data will be evaluated descriptively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of cost advantage of the percutaneous access, this study economically legitimates the&#xD;
      use of suture mediated closure systems and therefore contributes to the establishment of&#xD;
      minimally invasive endovascular aortic repair.&#xD;
