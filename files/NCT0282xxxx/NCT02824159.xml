    <textblock>
      Recently, European Medicines Agency approved ibrutinib and idelalisib to treat Chronic&#xD;
      Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and two lymphomas: Follicular Lymphoma (FL) for ibrutinib and&#xD;
      Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) for idelalisib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials for ibrutinib and idelalisib were performed with a small number of patients&#xD;
      (300-350) and showed several side effects profiles. Since, pharmacokinetic properties of&#xD;
      these 2 drugs highlight a interindividual variability of pharmacokinetic. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to determine the association between clinically significant side effects occurrence&#xD;
      during the first year of treatment and plasma mean concentration of the steady state of&#xD;
      ibrutinib or idelalisib at 1 month.&#xD;

      Recently, European medicines agency approved ibrutinib and idelalisib in the treatment of&#xD;
      Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and two lymphomas: Follicular Lymphoma (FL) for ibrutinib&#xD;
      and Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) for idelalisib. Nevertheless, clinical trials for these two&#xD;
      drugs were performed for only 300-350 patients and showed several side effects profiles, the&#xD;
      most frequent were diarrhea, infection, cutaneous rash… For some patients, treatment had to&#xD;
      be reduced or stopped temporary or definitely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic properties of these two drugs highlight an interindividual pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      considerable variability. The aim of this clinical research study is to determine the&#xD;
      association between clinically significant side effects occurrence during the first year of&#xD;
      treatment (serious adverse reaction and/or grade CTCAE ≥ 3 and/or leading a dosage&#xD;
      concession) and plasma mean concentration of the steady state of ibrutinib or idelalisib&#xD;
      performed at 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine plasma mean concentration of the steady state of ibrutinib or idelalisib, blood&#xD;
      tests will be performed every scheduled monitoring at visit 1 month during a pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      exploration and during scheduled medical consultation (2, 3, 6 and 12 months) and every&#xD;
      unscheduled visit in case of side effect occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every scheduled monitoring visit, blood tests will be performed to determine plasma&#xD;
      concentration in drug. Complementary blood or salivary samples will be collected before the&#xD;
      treatment, 24 months later and in case of relapse to determine genetic characteristics. In&#xD;
      parallel, a logbook will be completed by the patient to collect side effects. Finally, an&#xD;
      oncology certified nurse call patients every 2 weeks. In case of side effect occurrence a&#xD;
      visit will be organized in the next 3 days and a blood test will be performed.&#xD;
