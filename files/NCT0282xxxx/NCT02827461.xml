  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the hereditability of sleep homeostasis, i.e.,&#xD;
      drive for sleep by looking at monozygotic and dizygotic twins.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excessive daytime sleepiness is a prevalent problem in our society associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of vehicular crashes and industrial accidents. Sleepiness is, in part,&#xD;
      determined by fundamental biology relating to sleep homeostasis, i.e., the rate of&#xD;
      accumulation of the pressure for sleep during wakefulness. A differential susceptibility to&#xD;
      sleep deprivation is reported in normal subjects with large intraindividual differences in&#xD;
      the degree of functional impairment produced by the same duration of sleep. Genetics are&#xD;
      likely to play an important role in sleep homeostasis as shown by recent studies in inbred&#xD;
      mouse strains, but whether genetics plays any role in humans and, if so, the magnitude of&#xD;
      this role, is unknown. This proposal is based on the hypothesis that sleep homeostasis is a&#xD;
      heritable trait in humans. Given the complexity of phenotyping to study sleep homeostasis,&#xD;
      the investigators propose that studying differences in the variances of the phenotype between&#xD;
      monozygotic and dizygotic twins is the optimal approach to estimate heritability of sleep&#xD;
      homeostasis. The investigators will assess sleep homeostasis in 80 pairs of monozygotic and&#xD;
      80 pairs of dizygotic twins by quantifying the increase in delta power during recovery sleep&#xD;
      following sleep deprivation and the increase in theta power during the period of prolonged&#xD;
      wakefulness. Subjects will be recruited using the PennTwins Cohort, a population-based cohort&#xD;
      of about 1,800 twin pairs. If heritability of sleep homeostasis is shown, this EEG-based&#xD;
      phenotyping strategy could not be easily applied to the larger scale population studies that&#xD;
      will be required to assess underlying genetic variants. Thus, part of the overall strategy is&#xD;
      to evaluate, and potentially validate, other approaches to phenotyping that are less&#xD;
      physiologically rigorous but are more easily applied to a larger number of subjects.&#xD;
      Therefore, as a subsidiary goal, the investigators will also estimate heritability of&#xD;
      performance lapses during prolonged wakefulness as a surrogate method to assess sleep&#xD;
      homeostasis. The investigators will particularly determine whether the differences in the&#xD;
      measures based on our physiological intensive phenotypes between pairs of dizygotic twins are&#xD;
      reflected in differences in this phenotyping approach that is simpler to perform. Such a&#xD;
      result would indicate that this simpler method could be used in larger scale population&#xD;
      studies, and will be part of future strategies to elucidate genetic variants determining&#xD;
      sleepiness.&#xD;

      Blood and DNA samples will be identified by a bar-coding system. This will only be able to be&#xD;
      matched to the subject ID using a secure computer database to which only the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator will have access.&#xD;

        Subjects will be healthy MZ and DZ twins of the same gender between 18 years and 55 years&#xD;
        of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The investigators will not exclude any specific racial or ethnic group. African-American&#xD;
        twins currently represent 3.8% of the PennTwins Cohort, i.e., 68 twin pairs. The&#xD;
        investigators plan to oversample this group. The study design calls for 8 MZ and 8 DZ&#xD;
        African-American twins to match the demographics of the population. There are currently no&#xD;
        data that the phenotype being studied is affected by race or ethnicity.&#xD;
