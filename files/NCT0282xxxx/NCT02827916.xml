  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxaliplatin is an anticancer agent commonly used in the treatment of colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      However, the development of neuropathic pain under treatment limits its use. These are&#xD;
      manifested by acute hyperesthesia / distal cold allodynia and chronic course of hypoesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is widely reported that these pains are consecutive to hyperexcitability of some ioniques2&#xD;
      channels (mainly sodium and potassium channels). However, the pathophysiological mechanisms&#xD;
      of neurotoxicity are multifactorial and still imperfectly described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since May 2014, the hospital group Paris Saint Joseph led the pilot study LIPIDOXA whose&#xD;
      challenge is to quantify / measure NAION and explained by a biochemical approach,&#xD;
      specifically Lipidomics. The CANALOXA study is the logical continuation of LIPIDOXA study&#xD;
      insofar design methodology relies heavily on techniques developed for LIPIDOXA study and that&#xD;
      the expected results will be complementary to those of LIPIDOXA.&#xD;

      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      it is, in cancer patients chronically treated with oxaliplatin (over 5 courses) and&#xD;
      exhibiting signs of neuropathy, to correlate the quantitative changes in the thermal&#xD;
      sensitivity to hot and cold (Thermotest, Quantitative Sensory Testing QST ) with any changes&#xD;
      in the ion conductance chlorine measured by electrophysiological technique (SUDOSCAN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlating the results obtained with both types of techniques and with the descriptive&#xD;
           parameters of the population included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understand the importance of regulating the activity of the chloride channel in the&#xD;
           development of neuropathy induced by oxaliplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective study, single center, intervention in routine care. Time study: February 2015 -&#xD;
      October 2016&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluation of neuropathy by electrophysiological methods (SUDOSCAN) The SUDOSCAN is a&#xD;
           new technology fast and non-invasive to quantify the degree of neuropathy objectively&#xD;
           through evaluation of chloride conductance at the skin of the palms and the soles of&#xD;
           pieds4,5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluation of neuropathy by devices for quantitative measurement of neuropathic pain&#xD;
&#xD;
           The pain symptoms was evaluated through various semi-objective neuropathy quantification&#xD;
           tools (Quantitative Sensory Testing devices) 6:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The Thermotest (Somedic®): medical device that measures the thermal sensitivity&#xD;
                thresholds to cold and hot: cold sensitivity threshold, threshold of sensitivity to&#xD;
                hot, cold pain threshold, pain threshold warm. These stimuli are transmitted by the&#xD;
                fiber Adelta and C. Since dysesthesia to thermal stimuli (allodynia in acute and&#xD;
                chronical hypoesthesia) are typical of oxaliplatin, Thermotest is fundamental.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Questionnaire NPSI (Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory) widely used in the field&#xD;
                and validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistical Analysis: Professor Gilles Chatellier, statistician (Clinical Research Unit,&#xD;
           Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou) will bring its expertise in statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NB: For each subject will be awarded an identifier (simple counter: increment as and&#xD;
      measurement of inclusions) and the data will be entered on a computer file which will be sent&#xD;
      to the statistician in charge of the analysis. There will be no exchange of personal data for&#xD;
      this study is single center on the site GHPSJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion of patients treated with oxaliplatin from 6th cycle (FOLFOX protocols&#xD;
           FOLFIRINOX, EOX, GEMOX, EOF, XELOX).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expected duration of patient recruitment: 9 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of patients to recruit and duration of participation for each patient: Based on&#xD;
           75 patients seen in 9 months in GHSPJ the oncology department for cancer of the&#xD;
           digestive tract, and knowing that the prevalence of neuropathic pain in oxaliplatin is&#xD;
           50-70% (Attal 2009), the investigators plan to include at least 36 patients in this&#xD;
           period of 9 months.&#xD;
