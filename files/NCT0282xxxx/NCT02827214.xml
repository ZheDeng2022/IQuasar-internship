  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracolumbar (TL) burst fractures in neurologically intact patients account for&#xD;
      approximately 45% of all TL spine injuries. Despite being common fractures, there is&#xD;
      significant variability in treatment recommendations encompassing surgery and non-surgical&#xD;
      treatment options. The controversy regarding optimal treatment for these injuries is fueled&#xD;
      by several studies which suggest a potential benefit to surgical treatment in the realm of&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, and the overall socio-economic burden of treatment while other studies&#xD;
      demonstrate improved outcomes and lower morbidity with non-surgical treatment. This study&#xD;
      aims to perform a prospective cohort analysis investigating the clinical outcome of various&#xD;
      treatment alternatives for patients with A3/A4 fractures in the thoracolumbar region. A&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis will also be performed to identify costs and benefits of each&#xD;
      treatment option. More specifically a sub-group analysis will be performed for this group of&#xD;
      patients, which have equipoise in regards to patients treatment, as decided by a blinded&#xD;
      review panel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      208 subjects (i.e., 137 per surgical group; 71 per conservative group) with TL burst&#xD;
      fractures AOSpine classification type A3 or A4 without neurological deficit as defined in the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, and with or without suspected Posterior Ligament Complex (PLC)&#xD;
      injury (M1) from T10 to L2, will be enrolled in a prospective multicenter cohort study.&#xD;
      Patients may have an associated B injury, but must have an A3 or A4. Patients will be&#xD;
      monitored prospectively for patient reported, clinical and radiologic outcomes, over a period&#xD;
      of 2 years post-treatment. Specifically a patient diary will measure the Oswestry Disability&#xD;
      Index (ODI), and employment information (indirect costs questionnaire) every second week&#xD;
      until 6 months post-treatment. Diary will continue every second month until 2 years&#xD;
      post-treatment. All interventions/examinations are considered as standard of care.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>AOSpine PROST consists of 19 questions on aspects of functioning such as personal care, traveling, and emotional functioning after the accident causing the spinal injury. Each item has a 0-100 numeric rating scale, supported by smileys at both ends of the ruler. It is important to realize that 0 indicates a level at which the patient is non-functional and 100 indicates the level before the accident, no matter how well or poorly the patient functioned before the accident.</description>
