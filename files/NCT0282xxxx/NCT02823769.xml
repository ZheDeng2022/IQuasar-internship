  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the advances in adhesive restorative techniques and materials, dental caries still&#xD;
      remains a critical concern even today. In addition, recurrent caries related to microleakage&#xD;
      is a common mode of failure of directly placed resin composite restorations. Resin composites&#xD;
      are particularly susceptible to recurrent caries due to polymerization contraction and also&#xD;
      imperfect adhesion of restorative to tooth tissue. Thus, strong durable bond between adhesive&#xD;
      restoratives and tooth tissue and increasing the resistance of teeth to acid by encouraging&#xD;
      the development of remineralization are essential to withstand secondary caries. Fluoride has&#xD;
      been documented as a major contributing factor for the decline in the incidence of dental&#xD;
      caries and also it has been accepted as an agent in the prevention of caries. Giomers are a&#xD;
      new group of anhydrous resin based direct adhesive restorative materials based on the filler&#xD;
      technology (PRG) have both advantages of glass ionomers namely, fluoride release and&#xD;
      recharge, and resin composites with excellent optical and mechanical properties. The&#xD;
      chemistry of Giomer materials facilitates fluoride ion release with the potential for a lower&#xD;
      incidence of recurrent caries that was accepted as a major factor to retreat a resin&#xD;
      restoration. Limited number of studies is available on their fluoride release, and&#xD;
      polishability, as well as clinical survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this controlled clinical trial is to evaluate the clinical performance of&#xD;
      restorative material &quot;SI-R21204 resin composite&quot; versus a &quot;nano-hybrid resin com-posite&quot;&#xD;
      materials for Class I and Class II cavities that needs to be restored in per-manent teeth.40&#xD;
      patients are recruited to the project which is carried out at the School of dentistry,&#xD;

      The objective of this controlled clinical trial is to evaluate the clinical performance of&#xD;
      restorative material &quot;SI-R21204 resin composite&quot; versus a &quot;nano-hybrid resin com-posite&quot;&#xD;
      materials for Class I and Class II cavities that needs to be restored in per-manent teeth.&#xD;
      Giomers are a new group of anhydrous resin based direct adhesive restorative materials based&#xD;
      on the filler technology (PRG) to form a stable phase of glass ionomer in the restorative.&#xD;
      These materials have both advantages of glass ionomers namely, fluoride release and recharge,&#xD;
      and resin composites with excellent optical and mechanical properties. PRG fillers are&#xD;
      fabricated by acid-base reaction of glass particles and polyacrylic acid in the presence of&#xD;
      water and forms wet silicous hydrogel. S-PRG filler particles exhibit a three-layer structure&#xD;
      where the glass core is enveloped by a stable glass-ionomer hydrogel. This hydrogel is&#xD;
      surrounded by the &quot;reforming phase,&quot; which provides structural protection for the hydrogel.&#xD;
      These materials with S-PRG technology therefore, differ from polyacid modified composite&#xD;
      resins because the glass ionomer hydrogel forms only after water uptake by the compomer resin&#xD;
      matrix after polymerization. The chemistry of Giomer materials facilitates fluoride ion&#xD;
      release with the potential for a lower incidence of recurrent caries that was accepted as a&#xD;
      major factor to retreat a resin restoration. Limited number of studies is available on their&#xD;
      fluoride release, and polishability, as well as clinical survival. The study will be carried&#xD;
      out as a prospective study, with assessment of the restorationsafter three year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project includes 40 patients. Most of the patients have been recruited from the Istanbul&#xD;
      Medipol University Dental Clinics in Istanbul. After giving their consent to take part in the&#xD;
      study Class I &amp; II restorations of both upper and lower molars and premolars are&#xD;
      performed.The treatment procedure is: The patients are offered local anesthetic before&#xD;
      treatment start. The cavity is excavated and filled according to the guidelines for composite&#xD;
      restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control procedure is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The restoration is evaluated according to marginal adaptation, cavo surface marginal&#xD;
      discoloration, approximal contact, fractures, caries associated with restorations and&#xD;
      postoperative hypersensitivity. The controls will take place after two weeks, one year, two&#xD;
      years and three years.&#xD;

    <description>2 independent evaluators The primary outcome will consist in the FDI (World Dental Federation) instrument for dental restorations assessment, as it was published after consensus in 2007 and updated in 2010 . This instrument is composed of three dimensions (biological, functional and esthetic), each consisting of several items that are assessed by clinical and radiographic examination according to Likert scales of 5 terms. Some items are evaluated quantitatively, others visually.The worst score of all items is retained as the overall score of the restoration, thus resulting in a single (ordinal) primary outcome.
