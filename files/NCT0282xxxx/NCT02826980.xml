    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometriotic tissue outside the uterus. Its&#xD;
      pathophysiology is still misunderstood today, but more and more work on this pathology are&#xD;
      published. The clinical presentation is generally characterized by the existence of cyclical&#xD;
      pelvic pain, with dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dysuria, dyschezia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But, there are a wide variety of symptoms, with different painful sites and different types&#xD;
      of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated prevalence of endometriosis is about 10% in women. But the impact of this&#xD;
      disease on quality of life and its economic impact is estimated considerable. In a US study,&#xD;
      the direct costs associated with endometriosis were estimated at US $ 2.801 per woman. Some&#xD;
      studies have focused also to quantify work absenteeism associated with endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of endometriosis is based on the migration of endometrial fragments reaching the&#xD;
      pelvis via the tubes and establishing themselves on other sites, thus creating non cyclical&#xD;
      uterine pain. Catamenial pace of pain is suggestive of the diagnosis, but with time, the pain&#xD;
      tends to be chronic rather than cyclical. The standard diagnosis is based on visualization&#xD;
      and histological examination of the lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wide variety of symptoms of endometriosis often leads to wandering and medical diagnostic&#xD;
      delay. A better understanding of this disease by the medical community would allow better&#xD;
      management of these patients. Currently, endometriosis remains a misunderstood disease by&#xD;
      rheumatologists. However, the initial presentation may mimic rheumatologic symptoms; thus,&#xD;
      rheumatologists may face this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of&#xD;
      manifestations of endometriosis in a cohort of patients with a recent diagnosis of&#xD;
      endometriosis established. Secondly, it may well be possible to establish a list of symptoms&#xD;
      and signs suggestive of endometriosis for the rheumatologist, allowing to contact a&#xD;
      specialized consultant gynecologist some patients &quot;by mistake&quot; in rheumatology.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Main objective / secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational study rheumatological manifestations associated with endometriosis: prevalence&#xD;
      and characteristics of rheumatological manifestations associated with endometriosis, via a&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective, observational Time study: 3 to 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acquisition of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-administered questionnaire (in PJ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supports state and annex: FIU PJ, Excel grid of data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analysis Saint Joseph&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clarify data anonymisation: not anonymisation, but confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Describe how the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients consultant in gynecology in the service of Doctor Sauvanet, for whom a diagnosis of&#xD;
      endometriosis has been established (clinical history and imaging tests confirming the&#xD;
      diagnosis) will be offered to meet a self-administered questionnaire during their&#xD;
      consultation. This will be delivered by the gynecologist in the consultation, with the&#xD;
      consent sheet. If the patient agrees, the self-administered questionnaire must be completed&#xD;
      in the consultation box or in the waiting room, and handed to the gynecologist or the&#xD;
      secretary of the consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Expected duration of patient recruitment: 3 months&#xD;
