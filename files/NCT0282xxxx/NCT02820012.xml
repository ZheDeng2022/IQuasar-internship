  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although practiced for many years, surgical correction of scoliosis is relatively subject&#xD;
      published for idiopathic scoliosis and a few published for other types of scoliosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves a creation of an observatory of patients undergoing scoliosis by ST2R&#xD;
      reduction technique (Simultaneous Translation on Two Rods) associated with the PASS ® system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to analyze the three-dimensional correction of the deformity after&#xD;
      intervention and its maintenance over time depending on the etiology of scoliosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is conducted in pediatric surgery services specialized in this technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correcting radiographic parameters is directly related to the surgical procedure. The quality&#xD;
      of life of patients is indirectly affected by the surgery. Secondary objectives are to&#xD;
      analyze the surgical technique and to evaluate its impact on the quality of life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will firstly to have a better understanding in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scoliosis of the children and adolescents and their surgical treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The impact of the surgical procedure by the ST2R technique on the three-dimensional&#xD;
           correction, and the patient's quality of life; and secondly, better management of&#xD;
           patients requiring surgery for scoliosis as well as a public health impact.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The correction of the deformity in three planes of space is the main goal of surgical&#xD;
      treatment of children's scoliosis and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The techniques provide a satisfactory correction of the deformity in the coronal plane but&#xD;
      remain insufficient in the sagittal plane and in particular for the correction of thoracic&#xD;
      hypokyphosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Clarke and his team have shown that ST2R reduction technique (Simultaneous Translation on&#xD;
      Two Rods) associated with the PASS ® system gave a good correction of the thoracic&#xD;
      hypokyphosis of idiopathic scoliosis. The results of his single-center studies have shown&#xD;
      that ST2R technique allowed to restore normal thoracic kyphosis with an average gain of 23 °&#xD;
      in patients preoperatively hypokyphosis, higher than the gains made by other techniques&#xD;
      (rotation of the shaft, close off Gradually, in situ bending), while providing a frontal&#xD;
      correction 70%, similar to results reported by other techniques. The results of this&#xD;
      technique for non idiopathic scoliosis are still to be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The creation of an observatory of children's and adolescents scoliosis (idiopathic,&#xD;
      neuromuscular, etc ...) operated by the technique of reduction by simultaneous translation on&#xD;
      two rods with the same instrumentation will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Firstly, to confirm or refute the first published results idiopathic scoliosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  And secondly to analyze the results of the same technique on all other scoliosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of the intervention on the quality of life of patients is an essential element&#xD;
      that will be evaluated.&#xD;
