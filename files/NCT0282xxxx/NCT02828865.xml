  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver cancer including primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metastatic liver cancers is&#xD;
      one the most common malignancies in the world. Over 10000 new cases per year are diagnosed in&#xD;
      Taiwan. Despite the many treatment options, the prognosis of HCC remains dismal. More than&#xD;
      8000 people died of this cancer every year in Taiwan. A majority (70% to 85%) of patients&#xD;
      present with advanced or unresectable disease. In contrast, small liver cancers can be cured&#xD;
      with an appreciable frequency. Five-year disease-free survival exceeding 50% has been&#xD;
      reported for surgical resection, and for the inoperable patients who do not have vascular&#xD;
      invasion or extrahepatic spread. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is recommended as an&#xD;
      alternative curative therapy. However, the main drawback of RFA is its limitation to tumor&#xD;
      size and location. The tumors larger than 5 cm in diameter or located adjacent to vessels,&#xD;
      could not be ablated completely sometimes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irreversible electroporation (IRE), developed and manufactured by AngioDynamics US Ltd, can&#xD;
      ablate tumor by fenestrating the cancer cell membrane by electric pulse. The anti-tumor&#xD;
      effect does not result from thermotherapy, so is also not diminished by adjacent vessels.&#xD;
      Several pre-clinical studies have already demonstrated IRE is a safe and effective treatment&#xD;
      for live cancers. The system has been approved as safe by the European Union (EU) in 2008 and&#xD;
      received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2010. However, there are still few&#xD;
      experiences in using IRE for tumor ablation in Taiwan. In this study, the investigators will&#xD;
      perform IRE for 40 inoperable patients with liver cancers adjacent to vessels who are&#xD;
      suitable to receive radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the investigators hospital. The&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the potential side effect and ablate effect of tumors by&#xD;
      abdominal computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the investigators&#xD;
      will also follow-up this patients for 2 years to evaluate the overall survival and local&#xD;
      recurrence rate. The investigators will appraisal the clinical feasibility and advantage of&#xD;
      the system by this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or metastatic liver cancers with&#xD;
             pathologic proven, and the diagnosis of HCC will be made by pathology / cytology or&#xD;
             according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) (2010)&#xD;
             diagnostic criteria. In brief, Nodules larger than 1 cm found on ultrasound screening&#xD;
             of a cirrhotic liver should be investigated further with either tri-phase&#xD;
             multidetector computed tomography (CT) scan or dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging (MRI). If the appearances are typical of HCC (i.e., hypervascular in&#xD;
             the arterial phase with washout in the portal venous or delayed phase), the lesion&#xD;
             should be treated as HCC. If the findings are not characteristic or the vascular&#xD;
             profile is not typical, a second contrast enhanced study with the other imaging&#xD;
             modality should be performed, or the lesion should be biopsied. Biopsies of small&#xD;
             lesions should be evaluated by expert pathologists. Tissue that is not clearly HCC&#xD;
             should be stained with all the available markers including cluster of differentiation&#xD;
             34 (CD34), cytokeratin 7 (CK7), glypican 3, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and&#xD;
             glutamine synthetase to improve diagnostic accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Unsuitable for surgical resection but local ablation is indicated, however, the&#xD;
             distance between tumour and vessels is smaller than 5 mm.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function. Platelet count ≥ 100 K/Μl. Total&#xD;
             bilirubin ≦ 2 mg/dL. alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) &lt; 5 x&#xD;
             upper limit of normal. prothrombin time (PT)- international normalized ratio (INR) ≦&#xD;
             2.0. Serum creatinine ≦ 1.5 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Prior Informed Consent Form&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Life expectancy of at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The disease status is not suitable to receive surgical resection, percutaneous alcohol&#xD;
             injection, transarterial chemoembolization or other standard treatment.&#xD;
