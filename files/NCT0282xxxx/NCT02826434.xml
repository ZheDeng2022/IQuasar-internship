    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate Immunotherapy with a peptide vaccine and&#xD;
      Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor as a possible adjuvant treatment for Stage II or&#xD;
      III Triple Negative Breast Cancer. This research study is studying the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      and immune response of these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PVX-410 Vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Durvalumab (MEDI4736)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase Ib clinical trial, which tests the safety of an&#xD;
      investigational intervention and also tries to better understand how the investigational&#xD;
      intervention affects the body. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved PVX-410 and Durvalumab as a&#xD;
      treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Durvalumab is a protein that affects your immune system by blocking the PD-L1 pathway.&#xD;
           The PD-L1 pathway controls the body's natural immune response, but tumors can interrupt&#xD;
           this pathway and partially resist or escape the immune system. By blocking the PD-L1&#xD;
           pathway, Durvalumab may help the immune system identify and catch tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PVX-410 is an investigational vaccine that is being developed to treat multiple myeloma&#xD;
           and triple negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In this research study, the investigators are studying the body's immune response to the&#xD;
           PVX-410 study vaccine in combination with Durvalumab. This study will help researchers&#xD;
           understand if the vaccine and Durvalumab can work together to help the body's immune&#xD;
           system recognize triple negative breast cancer. The investigators are also studying the&#xD;
           safety of the PVX-410 vaccine alone and together with the Durvalumab.&#xD;
