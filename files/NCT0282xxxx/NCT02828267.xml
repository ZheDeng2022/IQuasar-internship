  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A brief negotiational interview (BNI), administered in an Emergency Department setting for&#xD;
      both hazardous and harmful drinkers has been shown to cost-effectively reduce a patient's&#xD;
      alcohol intake and re-injury rate up to 3 years post intervention. A BNI is a short (5-30&#xD;
      minute) counseling session administered by non-addiction specialists based on the concepts of&#xD;
      the FRAMES model of motivational interviewing. Text based boosters have been proposed to&#xD;
      prolong the impact of this intervention, either with a standardized or personalized content.&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a pilot study to test the feasibility of the study protocols,&#xD;
      acceptance of the intervention, and patient enrollment and retention rates, as we prepare for&#xD;
      a fully powered pragmatic randomized adaptive controlled trial of the intervention for&#xD;
      patients seen at the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center (KCMC) Emergency Department.(ED)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research Design: This will be a pilot randomized adaptive feasibility and acceptability&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a three stage trial where usual care, brief intervention and brief intervention&#xD;
      with standard booster will be in the first stage. The second stage will drop the usual care&#xD;
      arm. The third stage will keep an arm in stage two and a new arm, brief intervention with&#xD;
      personalized booster. Since this is a feasibility trial, we will advance through potential&#xD;
      adaptations, changing the enrollment procedures but not based on effectiveness testing as we&#xD;
      are not powered for that endpoint. We have chosen brief intervention with standardized&#xD;
      booster to continue in stage 3 to obtain more patient experience with the booster portion of&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and Recruitment: The investigators will prospectively enroll (n=75, 10 usual&#xD;
      care, 20 BNI, 24 BNI + standard booster and 16 BNI + Personalized Booster) patients who&#xD;
      present to the KCMC ED for care of acute injuries and meet inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Trained research nurses will describe the intervention as a health assessment, and eligible&#xD;
      interested participants will be enrolled, provide informed consent and a randomization packet&#xD;
      chosen. The research nurses will then administer patient demographic, injury, alcohol use&#xD;
      surveys and the intervention if appropriate all lasting less than 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Procedures: All groups will provide two phone numbers where participants can be&#xD;
      reached in order to facilitate follow-up. All participants will be contacted at 6 weeks, 3&#xD;
      months and 6 months for follow-up survey administration. Follow up surveys are expected to be&#xD;
      less than 20 minutes. All patients will be contacted by text message at the conclusion of the&#xD;
      study to inform them about availability of the results of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility Trial Outcomes: Using the RE-AIM framework, we will define the reach (enrollment/&#xD;
      retention), the preliminary effectiveness (reduction in DrInC score), adoption including&#xD;
      patient acceptance, implementation (intervention fidelity) and maintance (sustainability&#xD;
      features). The investigators will conduct a feasibility assessment subjectively through&#xD;
      self-assessments as well as objectively through Event Analyses, understanding causes of&#xD;
      deviations from protocol, intervention evaluations and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures: To evaluate the study procedures, the investigators will evaluate any&#xD;
      protocol deviation events, and compare length of survey times. The investigators will also&#xD;
      perform assessments of intervention fidelity through reviewing recorded observations of BNI&#xD;
      administration using the BNI Assessment Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reach: Enrollment and Retention The primary outcome measure will be recruitment and retention&#xD;
      rates, anticipated at 30% and 60%, respectively. Secondarily, the investigators will&#xD;
      qualitatively assess the inclusion and exclusion criteria, reasons for non-enrollment or&#xD;
      non-retention, to the extent possible. Finally, the investigators will administer follow-up&#xD;
      questions about compensation procedures in order to improve enrollment or retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness: We will evaluate the DrInC (Drinker Inventory of Consequences), AUDIT (Alcohol&#xD;
      Use Disorder Identification Test) scores, number of drinking days and number of binge&#xD;
      drinking days. We are not powered to determine effectiveness, so this is a preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adoption: We will evaluate patient acceptance and perception of effectiveness for the&#xD;
      adoption of this intervention. The investigators will assess acceptability of participation&#xD;
      in the trial and intervention through questions administered after the final follow-up time&#xD;
      point for both the research team as well as participants. This will include assessment about&#xD;
      the length of surveys, and method and quantity of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation: We will evaluate implementation preparedness with an evaluation of the time&#xD;
      burden of the BNI, and intervention fidelity both for the BNI, and SMS boosters but also&#xD;
      trial protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance: We will determine sustainability through the burden of administration of the BNI&#xD;
      as perceived by research nurses administering the intervention, the attitudes towards&#xD;
      effectiveness of interventionists and participants, the cost and feasibility of this type of&#xD;
      this adaptive clinical trial in this setting.&#xD;

    <description>The DrInC is a self-administered 50-item questionnaire designed to measure adverse consequences of alcohol abuse in five areas: Interpersonal, Physical, Social, Impulsive, and Intrapersonal. Scales are combined to assess total adverse consequences, with higher scores indicating more adverse consequences. This is a mean and standard deviation of the number of consequences suffered by participants since enrollment. The total DrInC score is reported where is 0 (no consequences) to 50 (every consequence experienced).</description>

In the personalized arm, the text sent will be personalized based on information obtained about the patient's reasons for reducing their drinking found in the BNI.&#xD;
