  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of KN035&#xD;
      in advanced and metastatic solid tumor.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dose escalation will follow the traditional 3+3 design. Cohorts of 3-6 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled sequentially at escalating doses of 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg weekly. Dosing schedule&#xD;
      for cohorts 2 and above may change after interim PK analysis after Cohort 1 Cycle 1 to&#xD;
      bi-weekly or other regimen based on elimination profile of KN035 to avoid excessive drug&#xD;
      accumulation. Dose escalation will continue until identification of MTD, up to a maximum dose&#xD;
      of 10 mg/kg. MTD is defined as the highest dose studied at which no more than 1 of 6 subjects&#xD;
      has experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in Cycle 1.&#xD;

             to local therapy. Subjects must have failed established standard medical anti-cancer&#xD;
             therapies for a given tumor type or have been intolerant to such therapy, or in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator have been considered ineligible for a particular form of&#xD;
             standard therapy on medical grounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is male or female and â‰¥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology&#xD;
             Group (ECOG) Performance Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have adequate hematologic and organ function. Note: If subject is&#xD;
             receiving anticoagulants, then value must be within therapeutic range for the&#xD;
             condition the subject is being treated for.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has voluntarily agreed to participate by giving written informed consent. If&#xD;
             subject has agreed to a newly obtained biopsy of tumor (that can be biopsied based on&#xD;
             Investigator's assessment). Tissue obtained for the biopsy must not be previously&#xD;
             irradiated. No systemic antineoplastic therapy may be received by the subject between&#xD;
             the time of the biopsy and the first administration of KN035.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subject of childbearing potential has a negative urine or serum pregnancy test.&#xD;
             If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test will be required. The serum pregnancy test must be negative for the subject to be&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects enrolled in the study, who are not free from menses for &gt; 2 years,&#xD;

             either 2 adequate barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method of&#xD;
             contraception to prevent pregnancy or to abstain from heterosexual activity throughout&#xD;
             the study, starting with Visit 1 through 120 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
             therapy. Approved contraceptive methods include for example; intra uterine device,&#xD;
             diaphragm with spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, male condoms, or female&#xD;
             condom with spermicide. Spermicides alone are not an acceptable method of&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male subjects must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first&#xD;
        dose of study drug through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject who not recovered from the effects of any prior chemotherapy, radioactive, or&#xD;

             CTCAE Grade 1 or better from the adverse events due to cancer therapeutics&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Subject who has had erlotinib, gefitinib,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject is expected to require any other form of antineoplastic therapy while on study&#xD;
             (including maintenance therapy with another agent for NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject had prior treatment targeting PD-L1 axis or CTLA 4. Subjects with prior&#xD;
             treatment targeting PD-1 are allowed to enroll if the subject has a washout time of at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks. Examples of such agents include (but are not limited to): BMS-936559&#xD;

        resection of basal cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder cancer, squamous cell&#xD;
        carcinoma of the skin, in situ cervical cancer, or other in situ cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided&#xD;

             vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be exception to this rule. Subjects&#xD;
             that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not&#xD;
             be excluded from the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism that is stable on hormone&#xD;
             replacement will not be excluded from the study.&#xD;

             testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;

             risk factors for torsade de pointes (TdP, e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family&#xD;
             history of Long QT Syndrome), or is using concomitant medications that prolong the&#xD;
             QT/QTc interval.&#xD;
