  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this protocol are 1) to investigate the safety and tolerability of X4P-001 in&#xD;
      combination with KeytrudaÂ® (pembrolizumab) in patients with advanced melanoma, and 2) to&#xD;
      assess serial biopsies of melanoma tumor lesions obtained throughout the study for&#xD;
      inflammatory and tumor cell infiltrates. After completion of study treatment, participants&#xD;
      with resectable disease will undergo surgery, unresectable participants may continue on&#xD;
      pembrolizumab as standard of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      X4P-001 is an orally bioavailable CXCR4 antagonist that has demonstrated activity in various&#xD;
      tumor models. CXCR4 (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4) is the receptor for CXCL12 (C-X-C&#xD;
      chemokine ligand type 12). CXCL12 has potent chemotactic activity for lymphocytes and MDSCs&#xD;
      (myeloid-derived suppressor cells), and is important in homing of hematopoietic stem cells to&#xD;
      the bone marrow. CXCR4 is also expressed and active on multiple types of human cancers,&#xD;
      including melanoma, ccRCC, and ovarian cancer. Additionally, increased expression of CXCR4 on&#xD;
      tumor cells has been associated with significantly decreased overall participant survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In animal cancer models, interference with CXCR4 function has been demonstrated to disrupt&#xD;
      the tumor microenvironment (TME) and unmask the tumor to immune attack by multiple&#xD;
      mechanisms, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decreasing the infiltration of MDSCs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increasing the ratio of CD8+ T cells to Treg cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eliminating tumor re-vascularization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is a humanized IgG4 kappa monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction&#xD;
      between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. Pembrolizumab is currently approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Analysis of tumor samples before and during&#xD;
      treatment in an earlier study demonstrated that a clinical response was associated with an&#xD;
      increase in the density of CD8+ T cells in the tumor parenchyma (center), while disease&#xD;
      progression was associated with persistent low levels of those cells. In an autochthonous&#xD;
      murine model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, persistent tumor growth despite administration of&#xD;
      anti-PD-L1 was similarly associated with failure of tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells to enter&#xD;
      the TME despite their presence in the peripheral circulation. This immunosuppressed phenotype&#xD;
      was associated with CXCL12 production by cancer-associated fibroblasts. Moreover,&#xD;
      administration of a CXCR4 antagonist (AMD3100) induced rapid T-cell accumulation among the&#xD;
      cancer cells and, in combination with anti-PD-L1, synergistically decreased tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these observations, the hypothesis is that effective CXCR4 antagonism by X4P-001&#xD;
      would be of potential benefit in participants with advanced melanoma and other cancers by&#xD;
      multiple mechanisms, resulting in increased anti-tumor immune attack.&#xD;
