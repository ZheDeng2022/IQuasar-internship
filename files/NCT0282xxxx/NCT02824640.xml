  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who inject drugs (PWID) have higher rates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) than do other&#xD;
      groups. Effective, safe new treatments called direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have been&#xD;
      developed recently. Unfortunately, PWID rarely get these treatments. The drugs are expensive,&#xD;
      so insurers often do not cover the cost of DAAs. Sometimes providers hesitate to prescribe&#xD;
      DAAs because they are concerned that PWID won't take their medication or that these patients&#xD;
      might become reinfected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several good models for treating PWID exist. One of them is to provide directly observed&#xD;
      treatment (DOT). Another model provides treatment to PWID with the support of patient&#xD;
      navigators (PN), public health workers who offer support and education to patients. Though&#xD;
      both the DOT and PN models have been successful, we still don't know which model works best.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will study both DOT and PN models for treating HCV in PWID.&#xD;
      The investigators' goal is to find out which model produces the best results and is preferred&#xD;
      by patients. Up to 1,000 HCV-infected PWID will participate in the study in eight sites&#xD;
      around the country. Patients will be randomized into either the PN or the DOT groups.&#xD;
      Patients who end up in the PN group will get a biweekly blister pack of medication to take&#xD;
      home. Their PN will provide education and support. The investigators will find out whether&#xD;
      patients adhered to medication using an electronic adherence monitoring system. Patients who&#xD;
      are randomly assigned to the DOT group will take their medication in front of a staff member.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site national study (8 U.S. cities), where up to 1000 HCV-infected PWIDs&#xD;
      (injecting illicit substances within the last 3 months) will be randomized to either PN plus&#xD;
      biweekly blister pack dispensation versus mDOT. Among patients who go on to initiate HCV&#xD;
      treatment (n=600 targeted) with a once-daily combination regimen, a comparison will be&#xD;
      conducted of the proportion of patients in each arm who: (a) optimally adhere (&gt;=80%), (b)&#xD;
      complete treatment, (c) achieve SVR, and (d) develop resistance. The primary outcome will be&#xD;
      SVR. The 8 sites offer geographic and policy diversity: New York City, Baltimore, Providence,&#xD;
      Boston, Morgantown, Seattle, San Francisco, and Albuquerque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from diverse venues: OAT clinics, community health centers,&#xD;
      syringe exchange programs, community-based organizations, homeless programs, and cohorts&#xD;
      established by research studies. The clinical sites will determine eligibility based on&#xD;
      clinical records, or on-site testing including for HCV tests (anti-HCV and HCV viremia) and&#xD;
      drug toxicology testing as needed. Study participants will be screened, consented and&#xD;
      enrolled on-site at OAT and non-OAT clinic settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to one of two models of care: patient navigation (PN) vs.&#xD;
      modified directly observed treatment (mDOT). Patients enrolled from OAT clinics who are&#xD;
      receiving methadone and randomized to mDOT will receive doses of once daily medication at the&#xD;
      same time as they receive methadone. Patients enrolled from community health settings and&#xD;
      randomized to mDOT may receive observed doses in a range of settings including: at their&#xD;
      clinic, at home, a community site (e.g. at a coffee shop or other gathering place), or using&#xD;
      a mobile health app on a smartphone. Subjects randomized to PN will receive a standardized PN&#xD;
      intervention and additional support through a peer-led support group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for up to 140 weeks: 12 weeks of pre-treatment evaluation, 12&#xD;
      weeks of treatment, 12 weeks of follow-up to determine SVR12, and 104 weeks of follow-up to&#xD;
      determine long-term SVR and reinfection. Data sources will include clinical lab and imaging&#xD;
      results from medical records, blood tests (HCV viral load during long-term follow-up and&#xD;
      resistance assays), urine toxicology, questionnaires, electronic monitors for assessing&#xD;
      adherence, and interview.&#xD;

    <description>The study will follow a PN model (Check Hep C) developed by NYCDOH in collaboration with Montefiore and the community. HCV PNs will provide the following interventions to those randomized to the PN arm: coordination of HCV treatment; health promotion; assisting patients to overcome barriers; and psychosocial support.&#xD;
Health Promotion Sessions: PNs will deliver 4 standardized health promotion sessions to all patients either individually or within a group.&#xD;
Optional Weekly Support Groups: Subjects randomized to the PN arm will be offered weekly support groups led by Peers.</description>

    <description>OAT clinic setting: Observation of HCV medications will be linked to methadone visits among patients receiving methadone. Patients will be receiving methadone as part of routine clinical care for opioid addiction and not as an intervention related to this study. The schedule of five days per week will be considered modified DOT (mDOT). Subjects will initiate HCV treatment on Mondays if feasible. Take home medications will be packed in a weekly electronic blister pack.&#xD;
Community health clinic setting: This intervention is considered modified DOT (mDOT) since between 3-5 weekly doses will be directly observed. A minimum of one dose will be observed in person by clinic/study staff. For the remaining observed doses, the research staff and provider will present the participant with a menu of options and determine what will work best for that participant.</description>
