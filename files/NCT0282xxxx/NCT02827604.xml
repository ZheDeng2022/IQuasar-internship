      This prospective, clinical, observational study compares preoperative and intraoperative&#xD;
      sonographic assessment of lower uterine segment of women who underwent ≥ second cesarean&#xD;
      section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the purpose of the study to assess transabdominal (linear/convex ultrasound probe) and&#xD;
      transvaginal approach versus intraoperative sonographic assessment of lower uterine segment.&#xD;

      In 1991, 126.297 (15.3%) women delivered by caesarean section in Germany. Since then, the&#xD;
      rate of caesarean section increased steadily over the next 20 years, reaching up to 32.2% in&#xD;
      2011 [https://www.destatis.de]. The absolute risk of uterine rupture in vaginal birth after&#xD;
      Caesarean section is 1 in 100 deliveries. The risk of perinatal death or the outcome of&#xD;
      extremely neurological impairment is 1 in 1000 deliveries [Cunningham et al., 2009].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistically more than 300 pregnant women with a prior caesarean delivery visit daily&#xD;
      ultrasound departments of german hospitals to investigate the C-section scar before delivery.&#xD;
      They have one important question: Is it possible to predict successful trial of labor after&#xD;
      cesarean delivery? [AQUA-Institut] The information for the risk of uterine rupture remains&#xD;
      insufficient based only on ultrasonography assessment [Varner et al., 2012].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement technique for lower uterine segment (myometrial) thicknesses in the third&#xD;
      trimester have been described by several authors. Using a combination of preoperative&#xD;
      transvaginal and transabdominal (linear/convex probe) ultrasound, we compare with&#xD;
      intraoperative sonographic assessment of lower uterine segment of women who underwent ≥&#xD;
      second cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to assess transabdominal (linear/convex ultrasound probe) and&#xD;
      transvaginal approach versus intraoperative sonographic assessment of lower uterine segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will allow the investigators to draw conclusions regarding the best method to assessment&#xD;
      of lower uterine segment (myometrial) thickness in the third trimester to predict successful&#xD;
      trial of labor after cesarean delivery.&#xD;
