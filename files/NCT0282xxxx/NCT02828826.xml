  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At home, maintenance, physical performance declines more or less rapidly from 6 weeks&#xD;
      depending advancing age and duration of the training period . It is feared that the advice or&#xD;
      prescription of regular physical maintenance at the exit of the service, has only adherence&#xD;
      to the 50% like the medication prescribed. A US study of 2000 on the observance of healthy&#xD;
      living recommendations, despite the many messages promoting physical activity, shows that&#xD;
      only 24% of Americans aged 65 to 74 were taking physical activity regular. There are no&#xD;
      French-date data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If physical maintenance is routinely recommended for the elderly living at home, so the way&#xD;
      to encourage these people to practice more often possible these recommendations remains&#xD;
      therefore a problem of public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent OSSEBO study (intervention for the prevention of injurious falls in elderly women:&#xD;
      background and design) recalled the interest to propose a program of physical exercise to&#xD;
      reduce trauma and falls in the elderly. It also shows the possibility to implement an&#xD;
      effective program on a long-term and large scale in France. The study allowed patients to&#xD;
      participate in collective sessions of physical exercises, within the framework of an&#xD;
      association. Patients were invited to continue their home exercises they had learned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, the investigators hypothesize that the monthly telephone coaching , directed by the&#xD;
      physical therapist following a physical fitness exercise program which they have been trained&#xD;
      during their hospitalization in SSR , would allow older patients to maintain fallers their&#xD;
      physical performance at home for at least 6 months after leaving&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before to the start of the study, physical therapists and CRA (clinical research associate)&#xD;
      will be trained in the specifics of this research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged 65 and older, with physiotherapy treatment, investigators will be offered to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiotherapist of the investigative service will inform the patient of the terms of the&#xD;
      study and will give the necessary information on the physical maintenance program,&#xD;
      (presenting the program, verification of the correct understanding of the program and it ran&#xD;
      properly, recall the entry on a calendar associated to the program booklet whenever the&#xD;
      program achieved, advice on the interests of the exercises as many times as possible per&#xD;
      week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient agrees to participate, the physical therapist will give him a copy of the&#xD;
      prospectus and gather written consent after a delay of 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will receive the booklet detailing the physical exercise program and allowing him&#xD;
      to record his achievement of physical exercise and its possible falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the inclusion of the patient, the physiotherapist will inform the computerized data&#xD;
      file and will proceed to randomization via Clinsight® software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be informed of the group in which it is randomized (with or without&#xD;
      telephone coaching ) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will receive a summons for assessments to M6 and M12 to be carried on the website&#xD;
      of the investigation center . It will be recalled him to bring his book.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before its release SSR ( M0 ), the patient will benefit included in the initial assessment&#xD;
      including a TUG ( Score Time UP and Go), VAS (Visual Analog Scale ) measures the fear of&#xD;
      falling , the IADL (INSTRUMENTAL ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING), the FTSST (Five Times Sit to&#xD;
      Stand Test) and score the one leg balance test . The running score 4 meters. This initial&#xD;
      evaluation will be conducted by the physiotherapist or the CRA by location Patients&#xD;
      randomized to the control group will not receive telephone coaching . Patients will only&#xD;
      record the achievement of physical exercises and the occurrence of falls in their booklet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the experimental group will benefit from the telephone coaching , with&#xD;
      5 phone calls programmed by the physiotherapist according to the most convenient times for&#xD;
      the patient, due to appointments per month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of each telephone coaching is estimated at 20mn . As patients in the control arm&#xD;
      , Patients will record their physical exercise sessions and the occurrence of falls in their&#xD;
      booklet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The telephone coaching conducted by the physiotherapist with patients is to assess the number&#xD;
      of exercises performed, the number of falls may have occurred, assess the fear of falling and&#xD;
      overall assessment of the patient's general condition and a self-assessment of their physical&#xD;
      ability (one leg balance, fear of falling, FTSST). With this information, the therapist may&#xD;
      encourage patients to practice more diligently exercises can even strengthen the practice of&#xD;
      some based on its evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the telephone coaching will be recorded in the eCRF ( Case Report Form).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A M6, the patients in both study arms will receive an evaluation including a TUG, EVA&#xD;
      measures the fear of falling, the IADL, the FTSST, walking speed and score the one leg&#xD;
      balance test. The number of re hospitalizations and use of a physiotherapist for motor&#xD;
      rehabilitation will also be sought from the patient and her doctor if necessary. This&#xD;
      evaluation will be carried out by a TEC, as part of a consultation center investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the evaluation M6, patients in the experimental arm no longer benefit from&#xD;
      telephone coaching. As for patients in the control arm, they will only record their exercise&#xD;
      sessions and the occurrence of falls in their booklet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final evaluation of patients will be performed at M12 (same as M6) Following the visits and&#xD;
      phone calls, the study data will be recorded in the eCRF by the CRA and / or physiotherapist&#xD;
      investigators centers.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The test is simple, attainable in 3 minutes in a quiet room with no noise with a standard chair with armrests. A line is marked on the ground at 3m from the chair. The examiner, provides with a stopwatch, should not encourage the patient. The patient performs the test with his shoes and his usual technical assistance. The patient should walk at a comfortable pace and as naturally as possible. The patient will have to stand up, turn around and return to the line sit.&#xD;
The test is performed 2 times: once to verify that the patient understands the instructions, then again timed.&#xD;
Reproducing the test has a degree of correlation between r = 0.92 and 0.99. There is excellent agreement between the various evaluators (0.93 to 0.99 correlation coefficient) (49).&#xD;
The TUG shows good diagnostic validity with a sensitivity and a specificity of 87% for the fall prediction .</description>
