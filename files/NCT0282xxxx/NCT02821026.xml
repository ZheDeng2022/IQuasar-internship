      Islet transplantation is a relatively new procedure used in people with difficult to control&#xD;
      Type 1 diabetes. Insulin producing cells (islets) are isolated from a pancreas of a deceased&#xD;
      organ donor. After the cells are carefully prepared, the islets are transplanted into&#xD;
      patient's body. These transplanted islets may produce insulin for the patient. Patient may be&#xD;
      able to reduce or eliminate the need for insulin injections for an unknown period of time.&#xD;
      Patients who receive an islet transplant may need to stay on powerful immunosuppressive drugs&#xD;
      for as long as the islets remain alive and working. These drugs help to prevent the immune&#xD;
      system from attacking the transplanted islets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under current standard of care procedure, islets are transplanted into patient's liver. The&#xD;
      investigators have learned that some of these cells do not survive the current procedure and&#xD;
      are lost around the time of transplant. Therefore in this study, the investigators are&#xD;
      studying a new transplant procedure that may help prevent this islet cell loss. The new&#xD;
      procedure involves transplanting the islets into an omental pouch instead of into the liver.&#xD;
      The omentum is a large apron-like fold of membrane inside the abdomen that drapes over the&#xD;
      intestines. This study will test to see if omental islet transplantation is safe and&#xD;
      effective. Standard immunosuppressive medicines (anti-thymocyte globulin, tacrolimus,&#xD;
      mycophenolic acid, sirolimus, etanercept) will be used in this study to prevent rejection of&#xD;
      the islets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a collaborative research with the University of Miami, and the same study&#xD;
      protocol has been in use over there. Recruitment in Edmonton will continue until all subjects&#xD;
      [N=6] needed for the study are transplanted. All subjects in this study will receive islet&#xD;
      transplants using the study procedure.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current islet transplantation into the portal vein of the liver has shown the unique ability&#xD;
      of islets to stabilize blood glucose levels and prevent severe hypoglycemia in a selected&#xD;
      group of subjects with type 1 diabetes. The main limitations of islet transplantation are the&#xD;
      need for systemic immunosuppression to maintain function and the loss of islet function over&#xD;
      time. Additionally, many studies have demonstrated that the current site of transplantation&#xD;
      in the liver is not an ideal site due to several factors. These factors include (1)&#xD;
      significant liver inflammation following islet infusion; (2) potential for life-threatening&#xD;
      procedure-related complications such as bleeding and thrombosis; (3) high levels of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs and GI toxins in the liver contributing to islet toxicity; (4) the&#xD;
      inability to retrieve islets after infusion; and (5) development of graft dysfunction in a&#xD;
      number of recipients of intrahepatic allogeneic and autologous islets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these premises, development of a clinical protocol for the implantation of islets&#xD;
      into the omentum is a desirable goal. As an attempt to maximize the engraftment of islet cell&#xD;
      clusters onto the omentum, implantation site should promote islet adherence to the omental&#xD;
      peritoneal layer and avoid cell pelleting. Dr. Alejandro's team at University of Miami has&#xD;
      recently performed a series of experiments in animal models of diabetes to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of transplanting pancreatic islets in the omentum using a plasma-thrombin gel.&#xD;
      With that approach, the islets are re-suspended in either donor or autologous plasma and&#xD;
      distributed in the omental pouch (created by sutures) to avoid pelleting. Cell adherence is&#xD;
      achieved by addition of clinical-grade recombinant human thrombin that reacts with plasma to&#xD;
      create a biocompatible, degradable gel containing the islet graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have outlined the initial patient trial as 6 subjects, based on clinical&#xD;
      judgment and extensive experience in clinical islet transplantation trials. If initial safety&#xD;
      and efficacy is satisfactory (no adverse events related to the transplantation and efficacy&#xD;
      in 2 of the 3 first transplanted subjects), the investigators will transplant 3 additional&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: To demonstrate the safety of islet transplantation into an omental pouch site for the&#xD;
      treatment of subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy: To demonstrate the efficacy of islet transplantation into an omental pouch site for&#xD;
      the treatment of T1D in subjects with hypoglycemia unawareness and a history of severe&#xD;
      hypoglycemic episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety endpoint is to demonstrate patient safety throughout all stages of the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects with HbA1c ≤6.5% at 1 year AND&#xD;
      free of severe hypoglycemic events from Day 28 to Day 365, inclusive, after the islet&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy endpoints: At 75±7, 365 ± 14 ,and 730 ± 14 days following the islet&#xD;
      transplant(s): the percent reduction in insulin requirements; HbA1c; Mean Amplitude of&#xD;
      Glycemic Excursions (MAGE); Lability Index (LI); Ryan hypoglycemia severity (HYPO) score;&#xD;
      Clarke score; number of severe hypoglycemic episodes; basal (fasting) and 90-min glucose and&#xD;
      c-peptide derived from the mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT); beta-score; C-peptide creatinine&#xD;
      ratio; acute insulin response to glucose (AIRglu), insulin sensitivity, and disposition index&#xD;
      derived from the insulin-modified frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance (FSIGT)&#xD;

      monitoring system® (CGMS); and Quality of life (QOL) measures: EuroQol five dimensions&#xD;
      questionnaire (EQ-5D), Hypoglycemia Fear Survey (HFS), SF-36v2, Diabetes Distress scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary safety endpoints: Safety, including incidence of post-transplant infections,&#xD;
      malignancies, morbidity, and other adverse events (AEs) (e.g., increased body weight and&#xD;
      hypertension) associated with conventional immunosuppression. Renal function as measured by&#xD;
      serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and other relevant laboratory parameters.&#xD;
      Lipid profiles (triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol) over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 75 ± 7 and 365 ± 14 days following the islet transplant, and at two years following the&#xD;
      final islet transplant: the incidence and severity of AEs related to the islet transplant&#xD;
      procedure including: bleeding (&gt;2 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin concentration); wound&#xD;
      complication (infection or subsequent hernia); torsion of omentum; gastrointestinal&#xD;
      obstruction; abscess; cysts; need for surgical intervention. The incidence and severity of&#xD;
      AEs related to the immunosuppression including: allergy; reduction in GFR; addition or&#xD;
      intensification of antihyperlipidemic therapy; gastrointestinal toxicity; neutropenia,&#xD;
      anemia, or thrombocytopenia; viral, bacterial, or fungal infections; and benign or malignant&#xD;
      neoplasms. The incidence of immune sensitization defined by presence of anti-HLA antibodies&#xD;
      absent prior to transplantation. The incidence of discontinuation of immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to transplantation, the patient is screened, qualified, listed for transplant, and&#xD;
      signs the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time a suitable islet preparation becomes available, the patient will receive&#xD;
      allogeneic islet cells placed in an omental pouch. The details of this surgical procedure&#xD;
      will be addressed in Question 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Islet transplant will be performed under Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (ATG, Thymoglobulin®)&#xD;
      induction immunosuppression (5 doses, day -2 prior to transplant to day 2 post-transplant).&#xD;
      Maintenance mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) therapy (1-2 g/day as BID dosing) will be started on&#xD;
      Day -1 pre-transplant. Tacrolimus will be administered orally twice daily on Day 1&#xD;
      post-transplant to maintain a trough level of 10-12 ng/mL for 3 months, then 6-10 ng/mL&#xD;
      thereafter. Etanercept will be given IV before the islet transplant (50 mg), and then at 25&#xD;
      mg (subcutaneously) on post-operative day (POD) +3, +7 and +10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW UP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will undergo a 24-month follow-up period following their islet transplant. 19 study&#xD;
      visits during the first year after the transplant, and 4 more study visits during the 2nd&#xD;
      year after the transplant.&#xD;

    <description>At the time a suitable islet preparation becomes available, the patient will receive allogeneic islet cells placed in an omental pouch. Islet transplant will be performed under Anti-Thymocyte Globulin induction immunosuppression (5 doses, day -2 prior to transplant to day 2 post-transplant). Maintenance mycophenolate mofetil therapy (1-2 g/day as BID dosing) will be started on Day -1 pre-transplant. Tacrolimus will be administered orally twice daily on Day 1 post-transplant to maintain a trough level of 10-12 ng/mL for 3 months, then 6-10 ng/mL thereafter. Etanercept will be given IV before the islet transplant (50 mg), and then at 25 mg (subcutaneously) on POD +3, +7 and +10. Sirolimus will be used in case of tacrolimus or/and mycophenolate mofetil intolerance.</description>

    <description>The intervention is transplanting the islets into an omental pouch instead of into the liver. The omentum is a large apron-like fold of membrane inside the abdomen that drapes over the intestines. This study will test to see if omental islet transplantation is safe and effective. Standard immunosuppressive medicines (anti-thymocyte globulin, tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid, sirolimus, etanercept) will be used in this study to prevent rejection of the islets.</description>
