      There is paucity of literature on the effects of intrathecal morphine on the postoperative&#xD;
      hemodynamics in the cardiac-surgical patients.We planned this study to compare the&#xD;
      post-operative hemodynamic effects (particularly the incidence of vasoplegia in the two study&#xD;
      groups) and outcome of combined general anesthesia + high spinal block, with or without&#xD;
      intrathecal morphine in patients undergoing cardiac-surgical procedures in our set up.&#xD;

      Introduction Currently various strategies are being developed for fast tracking in cardiac&#xD;
      anaesthesia that includes use of shorter acting opioids , combined thoracic epidural or high&#xD;
      spinal anaesthesia with GA, awake cardiac surgery along with normothermic or mild hypothermic&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and off pump surgeries. The aim of fast tracking is early&#xD;
      extubation, early mobilization, decreased length of ICU and overall hospital stay, not only&#xD;
      to reduce costs and human resource utilisation but also to reduce the postoperative morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality while enhancing the quality of health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally high dose opioid anaesthesia has been used to abolish this stress response,&#xD;
      however, some studies have shown that this technique of anaesthesia only relatively minimizes&#xD;
      the stress response and does not completely block it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anaesthesia in the form of thoracic epidural anaesthesia (TEA) alone (awake cardiac&#xD;
      anaesthesia) or combined with general anaesthesia (GA) has been used in cardiac surgical&#xD;
      patients. One of the useful alternatives to TEA would be high spinal anaesthesia as the risk&#xD;
      of haematoma associated with this procedure is much less than the epidural in cardiac&#xD;
      surgical patients. The use of spinal anaesthesia in cardiac patients, particularly patients&#xD;
      with stenotic valvular lesions has been for long viewed with much apprehension, primarily due&#xD;
      to the perceived risk of hypotension as a result of sympatholysis. However, various studies&#xD;
      using high spinal up to T1 level have proved such apprehensions to be invalid in the setting&#xD;
      of cardiac surgery where patients are monitored intensively with invasive monitors and the&#xD;
      hypotension managed at the earliest with the use of small aliquots or continuous infusion of&#xD;
      vasoactive agents such as phenylephrine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, mephentermine as per&#xD;
      the requirements of underlying cardiac lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although thoracic epidural anaesthesia has been studied and practiced, there is paucity of&#xD;
      literature on the effects of intrathecal morphine on the postoperative hemodynamics in the&#xD;
      cardiac-surgical patients.Hence, the investigators planned this study to compare the&#xD;
      post-operative hemodynamic effects and outcome of combined light general anesthesia + high&#xD;
      spinal block, with or without intrathecal morphine in patients undergoing cardiac-surgical&#xD;
      procedures in our set up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis Addition of intrathecal morphine in high spinal anesthesia does not affect&#xD;
      postoperative hemodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives A. Primary end point&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To look for incidence of Vasoplegia (defined by MAP &lt; 60mmHg with cardiac index &gt;&#xD;
      2.2L/min/m2 or requirement of vasopressors to maintain the MAP &gt; 60 mmHg in presence of&#xD;
      cardiac index &gt; 2.2L/min/m2) in the study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Secondary end point 1. Mechanical ventilation duration, time to extubation, requirement of&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia based on VAS, spirometry performance and incidence of awareness under&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods After obtaining ethics committee approval and informed written consent&#xD;
      of the patients, this study will be conducted in 60 adult patients with valvular heart&#xD;
      disease and coronary artery disease of New York Heart Association class II-III aged 18 to 60&#xD;
      years undergoing elective cardiac surgery. All patients will receive their usual&#xD;
      cardiovascular medications except angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin and&#xD;
      diuretics on the morning of surgery as per our institutional practice. On arrival inside&#xD;
      operating room and after securing peripheral venous access with 16 G catheter, continuous&#xD;
      monitoring will be instituted that will include 5-lead electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      end-tidal capnometry, and invasive arterial blood pressure through a 20-G catheter inserted&#xD;
      in a radial artery. A central venous catheter will be inserted before induction of&#xD;
      anaesthesia under local anaesthesia and mild sedation with midazolam 0.04mg/kg body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANESTHESIA PROTOCOL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal anesthesia - All study patients will receive spinal anaesthesia prior to induction of&#xD;
      GA. Patient will be placed in lateral position, parts painted and draped under strict aseptic&#xD;
      precautions. Heavy bupivacaine 40 mg will be administered in all patients at the level of&#xD;
      L2-3 or L3-4 intervertebral space in the Spinal group. Heavy bupivacaine (Anawin heavy 0.5%,&#xD;
      Neon laboratories LTD, Thane, India) 40 mg mixed with preservative free morphine sulphate 250&#xD;
      mcg (VERMOR 15,Verve health care limited, Delhi, India) will be given in L2-3 or L3-4 space&#xD;
      to all patients in the Opioid group. The patient will be then turned to supine position and a&#xD;
      30 degree Trendelenburg position will be maintained till sensory loss to a level of T1 is&#xD;
      achieved. The sensory level will be assessed by loss of sensation to cold stimulation (Spirit&#xD;
      swab), all the while administering 100% oxygen through a breathing system. Patient will&#xD;
      receive 100% oxygen by mask for 10 minutes and in case of respiratory depression will be&#xD;
      gently assisted in respiration. Once desired level is achieved, GA in both groups will be&#xD;
      induced with midazolam 1-2 mg, ketamine 20-30 mg plus lignocaine 2mg/kg and propofol 20-40 mg&#xD;
      titrated to maintain hemodynamics and to loss of eyelash reflex. Inj. Vecuronium bromide&#xD;
      0.1mg/kg will be used as muscle relaxant to facilitate tracheal intubation and lignocaine&#xD;
      spray (LOX 10% spray, Neon laboratories LTD, Thane, India) will be used over vocal cords&#xD;
      prior to intubation to blunt the sympathetic stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent anaesthesia will be maintained in all the patients in both the groups with&#xD;
      isoflurane inhalation to maintain BIS values between 40-60 or end-tidal isoflurane of 1-MAC.&#xD;
      Patients will be mechanically ventilated with 50% oxygen-air mixture and minute ventilation&#xD;
      will be adjusted to achieve normocapnia till sternotomy. Vasoactive drug phenylephrine&#xD;
      100ug/ml will be prepared and boluses (1-2 ug/kg) given to all patients to maintain MAP &gt; 60&#xD;
      mmHg (stable haemodynamics) on CPB. Normothermic CPB will be carried in all cases. Hematocrit&#xD;
      of &gt; 24% will be maintained in all patients on CPB. Total dose of phenylephrine received&#xD;
      before and on bypass will be recorded in both the groups. Anesthesia and hemodynamics on&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) will be maintained with isoflurane in oxygen-air mixture&#xD;
      connected to the CPB machine and anesthesia post CPB period will be maintained with&#xD;
      isoflurane in oxygen-air mixture. All patients will receive fentanyl 1ug/kg atleast 5-minutes&#xD;
      before sternal closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline pre-CPB TEE evaluation of LVOT diameter and LVOT area in ME-AV long axis view&#xD;
      (average of three readings) will be recorded and used as a standard for subsequent&#xD;
      calculation of cardiac output and cardiac index post-CPB and in ICU. Intra-operative TEE will&#xD;
      be used to calculate the LVOT VTI (mean of three values) either in the transgastric long axis&#xD;
      view or the deep transgastric long axis view (which ever gives better alignment) 15 minutes&#xD;
      after separation from CPB and before transfer to ICU with simultaneous recording of systemic&#xD;
      pressures (SBP,DBP and MAP). Vasoplegia in our study will be defined by mean arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure &lt; 60 mmHg with cardiac index â‰¥ 2.2 l/min/m2 or requirement for vasopressors to&#xD;
      maintain MAP &gt; 60 mmHg in presence of cardiac index â‰¥ 2.2 l/min/m2 65.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean of three reading taken five minutes apart before anaesthesia induction (prior to&#xD;
      administration of spinal anaesthesia in spinal group) in both groups will be taken as&#xD;
      baseline values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ionotropes will be used according to the underlying cardiac pathology. A combination of&#xD;
      milrinone and norepinephrine will be used in patients with right ventricular dysfunction and&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial hypertension ; a combination of dobutamine and norepinephrine/epinephrine&#xD;
      will be used in patients with LV dysfunction ; in patients with biventricular dysfunction&#xD;
      milrinone and norepinephrine/epinephrine will be used and low dose norepinephrine will be&#xD;
      used in patients with diastolic dysfunction. Total dose of vasoactive drugs used in the&#xD;
      postoperative period in the both the groups will be recorded in first 48 hours and analysed.&#xD;
      In the ICU, following parameters will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic parameters (HR, SBP, DBP, MAP, CVP) will be recorded 4 hourly for 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional hemodynamic readings will be recorded at any point hemodynamic instability&#xD;
           (defined by MAP &lt; 60 mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LVOT VTI will be measured in apical 5-chamber view and used to calculate SV. LVOT VTI&#xD;
           derived will be multiplied with LVOT area (derived already on TEE) to calculate SV which&#xD;
           will be multiplied by the HR of the patient at that point of time to calculate CO and CI&#xD;
           every 4 hourly for 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uniform rescue analgesia will be given to all the patients as per ICU protocol when the&#xD;
           value on the Visual analog scale (VAS) is more than.&#xD;
&#xD;
           . Postoperative Hb (gm/dl)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of residual sensory and motor blockade and occurrence of new onset motor&#xD;
           blockade&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of ventilation and time to extubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record of complications (nausea,vomiting,pruritis) if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intra-operative awareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be taken as an open end, pilot feasibility study, that is, more of subjects will be&#xD;
      added if the desired number (30) in each group is reached within less than the stipulated&#xD;
      time period for thesis desertion submission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be done using the SPSS software. All the parametric data such as&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters, time to extubation, and time to transfer to step down post&#xD;
      anaesthesia care unit will be analysed using Unpaired t-tests. Chi-square (Ï‡2) test will be&#xD;
      used to analyse the requirement of vasoactive agents and the requirement of rescue analgesia.&#xD;
      Residual sensory and motor blockade will be analysed using Mann-Whitney test&#xD;
