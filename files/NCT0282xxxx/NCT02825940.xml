    <textblock>
      This Phase I, open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and&#xD;
      preliminary anti-tumor activity of atezolizumab as monotherapy in Chinese participants with&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, esophageal cancer, and&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that are refractory to standard therapeutic modalities and for&#xD;
      whom no further standard therapy is available or who have refused standard therapy; and the&#xD;
      safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of atezolizumab in combination with gemcitabine&#xD;
      and cisplatin in Chinese participants with Stage IV, treatment-naive non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC). The study will consist of a pharmacokinetic (PK) phase and an extension&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
