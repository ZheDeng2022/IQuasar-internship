    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well TG4010 and nivolumab work in previously treated patients&#xD;
      with non-small cell lung cancer. Vaccines that are made from a gene-modified virus, such as&#xD;
      TG4010, may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as nivolumab, interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;
      Giving TG4010 and nivolumab together may work better in previously treated patients with&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of nivolumab plus TG4010 (modified vaccinia virus Ankara [MVA]-human&#xD;
      mucin 1 [MUC1]-interleukin-2 [IL2] vaccine) in previously treated patients with stage IV non&#xD;
      squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with respect to objective response rate (ORR) by&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Define the safety and toxicity profile of nivolumab plus TG4010 by Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine progression-free survival by RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the duration of response and the occurrence of responses over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the rate and duration of stable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the disease control rate.&#xD;
