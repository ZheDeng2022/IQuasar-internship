      The main objective of this study is to determine whether the proposed program of therapeutic&#xD;
      exercise is effective in improving fatigue, more than the exercise unsupervised depending on&#xD;
      their preferences, in women treated for breast cancer.&#xD;

      Introduction: The prevalence of cancer-related fatigue in women treated for breast cancer is&#xD;
      about 30% having significant effects in reducing their quality of life. There is evidence of&#xD;
      the presence of sleep problems and immune response. Several studies claim that physical&#xD;
      exercise is effective during and after treatment of the disease as it improves the quality of&#xD;
      life, cardiorespiratory function, physical functioning and symptoms of fatigue although not&#xD;
      always found significant differences between intervention groups exercises compared with a&#xD;
      control group. Although the results of these studies are promising, generally present&#xD;
      methodological biases as small sample size, absence of masking, heterogeneous groups, lack of&#xD;
      monitoring short and long term and especially lack of specificity in relation to prescribed&#xD;
      exercise ( frequency, intensity, time and type of exercise).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and methods: A randomized clinical trial, the examiner being blinded unaware of the&#xD;
      intervention group to which subjects were assigned. Participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An experimental group, where the participants will be treated with Therapeutic Exercise;&#xD;
&#xD;
      And a group where will be done Physical Exercise according their preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-intervention, immediate post-intervention, 3 and 6 months assessments will be made. The&#xD;
      selection criteria will be: Adult women treated for breast cancer, completed at least 6&#xD;
      months before, with persistent fatigue. All participants must understand and sign freely&#xD;
      Informed Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: 40 women for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: A descriptive analysis of all variables was performed. It establish for all&#xD;
      cases a confidence level of 95% (p &lt;0.05). The effectiveness was assessed by comparing the&#xD;
      experienced change of the two groups in outcome variables between physical therapy&#xD;
      examinations.&#xD;
