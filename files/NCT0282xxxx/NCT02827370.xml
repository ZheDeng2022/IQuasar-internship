      The purpose of the study is to determine if a targeted dietary change can enhance the effect&#xD;
      of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;

      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I To determine if dietary alternations designed to downregulate the dominate molecular&#xD;
      drivers of an individuals' breast cancer will enhance the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      and allow for an increase in the pathologic complete response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      I) Investigator measurable changes to molecular and patient characteristics from precision&#xD;
      nutrition to determine a metric for evaluation this treatment in future studies.&#xD;

    <description>During chemotherapy, patients will receive dietary counseling based on the molecular pathways driving their specific breast cancers found through genetic testing. Nutritional recommendations will seek to down-regulate the dominant molecular drivers of an individual's breast cancer while they are receiving standard chemotherapy as outlined by their treating medical oncologist.</description>
