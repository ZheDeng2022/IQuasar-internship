      The project will test the strategy of integrating 25 hours of relationship education into an&#xD;
      existing employment program for low-income individuals ages 18-30. It will use a 2-arm&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to test the effect of this full package of services on&#xD;
      participants' employment outcomes and relationship outcomes.&#xD;

      The study will examine the programming by FWCA, which currently offers the Career Pathways&#xD;
      Bridge program in three locations in St. Louis County in Missouri. The evaluation will test&#xD;
      the strategy of integrating relationship education into an existing workforce readiness&#xD;
      program. FWCA plans to add approximately 17 hours of content from the Within My Reach&#xD;
      relationship education curriculum to the two-week job readiness workshop it offers as part of&#xD;
      the Career Pathways Bridge program. Second, FWCA will add up to eight additional one-hour&#xD;
      relationship skills education sessions that customers can attend in the five weeks after&#xD;
      completing the initial two-week job readiness workshop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation will use a 2-arm randomized controlled trial to test the effect of this full&#xD;
      package of services on participants' employment outcomes and relationship outcomes. The&#xD;
      target population will be low-income individuals ages 18-30 living in St. Louis County,&#xD;
      Missouri. The study will aim to enroll 1000 individuals over 2 years. The Metropolitan&#xD;
      Employment and Training (MET) Center will be the primary recruitment and service location.&#xD;
