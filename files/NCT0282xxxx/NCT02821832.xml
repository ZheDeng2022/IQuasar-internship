      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial lung infection. Typical treatment using anti-TB drugs lasts&#xD;
      about 6 months. Some people with less severe TB might not need to take the drugs that long.&#xD;
      Researchers think a PET/CT lung scan along with estimating how much TB is in the lungs might&#xD;
      show who will be cured after only 4 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate that 4 months of treatment is not inferior to 6 months of treatment for people&#xD;
      with less severe TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18-75 years old who have TB treatable with standard TB drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sputum sample: Participants will be asked to cough sputum into a cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest x-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will start TB drugs. They will have visits at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and about 6&#xD;
      more times during the 18-month study. Visits include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sputum samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET/CT scans at 2-3 visits: Participants fast for about 6 hours before the scan. Participants&#xD;
      get FDG, a type of sugar that gives off a small amount of radiation, through an arm vein.&#xD;
      They lie on a table in a machine that takes pictures of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest x-rays at 1-2 visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who we believe are likely to be cured at 4 months will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      get either 6 months of treatment or 4 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be asked to join a substudy using their sputum samples or additional blood&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Shortening the duration of treatment for patients with drug sensitive tuberculosis from 6 to&#xD;
      4 months has been attempted many times in clinical trials but thus far all have failed. These&#xD;
      failures reveal our incomplete understanding of factors driving the need for such extensive&#xD;
      treatments. Consistently, trials have demonstrated that 80-85% of patients are successfully&#xD;
      cured after 4 months of therapy, including the extensive set of studies from the British&#xD;
      Medical Research Council (BMRC) in the 1970s and 1980, the Tuberculosis Research Unit (TBRU)&#xD;
      treatment shortening study in non-cavitary patients who achieve early culture conversion, and&#xD;
      the more recent treatment shortening trials using fluoroquinolones like REMoxTB. The current&#xD;
      standard of care is to over-treat all patients for a total of 6-months to avoid relapse in a&#xD;
      small subset of patients at higher risk for incompletely understood reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For decades, clinical investigators have attempted to establish culture conversion as a&#xD;
      predictor of treatment success. Despite the appealing logic, the real correlation of culture&#xD;
      conversion as a surrogate endpoint has been consistently disappointing. In the REMoxTB trial,&#xD;
      in particular, the intensive microbiological data collected revealed unambiguously that&#xD;
      clearance of bacteria from the sputum did not sufficiently correlate with relapse risk to be&#xD;
      a useful surrogate for durable cure. An important subset of patients, despite clearing their&#xD;
      sputum of TB quickly and complying with all of their medications, still remained at high risk&#xD;
      of relapsing with active disease after stopping treatment. Likewise there are patients who&#xD;
      clear their sputum of bacteria slowly that nontheless go on to achieve durable cure.&#xD;
      Intuitively this makes sense: only those bacteria at the surface of a cavity are directly&#xD;
      open to the airways to seed the sputum. Yet this is not the full story as there are also&#xD;
      heterogeneous lesions within each individual patient which respond differently to treatment&#xD;
      with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol builds upon the historical trials and several successful small studies that&#xD;
      suggest that directly monitoring lung pathology using (18F)- FDG PET/CT correlates better&#xD;
      with treatment outcome than culture status. We will prospectively identify patients at low&#xD;
      risk based on their baseline radiographic extent of disease, and further refine this risk&#xD;
      score by evaluating the rate of resolution of the lung pathology (CT) and inflammation (PET)&#xD;
      at one month as well as checking an end-oftreatment GeneXpert test for the sustained presence&#xD;
      of bacteria. Patients classified as low risk will be randomized to receive a shortened 4-&#xD;
      month or a full 6-month course of therapy. If successful, this trial will both offer a badly&#xD;
      needed alternative to culture status as a trial-level surrogate marker for outcome as well as&#xD;
      provide critical information for preclinical and early clinical efforts to identify new&#xD;
      agents and combinations with the potential to shorten therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NIAID Data Safety Monitoring Board conducted its 7th interim review of unblinded data on&#xD;
      September 11, 2020. Following this review, the DSMB recommended halting randomization to Arms&#xD;
      B and C. This recommendation is based on the result of the interim analysis, when 1/3 of&#xD;
      randomized participants have been followed for 72 weeks from study entry. The protocol&#xD;
      stopping guideline for inferiority of the treatment shortening arm was met. The DSMB was also&#xD;
      presented with conditional power calculations relating to the futility interim analysis;&#xD;
      although the protocol-specified time for this analysis had not been reached, the results of&#xD;
      the analysis were consistent with a decision to terminate randomization into Arms B and C,&#xD;
      but to continue enrollment into Arms A and B at the discretion of the investigators.&#xD;
      Pre-emptive retreatment of participants who have completed the course of treatment in Arm C&#xD;
      is not recommended and should be left to the discretion of the treating clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A combination of radiographic characteristics at baseline, the rate of change of&#xD;
      these features at one month, and markers of residual bacterial load at the end of treatment&#xD;
      will identify patients with tuberculosis who are cured with 4 months (16 weeks) of standard&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
