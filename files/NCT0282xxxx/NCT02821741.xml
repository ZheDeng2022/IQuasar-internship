  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vagus nerve runs from the brain to many organs. Stimulating it can affect the experience&#xD;
      of pain. The nerve can be stimulated on the surface of the left ear. Researchers want to&#xD;
      study how this stimulation affects the perception of pain. They also want to study how mood&#xD;
      affects the experience of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effects of mood and vagus nerve stimulation on the experience of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 18 and older who are fluent in English&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be pre-screened with a 15-minute phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have three 2-hour visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the screening visit, participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and psychiatric history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical and psychological exams&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires about physical and psychiatric health and mood&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      A heat probe on the forearm. The temperature will be increased until it is painful&#xD;
&#xD;
      but tolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2 testing sessions within 7 days. Before the testing, they cannot do&#xD;
      the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eat, use nicotine, or exercise for at least 2 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drink alcohol for 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Take certain medicines for 3 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine drug screening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left ear stimulation: In one session, the vagus nerve will be stimulated. In the other, an&#xD;
      area&#xD;
&#xD;
      of the ear away from the vagus nerve will be stimulated. This will be done with mild electric&#xD;
&#xD;
      shocks that cause a tingling, pricking, or itchy feeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heat applied to the forearm until it is painful but tolerable&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completing several forms on a computer or on paper about how they are feeling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitors on the chest and a finger clip to monitor heart, breathing, and blood pressure&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This double-blind, randomized, controlled, cross-over study on healthy participants will&#xD;
      evaluate the perceptual differences of pain and changes in mood in response to peripheral&#xD;
      nerve stimulation over two regions of the left external ear. A series of short and long&#xD;
      duration heat stimuli will be applied to the participants forearms and they will be asked to&#xD;
      rate their current mood state, the intensity of the pain, and whether it was pleasant or&#xD;
      unpleasant. The series of heat stimuli will be applied before, during, and after mild&#xD;
      electrical stimulation of the left external ear using a commercially available TENS unit.&#xD;
      There are two study sessions. Session 1 involves eligibility screening, a brief practice&#xD;
      session, followed by the testing session. In Session 2 (no more than 7 days later), the&#xD;
      testing session will be repeated with the exception of the location of ear stimulation. Up to&#xD;
      76 people, ages 18-50 years old, will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
