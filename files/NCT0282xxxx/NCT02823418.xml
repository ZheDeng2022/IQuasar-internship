    <textblock>
      Postpartum depression (PPD) affects approximately 15% of women during the first year after&#xD;
      giving birth, and is common across cultures. The etiology of postpartum depression is not&#xD;
      totally clear. The severe pain experienced during childbirth was reported to be associated&#xD;
      with the development of postpartum depression. The purpose of the present study is to&#xD;
      evaluate whether use of neuraxial labor analgesia can reduce the incidence of postpartum&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Postpartum depression (PPD) affects approximately 15% of women during the first year after&#xD;
      giving birth, and is common across cultures. In postpartum Chinese women, the reported&#xD;
      incidence ranged from 6.5% to 29.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of postpartum depression is not totally clear. Identified risk factors include&#xD;
      previous maternal blues, unplanned pregnancy, lack of marital or social support, and previous&#xD;
      psychiatric illnesses. Furthermore, the severe pain experienced during childbirth was&#xD;
      reported to be associated with the occurrence of postpartum depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study of the investigators found that use of epidural analgesia during labor was&#xD;
      associated with decreased risk of postpartum depression. However, several limitations existed&#xD;
      in that study and further evidence is needed to reconfirm the finding. The purpose of the&#xD;
      present study is to reevaluate whether use of neuraxial labor analgesia can reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of postpartum depression.&#xD;
