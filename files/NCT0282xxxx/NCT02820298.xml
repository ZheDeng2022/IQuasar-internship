  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a high-fat meal on the levels of&#xD;
      bexagliflozin in the blood in healthy subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single center, Phase 1, open-label, 2 × 2 crossover study designed to assess the&#xD;
      effects of a high-fat meal on the PK of orally administered bexagliflozin tablets in 18&#xD;
      healthy adults. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive bexagliflozin tablets with a high-fat&#xD;
      meal on day 1 and without a meal on day 8 after an overnight fast or to receive bexagliflozin&#xD;
      tablets without a meal on day 1 after an overnight fast and with a high-fat meal on day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were admitted to the clinic on the day before dosing in each treatment period, and&#xD;
      stayed in the clinic until 48 h post-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects dosed in the fed state received an oral bexagliflozin tablet, 20 mg, 30 min&#xD;
      after starting to consume a high-fat meal following an overnight fast. The meal was to be&#xD;
      ingested in its entirety over an approximate 25-minute period, such that it was completed at&#xD;
      least 5 minutes prior to the scheduled time of bexagliflozin dosing for the fed state&#xD;
      treatment. Subjects dosed in the fasting state received an oral bexagliflozin tablet, 20 mg,&#xD;
      after an overnight fast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for bexagliflozin plasma concentrations were collected at 0 h (pre-dose), and&#xD;
      at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 48 h post-dose. Urine collection in 12 h&#xD;
      batches was performed at pre-dose (-12 to 0 h on day 0 and day 7), and at post-dose (0 to 12&#xD;
      h, 12 to 24 h, 24 to 36 h, and 36 to 48 h) intervals.&#xD;
