      The goal of this research is to determine the effectiveness of a powered prosthesis compared&#xD;
      to an unpowered prosthesis during short bouts of walking, extended periods of walking (to&#xD;
      fatigue), and performance in the community.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals are living in the United States with limb loss. With the use of a prosthetic&#xD;
      device many individuals can stay active, but most do not achieve a medically desired physical&#xD;
      activity level. This creates a risk for cardiovascular disease. It is thought that&#xD;
      individuals with amputation walk less because it is more difficult to get around, and recent&#xD;
      advances in robotic prosthetic technology may make such activities easier. However, these&#xD;
      prostheses have not yet been evaluated to determine their effectiveness during extended&#xD;
      periods of walking. Despite the goals in design of new devices it is unclear whether&#xD;
      individuals using them are able to incorporate them into making daily activities easier.&#xD;
      Therefore, the goal of this research is to determine the effectiveness of a powered&#xD;
      prosthesis compared to an unpowered prosthesis during long periods of walking.&#xD;

    <measure>Total Steps Outside the Home Over a Two Week Period</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Activity data we be collected using activity monitors and GPS with both the regular prosthesis and the powered ankle prosthesis. Each activity monitoring period will last 2 weeks and will be done within in a 2 month period.

    <measure>Quality of Life (QoL) on a Short-Form 36</measure>
    <time_frame>Questionnaire completed 2 weeks after wearing each prosthesis</time_frame>
    <description>Participants completed the Medical Outcomes Study 36 Items Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) after each condition. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Questionnaire completed 2 weeks after wearing each prosthesis</time_frame>
    <description>Participants completed a survey to evaluate their prosthetic satisfaction (Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire) after each condition. Most questions in the PEQ use a visual analog scale format. Each visual analog scale is scored as a continuous numerical variable measured as the distance in millimeters from the left endpoint of the line (0 mm) to the point at which the respondent's mark crosses the line (up to 100 mm). The questions are all worded so that a higher number (toward the right) will correspond with a more positive response.&#xD;
Ambulation - Greater number = increased perceived ambulation Appearance - Greater number = better appearance Frustration - Greater number = less frustration Perceived Response - Greater number = increased perceived response Residual Limb Health - Greater number = better residual limb health Social burden - Greater number = less social burden Sounds - Greater number = less sound Utility - Greater</description>

    <measure>Muscle Activity in the Lower Limb</measure>
    <time_frame>Testing took place after the participant wore the prosthesis for 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants walk on a treadmill while muscle activity from various lower limb muscles are monitored using electromyography. We calculated the integrated EMG (iEMG) for each muscle collected as the total activity in that muscle as a percentage of the maximum signal.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Recruitment began after initial approval from the University of Michigan IRB (July 2016). Participants were recruited through the University of Michigan Orthotics and Prosthetics Clinic by a study physician and study prosthetist in-person, through phone or email, or with flyers.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were asked to complete both arms of the study. Before starting, participants were randomly enrolled in the dynamic response foot (unpowered prosthesis) or powered condition to start with. Some participants completed both arms while others only finished one of the arms.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Powered Ankle Prosthesis, Then Unpowered Prosthesis</title>
          <description>In this condition, the participant was fitted with a powered prosthetic ankle by a certified prosthetist to start the study. The ankle is the BiOM which is manufactured by Bionx (which used to be named iWalk). This device was given 510(K) Exempt status by the FDA under (regulation number: 890.3500). Participants had at least one week to acclimate to the prosthesis. They then will wore the device for 2 weeks at home, while their activity was monitored. They then came to the lab for testing. The powered prosthesis was removed and their prescribed prosthetic foot was reattached to their existing socket. They then wore their prescribed prosthesis for 2 weeks, while their activity was monitored, before returning to the lab for testing.</description>

        <description>Participants completed a survey to evaluate their prosthetic satisfaction (Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire) after each condition. Most questions in the PEQ use a visual analog scale format. Each visual analog scale is scored as a continuous numerical variable measured as the distance in millimeters from the left endpoint of the line (0 mm) to the point at which the respondent's mark crosses the line (up to 100 mm). The questions are all worded so that a higher number (toward the right) will correspond with a more positive response.&#xD;

          <title>Powered Ankle Prosthesis</title>
          <description>In this condition, the participant is fitted with a powered prosthetic ankle by a certified prosthetist. The ankle is the BiOM which is manufactured by Bionx (which used to be named iWalk). This device was given 510(K) Exempt status by the FDA under (regulation number: 890.3500). After accommodation, participants wore the device for 2 weeks.&#xD;
Powered ankle prosthesis: This device is a commercially available powered ankle prosthesis, (BioM, Bionx, Bedford, MA) which was given FDA device exempt status.&#xD;
We monitored for adverse events the entire time the participant had the device at home for accommodation and monitoring (~ 3 weeks)</description>

          <description>In this arm, participants will wear their clinically prescribed dynamic response foot (unpowered prosthesis). This period is 2 weeks long.&#xD;
Dynamic Response Foot: This condition is a sham condition as the participant will wear the prosthesis they were clinically prescribed and usually wear.&#xD;
We monitored for adverse events the entire time the person wore their device at home and were monitored (2 weeks).</description>
