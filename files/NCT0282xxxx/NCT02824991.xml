      Background: One treatment of Muscle trigger points (MTrPs) is deep dry needling (DN) with the&#xD;
      purpose of obtaining local twitch responses (LTRs), which are highly effective in releasing&#xD;
      MTrPs. In DN procedures the mechanisms associated with LTRs and the LTR intensities required&#xD;
      for optimal clinical results are poorly understood, especially in relation to range of motion&#xD;
      after intervention. Therefore, evaluating the intensity of LTRs is relevant for implementing&#xD;
      DN in different clinical settings, such as in patients with muscular or neurological&#xD;
      dysfunctions. One way to assess muscle contractions and LTRs is through ultrasound video&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this report was to evaluate the reliability of semi-automatic LTR intensities&#xD;
      tracking during dry needling by assessing ultrasound signals with an image processing method,&#xD;
      in addition to evaluating the relationship between LTR intensities and muscle elasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Young males without signs or symptoms of musculoskeletal pain were included. Primary&#xD;
      outcome measure was the LTR intensities determined by percentage change of muscle thickness.&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measures were the muscle elasticity of medial gastrocnemius and&#xD;
      hamstring, previous and posterior DN in both lower limbs for each subject. Three LTRs,&#xD;
      detected by a physical therapist and ultrasound assessment, were induced by inserting a&#xD;
      filament needle into muscle latent trigger points in medial gastrocnemius. The intensities of&#xD;
      LTRs were measured by assessing ultrasound images using an optical flow method and through&#xD;
      comparisons with manual detection.&#xD;

      The aim of this report was to evaluate the reliability of semi-automatically tracking local&#xD;
      twitch responses (LTR) intensities during dry needling by assessing ultrasound signals with&#xD;
      an optical flow method designed to estimate movement of ROIs, in addition to evaluating the&#xD;
      relationship between LTR intensities and muscle elasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol and measurements For each subject, the ROM of the medial gastrocnemius&#xD;
      (MG) and hamstring (HA) was determined in both lower limbs using weight bearing and the&#xD;
      active knee extension test, respectively, using a universal goniometer. For the knee&#xD;
      extension test, 180° were subtracted from the obtained range, and the values were presented&#xD;
      as negative. Both tests present excellent intra- and inter-rater reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants were placed in a prone position with the ankle locked at 90º. Latent MTrPs&#xD;
      were identified in both MG using according the presence of a palpable taut band and&#xD;
      hypersensitive spot in the palpable taut band as diagnostic criteria. The ultrasound&#xD;
      transducer was positioned over the MG muscle using a fixing device that was composed of a&#xD;
      thermoplastic polymer, with enough space for the dry needling (DN) technique to be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The deep DN was administered by a physical therapist with three years of experience in the&#xD;
      technique. The ultrasound video (SonoSite Titan; Sonosite, Bothell, WA, USA) was recorded at&#xD;
      60 frames per second captured through an external capture device from Epiphan Systems Inc.&#xD;
      (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). According to the perception of the physical therapist and the&#xD;
      ultrasound assessment, the filament needle was inserted into the MTrP to achieve three LTRs.&#xD;
      Posterior to DN application, the ROMs of the MG and HA were measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recorded ultrasound video was examined by the Camtasia software (Tech-Smith Corp, Okemos,&#xD;
      MI, USA) to select three LTRs for latter analysis. Each LTR was tracked by the Lucas-Kanade&#xD;
      optical flow (LKOF) algorithm with affine optic flow extension [12]. All analyses were&#xD;
      performed using the Matlab® 2014 software (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). For tracking&#xD;
      muscle thickness, two ROIs (size 250 x 70 pixels) positioned on the superficial and deep&#xD;
      aponeurosis were manually selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle thickness was normalized as a percentage of recruitment using the following equation:&#xD;
      (thickness contracted-thickness rest/thickness rest)*100. For manual tracking of LTRs, the&#xD;
      recorded ultrasound video was analyzed in the Matlab® 2014 software. Peak muscle thickness&#xD;
      was determined by selecting muscle borders using hyperechoic aponeurosis lines.&#xD;
