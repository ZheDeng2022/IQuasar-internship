  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase Ib open-label trial of CAVATAK™ (CVA21) in combination with&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC. The dose of Pembrolizumab&#xD;
      will be fixed at 200mg. Three cohorts (dose levels) of intravenously-delivered CVA21 will be&#xD;
      explored, using a standard 3+3 patient dose escalation design. The starting dose of CVA21&#xD;
      will be one log below the 1 x 10^9 TCID50 dose found to be safe when CVA21 was given alone in&#xD;
      an ongoing Phase I study (NCT02043665).&#xD;

      Primary Objective &amp; Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety of intravenous CVA21 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients&#xD;
      with advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab in combination with intravenous CVA21 will be well tolerated in patients with&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective &amp; Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. To evaluate the efficacy of intravenous CVA21 in inducing an immune cell rich tumour&#xD;
      microenvironment in patients with a baseline biopsy demonstrating a tumour with an immune&#xD;
      cell poor microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. To evaluate the efficacy of intravenous CVA21 in combination with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      patients with advanced NSCLC using irRECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. To evaluate the safety of intravenous CVA21 in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. To identify a safe and potentially effective dose for intravenous CVA21 in combination&#xD;
      with intravenous pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v. To serially evaluate the presence of detectable virus and anti-viral antibodies in&#xD;
      peripheral blood of the trial participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. CVA21 will induce immune cell infiltration into tumors of patients that lack an immune&#xD;
      cell rich micro-environment.&#xD;

    <time_frame>0-24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The overall response according to the irRC is derived from time-point response assessments based on tumor burden. In the irRC, an immune-related Complete Response (irCR) is the disappearance of all lesions, measured or unmeasured, and no new lesions; an immune-related Partial Response (irPR) is a 50% drop in tumour burden from baseline as defined by the irRC; and immune-related Progressive Disease (irPD) is a 25% increase in tumour burden from the lowest level recorded. Everything else is considered immune-related Stable Disease (irSD).</description>

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
