  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colitis is inflammation of the large bowel and it is often caused by conditions known as&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. In these conditions, the body has an exaggerated&#xD;
      inflammatory response against the bowel - the body attacks the bowel. Patients who have had&#xD;
      colitis affecting most of the large bowel for more than 8 years are at increased risk of&#xD;
      cancer of the large bowel. In view of this, many national gastroenterology organisations have&#xD;
      recommended that such patients have regular colonoscopies to detect pre-cancerous areas and&#xD;
      even early cancer in the large bowel. Early detection of such areas, will lead to early&#xD;
      treatment thereby reducing the risk of developing significant large bowel cancer. These&#xD;
      regular colonoscopies are known as surveillance colonoscopies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Official international guidelines for surveillance in patients with ulcerative and Crohn's&#xD;
      colitis advise to take 4 random samples of large bowel tissue (biopsies) every 10 centimeters&#xD;
      and of any suspicious areas. Recent studies have shown that spraying dye such as indigo&#xD;
      carmine (a type of food dye) helps highlight abnormal areas that could harbor pre-cancerous&#xD;
      cells. This technique is time-consuming, and tedious. There are no set standards of what is&#xD;
      considered a satisfactorily completed dye spray colonoscopy. The uptake of this technique in&#xD;
      the UK has not been uniform. Therefore virtual chromoendoscopy has been studied as an&#xD;
      alternative method to improve the detection of pre-cancerous tissue in patients with&#xD;
      longstanding colitis.&#xD;

      Virtual chromoendoscopy systems enhances specific characteristics of the lining of the large&#xD;
      bowel such as surface patterns and mucosal vasculature. This theoretically increases the&#xD;
      detection of pre-cancerous tissue compared to high definition white light endoscopy alone.&#xD;
      Narrow-band imaging or NBI (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), Blue Laser (Fujinon, Tokyo, Japan) and OE&#xD;
      scan (Pentax, Tokyo, Japan) use optical light filters to select particular narrow spectrums&#xD;
      of red, green and blue light with a relative decrease in the proportion of red light. The&#xD;
      Fujinon Intelligent Chromo-Endoscopy (FICE) system uses post hoc computer algorithms,&#xD;
      applying different filters to the stored endoscopic images and enabling a theoretically&#xD;
      endless number of combinations of filters that can be used. The Pentax I-SCAN system also&#xD;
      allows post hoc modification of the images. It provides the ability to enhance the mucosal&#xD;
      surface to better highlight mucosal changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These new imaging techniques have a theoretical advantage, which is extendedly used for sales&#xD;
      purposes but so far has not been proven in the surveillance for precancerous or early cancer&#xD;
      of the large bowel in patients with longstanding colitis.&#xD;
