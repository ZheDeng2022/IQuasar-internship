      The overall goal of this project is to test whether the Learn. Engage. Act. Process (LEAP)&#xD;
      intervention helps teams within the Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) local MOVE! group&#xD;
      weight management programs be more in line with guidance. Forty-eight sites will be&#xD;
      randomized to the LEAP intervention, which is a virtually delivered program that relies on&#xD;
      the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Model for Improvement, an online learning&#xD;
      platform for clinician teams to share ideas and progress, an audit and feedback process, and&#xD;
      a barrier buster tool. The LEAP intervention will be compared to active support that is&#xD;
      provided to all VA MOVE! programs by the National Center for Health Promotion and Disease&#xD;
      Prevention (NCP). The investigators will compare whether participation in LEAP results in&#xD;
      engaging more Veterans in the MOVE! weight management program compared to facilities not&#xD;
      participating in LEAP. The investigators will also collect information to understand what&#xD;
      components of LEAP worked best and how to scale up so more teams can participate in LEAP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Veterans Affairs (VA) National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP)&#xD;
      first disseminated MOVE! weight management program guidance in 2006. Program guidance was&#xD;
      updated in 2014, which is expected to increase engagement and improve outcomes. However,&#xD;
      variation in local programs is high. The overall goal of this project is to test the Learn.&#xD;
      Engage. Act. Process (LEAP) intervention to work with teams virtually, to build skills in&#xD;
      implementing program improvements. Forty-eight sites will be randomized to the LEAP&#xD;
      intervention using a stepped-wedge trial design. LEAP is a virtually delivered program that&#xD;
      relies on the IHI Model for Improvement, an online learning platform for clinician teams to&#xD;
      share ideas and progress, an audit and feedback process, and a barrier buster tool. The LEAP&#xD;
      intervention will be compared to active support provided by NCP to all local VA MOVE! teams.&#xD;
      The investigators will compare whether teams participating in LEAP have MOVE! programs that&#xD;
      engage more Veterans compared to facilities not participating in LEAP. The investigators will&#xD;
      also collect information to understand which components of LEAP worked best and how to scale&#xD;
      up and implement LEAP more broadly. The project aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To develop three core products to enhance NCP support to Veterans Affairs Medical&#xD;
      Centers (VAMCs) and to pilot LEAP in three VAMCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Dissemination of products to enhance NCP support will improve MOVE! outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine effectiveness of LEAP plus enhanced NCP support (LEAP+NCP) versus&#xD;
      enhanced NCP support alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: VAMCs with LEAP+NCP will have better MOVE! group outcomes than VAMCs with enhanced NCP&#xD;
      support alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To conduct formative and cost evaluations to refine design of LEAP and inform future&#xD;
      scaling-up of LEAP.&#xD;

          <description>Cohorts of 6 facilities, who expressed interest in being in the trial, will be randomly selected each quarter, as guided by the stepped-wedge trial design protocol, to participate in LEAP. These facilities will also receive the same enhanced NCP support as received by the active comparator arm.&#xD;
