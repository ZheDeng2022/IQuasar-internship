      RESEARCH STRATEGY&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           Breast cancer is a potentially deadly disease affecting one in eight women. [1] Majority&#xD;
           of them undergo mastectomies along with different modalities of treatment like&#xD;
           chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormonal treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Since mastectomy is the main and most commonly preferred treatment for breast cancer&#xD;
           surgery, it raises the focus on the most frequently studied complication that is&#xD;
           persistent pain following surgery [8, 9] The incidence of pain syndrome six months&#xD;
           post-breast cancer surgical treatment was 52.9%.[7] A multivariate analysis of the&#xD;
           presence of chronic pain in breast cancer survivors revealed risk factors including more&#xD;
           invasive surgery, radiation therapy after surgery, and clinically meaningful acute&#xD;
           postoperative pain. Each risk factor independently predicted more intense chronic pain&#xD;
           at three months after surgery. [8] A 20% prevalence rate of the Post Mastectomy Pain&#xD;
           syndrome was found. Women experiencing the syndrome reported chronic, stable pain of&#xD;
           long duration that began shortly after surgery. [10] The syndrome is important to&#xD;
           recognize because of how debilitating the pain can be. Studies have indicated that post&#xD;
           mastectomy pain interferes with activities of daily living like driving, taking care of&#xD;
           the children, leisure time, and sex, all of which result in poor quality of life. It was&#xD;
           also noted that in women who survived treatment of breast cancer, chronic pain often&#xD;
           caused mood changes, difficulty at work, and reduction of physical activities. This was&#xD;
           especially noted in those women whose pain spreads to other areas of the body. [14]&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are various anesthetic techniques available for management of mastectomies. The&#xD;
           effectiveness of each technique is widely studied regarding pain control, requirement of&#xD;
           rescue analgesia, side effects, post-operative hospital stay and development of&#xD;
           persistent pain following breast cancer surgical treatment. Belzarena SD et al compared&#xD;
           the effectiveness of thoracic epidural block and general anesthesia for oncologic&#xD;
           mastectomy. Patients were divided in two groups in which they either received GA or&#xD;
           thoracic epidural anesthesia as primary anesthetic. [10] The results showed that the&#xD;
           quality of postoperative analgesia was better in the epidural group, which also&#xD;
           presented with lower consumption of analgesics. The length hospitalization in this group&#xD;
           was also lower. They concluded that an epidural block had some advantages when compared&#xD;
           with general anesthesia and can be considered an anesthesia option in oncologic&#xD;
           mastectomies with axillary lymph node dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Newer regional anesthesia techniques have been developed to improve pain control and&#xD;
           patient satisfaction. These includes epidural blocks (thoracic and cervical), single&#xD;
           injection thoracic PVB and intercostal nerve blocks. PVB during breast cancer surgery&#xD;
           have been reported to decrease acute pain and opioid consumption immediately following&#xD;
           surgery in multiple randomized clinical trials [4, 5, 6] and were superior over epidural&#xD;
           blocks due to lower complication rate. A thoracic PVB is a well-established anesthetic&#xD;
           technique and has been proven to be safe for mastectomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The most recent advancement in anesthetic techniques for mastectomies is the SPB. The&#xD;
           SPB is a novel technique first described by Fajardo et al in 2012 [2]. A single&#xD;
           injection blocks many dermatomes at once. This technique could be an effective&#xD;
           alternative to PVB or thoracic epidurals, because it is considered more feasible, safe&#xD;
           than thoracic epidurals and results in a lower complication rate. But there are very few&#xD;
           long term randomized studies to prove the efficacy of SPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
           R. Blanco et al studied this novel ultrasound-guided regional anesthetic technique to&#xD;
           provide analgesia following surgery on the thoracic wall in four volunteers. All&#xD;
           volunteers reported an effective block that provided long-lasting paresthesia (750-840&#xD;
           min). There were no side-effects noted in this initial descriptive study. They have&#xD;
           suggested to confirm these preliminary results in a large clinical trial.[12] Currently&#xD;
           only a single major clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of SPB and PVB for Breast&#xD;
           Cancer Resections is being conducted by Ghada M N Bashandy, National Cancer Institute,&#xD;
           Egypt. [13]&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Protocol/Experimental Design/Flowchart/Primary and Secondary End Points&#xD;
&#xD;
           Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ages Eligible for Study: 18 Years to 80 Years Genders Eligible for Study: Female No. of&#xD;
           subjects in each group: 50. (Total = 100)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Informed consent for the procedure will be taken. Patients will be educated on the use&#xD;
           of the visual analogue scale (VAS) to evaluate their pain level and a printed copy of&#xD;
           the VAS scoring will be provided to take home. After the completion of preoperative&#xD;
           assessment by the OR nurse, the patients will be randomized to either SPB group or PVB&#xD;
           group. The block will be performed pre operatively. To reduce patient anxiety and&#xD;
           improve comfort, midazolam 0.02mg/kg IV will be given except in patients &gt; 70 years of&#xD;
           age. Standard ASA monitors were applied including pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood&#xD;
           pressure, and electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedure: Serratus Anterior Muscle Plane block (SPB)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The US probe will be placed in the mid-axillary line at the level of the 5th intercostal&#xD;
           space. The latissimus dorsi (superficial and posterior), teres major (superior) and&#xD;
           serratus muscles (deep and inferior) will be identified. Using in-plane approach, the&#xD;
           block needle (22 G, 50 mm) will be inserted until the tip is visualized between the&#xD;
           serratus anterior muscle and the intercostal muscles. As an extra reference point&#xD;
           thoracodorsal artery will be used which aids in the identification of the plane&#xD;
           superficial to the serratus muscle. After negative aspiration of blood, local anesthetic&#xD;
           (20 ml of 0.25 % bupivacaine) will be injected and visualized in real-time. [11]&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedure: Paravertebral Block (PVB)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be placed in the sitting position, leaning forward. After skin&#xD;
           disinfection using chlorhexidine solution, target spinous processes of T1- T5 will be&#xD;
           identified and at parasagittal plan at 2.5 cm, skin wheel will be raised using 1%&#xD;
           lidocaine. A 20-gauge, bevel needle will be advanced until the transverse process is&#xD;
           located. The depth from skin to transverse process will be marked/identified by needle&#xD;
           marking. The needle will be withdrawn 1-2 cm and angled down (walked off the transverse&#xD;
           process). The needle will be re-advanced 1cm past the initial marking. After negative&#xD;
           aspiration, 4-5 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine will be slowly injected. The same procedure will&#xD;
           be repeated at each level from T2 to T6 ensuring total dose of bupivacaine does not&#xD;
           exceed the maximum dose recommended. [13]&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the block is performed, all subjects will receive induction of general anesthesia&#xD;
           with fentanyl 1-2 mcg/kg, propofol 1-2 mg/kg and suxamethonium 1 mg/kg. After induction&#xD;
           the trachea will be intubated with 7.0 mm ID endotracheal tube. For analgesia all&#xD;
           patients will receive 1 gm of intravenous acetaminophen. Anesthesia will be maintained&#xD;
           with sevoflurane with oxygen and air. To minimize PONV, every patient will receive&#xD;
           ondansetron 4mg at the end of the surgery. Fentanyl 25 mcg boluses will be used as&#xD;
           rescue analgesia intra operatively. When extubation criteria have been met the trachea&#xD;
           will be extubated and the patient will be taken to PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
           PACU phase I For VAS &gt;6, 0.5 mg intravenous hydromorphone every 10 min up to 2 mg as a&#xD;
           rescue analgesia For VAS &lt;/=6, patient will be given tramadol 100 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
           PACU phase II Prior to discharge all patients will receive tramadol 50mg if they have&#xD;
           not required pain medication in phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At discharge, all patients will be prescribed Norco (7.5/325) every 4 hours prn for&#xD;
           VAS&gt;4.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reinforcement of previous education on VAS scoring will be done as part of discharge&#xD;
           instructions by the discharge nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following parameters will be recorded in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Duration of block analgesia - time to peak of pain/return of sensation after&#xD;
                surgery will be recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dermatomal distribution of sensory loss obtained after block tested with ice.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of static and dynamic VAS scores at 0 (on arrival to PACU), 6, 12, 24&#xD;
                and 48 hours, 3 months and 6 months after surgery and additional set of questions&#xD;
                to assess neuropathic pain. ( painDETECT)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time for 1st rescue analgesia&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Total dose of rescue analgesia received during the first 24 and 48 hrs&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sample size and statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan StatistiCall will create the randomization list by using the&#xD;
      software ClinStat (from St. George's Hospital Medical School, Version dated 08.05.96). The&#xD;
      treatment will be named 1 for SPB Block, 2 for PVB block for both parts of the study in the&#xD;
      list. Block randomization in X blocks of X patients will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there is no valid data comparing the 2 blocks, we are unable to construct a realistic&#xD;
      power analysis as the hypothesis of difference between the 2 procedures are potentially&#xD;
      minimal and not yet statistically proven. Therefore, this initial investigation in 100&#xD;
      subjects is clinically and logistically feasible and analysis will provide statistical&#xD;
      guidance to any necessary additional studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be responsible for analyzing the study data, and the analysts will be&#xD;
      blinded to patients' group assignment during the execution of the study. For the purpose of&#xD;
      the final analysis, the official clinical database will not be unblinded until&#xD;
      medical/scientific review has been completed and the investigators have been assured that the&#xD;
      data are complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before performing any analysis, the distribution of all variables will be examined for&#xD;
      appropriateness of distribution assumptions. Descriptive statistics will be summarized for&#xD;
      all variables including demographics, duration of analgesia, VAS scores during rest and after&#xD;
      surgery, time for 1st rescue analgesia, total dose of rescue analgesia received in 24 hrs and&#xD;
      side effects. Mean ± SD will be reported for continuous variables and frequency (percentage)&#xD;
      will be reported for discrete variables. Analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis test as&#xD;
      appropriate will be used to analyze and compare the primary endpoint VAS among two groups as&#xD;
      well as the secondary endpoints. Chi-square test or extended Fisher's exact test as&#xD;
      appropriate will be used for the comparison of the incidence of chronic pain as well as other&#xD;
      side effects. All analyses will be performed using SAS 9.3 (Cary, NC) and a p-value less than&#xD;
      0.05 will be considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
