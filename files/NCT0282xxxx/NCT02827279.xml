    <textblock>
      The Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) are severe neurodevelopmental disorders,&#xD;
      affecting nearly 1% of the general population. The disorder of social interaction has often&#xD;
      been described as resulting from poor emotion recognition, or a bad perception of biological&#xD;
      motion. However, the results of studies on these issues are very divergent. The PDD also been&#xD;
      described as a disorder of emotion regulation, but few studies address the emotional feelings&#xD;
      of individuals with ASD and their neuropsychological implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to study the effect of induced emotion in the children with ASD on his&#xD;
      visual exploration strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a comparative exploratory pilot study. We'll look at using the eye-tracking, policy&#xD;
      terms of the look in a group of children with ASD, in a context of emotional induction (joy,&#xD;
      fear, sadness or anger) using of sound stimuli.&#xD;

      Context: The Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) are severe neurodevelopmental disorders,&#xD;
      affecting nearly 1% of the general population. The disorder of social interaction has often&#xD;
      been described as resulting from poor emotion recognition, or a bad perception of biological&#xD;
      motion. However, the results of studies on these issues are very divergent. The PDD also been&#xD;
      described as a disorder of emotion regulation, but few studies address the emotional feelings&#xD;
      of individuals with ASD and their neuropsychological implications. Many studies analyzing the&#xD;
      effect of emotions induced - or felt - in healthy subjects. The effect of emotion on&#xD;
      cognitive or attentional process is often called &quot;emotional effect of interference.&quot; As has&#xD;
      already been demonstrated, an emotion (eg induced by music or film) results in a change in&#xD;
      visual perception of the environment strategies. These non-conscious mechanisms promote&#xD;
      interactive synchrony with the surrounding world, especially during social interactions. We&#xD;
      then assumed that the alteration of these perceptual-emotional regulation processes in PDD&#xD;
      contribute to disorders of social interactions. In the absence of sufficient data in the&#xD;
      literature, we wish to establish an exploratory study using the Eye-tracking, to objectify&#xD;
      the links between emotional and perceptual processing in PDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The main objective is to study the effect of induced emotion in the children with&#xD;
      ASD on his visual exploration strategies. We assume that the direction of gaze to photographs&#xD;
      of different emotional valences in individuals with ASD is not changed by the emotional state&#xD;
      in which they are located. We will compare a population of children with PDD in a control&#xD;
      population matched for age, sex. Our secondary goal is to study the link between 1) the socio&#xD;
      adaptive level (measured by the Vineland 2) the intensity of autistic symptoms (score ADI)&#xD;
      and gaze orientation towards social subjects with visual stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a comparative exploratory pilot study. We'll look at using the eye-tracking,&#xD;
      policy terms of the look in a group of children with ASD, in a context of emotional induction&#xD;
      (joy, fear, sadness or anger) using of sound stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: This study would better characterize the emotional processing in ASD and generate&#xD;
      hypotheses that could be tested in other neurophysiological studies. Moreover, it can&#xD;
      contribute to the development of new supported techniques.&#xD;
