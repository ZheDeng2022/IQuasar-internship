      Using phage libraries extensively pre-absorbed on a series of normal cell types, we will&#xD;
      isolate phage specifically internalized by B-CLL cells from newly diagnosed and untreated CLL&#xD;
      patients. Peptide sequences are then derived by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). NGS-based&#xD;
      studies are contributing to an improved understanding of cancer heterogeneity in order to&#xD;
      tailor treatment to patients based on the individual makeup of their tumor. However the use&#xD;
      of NGS to derive phage displayed peptide sequences is so far rare (22). Traditionally, after&#xD;
      exposure to a target and recovery by elution, the phage clones are isolated by titration on&#xD;
      bacterial lawns. It is technically demanding and labour intensive to select and analyze more&#xD;
      than about 15 of the sometimes thousands clones recovered. Therefore information on other&#xD;
      potentially important sequences is missed. NGS allows sequencing of the entire recovered&#xD;
      phage pool and provides far more detailed bioinformatic analyses of peptide sequences or&#xD;
      motifs. RNA from the CLL cells is used for RNA-seq expression sequencing. The wide&#xD;
      application of NGS in combination with bioinformatics tools has begun to revolutionize cancer&#xD;
      research, diagnosis and therapy. The peptide and RNA sequencing data will afford&#xD;
      bioinformatic testing of correlations of exome expression and clinical parameters with the&#xD;
      pattern of peptide sequences internalized by CLL cells of different patients. This&#xD;
      information is crucial to answering questions 1, 2 and 3 discussed on page 1 above. The&#xD;
      results of this analysis will probably not allow identification of specific receptors&#xD;
      targeted by the peptides. The aim at this stage of the research is to identify candidate&#xD;
      targeting peptides. Once identified, further research will be needed to identify the&#xD;
      receptors to which they bind. Regarding question 4, there is currently very little published&#xD;
      information on the therapeutic potential of PDCs in leukemia. Using two peptides we have&#xD;
      isolated that target murine A20 leukemic cells, we will prepare multi-drug PDCs (using&#xD;
      technology we have developed) and in an animal model, test their ability to enhance the&#xD;
      survival and quality of life of CLL bearing animals.&#xD;

      Methodology A: CLL specific peptides: (Specific aim 1) Whole blood samples are received from&#xD;
      healthy volunteers and newly diagnosed and untreated CLL patients according to our Helsinki&#xD;
      permit no. 0432-13-RMC. (Rabin Medical Center) Acquisition of samples at follow up and from&#xD;
      an additional 80 patients will be covered by additional Helsinki submissions now underway.&#xD;
      Lymphocytes are separated using Ficoll and the B cells isolated using a B-cell isolation kit.&#xD;
      The B-cells from the healthy volunteers and an aliquot of those isolated cells from each&#xD;
      patient are frozen for later use (see D: below). The remaining patient cells are divided into&#xD;
      two fractions. One is used for RNA extraction. The other is exposed to an &quot;Absorbed&quot; phage&#xD;
      library pre-absorbed on normal cells. After incubation, cells are washed and phage bound to&#xD;
      the cell membrane are eluted and recovered. Cells are then lysed and the lysate retained.&#xD;
      Phage in the eluate and lysate (membrane-bound and internalized respectively) are amplified&#xD;
      separately in E.coli. The amplified phage are isolated and DNA prepared for NGS. Sequencing&#xD;
      is carried out in an external core facility (The Technion Genome Center).&#xD;
&#xD;
      . B: Bioinformatic analyses of peptide sequences (Specific aim 1) I) Sequencing of peptides:&#xD;
      Sequence reads are obtained from phage DNA libraries generated and analyzed with&#xD;
      high-throughput sequencing (Illumina HiSeq system). Quality control checks are performed&#xD;
      using FastQC tool. The reads are processed to trim adaptors and remove the consensus&#xD;
      sequences from either side using the Cutadapt software (23). The remaining fragment tags&#xD;
      contain the peptides' DNA sequence and are expected to be 21 nucleotides in length. Next, the&#xD;
      BioString package from the Bioconductor framework are used to translate these nucleotide&#xD;
      sequences, and the number of occurrences of each peptide sequence is calculated to find the&#xD;
      most frequent peptides. Following normalization to library size, peptide sequence counts from&#xD;
      different patient libraries are compared to find common sequences. Sequences from the&#xD;
      membrane-bound pool fraction are subtracted from the internalized pool fraction so as to&#xD;
      remove membrane-bound clones that may not have been successfully eluted off the CLL cell. The&#xD;
      sequences remaining in the internalized pool serve as candidates for peptide-conjugate&#xD;
      therapy. A univariate logistic regression approach will then be used to test possible&#xD;
      associations of peptide counts with clinical and genetic findings. When clinical parameters&#xD;
      are treated as continuous variables, linear regression will be implemented. Candidate&#xD;
      peptides will be queried against the PepBank database (24) in order to check if they are&#xD;
      known to be related to cancer or other diseases and conditions such as apoptosis or&#xD;
      angiogenesis. Finally, a bioinformatic pipeline script will be developed automating the above&#xD;
      bioinformatics analysis steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II) RNA-seq to detect gene expression patterns and fusion genes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the RNA-seq analysis is to detect specific gene expression patterns which can&#xD;
      be correlated with peptide sequences and clinical parameters. These expression patterns will&#xD;
      give clues to cell surface receptor expression and intracellular pathway activity. Patients&#xD;
      will be divided based on the peptide sequences internalized by B-CLL cells, and a statistical&#xD;
      test will be performed in order to detect differentially expressed genes. Pathway analysis&#xD;
      will be performed in order to infer functional changes which may shade a light on the&#xD;
      possible role of the peptide receptors in the cell signaling cascade. Trim galore software&#xD;
      will be used for adapter trimming, and for removing low quality bases from the ends of reads.&#xD;
      Trimmed reads will be mapped to the human genome (hg38) using TopHat2 software. The number of&#xD;
      reads overlaping each of the annotated genes will be counted using the HT-seq python package.&#xD;
      DESeq within the Bioconductor framework will be used for normalization and differential&#xD;
      expression analysis using variants of Fisher's exact test. The Generally Applicable Gene-set&#xD;
      Enrichment (GAGE) method will be applied to detect up and down-regulated pathways. RNA-seq is&#xD;
      also used to detect fusion gene events in the patient's cancer cells and can be used as an&#xD;
      independent validation method to test the sensitivity of the peptide-dye conjugate used as&#xD;
      for disease monitoring. For this aim, three different tools TopHat-fusion, defuse and&#xD;
      ChimeraScan will be used to identify fusion transcripts. Several filtration steps will be&#xD;
      applied in order to remove low-quality candidates as described before, and only those&#xD;
      candidates detected by all the three tools will be chosen for RT-PCR validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C: Syntheses of Peptides and conjugates (Specific aims 1,2,3) Peptides will be synthesized&#xD;
      using solid-phase chemistry. In the first stage of the project, the two peptides specific for&#xD;
      A20 mouse leukemic cells already identified will be synthesized, namely HIS SER THR PRO SER&#xD;
      SER PRO (Peptide 1) and ASP SER SER LEU PHE ALA LEU (Peptide 2). In later stages (see below),&#xD;
      selected human CLL specific peptides will be synthesized as their sequences become available.&#xD;
      Only peptides will multiple repeat reads (&gt;5) (see B above) will be selected (maximum of 3&#xD;
      per patient) as these represent phage clones with greater propensity to induce uptake into&#xD;
      cells. Peptides will be synthesized both as fluorescent dye- and drug-conjugates based on our&#xD;
      previous work with targeted multi-drug conjugates (21). We will employ drugs with differing&#xD;
      mechanisms of action, such as the nitrogen mustard Chlorambucil used to treat elderly CLL&#xD;
      patients, and the microtubule inhibitor Combretastatin 4A, known to induce apoptosis in CLL&#xD;
      cells (25). Purity and composition of the products will be verified by HPLC and LC/MS.&#xD;
      Syntheses will be carried out by an external supplier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D: In vitro validation of peptide specificity and PDC activity: (Specific aims 1, 2, 3)&#xD;
      Specificity of peptides: The specificity of targeting peptides will be demonstrated by&#xD;
      incubating peptide-dye conjugates with target and controls cells. For the mouse CLL system,&#xD;
      A20 cells will be used as target cells and normal mouse splenic lymphocytes and primary&#xD;
      cultures of mouse skin and epithelial cells will be used as controls cells. For the human CLL&#xD;
      system, patient CLL cells and normal human lymphocytes and HUVEC cells will be used as target&#xD;
      and controls cells respectively. Cells will be incubated with FITC-labeled peptides at both&#xD;
      4oC and 37oC, washed and analyzed for binding and internalization respectively. Binding will&#xD;
      be evaluated by flow cytometry and internalization by confocal microscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytotoxicity of PDCs: Target and control cells will be incubated for 24 and 48 hrs with&#xD;
      increasing concentrations (0-50uM drug equivalents) of free drug or PDCs. Percent Growth&#xD;
      Inhibition will be assessed by the XTT assay. Cytotoxic A20 specific PDCs will then be&#xD;
      evaluated in vivo (see E: below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell culture systems: The A20 cell line is grown and maintained in FBS supplemented RPMI&#xD;
      culture medium. Normal primary cultures are maintained with selective media. On the other&#xD;
      hand, the survival of human CLL cells in culture is dependent on several unique&#xD;
      microenvironmental factors, including antigen stimulation of the B-cell BCR, T cell help&#xD;
      through the CD40-CD40L interaction, stimulation from the bone marrow stromal cell-derived&#xD;
      CXCL12 chemokine and stimulation of Toll-Like Receptor 9. These conditions will be mimicked&#xD;
      in vitro (26) by addition to the culture medium of anti-IgM (to crosslink the BCRs),&#xD;
      co-culture with fibroblasts expressing CD40L, addition of recombinant CXCL12 and CpG&#xD;
      dinucleotides respectively. These conditions will be used to test the specificity and&#xD;
      efficacy of human PDCs against cryopreserved samples of patient CLL cells and normal human&#xD;
      lymphocytes (controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      E: Animal studies using A20 mouse model of CLL (Specific aim 3) While several antibody-drug&#xD;
      conjugates for the treatment of CLL have been used or are being tested (16), there is little&#xD;
      published information as to the efficacy of PDCs for this disease. Therefore we aim to study&#xD;
      the behavior of our A20 specific PDCs in an animal model of CLL, according to protocols&#xD;
      approved by the Ariel University Institutional Animal Ethics Committee, permit no.&#xD;
      IL-47-08-13. To validate the calibration of CLL development, A20 cells will be injected&#xD;
      intravenously into Balb/c mice and the development of CLL symptoms monitored. Usually this&#xD;
      takes between 40-50 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study A): At this point, we know little about the most effective treatment schedule with&#xD;
      PDCs. For this reason, and based on published literature, we will first test the systemic&#xD;
      tolerance of the animals to the drugs in the PDCs by injecting groups of non-tumor bearing&#xD;
      mice intraperitoneally with 1, 7.5 or 15 mg/Kg of one Chlorambucil and Combretastatin 4A&#xD;
      containing PDC every third days for 3 weeks. Animals will be monitored for systemic morbidity&#xD;
      and survival. On the basis of these results, an initial treatment schedule will be selected&#xD;
      to compare two concentrations for each of the two PDCs. Animals showing initial signs of CLL&#xD;
      will be treated and followed for survival and development of CLL symptoms for at least and&#xD;
      additional 70 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study B: Using the Study A results, the most effective PDC will be studied further. The PK of&#xD;
      the drug conjugate will be analyzed by administering it in 5 drug concentrations, including&#xD;
      that used for Study A. Blood samples will be drawn from the tail vein at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 5,&#xD;
      10 and 24 hrs. PDC will be extracted and analyzed by LC/MS for content and integrity. Drug&#xD;
      concentrations will be analyzed by HPLC and used to calculate standard PK parameters [Cmax;&#xD;
      TCmax; T1/2]. Based on these experiments, an additional treatment protocol will be devised&#xD;
      aimed at maintaining a maximum blood PDC concentration over the treatment period. The&#xD;
      protocol will be tested on an additional group of animals. After the treatment period,&#xD;
      animals will be followed for survival and development of CLL symptoms for at least and&#xD;
      additional 70 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F: Detection of CLL cells in animal and patient whole blood. (Specific aims 1 and 2) The aim&#xD;
      of these experiments is to assess the potential of CLL-specific peptide-dye conjugates to&#xD;
      detect CLL cells in blood samples. Calibration experiments will be carried out on three&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cell doping: Cryopreserved samples of patient CLL cells will be added to either RPMI&#xD;
           culture medium or normal human blood (in three concentrations). B-cells isolated as&#xD;
           described in A above will be incubated with the appropriate Peptide-dye conjugate for&#xD;
           30mins at 37OC. Cells will be washed and analyzed for peptide binding by flow cytometry.&#xD;
           Similarly, A20 cells will be added to normal mouse blood and tested with A20 specific&#xD;
           peptide-dye conjugates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Animal model: Using the animal model described above, blood samples will be taken&#xD;
           once/week during the tumor induction phase. After RBC lysis, the remaining cells will be&#xD;
           incubated with peptide-dye conjugates, washed and analysed by flow cytometry.&#xD;
           Furthermore, samples will be taken once/fortnight from animals surviving Study B and&#xD;
           analysed for Minimal residual Disease and relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient follow up: Aliquots of blood samples taken during routine follow up of the CLL&#xD;
           patients will be used. Cells will be incubated with the appropriate Peptide-dye&#xD;
           conjugate for 30mins at 37OC. Cells will be washed and analyzed for peptide binding by&#xD;
           flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G: Statistics Cytotoxicity of PDCs and free drug will be assessed by calculating % Growth&#xD;
      Inhibition of treated versus untreated cells. Experiments will be performed in triplicate and&#xD;
      repeated thrice. In animal studies, survival will be assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves.&#xD;
      Additional statistics related to the bioinformatic analyses are described in detail above in&#xD;
      section 1.7-B.&#xD;
