  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) among all hospitalized patients is approximately&#xD;
      7%. Among these patients, sepsis and septic shock remain the most important cause of acute&#xD;
      renal failure (ARF) and account for more than 50% of cases of AKI. The goal of this project&#xD;
      is to uncover key factors that lead to renal function recovery. This study is planned to&#xD;
      survey novel biomarkers that reflect tissue pathology or regeneration. During the&#xD;
      hospitalization, blood and urine sample will be collected for NGAL and inflammatory marker&#xD;
      analysis in the patients with bacteremia, while the rest sample will be collected for further&#xD;
      novel biomarker survey. This study is to early predict the renal function impairment and&#xD;
      identify the possible molecule that involved in renal function recovery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recovery of renal function after acute renal injury is an important clinical determinant of&#xD;
      patient morbidity and mortality. However, studies covering this field are scarce and&#xD;
      nonhomogeneous. The &quot;gold standard&quot; for monitoring kidney function is to measure &quot;true&quot;&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by 24 h urine isotope collections. Serum creatinine is a&#xD;
      practical surrogate for GFR in the daily caring of the patients. Unfortunately, use of serum&#xD;
      creatinine is limited by several patient dependent and independent factors. Also, serum&#xD;
      creatinine concentration may fall to one-third of normal in advanced CKD secondary to its&#xD;
      extrarenal clearance. The accuracy of serum creatinine in determining kidney function can be&#xD;
      improved by serial measurements of serum creatinine, assessment of the reciprocal slope of&#xD;
      the serum creatinine, or serial measurements of 24 h creatinine clearances. However, it is&#xD;
      difficult to decide residual renal function in AKI patients requiring renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy. Furthermore, even when the changes of kidney function is linear, there is a poor&#xD;
      relationship between [Cr]-1 and the rate of rate function recovery, as demonstrated by direct&#xD;
      comparison with urine isotope clearances. Moreover, even 24 h creatinine clearances yield&#xD;
      poor estimates of renal function recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe sepsis is the leading cause of acute kidney injury, although there is little mechanism&#xD;
      of the pathogenesis of this subset of AKI in humans. Animal models have since directed&#xD;
      attention to other lesions, such as apoptosis, leukocytic infiltration and thrombus&#xD;
      formation. Kidney biopsy from post-mortem patients who died of septic shock showed the&#xD;
      involvement of intense capillary leukocytic infiltration, apoptosis, and rare thrombi.&#xD;
      Apoptosis and leukocytic infiltration, predominantly mononuclear, seem likely to be of major&#xD;
      importance. Furthermore, the acute tubular lesions were correlated with the arterial lactate&#xD;
      concentration. Thus, this indicated that the kidney lesions are integral to the severity of&#xD;
      multiple organ failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell wall component of gram-negative bacteria, is known to exert&#xD;
      its toxic effects through the activation of the complement system or monocytes-macrophages&#xD;
      and releases of the secondary mediators like cytokines, chemokines, and arachidonic acid&#xD;
      derivatives, but recent reports suggest that LPS may exert a direct toxicity on renal&#xD;
      cells.LPS is a potential drug target since its presence is critical in membrane stability,&#xD;
      and also it plays a prominent role in raising an immune response. LPS triggers the release of&#xD;
      many inflammatory cytokines, in particular, TNFα, interleukin-1β and IL-6, and it has been&#xD;
      implicated as the etiological agent of a variety of pathologies ranging from mild (fever) to&#xD;
      lethal (septic shock, organ failure, and death).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers are biological parameters that can be objectively measured and evaluated, which&#xD;
      act as indicators of normal or pathological processes, or of the response to intervention.&#xD;
      The sensitivity, specificity and time course of a biomarker are critical factors in&#xD;
      determining the utility of a particular biomarker in a disease process. A surrogate outcome&#xD;
      biomarker is one which faithfully tracts a disease including early prediction of renal&#xD;
      function impairment, the response to therapy, and renal function recovery.&#xD;
