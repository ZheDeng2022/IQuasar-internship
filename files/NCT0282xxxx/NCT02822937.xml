    <textblock>
      This is a study in adults to assess the sensitivity of Project: EVO Monitor cognitive&#xD;
      measurements to two short-acting cognitively active pharmacological agents. The participants&#xD;
      will receive a placebo, and two pharmacological agents in a randomized order for three&#xD;
      in-clinic study days. During each study day in the clinic, the participants will use Project:&#xD;
      EVO Monitor and another cognitive task through the day.&#xD;

      This is a study in adults ages 40 to 55 to assess the sensitivity of Project: EVO Monitor&#xD;
      cognitive measurements to two short-acting cognitively active pharmacological agents,&#xD;
      methylphenidate (MPH) and triazolam (TRZ). The participants will receive a placebo, MPH, and&#xD;
      TRZ in a randomized order for three in-clinic study days. All drug administration and&#xD;
      cognitive testing will take place in the clinic under medical staff supervision. During each&#xD;
      study day in the clinic, the participants will use Project: EVO Monitor and do a short digit&#xD;
      symbol substitution task (DSST) 8 times over the day. A minimum of 48 hours will be needed&#xD;
      between each study day. The investigators plan to evaluate 18 participants in this study.&#xD;
