  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 8000 colonoscopies are performed on a yearly basis on the Funen Island. Between 5%&#xD;
      and 10% of those are incomplete due to excessive pain, fixed colon loops, and other reasons.&#xD;
      The current standard procedure is to refer the patient to the department of radiology for a&#xD;
      CT-colonography. In some instances the radiology department can offer the investigation the&#xD;
      next day, and thus in the same colon preparation. At other times they cannot, and the patient&#xD;
      has to go through an second colon preparation for the colonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A CCE procedure could be provided to the participants immediately after the failed&#xD;
      colonoscopy and the investigation can be completed the next morning in the same bowel&#xD;
      preparation without a visit to the radiology department.&#xD;

      Optical colonoscopy is the standard method for evaluating the colon. This technique allows&#xD;
      evaluation of the entire colon in most patients. Full colonoscopy including examination of&#xD;
      the cecum is associated with an increased detection rate of advanced neoplasia, as 33-50% of&#xD;
      advanced neoplasia is located in the proximal colon. After an incomplete optical colonoscopy,&#xD;
      participants are required to undergo another test in order to exclude clinically relevant&#xD;
      lesions to reduce the risk of proximal cancer which has been shown to increase by twofold&#xD;
      when colonoscopy was incomplete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic and radiological options to complete the colon assessment have been available in&#xD;
      the last decades. Multiple alternative endoscopic techniques-such as colonoscopy with thinner&#xD;
      colonoscopes, gastroscopes and device-assisted enteroscopes have been described. However,&#xD;
      none of them has been clearly standardized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT colonography (CTC), is a relatively new imaging technique that was first described in&#xD;
      1994. In large randomized trials on symptomatic patients, CTC has been shown to be as equally&#xD;
      effective as colonoscopy - for the detection of large colorectal polyps and already developed&#xD;
      colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colon Capsule Endoscopy (CCE) is a promising new technology that may have the potential to&#xD;
      complement existing diagnostic methods to screen people for colorectal cancer. Delivered&#xD;
      correctly, it may reduce costs, increase utilization of medical services, reduce risks for&#xD;
      patients and overall improve screening rates among the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 8000 colonoscopies are performed on a yearly basis on the Funen Island and about&#xD;
      10% of those are incomplete due to excessive pain, fixed colon loops, and others causes. The&#xD;
      current standard procedure is to refer the participant to the Department of Radiology for a&#xD;
      CT-colonography.&#xD;
