      The goal of the study is to determine whether the use of Human Fibrinogen Concentrate&#xD;
      (RiaSTAP) will decrease blood loss and the need for component blood therapy in neonates and&#xD;
      infants undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. RiaSTAP will be administered after termination of&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) at a dose of 70 mg/kg, in a prospective, randomized, controlled&#xD;
      study. We hypothesize that the administration of RiaSTAP in this manner will reduce&#xD;
      peri-operative bleeding and transfusion requirements.&#xD;

    <description>Primary outcome efficacy: Estimated blood loss (EBL); median; A transfusion algorithm was developed based on three previous studies, modified for pediatrics. Clinically significant bleeding requiring treatment was defined as a rate &gt;10 cc kg-1 hr-1 calculated every 15 minutes while in the OR, measured by blood in the suction canister. In cases of continued bleeding following randomization to HFC or placebo, cryoprecipitate was considered for fibrinogen &lt;200 mg/dL or FIBTEM MCF &lt;7 mm. Thereafter, as per routine care, ROTEM analysis was performed at least every 30 minutes while in the OR, or sooner, at the discretion of the OR team. Once the patient left the OR, ROTEM was performed at least every 60 minutes for the first 6 hours or until clinically significant bleeding had stopped. Blood products transfused after CPB separation were based on a pre-defined protocol. Recommended volumes of each therapy were based on pre-defined formulae and a ROTEM analysis algorithm.</description>

        <description>Primary outcome efficacy: Estimated blood loss (EBL); median; A transfusion algorithm was developed based on three previous studies, modified for pediatrics. Clinically significant bleeding requiring treatment was defined as a rate &gt;10 cc kg-1 hr-1 calculated every 15 minutes while in the OR, measured by blood in the suction canister. In cases of continued bleeding following randomization to HFC or placebo, cryoprecipitate was considered for fibrinogen &lt;200 mg/dL or FIBTEM MCF &lt;7 mm. Thereafter, as per routine care, ROTEM analysis was performed at least every 30 minutes while in the OR, or sooner, at the discretion of the OR team. Once the patient left the OR, ROTEM was performed at least every 60 minutes for the first 6 hours or until clinically significant bleeding had stopped. Blood products transfused after CPB separation were based on a pre-defined protocol. Recommended volumes of each therapy were based on pre-defined formulae and a ROTEM analysis algorithm.</description>

A transfusion algorithm was developed based on three previous studies, modified for pediatrics. Clinically significant bleeding requiring treatment was defined as a rate &gt;10 cc kg-1 hr-1 calculated every 15 minutes while in the OR, measured by blood in the suction canister. In cases of continued bleeding following randomization to HFC or placebo, cryoprecipitate was considered for fibrinogen &lt;200 mg/dL or FIBTEM MCF &lt;7 mm. Once the patient left the OR, ROTEM was performed at least every 60 minutes for the first 6 hours or until clinically significant bleeding had stopped. Blood products transfused after CPB separation were based on a pre-defined protocol. Recommended volumes of each therapy were based on pre-defined formulae and a ROTEM analysis algor</description>

        <description>Post-operative 24 hr International Normalize Ratio (INR) between the treatment and placebo group. A transfusion algorithm was developed based on three previous studies, modified for pediatrics. Clinically significant bleeding requiring treatment was defined as a rate &gt;10 cc kg-1 hr-1 calculated every 15 minutes while in the OR, measured by blood in the suction canister. In cases of continued bleeding following randomization to HFC or placebo, cryoprecipitate was considered for fibrinogen &lt;200 mg/dL or FIBTEM MCF &lt;7 mm. Once the patient left the OR, ROTEM was performed at least every 60 minutes for the first 6 hours or until clinically significant bleeding had stopped. Blood products transfused after CPB separation were based on a pre-defined protocol. Recommended volumes of each therapy were based on pre-defined formulae and a ROTEM ana</description>
