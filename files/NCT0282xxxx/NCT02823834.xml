    <textblock>
      MicroPort Orthopedics (MPO) is conducting this post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of its total hip arthroplasty (THA) components marketed in&#xD;
      the European Union (EU). These types of studies are required by regulatory authorities for&#xD;
      all THA devices that do not have medium to long-term clinical evidence available at the time&#xD;
      of gaining approval to market in the EU. This study has been designed in accordance with the&#xD;
      medial device directives (MEDDEV) 2.12/2 rev 2.&#xD;
