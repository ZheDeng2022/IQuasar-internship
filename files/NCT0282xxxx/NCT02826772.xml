  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, clinical trial in adult subjects with metastatic&#xD;
      castrate resistant prostate cancer who progressed after both hormonal therapy (abiraterone or&#xD;
      enzalutamide) and chemotherapy (docetaxel), or cannot tolerate either or both therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involved a Phase 1 dose escalation of oral GT0918 to evaluate its safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GT0918 treatment was initiated with the first dose of 50 mg/day in a cohort of 3 patients,&#xD;
      and 6- patients per cohort for the subsequent escalated dose levels at 100 mg, 200 mg, 300&#xD;
      mg, 400 mg, 500 mg and 600 mg/day. Patients received orally administered GT0918 once daily at&#xD;
      the indicated doses for 28 consecutive days (4 weeks), followed by a 7-day off-treatment&#xD;
      period for PK analysis. This concluded the Cycle 1 treatment. Patients who could not complete&#xD;
      the first cycle of 28 days for DLT evaluation were to be considered as early termination and&#xD;
      replaced. Upon completion of the Cycle 1 treatment, if no DLT occurred in the cohort of 3&#xD;
      patients, or no more than 1 patient had DLT in cohorts with at least 6 patients, dose&#xD;
      escalation was allowed for the subsequent higher dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were to receive up to 6 cycles of GT0918 treatments at their assigned dose levels if&#xD;
      they were evaluated by the investigator to have no unacceptable toxicity and show evidence of&#xD;
      clinical benefit (stable disease or a response) per RECIST v1.1 criteria and PSA assessments.&#xD;
      No off-treatment periods were scheduled for the additional cycles from Cycle 2 beyond.&#xD;
      Patients had to be evaluated bi-monthly for their eligibility to continue the treatment of&#xD;
      additional cycles. Patient evaluations included CT and/or MRI scans performed every 2 cycles&#xD;
      (8 weeks), as well as physical examinations, ECOG performance status, PSA measurements, which&#xD;
      were performed every 4 weeks. Cycles beyond the 6th cycle were optional for eligible subjects&#xD;
      that did not exhibit progressive disease (PD). Eligible patients could be treated for a total&#xD;
      of 6 months at their assigned dose level at the investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients would have an End-of-Study (EOS) visit if treatment were discontinued due to&#xD;
      intolerable toxicities, disease progression, withdrawal of consent. Safety follow-up for&#xD;
      possible delayed drug-related AE or side effects can be performed by phone call or office&#xD;
      visit if needed.&#xD;
