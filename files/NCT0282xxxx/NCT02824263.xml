  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea is a risk factor for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, by unknown&#xD;
      mechanisms. The investigators hypothesize that sleep apnea changes glucose and lipid&#xD;
      metabolism during sleep, which over time could lead to diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      This study examines metabolic changes during sleep in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;
      Patients accustomed to CPAP therapy are enrolled to undergo sleep studies, either on CPAP&#xD;
      therapy or after withdrawing from CPAP for 3 nights. During sleep, blood samples are obtained&#xD;
      so that metabolic function can be compared between sleep apnea and CPAP nights.&#xD;

      Participants with a history of moderate severe sleep apnea (AHI&gt;20) will be enrolled if&#xD;
      participants meet inclusion/exclusion criteria. Investigators will report to the sleep&#xD;
      laboratory on two nights, (1) after continuing their CPAP or (2) after discontinuing CPAP for&#xD;
      3 nights. The order of observation will be randomized. A standard research dinner is provided&#xD;
      before each study. IV's are placed so that blood can be sampled at frequent (30 min)&#xD;
      intervals throughout the night. In the morning after each study, a glucose tolerance test and&#xD;
      endothelial function study (endoPAT) are performed. Serum samples will be analyzed for&#xD;
      glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, triglycerides, hormones, and other metabolic biomarkers.&#xD;
