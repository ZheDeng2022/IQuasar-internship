  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled feasibility trial of MBSR&#xD;
      for patients with moderate-to- severe migraine headache.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine, one of the most common neurological disorders in the U.S., is ranked among the top&#xD;
      20 causes of disability worldwide. Migraine is currently one of the leading causes of disease&#xD;
      burden for women aged 15-44 years and affects an estimated 11% of the adult population&#xD;
      globally, with a strong female predominance. Current approaches to therapy are primarily&#xD;
      medication-based but are limited by often-inadequate effectiveness, high costs for many&#xD;
      migraine-specific medications, and common side effects. In addition, there likely exist&#xD;
      subtypes of migraine that may affect the likelihood of response to treatment, but these have&#xD;
      been poorly investigated to-date. Furthermore, many patients are interested in exploring&#xD;
      alternatives to pharmacological therapy for this functional disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a meditation-based intervention developed by&#xD;
      Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts, has been increasingly shown to be effective&#xD;
      for many patients with a variety of functional disorders. Recent small pilot studies suggest&#xD;
      that MBSR may also provide an important benefit as an adjunctive therapy for patients with&#xD;
      migraine headaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preparation for a fully powered randomized controlled clinical trial of MBSR for patients&#xD;
      with moderate-to-severe migraine headache, the investigators propose a detailed&#xD;
      pilot/feasibility study to develop and test the clinical research methods required for a&#xD;
      successful Phase III trial. The investigators will first identify a large number of&#xD;
      migraineurs in the Northern California-based Sutter Health system using analytic tools&#xD;
      previously developed by the group. Next, using latent class analysis, the investigators will&#xD;
      identify subgroups of migraine patients defined by comorbidities. The investigators will then&#xD;
      enroll 60 patients with a pattern of 4-20 headaches per month and randomize them to a full&#xD;
      8-week MBSR intervention with usual care or usual care alone, with follow-up at 4 months. The&#xD;
      primary clinical outcome is change in headache frequency at 4 months, with several secondary&#xD;
      outcomes, including assessments of pain, quality of life, and functional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a feasibility study, the primary emphases of the trial are to demonstrate the&#xD;
      investigators' ability to recruit and retain participants, to test whether their proposed&#xD;
      enrollment criteria identify the appropriate patient population, to assess participants'&#xD;
      levels of adherence to all aspects of the protocol, and to determine optimal methods for data&#xD;
      collection. No tests of clinical effectiveness will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this feasibility study will provide invaluable information for the study&#xD;
      investigators in development of methods to ensure a highly successful and informative Phase&#xD;
      III trial of a promising MBSR intervention for this common and distressing medical condition.&#xD;
