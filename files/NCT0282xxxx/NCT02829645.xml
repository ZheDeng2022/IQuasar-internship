  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eating disorders (ED) are serious mental illnesses with an excess mortality and many affects&#xD;
      in the quality of life of patients and thier relatives. Management of ED is very difficult :&#xD;
      the prognosis remains relatively poor both in terms of remission rate and quality of life. In&#xD;
      this context, the contribution of new strategies for pathophysiological exploration and the&#xD;
      development of therapeutic options are crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project the investigators aim to constitute un cohort of patients from a day unit&#xD;
      specialized in the management of ED. A prospective follow-up will be offered to patients to&#xD;
      assess their clinical and psycho-social evolution. The overall objective is to identify which&#xD;
      factors are prognostic of clinical improvement of the ED. We also want to better characterize&#xD;
      patients that will migrate from diagnosis to another.&#xD;

      The investigators propose to assess, with a cohort of patients with ED the prognostic value&#xD;
      of cognitive abnormalities associated with ED (cognitive flexibility and central coherence)&#xD;
      They will recruit 370 patients suffering from a current ED (anorexia, bulimia, binge eating&#xD;
      disorder, Eating disorder not otherwise specified).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be reassessed every year for 3 years.&#xD;
