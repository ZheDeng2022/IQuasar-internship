      OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Intraplaque neovascularization is one of the most important risk&#xD;
      factors for unstable carotid plaque. This study was designed to evaluate whether carotid&#xD;
      intraplaque neovascularization (IPN) can be accurately assessed by contrast enhanced&#xD;
      ultrasound (CEUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Preoperative CEUS analysis of 50 carotid artery stenosis patients would be compared&#xD;
      to histopathology performed on their plaques excised by carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with&#xD;
      CD34 and MMP9 staining.&#xD;

      1. To enroll 50 cases of patients suffering from carotid artery stenosis continuously, the&#xD;
           investigators perform contrast enhanced ultrasound on patients for identifying the&#xD;
           vulnerable plagues and taking high resolution MR inspection to analysis those plagues at&#xD;
           the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All patients undergo carotid endarterectomy. The vulnerable ingredients of carotid&#xD;
           plaques such as intraplaque neovascularization and bleeding are identified by&#xD;
           pathological examination and immunohistochemical staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the accuracy of CEUS for identifying carotid vulnerable plague compared with&#xD;
           high resolution MR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The investigators divide patients into the stable group and the vulnerable group based&#xD;
           on the results of CEUS inspection. To analysis the incidence of postoperative&#xD;
           complications such as stroke and mortality within 30 days and to compare the differences&#xD;
           between the two groups.&#xD;
