  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two distinct and sequential parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Phase Ib aimed at determining the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) of the combination&#xD;
           (copanlisib/cetuximab) and the RP2D&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Phase II aimed at evaluating the efficacy of the combination at the RP2D (Recommended&#xD;
           Phase 2 Dose)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated with the Copanlisib, a selective PI3KCA inhibitor, in&#xD;
      association with Cetuximab.&#xD;
