      This is a feasibility study to assess the use of wide field adaptive optics optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (WF-AO-OCT) to determine whether there are structural differences in the&#xD;
      peripheral retina in participants diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy compared to a healthy&#xD;
      control group. This study being conducted under an abbreviated IDE. The investigators will&#xD;
      analyze data using descriptive statistics. Risks related to light exposure will be managed by&#xD;
      ensuring that the exposure to the WF-AO-OCT light source is well below maximum permissible&#xD;
      limits for safe exposure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Adaptive optics (AO) is an optical technique that corrects the natural aberrations (optical&#xD;
      imperfections) of the eye. Since it was first described in 1997, it has been used&#xD;
      successfully to enhance the visualization of retinal tissue, in particular, the human&#xD;
      photoreceptor mosaic. Previous studies using AO in the human eye have contributed to&#xD;
      considerable advancements in our understanding of vision and ocular pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An AO system sends a pattern of light into the eye that balances the eye's inherent&#xD;
      imperfections. This leads to better imaging by providing better light focusing by the natural&#xD;
      lens of the eye. The AO system measures the light returning from the eye as is typical in&#xD;
      clinically accepted optical coherence tomography and scanning laser ophthalmoscope systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A schematic AO system consists of a light input, a deformable/adaptive mirror that modifies&#xD;
      the shape of the light entering and exiting the eye, and a detector system that captures and&#xD;
      analyzes the returning light from the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device used in this feasibility study has been tested to ensure that its light output is&#xD;
      within ANSI limits for safe ocular exposure and is capable of obtaining useful images of the&#xD;
      peripheral retina in normal subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic retinopathy represents the most common cause of vision loss in working aged adults.&#xD;
      Vision loss is related to two manifestations of advanced diabetic retinopathy: proliferative&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and diabetic macular edema (DME). PDR occurs when the vascular&#xD;
      perfusion of the retina is compromised and compensatory signals including expression of&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor causes neovascularization on the surface of the retina.&#xD;
      These abnormal vessels cause vision loss by either bleeding into the vitreous or by&#xD;
      contracting leading to retinal detachment. DME occurs when vascular leakage results in&#xD;
      swelling of the macular tissue causing central vision loss. While DME affects the macula (the&#xD;
      area typically imaged using OCT), PDR is much more frequently found in the peripheral retina&#xD;
      which is not typically imaged by traditional OCT devices. In recently years, wide field&#xD;
      fluorescein angiography has allowed insights into the relationship between DME, PDR and the&#xD;
      status of retinal blood vessels within the macula and the retinal periphery. WF-AO-OCT has&#xD;
      the potential to provide similar or complementary structural detail of the retinal tissue and&#xD;
      vasculature within the macula and retinal periphery. The advantage of WF-AO-OCT is that it is&#xD;
      a non-contact, non-invasive imaging technology which is easier to use, faster and less&#xD;
      invasive compared to fluorescein angiography which entails intravenous injection of&#xD;
      fluorescein, requires a skilled ophthalmic photographer and takes 10-20 minutes to perform.&#xD;
      By imaging participants who have previously undergone wide field fluorescein angiography as&#xD;
      standard of care, the investigators will be able to compare the information obtained using&#xD;
      WF-AO-OCT and to determine its sensitivity in identifying specific vascular and morphological&#xD;
      findings associated with PDR and DME.&#xD;
