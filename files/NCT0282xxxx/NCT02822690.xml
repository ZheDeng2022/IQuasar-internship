      The aim of this study is to get insight in the quality of life at the end of life and quality&#xD;
      of dying for patients died at the hospital in the department Groningen (the Netherlands).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the quality of life at the end of life and the secondary endpoint is&#xD;
      the quality of dying. Both according a numerical rating scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An explorative analysis will be done for differences for the hospitals in Groningen, effect&#xD;
      of using the Liverpool care Pathway for the dying, effect of using consultation by the&#xD;
      palliative consultation team, effect of using the Hospice@UMCG intervention, correlation with&#xD;
      the quality of life at the end of life and quality of dying according to nurses and doctors.&#xD;

      Three hospitals in the department Groningen (the Netherlands) will participate in this study.&#xD;
      When a patient died in one of these hospitals (except the emergency department, child ward&#xD;
      and intensive care unit) the bereaved relatives will get an information letter. After about&#xD;
      12 weeks a questionnaire will be sent to the bereaved relative. This questionnaire is&#xD;
      developed to evaluate the end of life care at the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shortly after the patient died at the hospital, also the nurse and doctor of this patient are&#xD;
      requested to fill out a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire for the bereaved relatives consists of items, divided in groups: a general&#xD;
      part, followed by questions of the last days of life, existing symptoms (physical,&#xD;
      psychological, existential and social), the care and treatment and the loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire for the nurses exists of similar items. Special attention for recognizing&#xD;
      the impending dying and problems, care and therapy at the end of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all questionnaires there are also 2 main questions: What is your opinion of the quality of&#xD;
      life during the last days of life and What is your opinion of the quality of dying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the three hospitals the end of life care is managed at somehow different ways: the use of&#xD;
      the Liverpool care Pathway of the dying, the hospice@UMCG intervention and consultation by&#xD;
      the palliative team of the hospital.&#xD;
