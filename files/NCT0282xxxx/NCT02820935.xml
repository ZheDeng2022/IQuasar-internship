      This is a two part study to be conducted at a single study site. Both parts of the study may&#xD;
      be conducted in parallel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of approximately 38 subjects will participate in this study, with approximately 19&#xD;
      subjects in Part 1 and approximately 19 subjects in Part 2. Each subject may only participate&#xD;
      in one of the parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each Part will consist of 2 study periods. Part 1 and Part 2, each subject will participate&#xD;
      in a Screening phase, one baseline visit per period, one dosing phase per period, and&#xD;
      follow-up telephone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, subjects will receive a single dose of CC-220 in Period 1 and, following an&#xD;
      appropriate washout, multiple doses of itraconazole plus one dose of itraconazole with CC-220&#xD;
      in Period 2. In Part 2, subjects will receive CC-220 in Period 1 and, following an&#xD;
      appropriate washout, multiple doses of rifampin plus one dose of rifampin with CC-220 in&#xD;
      Period 2.&#xD;

             (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any study-related&#xD;
             assessments/procedures being conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is in good health as determined by a Physical examination (PE) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject agrees to abide by the requirements and restrictions outlined in the CC-220&#xD;
             Pregnancy Prevention Plan for Subjects in Clinical Trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female subjects not of childbearing potential must:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Have been surgically sterilized (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; proper&#xD;
             documentation required) at least 6 months before screening, or be postmenopausal&#xD;
             (defined as 24 consecutive months without menses before screening, with a&#xD;
             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] level of &gt; 40 IU/L at screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Male subjects must:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Practice true abstinence1 (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis and source&#xD;
             documented) or agree to use a barrier method of birth control (condoms not made out of&#xD;
             natural [animal] membrane [latex condoms are recommended]) during sexual contact with&#xD;
             a pregnant female or female of childbearing potential (FCBP)2 while participating in&#xD;
             the study, during dose interruptions, and for at least 28 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             investigational Product (IP), even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 and ≤ 33 kg/m2 at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1 True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
        of the subject (periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation&#xD;
        methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception). 2 A female of&#xD;
        childbearing potential (FCBP) is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at some point; 2)&#xD;
        has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 3) has not been naturally&#xD;
        postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing&#xD;
        potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the&#xD;
        preceding 24 consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Subject has clinical laboratory safety test results that are within normal limits or&#xD;
        acceptable to the Investigator. Platelet count, absolute neutrophil count, and absolute&#xD;
        lymphocyte count must be above the lower limit of normal at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        10. Subject is afebrile, with supine systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 90 and ≤ 140 mmHg,&#xD;
        supine diastolic BP ≥ 50 and ≤ 90 mmHg, and pulse rate ≥ 40 and ≤ 110 bpm at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        11. Subject has a normal or clinically acceptable 12-lead ECG (Electrocardiogram) at&#xD;
        screening. In addition:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. If male, subject has a corrected QT value (based on Fridericia's formula) ≤ 430 msec&#xD;
             at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. If female, subject has a corrected QT value (based on Fridericia's formula) ≤ 450 msec&#xD;
             at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has any significant and relevant medical condition (including but not limited&#xD;
             to neurological, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, psychological,&#xD;
             pulmonary, metabolic, endocrine, hematological, allergic disease, drug allergies, or&#xD;
             other major disorders), laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would&#xD;
             prevent the subject from participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which&#xD;
             places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is a female of childbearing potential, pregnant, or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject was exposed to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days&#xD;
             preceding the first dose administration, or five half-lives of that investigational&#xD;
             drug, if known (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has used any prescribed systemic or topical medication (including but not&#xD;
             limited to analgesics, anesthetics, etc) within 30 days prior to the first dose&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;

          8. Subject has used CYP3A inducers and/or inhibitors (including St. John's wort) within&#xD;
             30 days prior to the first dose administration. The Indiana University &quot;Cytochrome&#xD;
             P450 Drug Interaction Table&quot; should be utilized to determine inhibitors and/or&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject has any surgical or medical conditions possibly affecting drug absorption,&#xD;

             cholecystectomy are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject donated blood or plasma within 8 weeks before the first dose administration to&#xD;
             a blood bank or blood donation center.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject has a history of drug abuse (as defined by the current version of the&#xD;
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual [DSM]) within 2 years before the first dose&#xD;
             administration, or positive drug screening test reflecting consumption of illicit&#xD;
             drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject has a history of alcohol abuse (as defined by the current version of the&#xD;
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)) within 2 years before the first dose&#xD;
             administration, or positive alcohol screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subject is known to have serum hepatitis or known to be a carrier of hepatitis B&#xD;
             surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody (HCV Ab), or have a positive result to&#xD;
             the test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject smokes &gt; 10 cigarettes per day, or the equivalent in other tobacco products&#xD;
             (self-reported).&#xD;
&#xD;

             site staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subject has received immunization with a live or live attenuated vaccine within 2&#xD;
             months prior to administration of the first dose of IP or is planning to receive&#xD;
