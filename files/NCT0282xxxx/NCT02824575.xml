    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of rebastinib when&#xD;
      combined with antitubulin therapy with paclitaxel or eribulin in patients with advanced&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastasis is the primary cause of death from breast cancer, invasive carcinoma cells in&#xD;
      mouse and rat mammary tumors co-migrate accompanied by macrophages towards intravasation&#xD;
      sites . The intravasation occurs at sites where a TIE2-expressing macrophage, a&#xD;
      mena-expressing tumor cell, and an endothelial cell are in direct contact, forming a&#xD;
      micro-anatomic structure called tumor micro-environment of metastasis (TMEM). Ablation of the&#xD;
      presence or activity of the TMEM associated macrophages blocks intravasation at TMEM&#xD;
      demonstrating an essential role of perivascular macrophages in TMEM function. Rebastinib, a&#xD;
      TIE2 inhibitor , blocks TMEM assembly and function in-vivo and in-vitro assays. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that rebastinib combined with antitubulin therapy (eribulin or paclitaxel) could&#xD;
      improve clinical outcomes in breast cancer by preventing intravasation at TMEM sites and&#xD;
      preventing further metastasis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast that is HER2 (human epidermal&#xD;
             growth factor receptor 2) negative; based on ASCO(american society of clinical&#xD;
             oncology)/ CAP (college of American Pathologists) guidelines as: (a) IHC&#xD;

             hybridization ) negative using single probe ISH( average HER2 copy number &lt; 4.0&#xD;
             signals/cell), or dual probe ISH ( HER2/CEP17 ratio &lt;2.0, average HER2 copy number&#xD;
             &lt;4.0 signals/cell)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Metastatic breast cancer not amenable to potentially curative surgery. Patients must&#xD;
             have disease that is measurable and/or non-measurable as defined by RECIST 1.1&#xD;
             criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy. Patients will be assigned to arm A or arm&#xD;
             B depending on their prior exposure to paclitaxel and eribulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Arm A: Rebastinib plus paclitaxel: Up to two prior non-taxane chemotherapy&#xD;
                  regimens for metastatic or incurable locally advanced disease permitted (no prior&#xD;
                  paclitaxel, docetaxel, or eribulin for metastatic disease)..Prior therapy with&#xD;
                  paclitaxel or docetaxel in the neo/adjuvant setting is allowable if there is at&#xD;
                  least a 6 month interval between the last adjuvant/neoadjuvant paclitaxel or&#xD;
                  docetaxel dose and recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Arm B: Rebastinib plus Eribulin: Patients must have previously received at least&#xD;
                  two chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of metastatic disease (no prior&#xD;
                  eribulin, but prior paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, or docetaxel allowed). Prior&#xD;
                  therapy should have included a taxane in either the adjuvant or metastatic&#xD;
                  setting.&#xD;

                  of completing adjuvant endocrine therapy may be considered failure of one prior&#xD;
                  endocrine regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Female and age &gt;18 years. Because breast carcinoma is a disease of adults that rarely&#xD;
             occurs in children, children are excluded from this study. In addition, the safety of&#xD;
             rebastinib in pediatric patients has not been evaluated.&#xD;

             macular edema or macular degeneration. Patients without such a history are required to&#xD;
             have a baseline ophthalmologic exam as part of screening, and must not have evidence&#xD;
