  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The disease Osgood-Schlatter is most commonly found in sports teenager growing up apophysose&#xD;
      accounting for 28.4% of osteochondrosis by Breck. It relates to 62% of osteochondrosis knee&#xD;
      and affects adolescent girls between 10 and 12 and boys between 12 and 15 It is usually&#xD;
      considered a benign pathology that cures in the majority of cases. However, in 5-10% of cases&#xD;
      there is persistent residual pain in adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The classic complication is the avulsion fracture of the tibial tuberosity in adolescents who&#xD;
      continued his sports without restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible consequences are numerous including the presence of a free bone fragment at the&#xD;
      insertion of the tendon originally described by Osgood the establishment of a genu&#xD;
      recurvatum, a high kneecap or patella alta and an enlarged tibial tuberosity (ATT) annoying&#xD;
      sport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main two treatments are complete rest from sport activity or cast immobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to compare these two technics according to the proportion of full&#xD;
      sporting recovering at 12 months&#xD;
