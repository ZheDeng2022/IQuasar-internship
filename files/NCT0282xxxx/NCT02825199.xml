      Objective: Assess the effect of caffeine in the following vestibular function tests: Cervical&#xD;
      Vestibular Evoked Potential (cVEMP), Ocular Vestibular Evoked Potential(oVEMP) and Caloric&#xD;
      Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Randomized, prospective triple-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial. All&#xD;
      participants underwent otoscopy, tympanometry, responded to the Profile of Mood State (POMS),&#xD;
      submitted to the cVEMP, oVEMP and caloric tests. After that they received placebo or caffeine&#xD;
      capsule (300mg) and repeated the procedures 45 minutes after.&#xD;

      Trial design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, prospective triple-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial approved by&#xD;
      the institutional review board under protocol number 1.399.322/16. Informed consent was&#xD;
      obtained after a full explanation of the experimental procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample was made up of medical students who agreed to participate as volunteers and had no&#xD;
      hearing and/or vestibular complaints or other health problems that could affect the&#xD;
      homeostasis of the vestibular system (problems in the cervical spine, cardiovascular&#xD;
      problems, migraine, metabolic disorders, hormonal changes, psychiatric disorders,&#xD;
      neurological diseases, use of prescription drugs continuously, smokers, alcoholics, illegal&#xD;
      drug users).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization, allocation and Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, study participants were randomized to receive caffeine or placebo at a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio, by independent statistician. Was used a completely randomized design for two&#xD;
      treatments which PLAN procedure (SAS 9.4). The allocation was made for a person outside the&#xD;
      study what identified the capsules in identical packages labeled with the name of the&#xD;
      participants. The active (caffeine) and placebo (maize starch) capsules were identical in&#xD;
      color, size, weight, and packaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants underwent otoscopy and tympanometry, responded to the Profile of Mood State&#xD;
      (POMS), submitted to the cVEMP, oVEMP and caloric tests in that order. After that the&#xD;
      participants received placebo or caffeine capsule (300mg). After 45 minutes the subjects&#xD;
      again responded to the POMS, repeated the cVEMP, oVEMP and caloric test. The tests were&#xD;
      performed in a center of rehabilitation of hearing and balance for the same audiologist, with&#xD;
      the data collection period was 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caffeine consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine caffeine consumption a questionnaire which sought to investigate eating habits&#xD;
      was applied. The participants have to include for each item (coffee, teas, soft drinks,&#xD;
      chocolate, powdered chocolate, powdered guarana, food supplements and energy drink) the&#xD;
      amount, kind (i.e. espresso, filter coffee) and brand. Based on these data, the consumption&#xD;
      was calculated using a preview standardization. From there, the subjects were classified&#xD;
      according to consumption: sporadic (less than 100mg), light (100 to 299mg), moderate (300 to&#xD;
      499mg). Those who had higher intakes equal to 500mg / day or more (heavy or very heavy) were&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-administered instrument that consists of 65 items describing feelings; to them should be&#xD;
      assigned values from 0 to 4 according to the Likert scale of 5 points (0 -no, 1 - a little, 2&#xD;
      - more or less, 3 - well, 4 - extremely). The POMS aims to evaluate six factors:&#xD;
      tension-anxiety (9 items), depression-dejection (15 items), anger-hostility (12 items),&#xD;
      vigor-activity (8 items), fatigue-inertia (7 items), confusion-bewilderment (7 items), and a&#xD;
      total mood disturbance score (TMD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      cVEMP&#xD;
&#xD;
      VEMP was performed in response to air-conducted stimuli, using alternate 500Hz (Hertz) tone&#xD;
      bursts presented at 120 dB (decibel) and rate of 5.1 stimuli per second. Bandpass filter of&#xD;
      10 Hz to 1500 Hz was used, 50ms window and 200 stimulations in each track were standard. Two&#xD;
      stimulations were recorded on each side, in order to observe the replicability. The stimuli&#xD;
      were presented via insert earphones. A cleaning of the skin with abrasive paste was performed&#xD;
      and surface electrodes were affixed using conductive paste. The non inverting electrode was&#xD;
      placed in the middle part of the sternocleidomastoid, the ground electrode in lower forehead&#xD;
      and the inverting on the upper forehead. The impedance of the electrodes should be less than&#xD;
      or equal to 5hms. Subjects were positioned seated and instructed to maintain maximum head&#xD;
      turn to the side contralateral to the stimulus throughout stimulation.The latency of P1 and&#xD;
      N1 and the P1N1 amplitude were analyzed in each ear and an asymmetry rate was also analyzed.&#xD;
      For the last one was used the formula: ǀ amplitude of right ear ǀ - ǀ amplitude of left ear ǀ&#xD;
      / ǀ amplitude of right ear ǀ + ǀ amplitude of left ear ǀ x 100. To compare the amplitudes in&#xD;
      each ear before and after tests was used the rate of change formula, consisting of: ǀ&#xD;
      amplitude of ear before ǀ - ǀ amplitude of ear after ǀ / ǀ amplitude of ear before ǀ + ǀ&#xD;
      amplitude of ear after ǀ x 100. The investigators considered normal p13 latencies between&#xD;
      13.9 to 19.2 and from 22.9 to 30.3 n23 and the asymmetry rate and rate of change of up to&#xD;
      28%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      oVEMP&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators used the same parameters of stimulation and analysis described in cVEMP.&#xD;
      Non inverting electrodes were placed on the face just inferior to each eye (inferior oblique&#xD;
      muscle), reference electrode was placed 1-2cm below contralateral to the stimulus and ground&#xD;
      electrode in the forehead. The subject was placed in the sitting position and instructed to&#xD;
      look upward. The latencies of initial negative (nI) and positive (pI) peak were measured.&#xD;
      They considered normal nI latencies from 10.2 to 11.8 and from 14.7 to17.3 pI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caloric test&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform the caloric test the investigators used an air otocalorimeter, and carried out&#xD;
      four stimulations of 60 seconds each, with a flow of 8 liters per minute: 50C in the right&#xD;
      ear, 50C on the left, 24C on the left ear and 24C in the right ear, in this order. The&#xD;
      absolute values and percentages of unilateral weakness or directional preponderance were&#xD;
      analyzed for each subject in each test. The subjects were considered normal when they showed&#xD;
      absolute values from 3 to 45, a range of 30% or less in directional preponderance and of less&#xD;
      than 25% in the unilateral weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was the latency waves for cVEMP and oVEMP and absolute and relative&#xD;
      values for caloric tests. These parameters were chosen for analysis of the primary outcome&#xD;
      for being these the most well-established parameters for use in clinical practice. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes were asymmetry ratio and ratio of change for cVEMP. There were no&#xD;
      secondary outcomes for oVEMP and Caloric test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-parametric tests were used seeking statistically describe and compare the two groups -&#xD;
      caffeine and no caffeine (Mann-Whitney test), the two time points - before and after in each&#xD;
      group (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and study the statistical effect of caffeine consumption on&#xD;
      the other variables (Jonckheere-Terpstra test). It was used a confidence interval of 95%.The&#xD;
      spreadsheet MS-Excel was used in your version of MS-Office 2013, for the organization of&#xD;
      data, and IBM SPSS (International Business Machines - Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Sciences), in its version 23.0, to obtain the results.&#xD;
