  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertile couples who come for evaluation and treatment in IVF unit could be under&#xD;
      psychological stress. Many authors in the past suggested that stress itself is one of the&#xD;
      factors that directly influence fecundability rate. In couples treated in IVF unit, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to measure chronic stress by measuring hair cortisol level (as a marker for&#xD;
      chronic cortisol release) and by filling different questionnaires.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many speculations regarding the decline in human fecundity are believed to be related to&#xD;
      environmental factors, including life style. Among many other factors, perceived&#xD;
      psychological stress has been suggested to alter both male and female fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many ways to asses stress, one of which is done by filling questionnaires. DASS-21,&#xD;
      a 21-item questionnaire, is a set of three self-report scales (Depression, anxiety, stress&#xD;
      scale). The negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress can be measured using&#xD;
      DASS21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the three DASS scales contains 7 items. Each item is rated on a four-point scale of&#xD;
      severity. By using DASS scale, stress and anxiety level of the subject can be monitored in&#xD;
      different situations in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another way to asses stress can be done by measuring peptides that are secreted in acute and&#xD;
      chronic stress, one of them is cortisol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cortisol is a glucocorticoid class steroid hormone; it is produced in humans by the zona&#xD;
      fasciculate of the adrenal cortex within the adrenal gland. It is quantified as a marker for&#xD;
      hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis reactivity. In humans, cortisol levels are increased in&#xD;
      stress, depression, and selected systemic diseases such as Cushing's syndrome as well as in&#xD;
      response to low blood-glucose concentration as well as a response to psychosocial stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experience of chronic adversity or stress is well-known to be associated with a range of&#xD;
      negative effects on health. A crucial neuroendocrine axis involved in mediating these effects&#xD;
      is the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis leading to the secretion of the glucocorticoid&#xD;
      cortisol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of long-term endogenous production of cortisol can be done by taking urine,&#xD;
      saliva or serum samples, while each of these measurements has advantages and limitations. All&#xD;
      these methods require multiple samples to provide an assessment of cortisol levels over&#xD;
      prolonged periods of time and it is important to note that those measures reflect acutely&#xD;
      circulating cortisol level or integrated cortisol secretion over the examined sampling&#xD;
      period. Another aspect is that acute cortisol level fluctuates markedly depending on many&#xD;
      factors such as circadian rhythmicity, acute stress, cigarettes smoking, alcohol, or&#xD;
      exercising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another strategy is to measure cortisol is a repeated sampling at different time of the day&#xD;
      over several days. But, in order for this strategy to be effective, large number of sampling&#xD;
      points during the day are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking together, real assessment of long term cortisol secretion can be difficult, thus a new&#xD;
      technique has been developed using hair. Positive association between hair cortisol and&#xD;
      accumulated salivary free cortisol was seen, and it was concluded that hair cortisol reflects&#xD;
      long term cortisol secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In infertile couples who come for evaluation facing stressful time that can cause an even&#xD;
      more reduction in fecundity, the investigators will measure long term cortisol secretion and&#xD;
      understand the effect of stress and cortisol on infertile couples.&#xD;
