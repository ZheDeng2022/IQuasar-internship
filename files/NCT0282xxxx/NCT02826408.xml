  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Palpitation is a common complaint. Patients frequently feel this symptom despite having&#xD;
      normal rhythm during symptoms. I have seen many patients who improve significantly on&#xD;
      treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPI). It may be that gastritis provokes a feeling of&#xD;
      discomfort that subsequently starts the feeling of palpitation. On searching literature I&#xD;
      found no study that investigated the effect of PPI's on palpitations. Therefore I propose a&#xD;
      study where the investigators randomize people with palpitations with normal heart rate (no&#xD;
      arrhythmia) and no apparent cause such as anxiety or clear illness to receive either PPI or&#xD;
      placebo. The result will help to investigate if the improvement is true and if the results&#xD;
      are positive this can provide a simple treatment for a common problem.&#xD;

      Methods Two hundred patients with palpitations and no clear cause for their symptoms will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either PPI or placebo for one month. At base line they will be&#xD;
      investigated to rule out arrhythmia by documenting normal heart rate (less than 110 beat per&#xD;
      minute) or ECG showing normal sinus rhythm or mild sinus tachycardia (Less than 110 per&#xD;
      minute) during symptoms. Obvious causes such as anxiety due to a stressful event or organic&#xD;
      causes such anemia or thyroid disorders should be also ruled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient who agree to participate in the study will be asked to sign an informed consent. A&#xD;
      baseline questionnaire with symptoms will be filled. They will then be randomized for&#xD;
      treatment with either PPI or placebo once at night time. After 10 days of treatment they will&#xD;
      be contacted and questioned regarding their symptoms. The two groups will be compared to see&#xD;
      if there is any improvement of symptoms with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studying group The study will be under the umbrella of the JCC group. Primary investigators&#xD;
      are Dr Munir Zaqqa and Dr Ismail Hamam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Support required Pharmaceutical company will be contacted to provide 120 packets with 30 tabs&#xD;
      of PPI and if possible packets with similar matching placebo to support the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study criteria inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Persons with palpitations and no clear cause who are above the age of 16 years and who&#xD;
           consent to the study will be included&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clear causes that should be excluded are true arrhythmia such SVT or VT or frequent&#xD;
           premature atrial or ventricular contractions or any organic cause such as thyroid&#xD;
           disorder, anemia (hg less than 11 g/dl) and obvious anxiety disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Arrhythmia can be excluded by an ECG showing sinus rhythm or sinus tachycardia during&#xD;
           episodes or measurement of heart rate by a reliable method during symptoms showing&#xD;
           regular heart rate less than 120 beats per minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient will be randomized to either PPI or placebo to be taken one table at night time&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients will be provided with 2 weeks supply but will be evaluated at 10 days to see if&#xD;
           symptoms improved&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The two groups will be compared using statistical methods to see if there is difference&#xD;
           in improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected harm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPI's are generally safe medications. Side effects are rare and generally mild. They include&#xD;
      nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea, constipation or headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very rarely allergic reaction can occur with hives, difficulty in breathing and swelling of&#xD;
      the face and lips.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefit to the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to either group may experience benefit due to the medication or even&#xD;
      placebo use. There is no financial benefit of participating in the study. The result of the&#xD;
      study will be used to help patient in the future with similar symptoms&#xD;
