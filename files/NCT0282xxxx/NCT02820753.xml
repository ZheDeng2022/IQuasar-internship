  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will leverage available technologies and test strategies to impart the Universal&#xD;
      Medication Schedule (UMS) in primary care to help patients understand, consolidate, safely&#xD;
      use, and adhere to their complex medication regimens.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study investigators will conduct a patient-randomized controlled trial using a 2x2&#xD;
      factorial design to compare the effectiveness of interventions, alone or in combination, to&#xD;
      one another. 1505 English and Spanish-speaking patients who are ≥ 50 years old, from a&#xD;
      federally qualified health center (FQHC) in Chicago, and prescribed ≥ 3 Rx medications will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive: 1) Enhanced Usual Care (EHR tools), 2) EHR tools + SMS, 3) EHR +&#xD;
      Portal, or 4) EHR + SMS + Portal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the effectiveness of the UMS EHR tools, with or without SMS and/or Portal&#xD;
           interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the 'fidelity' (reliability) of each strategy and explore patient, staff,&#xD;
           physician, and health system factors influencing the delivery of the interventions,&#xD;
           alone and in combination&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the costs required to deliver each of the interventions from a health system&#xD;
           perspective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to an NIA administrative hold, the interventions were not implemented as planned. Hence&#xD;
      it was determined that the primary analysis would be &quot;per-protocol&quot; rather than&#xD;
      intent-to-treat to assess the effect of the interventions under optimal conditions.&#xD;
      Participants who either received the initial 6 weeks of SMS messaging continuously, or logged&#xD;
      on to the patient portal and completed at least one survey will be considered as receiving&#xD;
      the intervention. Those who have not received the initial 6 weeks of texting or completed at&#xD;
      least 1 portal survey will be considered as enhanced usual care.&#xD;

    <description>Adherence will be measured for each Rx medication using: 1) Self-report of how many pills and how often each medicine was taken over the last 24 hours, 2) objective pill count at baseline and 6 month interviews, 3) the proportion of days covered (PDC), a measurement of days covered with medication, based on pharmacy claims General adherence behaviors and barriers to treatment adherence will be assessed by the ASK-12 Adherence Barrier Survey.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Systolic/diastolic blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic/diastolic blood pressure will be collected on all patients at baseline and 6 months.</description>

    <description>Patients who have not received the initial 6 weeks of text message reminders telling them to take their medicines; or did not complete at least 1 portal survey that asks them if they filled their medications, if they had any side effects or concerns; or did not receive either intervention will be considered as enhanced usual care.&#xD;
Patients will only receive EHR tools (patient-friendly med-sheets about their medicines, MedList putting their medicines into the Universal Medication Schedule, and UMS sigs on their Rx bottles).</description>
