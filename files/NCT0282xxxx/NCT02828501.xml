      Physical therapists frequently use spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) to treat spinal pain.&#xD;
      However, the methods by which SMT exerts its effects are not well understood. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to assess potential changes in pain pressure threshold following both a cervical and&#xD;
      lumbar spine manipulation in a single treatment session at sites local and diffuse to the&#xD;
      site of manipulation application. This study will also attempt to determine if the order of&#xD;
      the cervical and lumbar manipulation application impacts pain pressure threshold changes.&#xD;

      The aim of the proposed study is to add to the literature pertaining to the effects of spinal&#xD;
      manipulation on PPT. To date, no studies have assessed whether or not there is an additive&#xD;
      effect of multiple manipulations during a single treatment session on PPT. The proposed study&#xD;
      will assess potential changes in PPT between baseline measurements, following a single&#xD;
      cervical or lumbar manipulation, and after the delivery of second spinal manipulation&#xD;
      performed on a different segment. The study design will allow for the investigation of&#xD;
      possible additive effects, as well as for the effect of the first manipulation to be assessed&#xD;
      independently of the second. Order of delivery of the cervical and lumbar manipulation will&#xD;
      be randomized among participants to allow investigators to consider the possibility that the&#xD;
      order of the manipulations impacts PPT changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is a single spinal manipulation of either the cervical or lumbar spine associated with&#xD;
           an immediate increase in pain pressure threshold either locally or diffusely when&#xD;
           compared to a no treatment control?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the effect of a second spinal manipulation at a different segment immediately&#xD;
           following the first spinal manipulation on pain pressure threshold?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is there a difference based on the order of which spinal manipulation is administered&#xD;
           (cervical first, then lumbar; lumbar first, then cervical) on post-intervention local&#xD;
           and diffuse pain pressure threshold?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Research Design This study will be a cross-sectional, single-blinded randomized&#xD;
      control trial. This will be a single session, experimental approach in which participants who&#xD;
      meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be divided into three groups: treatment group 1,&#xD;
      treatment group 2, and control group. Group assignment will be performed using randomized&#xD;
      concealed allocation. Participants will undergo pain pressure threshold testing using&#xD;
      pressure algometry, followed by a cervical manipulation for treatment group 1 and a lumbar&#xD;
      manipulation for treatment group 2. The control group will rest quietly for an allotted&#xD;
      amount of time. Upon completion of the first intervention, a second pain pressure threshold&#xD;
      assessment will be performed. Treatment group 1 will then receive a lumbar manipulation,&#xD;
      while treatment group 2 receives a cervical manipulation. The control group will again rest&#xD;
      quietly. Following the second intervention, a final pain pressure threshold assessment will&#xD;
      be taken. The primary dependent measures will be 1) current pain intensity as reported by a&#xD;
      verbal numeric pain rating scale, 2) self-reported stiffness, and 3) pain pressure threshold&#xD;
      measured in Newtons.&#xD;
