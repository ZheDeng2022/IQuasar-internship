    <textblock>
      The SCD (Selective Cytopheretic Device) is an extracorporeal device used as an adjunct to&#xD;
      renal replacement therapy (RRT) to improve the outcomes of pediatric patients with acute&#xD;
      kidney injury (AKI). Funding Source - FDA OOPD (SCD-PED-01)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The selective cytopheretic device (SCD) is comprised of tubing, connectors and a hemofilter&#xD;
      cartridge. The device is connected in series to commercially available Continuous Renal&#xD;
      Replacement Therapy (CRRT) devices. Blood from the CRRT circuit is diverted after the CRRT&#xD;
      hemofilter through to the extra capillary space (ECS) of the SCD. Blood circulates through&#xD;
      this space and it is returned to the patient via the venous return line of the CRRT circuit.&#xD;
      Regional citrate anticoagulation is used for the entire CRRT and SCD blood circuits.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Must be receiving medical care in an intensive care unit (e.g., ICU, MICU, SICU,&#xD;
             CTICU, Trauma).&#xD;

          3. Age less than 22 years.&#xD;
&#xD;

             available therapies for a minimum of 96 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Clinical diagnosis of AKI due to etiologies requiring CRRT (see Appendix B). AKI is&#xD;
             defined as acute kidney injury with any one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Increase in SCr by ≥0.3 mg/dL (≥26.5 μmol/L) within 48 hours or;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Increase in SCr to ≥1.5 times baseline, which is known or presumed to have&#xD;
                  occurred within the prior 7 days or;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Urine volume &lt;0.5ml/kg/h for 6 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. At least one non-renal organ failure (defined as receiving mechanical ventilation or&#xD;
             at least one vasoactive medication to treat hypotension) OR presence (proven or&#xD;
             suspected) of sepsis. (Appendix C).&#xD;
