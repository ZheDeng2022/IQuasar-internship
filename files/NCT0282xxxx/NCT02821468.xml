  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A previous multicenter trial led by Bioiberica S.A. has confirmed the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      DROGLICAN for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) in patients with severe pain. The MOVES&#xD;
      study was a phase IV, double blind, randomized and non-inferiority trial to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of a fixed dose combination of glucosamine hydrochloride (GH) +&#xD;
      chondroitin sulfate (CS) (DROGLICAN) versus celecoxib in patient with symptomatic knee OA&#xD;
      with moderate to severe pain. This study concluded that both drugs reduced the WOMAC Pain&#xD;
      subscale by 50% without significant difference between groups. Further, there was no&#xD;
      difference in all secondary outcomes assessing patient's pain, functional capacity,&#xD;
      stiffness, inflammation, joint swelling, effusion, and overall quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new exploratory trial is aimed to evaluate the beneficial effect of DROGLICAN on the&#xD;
      good health of the cartilage of patients suffering of knee osteoarthritis as revealed by&#xD;
      qualitative assessment of cartilage biochemical composition in vivo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a post-marketing, open, exploratory, multicenter trial with 2 parallel-groups&#xD;
      of patients suffering from knee OA. Investigators will be private or public hospital&#xD;
      rheumatologists, general practitioners, or articular disease specialists located in Belgium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After evaluation by the investigator during a control visit or via on site-patient registry,&#xD;
      potential participants will be asked to perform an inclusion visit (V1). During this visit,&#xD;
      the investigator will assess the eligibility of the patients. Eligible patients will sign an&#xD;
      informed consent. The investigator will make a general evaluation (demography, medical&#xD;
      history, OA history, OA medication history, concomitant medications including &quot;rescue&#xD;
      treatments&quot;) and a pain evaluation. Synovial fluid will be collected in case of knee&#xD;
      swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected in a preselected clinical laboratory for future biomarkers&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to perform an MRI exam within 20 days following the inclusion visit&#xD;
      and representing the MRI at baseline. A standard X-ray will be performed at the same imaging&#xD;
      site if the last X-ray available is not responding to high quality standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For DROGLICAN arm, patients will be given investigational medicinal product (IMP) for a&#xD;
      6-month period via the hospital pharmacy where image acquisition will be performed. IMP&#xD;
      intake will begin right after baseline MRI acquisition. Study arm attribution will be&#xD;
      determined according to the order of enrolment at each investigating site and using a&#xD;
      randomization list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study subjects (receiving DROGLICAN or untreated control) will be allowed to take&#xD;
      paracetamol and oral NSAIDs excluding COX2 inhibitors to relief knee pain. Patients will be&#xD;
      asked to use these &quot;rescue medications&quot; only when needed during the trial, beginning by&#xD;
      Paracetamol (up to 3g/day) and NSAIDs as a second-line medication, and will be told to reduce&#xD;
      their use if they do not feel the need for them. The use of rescue treatments during the&#xD;
      month prior to each visit will be recorded by the investigator in a Case Report Form (CRF).&#xD;
      All other treatments for osteoarthritis will be forbidden during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return for consultation after 6 month (V2) and 12 months (V3). At each visit,&#xD;
      the investigator will make a general evaluation, and will record concomitant medications&#xD;
      including rescue medications, adverse events and drop-outs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For DROGLICAN arm, compliance to the IMP will be assessed by counting unused capsules within&#xD;
      the investigation kit brought back by the patient. At V2, patients will be given IMP for the&#xD;
      next 6 months. Patients will be asked to return to the investigator all unused capsules of&#xD;
      IMP at the next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples and synovial fluid (if applicable) will be collected for future biomarkers&#xD;
      analyses. MRI will be done at 6 months (V2) and optionally at 12 months (V3). Finally, an&#xD;
      optional X-ray might be performed at V3 depending on the result of the interim analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monthly phone calls will be made by the investigator to assess and encourage patient's&#xD;
      compliance (for DROGLICAN arm), to record potential adverse event, new concomitant treatment&#xD;
      and/or drop-off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' clinical data will be recorded at each visit in a CRF.&#xD;
