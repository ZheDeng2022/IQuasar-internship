  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition at hospital admission is a risk factor for an unfavourable outcome, prolonged&#xD;
      hospital stay and delayed recovery. In these patients the incidence of complications such as&#xD;
      nosocomial infections, poor ventilatory function, prolonged bed rest is increased. In&#xD;
      addition a relevant proportion of patients have a nutritional intake below their needs during&#xD;
      hospitalisation.Mortality has been shown to be up to 8 times higher and dependency at&#xD;
      discharge up to 3 times more frequent when actual food intake was below 25% of calculated&#xD;
      needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this international cross-sectional multicentre audit and registry is to generate a&#xD;
      risk and level of nutritional intervention profile for an individual unit/ward based on&#xD;
      case-mix, nutrition care and available structures. This profile should give a snapshot on the&#xD;
      relation of risk to resource allocation. The audit is unit centered. Each unit gets as a&#xD;
      feedback anonymously its position compared with all other participating units. Risk&#xD;
      adjustment for selected patient groups, social environments and structures is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion this audit/registry will serve five distinct aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Generate a precise map of the prevalence of malnutrition before admission and of&#xD;
           decreased nutrient intake according to risk factors, medical specialty, organisational&#xD;
           structures and countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase in awareness for clinical nutrition in patients, caregiver and hospital&#xD;
           managers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enlarge and maintain a reference database for hospitalised patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide individual unit benchmarking&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One day international cross-sectional audit in all types of hospital wards. Intensive care&#xD;
      units are excluded. Data are collected with the help of questionnaires. Anonymised data entry&#xD;
      into the audit database is done with individual and anonymous center and unit-codes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected consist of four parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unit organisation and structures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Structural information about the unit (one sheet / unit) to be filled by the unit&#xD;
           supervising physician together with the nursing head.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient's demographics &amp; medical information:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Demographic profile, diagnostic category based on ICD 10 and nutritional interventions&#xD;
           for all patients (one line / patient) to be filled by a responsible person from the&#xD;
           medical staff. Oncological patients have an additional caregiver sheet to define&#xD;
           precisely cancer stage and specific treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Individual self-administered patient questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each patient should document her/his nutritional intake during the study period. In&#xD;
           addition patients may be asked to fill a questionnaire about changes in nutritional&#xD;
           habits and reasons for decreased nutritional intake from the patient's perspective.&#xD;
           Oncological patients have an additional optional patient sheet to determine the specific&#xD;
           nutritional problems and supportive treatments used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Individual patient outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      hospital cohort: at hospital discharge or day 30, whatever comes first: date of unit&#xD;
      discharge, date of hospital discharge, site of discharge and health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation rules:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A user needs to register to nutritionDay as a member to the nutritionDay network. Each&#xD;
           may choose a personal user name. Each user needs to provide a valid email address. After&#xD;
           responding to a validation email the user is registered with the chosen user name. User&#xD;
           details are stored on a system that is not connected to the nutritionDay registry at any&#xD;
           time. One user may serve as contact for several units and centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A user may order codes for participation for one or several centers and units. Access to&#xD;
           the registry is only possible with a center code and unit code. These codes are selected&#xD;
           from a list of random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audit/registry recruitment plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation to the registry is voluntary. There is actually no participation fee. All&#xD;
      necessary information can be obtained from a dedicated website (www.nutritionday.org).&#xD;
      Participation can be promoted via international and national scientific societies,&#xD;
      universities, health care organisations or governmental agencies as well as via advertisement&#xD;
      at international and national congresses. The target would be all types of hospital wards&#xD;
      within hospitals of different sizes and level of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk and benefit assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit for each patient is that awareness and knowledge about nutrition related factors&#xD;
      and treatment options in the treating unit is increased. There is no individual risk since&#xD;
      the audit is purely observational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit for the individual unit is to receive an extensive benchmarking report displaying&#xD;
      the unit data in comparison with all units from the same specialty from the previous 3 years&#xD;
      immediately after the end of data entry and a validation step. Units or groups of units may&#xD;
      request specific reports that can be obtained only after a case by case agreement and&#xD;
      financial coverage. All data used as a reference for benchmarking purpose are from units&#xD;
      where a minimum of 60% of actually present patients have been recruited and the outcome at&#xD;
      day 30 is available in more than 80% of these patients. There is no risk for the unit since&#xD;
      anonymity of unit is structurally strictly maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit for the registry up-to-date data enabling benchmarking in pace with medical and&#xD;
      care evolution. Moreover the registry data are used for research of the scientific community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to recruit a minimum of 10-50 units with 20-30 beds per participating country. A&#xD;
      minimum of 10 units per medical specialty will be necessary to allow specialty adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data security:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the datasheets the unit and the hospital/center are identified by a numeric code delivered&#xD;
      after application to the nutritionDay coordinating center by an automatic system. The only&#xD;
      requirement is a valid email address for direct communication with the unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are usually identified on the locally used questionnaires by initials and age, but&#xD;
      use of initials is not mandatory. Consecutive numbering is also possible. Only the&#xD;
      participating unit has to trace patients identifier to be able to collect hospital outcome at&#xD;
      day 30 after nutritionDay and to answer automatic requests for data clarification during the&#xD;
      data quality feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During data entry into the electronic registry only anonymous codes for center, unit and&#xD;
      patients are possible. Thus the data handling centre cannot trace data back to an individual&#xD;
      patient. The access to data entry is protected by anonymous center-code and unit-code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typically all data are collected via a dedicated website accessed via www.nutritionday.org .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protected data server is run by the Center for Medical Statistics Informatics and&#xD;
      Intelligent Systems (CEMSIS) of the Medical University Vienna. The data server is mirrored&#xD;
      and backed up. The data server is protected within the University Firewall against external&#xD;
      access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data feedback and individual unit report&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participating units are entitled to receive a bench-marking report from the registry. The&#xD;
      report generator is started by the participating unit, when data entry has been completed. As&#xD;
      a first step each unit receives a data feedback sheet that is based on an electronic data&#xD;
      plausibility and missing data analysis. After stating that all data are correctly entered the&#xD;
      final report can be generated. This final report offers complete descriptive statistics of&#xD;
      the unit data compared to the reference data from the previous 4 years of the corresponding&#xD;
      specialty. Only data from units fulfilling a high data quality standard are used for the&#xD;
      reference. More than 60% of the patients present in the unit need to participate and 80% of&#xD;
      these patients need to have their outcome recorded. Optionally the period used for comparison&#xD;
      can be extended until 2006. All descriptive statistics represent prevalent data and are not&#xD;
      corrected for cross-sectional sampling to allow direct data control and interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All downloaded reports of a unit are consecutively numbered and stored for documentation&#xD;
      purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis and modelling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of the project is to serve local specialty specific and up-to-date benchmarking&#xD;
      with regard nutrition and feeding status , risk profile and nutrition care. Given the typical&#xD;
      cross-sectional sample of 20-30 patients frequent risk factors can be easily compared because&#xD;
      such risk factors as recent weight loss or less than normal eating are observed in one third&#xD;
      to half of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim is scientific data analysis. The actual research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying the risk factors associated with decreased eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysing the impact of risk factors for increased length of hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysing time-trends in risk profile and nutrition care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysing the economic impact of nutrition risk factors on the health care system&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Updating the PANDORA score if major change in performance is identified&#xD;
&#xD;
      The actual database includes 103 920 patients for the period 2006-2012 and allow the&#xD;
      following precision for estimating the prevalence of risk factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factor prevalence 1% precision as 95% CI 0.93-1.07%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factor prevalence 5% precision as 95% CI 4.87-5.14%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factor prevalence 10% precision as 95% CI 9.81-10.19%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factor prevalence 20% precision as 95% CI 19.75-20.25%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factor prevalence 30% precision as 95% CI 29.72-30.29%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factor prevalence 40% precision as 95% CI 39.70-40.30%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the typical participation of 12 000-20 000 patients annually, the investigators expect&#xD;
      to have a sufficiently precise database for benchmarking, when using the last 4 years data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the scientific data analysis the investigators use COX-regression or general linear model&#xD;
      with proper weighting of observations to account for the effect of cross-sectional sampling&#xD;
      for events such as discharge or death and linear regression models to analyse length of stay.&#xD;
      Whenever several events can occur in a patient a competing risk analysis is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data analysis will be done at the Dept. for Medical Statistics, Medical University&#xD;
      Vienna. After publication of the multinational results, all national datasets will be&#xD;
      available for national publication based on a research plan, if the number of wards is large&#xD;
      enough to ensure anonymity for the individual ward within the country.&#xD;
