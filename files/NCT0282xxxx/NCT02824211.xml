      Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of a new oxygen delivery device, the &quot;Right Dose&#xD;
      System&quot; (RDS). It delivers individualized boluses of oxygen during rest and exertion to&#xD;
      maintain acceptable oxygen saturations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures include: Enrollment of 10 patients, who are randomized to either exercise with&#xD;
      their oxygen prescription followed by exercise with the RDS, or exercise with the RDS&#xD;
      followed by exercise on their oxygen prescription. Randomization will occur on a 1:1 basis.&#xD;
      Each set of exercise will be separated by a 30 minute recovery session. Subjects will be&#xD;
      adults who are on supplemental oxygen and are able to exercise on a treadmill. Subjects will&#xD;
      be above 18 years of age. Subject participation will last approximately 1 month. Subjects&#xD;
      will be recruited from the Loma Linda pulmonary clinic and the pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
      program. Consent will take place in the pulmonary clinic, pulmonary function lab or pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation by trained study physicians. If Multi-center: N/A (single center) If Single&#xD;
      center or investigator-initiated: 10 subjects will participate in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consent will be administered by trained study physicians-each subject will be given the&#xD;
      opportunity to read the IRB approved consent form and ask questions before being enrolled in&#xD;
      the study. Consenting investigating physicians are all licensed medical doctors in the state&#xD;
      of California and will be instructed to determine that the subject is competent before&#xD;
      obtaining consent. After questions and concerns are answered, the patient will sign and date&#xD;
      the consent form. This process will be witnessed, signed and dated by one of the clinic staff&#xD;
      as well as the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-blinded study without a placebo group. The investigators will randomize subject&#xD;
      assignment to two cohorts with opposing intervention order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject confidentiality will be maintained by all staff. The LLUH Research Protections HIPPA&#xD;
      form will be utilized to inform and gain consent of the subject. Data will be maintained in a&#xD;
      locked department, in a locked office and in a locked cabinet. All electronic data will be&#xD;
      stored on the LLUH network and servers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background/Rationale for Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of a novel personalized oxygen&#xD;
      delivery device called the &quot;Right Dose System&quot; (RDS) compared to standard prescription of&#xD;
      oxygen, and current oxygen delivery devices during exercise. As an individual's oxygen needs&#xD;
      vary according to their level of activity, RDS would provide an individualized tailored pulse&#xD;
      of oxygen to meet the demand of each individual patient while maintaining the appropriate&#xD;
      oxygen saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare RDS to the standard flow of oxygen on current prescription in patients who require&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen during rest and exercise. This is a non-blinded, cross-over study with&#xD;
      1:1 randomization to either intervention A then B, or B then A. It will ascertain the&#xD;
      feasibility of this novel oxygen conservation device in maintaining oxygenation saturations&#xD;
      during exercise. The goal of the study is to establish proof of concept for this device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During exercise the utilization of the right dose system (RDS) will be compared to patient's&#xD;
      standard oxygen therapy. The study subjects will be enrolled to test 2 different oxygen&#xD;
      delivery devices (standard oxygen delivery device and RDS with SPO2 measurement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Screening &amp; Evaluation Patients will be enrolled in clinic or pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation. At this time, screening, evaluation and education about the study as well as&#xD;
      consent and demographics will be performed at: 1) pulmonary clinic at faculty medical offices&#xD;
      (FMO), 2) Loma Linda University Medical Center pulmonary function testing lab and/or 3) Loma&#xD;
      Linda University Medical Center pulmonary rehabilitation office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two tests evaluating O2 administration with O2 prescription &amp; RDS with active pulse oximetry&#xD;
      separated by a 30 minute recovery period. Order of intervention will be randomized into 2&#xD;
      groups: standard O2 therapy followed by RDS, versus RDS followed by standard O2 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measuring - exercise time, constant work rate endurance time, SPO2, modified Borg scale&#xD;
           for perceived exertion and shortness of breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second end point will be how much mean O2 delivered/minute (because patients may be&#xD;
           able to exercise much longer on the RDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Device:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Name of device: Right Dose System&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Manufacturer: Smart Oxygen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Status with Food &amp; Drug Administration, ID#: Pending Class 2, 5-10K predicate meeting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of animal studies &amp; previous human studies: None&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reported adverse effects: None, minimal risk device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics: Including etiology of hypoxemia, severity of disease process, height, weight,&#xD;
      age, gender, oxygen prescription, current oxygen delivery device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting blood pressure Pulse oximetry before, during, and after exercise (using the Masimo&#xD;
      Radical 7 pulse oximeter, K120657) Comfort level with walking, Perceived Exertion Level&#xD;
      (modified Borg scale) Resting, exercise and post-exercise Shortness of Breath (modified Borg&#xD;
      scale) Data Analysis The trial is powered to demonstrate feasibility of RDS in maintaining&#xD;
      targeted oxygen saturations in hypoxemic patients with exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be calculated for the baseline variables (demographics,&#xD;
      objective, and physical measures)-this will include means, SD, and range. Will evaluate the&#xD;
      differences in oxygenation at the three different levels of activity (rest, low exercise,&#xD;
      moderate exercise) utilizing the 2 different oxygen delivery systems by repeated measures&#xD;
      analysis of variance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constant work rate exercise time will be compared between the two groups via paired Student's&#xD;
      T-Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will have statistician assistance in providing: 2 variable t-test, ANOVA as will have&#xD;
      repeated measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits There will be no immediate benefit to subjects.&#xD;
