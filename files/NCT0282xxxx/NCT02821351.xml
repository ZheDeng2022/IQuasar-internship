&#xD;
      Study Design/Planned Number of Subjects/Number of Centers This study is a prospective, single&#xD;
      center, single arm study. A maximum of 75 subjects will be enrolled in the study to include a&#xD;
      maximum of 5 roll-in subjects in one investigational center in the Czech Republic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints The primary endpoint events for this trial as follows are to assess the&#xD;
      safety and performance effectiveness of the DiamondTemp System for the treatment of drug&#xD;
      refractory, recurrent, symptomatic PAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Safety Endpoint: The safety of the DiamondTemp System will be assessed by&#xD;
           evaluating the nature and frequency of serious adverse events (SAE) and serious adverse&#xD;
           device effects (SADE) during the time of the ablation procedure and within 7 days&#xD;
           afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Effectiveness Endpoint: The effectiveness of the DiamondTemp System will be&#xD;
           evaluated post-ablation with demonstration of acute procedural success defined as&#xD;
           isolation of clinically relevant pulmonary veins by demonstration of block or isolation&#xD;
           of signals confirmed after delivery of the ablation treatment. Depending on EP lab&#xD;
           protocol, one method will be chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following secondary endpoint will be evaluated to support the results of the primary&#xD;
      endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Secondary Safety Endpoint: The chronic safety of the DiamondTemp System will be assessed by&#xD;
      evaluating the nature and frequency of adverse events (AE) and adverse device effects (ADE)&#xD;
      at 30 days, 90 days, 6 months and 12 months post-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration The duration of the study is expected to last approximately 18 months from the&#xD;
      first enrollment to final report for assessment of endpoints. An additional 12 months to the&#xD;
      study closeout after the last follow-up.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Additional Follow-up visits (as determined necessary)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be considered complete for the purpose of reporting results with regards to&#xD;
      the primary endpoints after all subjects have completed the 7-Day follow-up. A final study&#xD;
      closeout report will be created after the last 12-month follow-up visit.&#xD;
