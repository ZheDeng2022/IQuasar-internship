    <textblock>
      Unanticipated difficult airway comprises of unexpected difficult bag mask ventilation or&#xD;
      unforeseen difficult laryngoscopy. The incidence of difficult laryngoscopy or unanticipated&#xD;
      difficult intubation in children was varied from 1.2 %to 4.77% depending on general or&#xD;
      specific population and type of surgery. The known risk factors of difficult intubation in&#xD;
      children were young age, associated syndrome or congenital abnormality and obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea. Moreover, the predictors of difficult laryngoscopy by physical examination were&#xD;
      associated with short interincisors distance, high frontal plane to chin distance, short&#xD;
      thyromental distance and Cormack &amp; Lehane classification 3 or 4. However, little knowledge is&#xD;
      known regarding difficult bag mask ventilation in children. The incidence of difficult bag&#xD;
      mask ventilation was 6.6% according to the single study. A few study reported the independent&#xD;
      risk factor of difficult bag mask ventilation in children which were young age, obesity, use&#xD;
      of neuromuscular blocking agent and airway surgery. In addition, the association between&#xD;
      difficult bag mask ventilation and difficult intubation are still unknown. To understand more&#xD;
      of difficult bag mask ventilation in children and factor-association may reduce incidence of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality by identifying difficult airway, preparing personnel and equipment&#xD;
      tool in order to improve clinical outcome in pediatric anesthesia. The objectives of the&#xD;
      study were to determine the predictors of difficult bag mask ventilation and the association&#xD;
      with unexpected difficult intubation in children who came for elective surgery in tertiary&#xD;
      care hospital of southern Thailand.&#xD;

      Study protocol and anesthesia practice Patient's demographic and history of snoring or&#xD;
      asthma/hyper-reactive airway were obtained by research assistant at preinduction period.&#xD;
      Standard monitoring including non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      electrocardiography and capnography were applied to all patients before starting general&#xD;
      anesthesia. All patients were received general anesthesia with oroendotracheal tube&#xD;
      intubation. Induction techniques were either inhalation anesthetic agent by&#xD;
      N2O-O2-sevoflurane or intravenous agent with 100% O2. Type of anesthetic circuit used (Circle&#xD;
      or Jackson-Rees) was depending on anesthesiologist in charge. Patients head position were in&#xD;
      neutral under small head ring to prevent head movement during induction. Maneuvers on bag&#xD;
      mask ventilation such as application of CPAP with opening airway maneuvers, oropharyngeal&#xD;
      airway or two person ventilations were recorded by research assistant at induction period.&#xD;
      When positive pressure ventilation was difficult after the patients had been slept, the CPAP&#xD;
      â‰¥5 cmH2O was applied incorporated with opening airway by head tilt/chin lip or jaw thrust&#xD;
      until assisted spontaneous ventilation was successful. BMV was performed during induction&#xD;
      with 100% O2. If performing BMV was possible, a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant was&#xD;
      administered to facilitate the laryngoscopy procedure. If performing BMV was difficult, deep&#xD;
      anesthesia using propofol, or a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant, or succinylcholine was&#xD;
      given to facilitate the BMV procedure. The anesthesia personnel who handled the BMV also&#xD;
      performed the first laryngoscopy. The laryngoscopists included anesthesia residents (more&#xD;
      than 1-year experience), nurse anesthetists (at least 1-year training), and anesthesiologist&#xD;
      attendants. Number of intubation attempts, Cormack-Lehane laryngoscopic view, intubation time&#xD;
      in second and presence of desaturation (SpO2 &lt; 95%) were recorded by research assistant at&#xD;
      intubation period. There were many optioned used to aid successful intubation such as&#xD;
      applying BURP maneuver, endotracheal tube with stylet used, change to smaller endotracheal&#xD;
      tube size, change laryngoscope type or change to more experience laryngoscopists. Attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologists take responsibility over anesthesia resident and nurse anesthetists for&#xD;
      first or second failure of intubation attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome of interest Primary outcomes were to determine the predictors of difficult bag mask&#xD;
      ventilation. The difficult bag mask ventilation was defined as the occurrence at least 2&#xD;
      following events which were requiring application of CPAP with opening airway maneuvers,&#xD;
      requiring oropharyngeal airway or nasopharyngeal airway, requiring 2- person bag mask&#xD;
      ventilation, unable to perform bag mask ventilation or presence of desaturation (SpO2 &lt; 95%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome was to find out the association between difficult bag mask ventilation and&#xD;
      unexpected difficult laryngoscopy/intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difficult laryngoscopy was defined as the Cormack-Lehane laryngoscopic view grade 3 or 4.&#xD;
      Difficult intubation was defined as the occurrence of at least two of the following: 1) at&#xD;
      least three intubation attempts using a conventional laryngoscope blade, either Miller or&#xD;
      Macintosh; 2) intubation time (the summation of all attempts from applying a laryngoscope to&#xD;
      the endotracheal tube that passed the vocal cords) &gt;300 seconds; and 3) the occurrence of&#xD;
      desaturation (SpO2 &lt;95%)The intubation time was defined as the time starting from applying&#xD;
      laryngoscope to presence of positive capnography wave form. In case of fail intubation, the&#xD;
      intubation time started from applying laryngoscope to remove laryngoscope from children's&#xD;
      mouth. The total intubation time was the combined timing of each intubation attempts&#xD;
