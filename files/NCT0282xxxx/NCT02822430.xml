      For several decades, authors are interested in the existence and meaning of painful symptoms&#xD;
      in a population of psychiatric inpatients. But, to date, studies specifically focused on the&#xD;
      impact of pain in patient populations in psychiatric hospitals are few. More recently, a&#xD;
      review of the literature highlights the difficulties of evaluation of pain in populations of&#xD;
      psychiatric patients but also the complex interrelationships between painful symptoms and&#xD;
      psychiatric diseases. The first national survey conducted among 172 health which evaluate&#xD;
      pain and its management in the field of psychiatry concluded on the need to develop research&#xD;
      in this area.&#xD;

      Pain in all the populations remains a major public health issue. Patients with mental illness&#xD;
      consult less their general practitioners while they have an increased risk of physical&#xD;
      disease. In addition, they have a net reduction in life expectancy due to their mental&#xD;
      illness, living conditions and drug treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this particular population, doctors faces especially difficulties assessment and treatment&#xD;
      of pain. Indeed, there is for example in some of these patients difficulties to express that&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These painful events make more complex the care of hospitalized patients (eg&#xD;
      interrelationship between pain complaints and psychiatric symptoms) and seem to lengthen&#xD;
      their hospital stay. This is not without consequences as long as hospitalizations represent&#xD;
      an obstacle to the patients psychosocial rehabilitation (installation of daytime activities,&#xD;
      project work rehabilitation, development of social network ...) and impair their quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And for the patients with psychiatric disorders some points can be noticed :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An increased risk of physical disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Warning signs like pain poorly known and poorly evaluated ... and poorly supported&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of the pain seems to lengthen the hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An extension of the hospital stay, which represent an obstacle to the psychosocial&#xD;
           rehabilitation This research project is to test if the presence of a painful complaint&#xD;
           among psychiatric inpatients is associated lengthening of the hospitalization duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the prevalence of painful complaint in this specific population,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the evolution of pain during hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify factors influencing the relationship between pain and length of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify if the intensity of the psychiatric illness is associated with pain&#xD;
           intensity measured&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirmation of these objectives would lead to a better understanding of the factors&#xD;
      influencing psychiatric hospital stays and thus more efficient management of health&#xD;
      resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the present study will well identify and implement standardized assessments of&#xD;
      pain for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these patients the interest is important because they can be in great difficulty to&#xD;
      express a painful complaint. These people have often difficulties to communicate, and live in&#xD;
      a sometimes precarious environment and severity of disorders reduce their access to care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach is part of a comprehensive approach taking account of the psychiatric and&#xD;
      somatic disorders in a very vulnerable population.&#xD;
