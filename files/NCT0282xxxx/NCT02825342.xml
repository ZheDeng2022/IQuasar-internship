  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non cardiac chest pain (NCCP) is defined as recurring, angina-like, retrosternal chest pain&#xD;
      of non cardiac origin. Annual prevalence of NCCP in the general population of the western&#xD;
      world ranges from 25-35%. Of those patients presenting to an emergency room with chest pain,&#xD;
      a cardiac etiology is ultimately found in only 11-39%. Several conditions are associated with&#xD;
      NCCP, with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) being the most prevalent, constituting up&#xD;
      to 60% of cases. However, NCCP is considered a disorder of heterogenous nature and several&#xD;
      other conditions, apart of GERD, such as esophageal dysmotility and esophageal&#xD;
      hypersensitivity have been implicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of NCCP remains a real challenge due to the diverse underlying mechanisms&#xD;
      responsible for patients' symptoms. Given the fact that GERD is by far the most common&#xD;
      etiology, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy has been tried extensively; however, after 6&#xD;
      weeks of treatment complete resolution of symptoms occurs in only 30% of patients, the&#xD;
      optimal duration of PPI administration is not known, while the best maintenance dose has&#xD;
      never been determined. Although the administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&#xD;
      (SSRIs) could theoretically benefit those patients with esophageal hypersensitivity, the&#xD;
      trials that have been published so far have included small number of patients and reported&#xD;
      conflicting results, while the co-administration of PPIs with SSRIs has not been evaluated so&#xD;
      far. Furthermore, data on treatment of patients with functional chest pain are lacking.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have therefore designed a prospective study in order to evaluate the effect of PPI and&#xD;
      SSRI therapy for different subtypes of NCCP patients using multichannel intraluminal&#xD;
      impedance and pH (MII-pH) monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with non cardiac chest pain symptoms presenting to the participating centres, will&#xD;
      be prospectively screened for entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They should have undergone a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation by cardiologists in order to&#xD;
      exclude a cardiac source for their chest pain. Patients recruited in the study should have&#xD;
      either a normal coronary angiogram or lack of ischemic heart disease on exercise treadmill or&#xD;
      stress thallium testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria i) patients should have at least 3 episodes of chest pain per week in the&#xD;
      previous 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) thoracic, esophageal or gastric surgery ii) primary or secondary esophageal motility&#xD;
      disorders iii) use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin iv) presence of&#xD;
      Barrett's esophagus, erosive esophagitis, peptic stricture and duodenal or gastric ulcer on&#xD;
      upper endoscopy v) eosinophilic esophagitis vi) underlying psychiatric illness vii) pregnancy&#xD;
      in women viii) refusal to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects who will agree to participate in the study should undergo an upper endoscopy to&#xD;
      assess the presence or absence of esophageal mucosal injury. Patients with Barrett's&#xD;
      esophagus and erosive esophagitis will not be included in the present study. Furthermore,&#xD;
      biopsies will be taken and patients with eosinophilic esophagitis will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will also be subjected to stationary esophageal manometry and those with&#xD;
      motility abnormalities will be excluded. During esophageal manometry the lower esophageal&#xD;
      sphincter (LES) will be located.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal impedance-pH monitoring will be performed in all participating subjects using an&#xD;
      ambulatory multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII) and pH monitoring system (Sleuth;&#xD;
      Sandhill Scientific, Inc. Higland Ranch, CO, USA). During the test, each subject will eat&#xD;
      three standard meals, while the beginning and ending times of every meal will be indicated in&#xD;
      a diary. Subjects will also be instructed to press the event marker button on the data logger&#xD;
      whenever they experience chest pain. Data recording will be concluded after 24 hours, when&#xD;
      patients will return to the endoscopy unit for the catheter removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impedance and pH data will be used to determine in each patient the number and type of&#xD;
      reflux episodes and the total 24-hour esophageal acid exposure, defined as the total time at&#xD;
      pH below 4 divided by the time monitoring. Total distal esophageal acid exposure (i.e., %&#xD;
      time pH &lt; 4) less than 4.2% over 24 hours will be considered normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each patient we will calculate the symptom index (SI) for chest pain. Bioview analysis&#xD;
      software will be used for the calculation of SI. According to the setting of this software&#xD;
      the symptoms will be considered as being related to reflux if they occur within a 2-min time&#xD;
      window after the onset of the reflux episode. SI will be defined as the number of symptoms&#xD;
      associated with reflux divided by the total number of symptoms. A positive SI is declared if&#xD;
      â‰¥ 50% (i.e, at least half of the symptoms are associated with reflux).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will abnormal distal acid esophageal exposure will receive PPI twice daily for 8&#xD;
      weeks .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with positive symptom index for chest pain will receive citalopram 20 mg once daily&#xD;
      and PPI once daily for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a negative symptom index for chest pain will receive citalopram 20mg once daily&#xD;
      for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be evaluated at the end of the 8-week period and will be asked about the&#xD;
      presence or absence of chest pain. Treatment success will be defined as the complete&#xD;
      disappearance of the chest pain, while the presence of mild or infrequent symptoms will be&#xD;
      considered as treatment failure.&#xD;
