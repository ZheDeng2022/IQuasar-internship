  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of developmental disorders in adults is still difficult. Indeed, in France,&#xD;
      there is not questionnaires to easily and accurately diagnose this disorder. Several&#xD;
      diagnostic scales were developed in English. Among them, RAADS-R scale, which is a clinical&#xD;
      tool that aims to better identify autism spectrum disorders including mild forms in adult&#xD;
      people and help to diagnose of high-functioning autism . The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      perform a complete validation of this scale in the french version.&#xD;

      The diagnosis of developmental disorders in adults is still difficult. Indeed, in France,&#xD;
      there is not questionnaires to easily and accurately diagnose this disorder. Several&#xD;
      diagnostic scales were developed in English. Among them, RAADS-R scale, which is a clinical&#xD;
      tool that aims to better identify autism spectrum disorders including mild forms in adult&#xD;
      people and help to diagnose of high-functioning autism . This scale is a self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaire completed by the person himself assisted by a clinician (psychiatrist,&#xD;
      psychologist) which ensures the understanding of issues and the choice of answers. The scale&#xD;
      contains 80 items including 64 questions describe specific symptoms of autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorders and 16 questions describe non-symptomatic behaviors. The objective of this study is&#xD;
      to perform a complete validation of this scale in the french version. 300 adults should be&#xD;
      included, including 100 adults with high-functioning autism, 100 adults with another&#xD;
      psychiatric disorder, and 100 adults without developmental disabilities and / or mental.&#xD;
