  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of three dose levels of&#xD;
      H3N2 M2SR influenza vaccine versus placebo delivered intranasally to healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy adult subjects will be screened with the objective to randomize 96 subjects with the&#xD;
      lowest levels of H3 hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers that meet all&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and have signed an informed consent. Subjects will be rank&#xD;
      ordered from low to high based on their HAI titer. Subjects will then be assigned treatment&#xD;
      based on a randomization to either active vaccine or placebo. The first two subjects dosed in&#xD;
      each dose cohort will serve as sentinels and will receive active IP (not randomized).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a single dose inoculation of the H3N2 M2SR seasonal monovalent&#xD;
      influenza vaccine administered intranasally as a liquid formulation, or placebo (saline). The&#xD;
      sentinel subjects will be vaccinated in dose cohort 1 and a safety monitoring committee (SMC)&#xD;
      will conduct a review of safety data, tolerability, reactogenicity, and clearance of&#xD;
      infectious virus prior to dosing the remaining subjects of the cohort with active or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the last subject in the cohort has been followed for at least 7 days the SMC will&#xD;
      conduct another review of safety data prior to proceeding to the next higher dose level:&#xD;
      Cohort 2. The same processes of sentinel subject dosing and SMC review will be conducted for&#xD;
      Cohorts 2 and 3.&#xD;
