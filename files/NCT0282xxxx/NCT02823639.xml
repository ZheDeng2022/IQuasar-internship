  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impairments of cognition are a core, severely disabling feature of schizophrenia leading to&#xD;
      poor long-term outcome with no established treatment available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particularly impaired executive functions (e.g working memory) are frequently observed and&#xD;
      are consistently associated with reduced activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (dlPFC). Deficits in those functions have been shown to be closely related to negative&#xD;
      symptoms, thought disorder, and functional outcome in schizophrenia leading to the notion&#xD;
      that frontal lobe dysfunction is crucially important in schizophrenic psychopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninvasive brain stimulation like tDCS can enhance executive functions like working memory&#xD;
      in healthy subjects as well as in patients. To identify the optimal parameters for this&#xD;
      intervention in patients with schizophrenia, the investigators first test the effects of&#xD;
      different polarities (anodal, cathodal), stimulation intensities (1mA, 2mA) and laterality&#xD;
      (left, right) on working-memory performance (nback task) in a sham-controlled cross-over&#xD;
      design (n=128). To elucidate mechanisms of action, oscillatory brain activity will be&#xD;
      registered with electroencephalography (EEG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These experiments will provide reliable data for an evidence-based development of new&#xD;
      clinical interventions to improve treatment of cognitive deficits in patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia and thus enhance schizophrenia prevention and recovery.&#xD;

      1. Working hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In patients with subacute schizophrenia, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)&#xD;
           to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) exerts lasting beneficial effects on&#xD;
           working-memory performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research question(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
           In patients with remitted early phase schizophrenia, this research project aims at&#xD;
           providing evidence for:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) immediate improvement of working-memory performance by application of tDCS to the&#xD;
           dlPFC in patients with schizophrenia; ii) determination of the optimal stimulation&#xD;
           polarity, dosage and localization; iii) neurophysiological mechanisms (modulation in&#xD;
           oscillatory activity and functional connectivity) and predictors of tDCS effects; iv)&#xD;
           modulating effect of gender on the malleability of executive functions with tDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Previous work of the investigators:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators have provided proof-of principle evidence for persisting improvement&#xD;
           of cognitive planning by a polarity-specific learning-stage dependent coupling of&#xD;
           training and stimulation. The investigators have demonstrated that working memory and&#xD;
           deficient cognitive control can be enhanced with anodal tDCS in depression and that the&#xD;
           effects of tDCS are modulated by genetic polymorphisms. The investigators were the first&#xD;
           to show impaired cortical plasticity following tDCS in schizophrenia patients at&#xD;
           different disease states. Finally, the investigators have just successfully finished the&#xD;
           world-wide largest clinical trial investigating the efficacy of non-invasive brain&#xD;
           stimulation (rTMS) on negative symptoms in schizophrenia (DFG 241/10-1, Falkai, Hasan).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Aims and work plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the potential of tDCS for the improvement of working memory with remitted&#xD;
      schizophrenia the investigators are following this work plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I) Immediate effects on performance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of efficacy of tDCS polarity (anodal, cathodal), dosage (1mA, 2mA) and laterality&#xD;
      (left and right dlPFC) on working memory (adaptive n-back(6)) in patients (n=2x2x2x16=128).&#xD;
      In a two-session cross-over design, stimulation (tDCS and sham) will be applied to the dlPFC&#xD;
      (left or right) for 20min (during task performance).&#xD;
