    <textblock>
      This is an observational neuroimaging treatment study. This study involves examining the&#xD;
      neural circuitry of controlled treatment of patients presenting with a first-episode of&#xD;
      psychosis with risperidone or aripiprazole. Patients who present for treatment of a first&#xD;
      psychotic episode with a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis and who are eligible to undergo&#xD;
      treatment with either risperidone or aripiprazole will be offered participation in the study.&#xD;
      Clinical ratings, neuropsychological testing, neuroimaging and EEG will be conducted at&#xD;
      baseline. Additionally, subjects will undergo the same assessments at week 12 to determine&#xD;
      treatment-related biomarkers. Clinical ratings, including neurocognitive testing, will be&#xD;
      conducted by blinded raters at study visits during treatment. Healthy controls (N=50) will&#xD;
      also be recruited and scanned twice (12-week interval) to control for effects of time and&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

      In this proposed study, the study will examine treatment-related effects on functional brain&#xD;
      circuitry in first episode schizophrenia. Converging lines of evidence suggest a key role for&#xD;
      striatal disconnectivity in the pathophysiology of psychosis. The proposed study will utilize&#xD;
      resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), as well as fMRI tasks derived&#xD;
      from the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, to: 1) develop and validate a prognostic&#xD;
      biomarker to predict antipsychotic treatment response; and 2) to model the underlying neural&#xD;
      circuitry changes associated with state changes in psychotic symptomatology. As a prognostic&#xD;
      biomarker, a neuroimaging assay of striatal connectivity can potentially provide a clinically&#xD;
      useful tool to advance the goal of precision medicine. As a longitudinal index of symptom&#xD;
      change, our model can serve as an objective index against which to measure potential efficacy&#xD;
      of newly developed antipsychotic treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large, well-characterized cohort of patients presenting with a first episode active&#xD;
      psychosis (regardless of DSM diagnosis) will be recruited, along with matched controls. The&#xD;
      study will utilize two well-validated fMRI tasks capturing two portions of the positive&#xD;
      valence system: probabilistic category learning and reward responsiveness; these tasks are&#xD;
      designed to interrogate dorsal and ventral corticostriatal circuits, respectively. The design&#xD;
      will be longitudinal, with two scanning sessions performed for each patient: at baseline, and&#xD;
      after 12 weeks of treatment. Treatment will be standardized across all patients to reduce&#xD;
      potential confounds, and healthy controls will also be scanned at baseline and 12 weeks in&#xD;
      order to control for effects of time and practice. Level of psychotic symptomatology&#xD;
      (hallucinations, delusions, and thought disorder) will be measured at regular intervals using&#xD;
      a comprehensive battery of rating scales. As secondary measures, electroencephalography (EEG)&#xD;
      will be performed coinciding with neuroimaging on a subset of patients who provide consent.&#xD;
      We will utilize Kaplan-Meier estimators and hierarchical linear modeling to examine the&#xD;
      association of baseline striatal connectivity, and changes in connectivity over time, with&#xD;
      clinical response of psychotic symptoms to antipsychotic treatment. Deliverables will include&#xD;
      both baseline and longitudinal biomarkers that can subsequently be tested in broader, more&#xD;
      heterogeneous populations of patients with psychosis.&#xD;

    <description>Risperidone or aripiprazole will be administered. Subjects will start risperidone 1 mg qhs or 5mg qhs aripiprazole; on day 4 the daily dose will be increased to 2 mg risperidone or 10mg aripiprazole and to 3 mg risperidone or 15mg aripiprazole at day 7. The target dose is 3 mg risperidone or 15 mg aripiprazole daily but patients who remain psychotic can be increased to 4 mg risperidone or 20mg aripiprazole at week 4; 5 mg risperidone or 25 mg aripiprazole at week 6 and 6 mg risperidone or 30 mg aripiprazole at week 8. Study Psychiatrists will be able to increase faster if symptoms don't improve as well as decrease for side effects. These dose ranges conform with standard clinical practice and are within the FDA approved dosing ranges for schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorder. Subjects advance in the risperidone titration schedule until they respond or develop dose-limiting side effects.</description>
