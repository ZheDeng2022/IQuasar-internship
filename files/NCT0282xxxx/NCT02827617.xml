  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general aim of the project is the identification of dynamic molecular markers that can&#xD;
      help the early and real time prediction of sustained benefit or no benefit from ibrutinib&#xD;
      treatment in CLL harboring TP53 mutations. Specific aims of the project include: 1) Assess&#xD;
      whether clearance of TP53 mutated clones translates into a predictive biomarker of long term&#xD;
      benefit from ibrutinib treatment in CLL. 2) Assess whether plasma cell free DNA represents a&#xD;
      sensitive tool that can early and dynamically inform on the development of ibrutinib&#xD;
      resistant mutations in CLL.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the chemoimmunotherapy era, TP53 mutations defined a subgroup of high risk chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients in whom allogeneic stem cell transplantation had to be&#xD;
      strongly considered. As a result of the accumulating favorable outcome data reported for new&#xD;
      biological drugs, including ibrutinib, in high risk CLL harboring TP53 mutations, there is&#xD;
      concern about whether these patients should continue to be offered allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation. Despite their improved outcome, a proportion of high risk CLL harboring TP53&#xD;
      mutations is going to develop ibrutinib resistance, which in turns translate in a very poor&#xD;
      survival. On these bases, in the setting of ibrutinib treatment, novel biomarkers are&#xD;
      required to re-define high risk CLL patients candidate for consolidation strategies including&#xD;
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Our working hypotheses are that: i) clearance of high&#xD;
      risk TP53 mutated clones upon treatment with ibrutinib may associate with long progression&#xD;
      free survival (PFS), while conversely, the persistence or increase of high risk TP53 mutated&#xD;
      subclones under ibrutinib may associate with acquisition of resistance and disease&#xD;
      progression; and ii) plasma cell free DNA represents an accessible source of tumor DNA for&#xD;
      the early and sensitive identification of mutations causing resistance to ibrutinib. By using&#xD;
      highly sensitive ultra-deep next generation sequencing strategies to monitor molecular&#xD;
      biomarkers potentially relevant for ibrutinib in DNA coming from both cellular and the plasma&#xD;
      fractions of peripheral blood, the project has the chance of identifying new dynamic&#xD;
      molecular markers that can help the early and real time prediction of sustained benefit from&#xD;
      ibrutinib treatment vs imminent progression in TP53 mutated CLL patients. In the end, the&#xD;
      results of this study will provide the bases to refine the current approach for treatment&#xD;
      tailoring in TP53 mutated patients by allowing the identification of cases who, though being&#xD;
      in clinical response under ibrutinib, will conceivably benefit from immediate switch to&#xD;
      alternative options (i.e. novel drugs, allogeneic stem cell transplantation, or CART).&#xD;
