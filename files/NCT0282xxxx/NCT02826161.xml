  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, multi-center, prospective, randomized, open-label Phase 3 clinical&#xD;
      trial of the cancer stemness inhibitor napabucasin administered with weekly paclitaxel versus&#xD;
      weekly paclitaxel alone in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer who&#xD;
      have disease progression following systemic treatment with a platinum-based combination&#xD;
      regimen in the metastatic setting, who have received treatment with an immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor if a candidate, additional approved therapies, and for whom weekly paclitaxel is an&#xD;
      acceptable treatment option.&#xD;

    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>On 12 June 2017 the sponsor notified study investigator that the study was terminated because of the rapidly evolving standard of care for patients with NSCLC. At the time of the termination, there were only 4 patients randomized (3 to the control arm and 1 to the napabucasin arm). Due to the small sample size, neither safety or efficacy data were analyzed or summarized for this study.</limitations_and_caveats>
