      A prospective observational cohort study to assess the predictive value of preoperative&#xD;
      frailty on postoperative quality of life in peripheral vascular surgery patients.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentage of elderly in the general population is increasing rapidly. Currently, the&#xD;
      Dutch population comprises for one fifth of persons aged 65 years or older and recent&#xD;
      estimates show this will increase to roughly a quarter in the next 20 years. Since th&#xD;
      incidence of peripheral arterial disease increases with age, this rise in elderly will also&#xD;
      reflect on the population of patients being referred for vascular surgery. Elderly patients&#xD;
      are at higher risk for postoperative complications, mortality or functional decline than&#xD;
      younger patients. In frail elderly this effect might be more pronounced. Frailty is an&#xD;
      umbrella term that encompasses patient related factors such as weight loss, muscle wasting,&#xD;
      inactivity, comorbidities and polypharmacy. Current scoring systems that are used to predict&#xD;
      postoperative mortality and complications following vascular surgery perform poorly in the&#xD;
      elderly population and do not take into account frailty. Moreover they are designed to&#xD;
      predict mortality and complications and are not validated to predict patient reported outcome&#xD;
      measures such as quality of life or functional status. The aim of the AGE VASC study is&#xD;
      assess the value of frailty factors in predicting an improvement in quality of life one year&#xD;
      after peripheral vascular surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AGE VASC study is a prospective observational cohort study. All patients aged 70 years or&#xD;
      older, scheduled for peripheral vascular surgery of the lower limb, mentally competent and&#xD;
      have signed informed consent are eligible for the study. Before surgery patients will be&#xD;
      screened for frailty using different questionnaires and physical tests. The battery of tests&#xD;
      exists of Short Form 36 (SF36), Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ), Multi Nutritional&#xD;
      Assessment (MNA), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Nagi's scale for disability,&#xD;
      Geriatric Depression Scale -8 (GDS8), three physical tests: five meter walking speed, timed&#xD;
      get up and go test and hand grip strength. And a non-invasive measurement of Advanced&#xD;
      Glycation Endproducts (AGEs). A blood sample will be taken to determine vitamin status,&#xD;
      immune status and iron deficiency. After surgery, electronic patients charts will be studied&#xD;
      to score postoperative complications or mortality. Three and twelve months after surgery&#xD;
      patients will receive SF-36, WIQ, and World Health Organization Disability Assessment&#xD;
      Schedule (WHODAS) 2.0 questionnaires to determine quality of life and functional status.&#xD;
