    <textblock>
      This phase II trial evaluates how effective 560 mg of ibrutinib taken by mouth daily is in&#xD;
      the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma which recurs or does not respond to initial&#xD;
      treatment. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth, by altering the environment around the tumor or by affecting the&#xD;
      immune system.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the antitumor efficacy of single agent ibrutinib as measured by the overall&#xD;
      response rate in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma who have relapsed or&#xD;
      not responded to chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess duration of tumor control including duration of response (DOR) II. To assess&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS). III. To assess the safety and tolerability of 560mg of&#xD;
      ibrutinib in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the mechanism(s) by which ibrutinib may be active in patients with classical&#xD;
      Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) by the correlation of potential biomarkers with clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD). Courses repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days then every 9 weeks&#xD;
      for 1 year.&#xD;
