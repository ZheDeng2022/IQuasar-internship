  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this trial is to assess efficacy and safety of the combination of low&#xD;
      doses of Methotrexate (MTX) with anti Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) alpha to improve initial&#xD;
      efficacy and maintenance rate of anti-TNF alpha treatment in patients with psoriasis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of an anti-TNF alpha and methotrexate may also prevent the development of&#xD;
      antibodies to anti TNF alpha. Observational studies indicated that MTX dose-dependently&#xD;
      inhibits the development of anti-drug antibodies and could reduce the accelerated clearance&#xD;
      of biological agents associated with loss of therapeutic response in inflammatory diseases.&#xD;
      Reduced ADA development influence positively clinical response and therefore likely drug&#xD;
      maintenance through optimizations of drug pharmacokinetics and serum anti TNF alpha trough&#xD;
      concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In psoriasis, there is no prospective evaluation of the combination MTX-anti TNF alpha to&#xD;
      help to maintain long-term efficacy for all anti TNF alpha. Long-term maintenance treatment&#xD;
      with the combination of MTX and infliximab was reported in one small retrospective cohort&#xD;
      study of psoriasis patients experiencing a loss of response to infliximab (55). In total 23&#xD;
      patients received as a rescue either azathioprine (5 patients) or weekly MTX (18 patients)&#xD;
      (7.5 to 15 mg, average 11.66 mg) in combination with infliximab. After a mean follow up of&#xD;
      26.5 months, only 2 patients on MTX combination stopped infliximab for loss of response which&#xD;
      is lower compared to the 50% loss of response observed with infliximab monotherapy (55).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of anti TNF alpha and MTX was also retrospectively assessed in observational&#xD;
      studies. Most of them suggest that the systematic combination of MTX to biologic since the&#xD;
      anti TNF alpha initiation improve survival rate of biologics (21, 24, 29, 30, 31). A&#xD;
      retrospective cohort study including 93 patients treated with infliximab for psoriasis showed&#xD;
      that concomitant MTX at an average weekly dose of dose of 7.5 to 17.5 mg of MTX enhanced the&#xD;
      maintenance of response and prolonged drug survival (by a mean ± SD of 19.5 ± 8.1 months, P =&#xD;
      0.034) (23). In addition, time until first infliximab dose escalation was delayed in patients&#xD;
      receiving MTX (by a mean ± SD of 12.0 ± 6.1 months, P =0 .037). In the same study, after 2&#xD;
      years of treatment, 25% of patients without MTX were still under the initial infliximab&#xD;
      regimen versus 40% of patients receiving a combination of infliximab with MTX (30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of MTX to prolong drug survival was also suggested in psoriatic arthritis in&#xD;
      several observational studies (26, 27, 52, 56). In a longitudinal observational study, the&#xD;
      1-year retention rate of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha medications in patients with RA and&#xD;
      PsA were 65.4% and 77.3%, respectively with concomitant MTX associated with a better drug&#xD;
      survival (52). In this study, the combination with MTX was also associated with a crude&#xD;
      1-year survival of 85% in PsA versus 70% without concomitant MTX, p=0.02 (52). In the Danish&#xD;
      biologics registry DANBIO, male sex, CRP level &gt;10 mg/liter, concomitant methotrexate use,&#xD;
      and low patient health visual analog scale score at baseline were associated with longer drug&#xD;
      survival in PsA patients (27).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To summarize, there is a need to improve drug survival as well as level of response rates&#xD;
      with biologics, especially for psoriasis patients. Low doses methotrexate when combining to&#xD;
      biologics could be an option in psoriasis patients to solve such crucial issues.&#xD;
