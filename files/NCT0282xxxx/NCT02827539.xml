  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information comparing LessRay Enhanced fluoroscopy&#xD;
      with the current standard of fluoroscopy. This research is being conducted to demonstrate the&#xD;
      utility and effectiveness of LessRay Enhanced fluoroscopy during surgical placement of a&#xD;
      spinal cord stimulator epidural array.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective, randomized single center study is to assess the ability of&#xD;
      LessRay to decrease overall radiation exposure during surgical placement of a spinal&#xD;
      stimulator. A secondary objective is to analyze the efficacy of utilizing enhanced low&#xD;
      radiation imaging in a fluoroscopically intensive pain procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population group will be 65 patients from Duke University Medical Center and Duke Raleigh&#xD;
      Hospital who meet the medical criteria for the surgical placement of a spinal cord stimulator&#xD;
      epidural array. They will be divided equally into 2 arms: Research and Control and randomized&#xD;
      by a non-surgeon on the study team. That information will be recorded and placed in a sealed&#xD;
      envelope. On the day of surgery the envelope will be delivered to the OR and opened following&#xD;
      &quot;time-out&quot;. At the time the envelope is opened in the OR the patient is acknowledged to be&#xD;
      evaluable for failure or success of LessRay during the surgical procedure if they are in the&#xD;
      research arm. The control arm cohort will proceed with the surgery as typical without&#xD;
      LessRay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from the two groups (Research vs. Control) will be analyzed using a two tailed&#xD;
      t-test with p&lt;.05. The risks associated specifically with the implementation of this study&#xD;
      are with respect to loss of confidentiality. Every effort will be made to keep the&#xD;
      information confidential&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female adults of any ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 18 years-old but without an upper age limit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is willing to provide informed, written consent to participate in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject meets the medical criteria for surgical placement of a spinal cord stimulator&#xD;
             epidural array (e.g. not pregnant)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Less than 18 years of age. For both physicians involved in the study, standard of care&#xD;
             Spinal Cord Stimulator placement is not done for those patients under 18 years of age&#xD;
             as the literature does not show that the procedure helps in back pain of this cohort&#xD;
             of patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to provide informed, written consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women as pregnancy makes them ineligible to undergo a surgical placement of a&#xD;
             spinal cord stimulator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior placement of a spinal cord stimulator epidural array or previous thoracic spine&#xD;
             surgery, which could potentially make placement more difficult&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enrollment in another study, which would prohibit participation in this study&#xD;
