  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A device has been developed that has eye trackers integrated within the Head Mounted Display&#xD;
      (HMD) and can remap text and images around the scotoma in real time to prevent information&#xD;
      loss from a central scotoma. It can also carry out other types of image processing such as&#xD;
      contrast enhancement and image magnification. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy&#xD;
      of this device on the visual performance of participants suffering from central vision loss,&#xD;
      with and without remapping&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with bilateral central scotomas will be selected for this study during their&#xD;
      routine clinical visits at the University of Minnesota Eye Clinic. Written consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will have their scotomas mapped using a Nidek MP-1 microperimeter housed in&#xD;
      the psychology department to give exact size and shape information. This allows for the&#xD;
      extent of each eye's scotoma to be put into the remapping software, and their intersection&#xD;
      used in remapping calculation. Comparisons will be made between participants with small&#xD;
      scotoma, less than 5 degrees, and participants with large scotoma, larger than 5 degrees.&#xD;
      Experiments to be performed with the device are also divided into two categories. Category 1&#xD;
      involves reading of naturalistic text, and everyday task performance. Category 2 involves&#xD;
      studying the effects of practice with the device on performance in category 1 experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will schedule an initial one-hour session for testing. During testing,&#xD;
      participants will be told about the device and its functionality. Main instructions include&#xD;
      what patients can expect to experience and see when wearing the HMD. Following this, the&#xD;
      participants will be instructed on how to wear the HMD. If they have any glasses/ corrective&#xD;
      lenses, they can be kept on. Once the patients don the HMD, testing will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, a calibration-free mode will be tested. This will entail asking the subject to&#xD;
      focus on a particular point on the screen and checking if the gaze point determined by the&#xD;
      eye tracker corresponds to this point. If good calibration is obtained, the investigators&#xD;
      proceed with testing. Otherwise, a 3-point calibration sequence will be initiated following&#xD;
      instructions on the software program. For the 3-point calibration sequence, the participant&#xD;
      will be instructed to fixate at 3-5 different points on the screen one at a time. Following&#xD;
      this calibration sequence, testing will resume and visual performance such as reading speed&#xD;
      in words/minute will be measured as the primary outcome measure, with and without remapping.&#xD;
