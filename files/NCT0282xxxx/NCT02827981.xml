  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Active discopathies or MODIC 1, are a diagnostic entity discovery with the contribution of&#xD;
      MRI in which the first cases were described by Dr. Michael MODIC in 1988. It is characterized&#xD;
      by a vertebral bone edema secondary to active discarthrose. Its prevalence is estimated at 6%&#xD;
      of the general population and up to 40% of the CLBP according to studies. Following the&#xD;
      discovery of this recent diagnostic entity, responsible for low back pain, the question of&#xD;
      its management is debate in the medical community. Early studies demonstrate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of corticosteroid injections in intra-disc. Other works, most recent, suggest&#xD;
      the contrary, infectious, incriminating a pathogenic role of certain bacteria such as&#xD;
      Propionibacterium acness or Corynebacterium propinquum recommending, in contrast, treatment&#xD;
      with prolonged antibiotic therapy. This study will aim to assess the effectiveness of&#xD;
      intra-disc infiltration GHPSJ carried out between 2007 and 2014. The innovation of our work&#xD;
      will be to assess these infiltrations in various subgroups such as patients with a previous&#xD;
      surgery of the spine or a history of scoliosis or spondylolisthesis.&#xD;

      1. Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Evaluate the effectiveness of intra-disc infiltrations conducted in the rheumatology&#xD;
           department of pain in the active disc disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluate the duration of the benefit on pain caused by gesture&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assess the impact of the gesture on NSAIDs and / or analgesics&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Analysis of different subgroups (antecedent of surgery, spondylolisthesis,&#xD;
                scoliosis) Inclusion / non-inclusion: Patients older than 18 who were hospitalized&#xD;
                between 2007 and 2014 in the Rheumatology Department for intradiscal infiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: A retrospective, single-center, non-interventional Study duration: 6 months&#xD;
      Acquisition of data: demographic data, data on the disc disease, data on the assessment of&#xD;
      pain, the effectiveness of infiltration of analgesics and / or NSAIDs, or need infiltration&#xD;
      surgery for the gesture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supports: patient questionnaire report hospital, medical, Excel grid of data collection),&#xD;
      analysis (statistic: local management) Anonymised data in the Excel spreadsheet Development&#xD;
      of the study: Data collection, statistical analysis, literature review Retrospective study&#xD;
      based on recovering data regarding efficacy of infiltrative gesture that some patient was&#xD;
      performed in 2007, with possibility of bias on the recovery of data in view of the age of the&#xD;
      gesture for some patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An analysis of each folder from the hospital report will be carried out in parallel in order&#xD;
      to compare the data collected by the questionnaire with the reporting. The sending of&#xD;
      questionnaires and letters will be performed by the service attaches where a pre-stamped&#xD;
      letter. The address of the patients will be that recorded in the base DxCare.&#xD;
