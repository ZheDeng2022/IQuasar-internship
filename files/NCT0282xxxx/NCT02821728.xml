    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether a broccoli intervention (≥ 4 weeks) will result in differences&#xD;
      in tissue sulphate levels in men scheduled for prostate biopsies. Comparisons will be made&#xD;
      between participants randomised to the broccoli-rich diet and those randomised to the&#xD;
      non-intervention arm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies provide evidence for a negative correlation between prostate cancer&#xD;
      and intake of cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli. Preliminary data from ongoing&#xD;
      intervention trials carried out at the IFR suggest that dietary changes can directly&#xD;
      influence the metabolic profile of prostate tissue. The most significant result observed to&#xD;
      date is that of sulphate accumulation within the prostate. The additional sulphate is likely&#xD;
      to drive synthesis of 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate, a universal sulphate donor, a&#xD;
      process which would consume energy from ATP. A significant rise in levels of both ADP and&#xD;
      phosphate has also been observed in prostate tissue from these studies, supporting the&#xD;
      potential depletion of cellular ATP. Interestingly, the data indicate that the extent of ADP&#xD;
      accumulation is negatively correlated with prostate cancer progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators now propose to undertake a two arm parallel un-blinded study to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that a short-term intervention with broccoli soups will lead to the accumulation&#xD;
      of sulphate and ADP in prostate tissue. A potential increase in glutathione metabolites&#xD;
      indicating a change in redox status, and therefore functional status, of specific genes&#xD;
      involved in tumour suppression (PTEN) will also be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators aim to determine whether the accumulation of sulphate and ADP&#xD;
      is specific to the prostate gland through the metabolic analyses of both prostate and&#xD;
      non-prostate tissues.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in this group will consume three portions of broccoli and stilton soup per week for a minimum of four weeks before their scheduled template prostate biopsy. The soup will be made with a specially cultivated broccoli known as Beneforte, which contains an enhanced dose of a substance called glucoraphanin.</description>
