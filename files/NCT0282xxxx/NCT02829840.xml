    <textblock>
      The goal of Part 1 of this clinical research study is to learn if ponatinib alone can help to&#xD;
      control FLT3-mutated AML or FLT3-mutated high-risk MDS. The safety of this drug will also be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of Part 2 of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of&#xD;
      ponatinib in combination with 5-azacytidine and to learn if the highest dose level found can&#xD;
      help to control FLT3-mutated AML or FLT3-mutated high-risk MDS. The safety of this&#xD;
      combination will also be studied.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be assigned to&#xD;
      either Part 1 or Part 2 based on when they join this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is enrolled in Part 1, they will receive ponatinib alone for the first cycle.&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is needed, the dose level may be increased. If the disease does not&#xD;
      respond to ponatinib alone, participant will continue on to Part 2 of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of this clinical research study will have 2 phases: Phase 1 (dose escalation) and&#xD;
      Phase 2 (dose expansion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, participant will be assigned to a study group based on when they join this study.&#xD;
      Up to 3 groups of 30 participants will be enrolled in Phase 1 of Part 2, and up to 60&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled in Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is enrolled in Phase 1, the dose of ponatinib they receive will depend on when&#xD;
      they join this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of&#xD;
      ponatinib. Each new group will receive a higher dose of ponatinib than the group before it,&#xD;
      if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose&#xD;
      of ponatinib is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is enrolled in Phase 2, they will receive ponatinib at the highest dose that&#xD;
      was tolerated in Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in Part 2 will receive the same dose level of 5-azacytidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will take ponatinib tablets by mouth 1 time every day while they are on study.&#xD;
      Participant should swallow the tablets whole. Participant should not crush them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is enrolled in Part 2, they will receive 5-azacytidine either by vein over&#xD;
      about 1 hour or as an injection under the skin on Days 1-7 of each study cycle or on Days&#xD;
      1-5, 8, and 9 of each study cycle (if the clinic is closed on a weekend).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is needed, the dose level, dosing schedule, or study cycle may be&#xD;
      changed and/or delayed. The study doctor will discuss any changes with participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of each cycle (+/- 4 days), participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 (+/-1 day) of Cycles 1-3 and then every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 6, 9, 12, and so&#xD;
      on), participant will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 2 and then every 3 cycles after that, participant will have an ECHO or MUGA&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time each week during Cycles 1-3 and then 1 time every 2-4 weeks after that, blood&#xD;
      (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. Participant may be able to have these&#xD;
      blood draws performed at a local lab or clinic that is closer to their home. The results of&#xD;
      the testing will be sent to MD Anderson for review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 28 (+/- 7 days) of Cycles 1, 3, and then every 1-3 cycles after that, participant will&#xD;
      have a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time every 3 cycles, if participant can become pregnant, blood (about 1-2&#xD;
      tablespoons) will be drawn for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At any time while participant is on study, if the doctor thinks it is needed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant may have a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will receive ponatinib alone or ponatinib and 5-azacytidine for as long as the&#xD;
      doctor thinks it is in their best interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the&#xD;
      study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are&#xD;
      unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 14 days after participant's last dose of study drug(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy&#xD;
           to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 days after the end-of-study visit, a member of the study staff will call participant&#xD;
      to ask if they have had any side effects and/or started any new treatment(s). This call&#xD;
      should last about 5 minutes. If the study staff thinks it is needed, participant may also be&#xD;
      asked to come into the clinic for a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease appears to be responding to the study drugs, a member of the study staff will&#xD;
      call participant every 3-6 months for up to 5 years to ask how they are doing and about any&#xD;
      side effects they may be having. Each call should last about 5 minutes. Participant may also&#xD;
      be asked to come into the clinic for a physical exam, if the study staff thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. 5-azacytidine is FDA approved and commercially available&#xD;
      for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Ponatinib is commercially available and&#xD;
      FDA approved for the treatment of specific groups of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)&#xD;
      participants. Their use in this study is considered investigational. The study doctor can&#xD;
      explain how the study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 132 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

             inhibitor. (C) Patients with MDS or CMML who received therapy with a hypomethylating&#xD;
             agent and progress to AML are eligible at the time of diagnosis of AML regardless any&#xD;
             prior therapy for AML. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification will be used&#xD;
             for AML. These patients will be assigned to Cohort 1. Patients with MDS, CMML or AML&#xD;
             who have received no prior therapy are eligible if age 65 and greater or if, at the&#xD;
             time of enrollment, are not candidates to receive or refuse standard therapy (Cohort 1&#xD;
             only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients should have a FLT3 mutation, either ITD or kinase domain mutation or&#xD;

             aminotransferase and/or aspartate transaminase &lt; 3.0 x ULN (or &lt; 5.0 x ULN if deemed&#xD;
             to be elevated due to leukemia), and renal function (creatinine 2x ULN or glomerular&#xD;
             filtration rate (GFR) &gt; 50) function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at least 40% by multiple gated acquisition&#xD;
             (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to&#xD;
             time of initiation of ponatinib administration will be at least 2 weeks for cytotoxic&#xD;
             agents OR at least 5 half-lives for cytotoxic/non-cytotoxic agents. Use of one dose of&#xD;
             cytarabine (up to 2 g/m2) or hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly proliferative&#xD;
             disease is allowed before the start of study therapy and for the first eight weeks on&#xD;
             study therapy from the day of enrollment, either prior to or concomitantly with&#xD;
             ponatinib administration initially to control the peripheral blast count. Concurrent&#xD;
             therapy for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis or continuation of therapy for&#xD;
             controlled CNS disease is permitted. Controlled CNS leukemia is defined by the absence&#xD;
             of active clinical signs of CNS disease and no evidence of CNS leukemia on the most&#xD;
             recent 2 simultaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women of childbearing potential must practice contraception. Females of childbearing&#xD;

             with female partners who are of childbearing potential: Recommendation is for male and&#xD;
             partner to use at least 2 effective contraceptive methods, as described above, during&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Females must be surgically or biologically sterile or postmenopausal (amenorrheic for&#xD;
             at least 12 months) or if of childbearing potential, must have a negative urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 72 hours or serum pregnancy test within 2 weeks of signing the&#xD;
             Informed Consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception&#xD;
             during the study and until 3 months after the last treatment. Males must be surgically&#xD;
             or biologically sterile or agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the&#xD;
             study until 3 months after the last treatment. Adequate methods of contraception&#xD;
             include: (A) Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
             lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
             symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
             contraception. (B) Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with&#xD;
             or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study&#xD;
             treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the&#xD;
             woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. 11 (Cont'd): (C) Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female&#xD;
             patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for&#xD;
             that patient (D) Combination of any of the two following (a+b or a+c or b+c): (1) Use&#xD;
             of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of&#xD;
             hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example&#xD;
             hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception (B) Placement of an&#xD;
             intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS). (C) Barrier methods of&#xD;
             contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with&#xD;
             spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository In case of use of oral&#xD;
             contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill before taking study&#xD;
             treatment. Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction&#xD;
             with a barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. 11 (Cont'd) Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if&#xD;
             they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate&#xD;
             clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had&#xD;
             surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at&#xD;
             least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
             status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she&#xD;
             considered not of child bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. 1 (Cont'd) not considered candidates for intensive remission induction chemotherapy at&#xD;

             interval (QTc) interval on pre-entry electrocardiogram (&gt; 470 msec) on both the&#xD;
             Fridericia and Bazett's correction. Symptomatic congestive heart failure within 3&#xD;
             months prior to first dose of ponatinib (NYHA class III or IV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension (defined as sustained stage 2 hypertension,&#xD;
             i.e., systolic BP &gt;/=160 mmHg or diastolic BP &gt;/=100 mmHg) with or without medical&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients currently taking drugs that are generally accepted to have a risk of causing&#xD;
             Torsades de Pointes (unless these can be changed to acceptable alternatives).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Taking any medications or herbal supplements that are known to be strong inhibitors of&#xD;
             CYP3A4 within at least 14 days before the first dose of ponatinib.&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of significant bleeding disorder unrelated to cancer, including: • Diagnosed&#xD;

             bleeding disorder within one year (e.g., acquired anti-factor VIII antibodies)&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients with inflammatory or chronic functional bowel disorder, such as Crohn&#xD;
             disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or gastrointestinal graft versus host disease&#xD;
             that in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with absorption of ponatinib or&#xD;
             increase the risk of serious complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Any other medical, psychological, or social condition that may interfere with study&#xD;
             participation or compliance, or compromise patient safety in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Known active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or C virus (HCV) infection; or known to be&#xD;
