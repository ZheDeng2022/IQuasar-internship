  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, a person consumes an average of 48 boxes of medicines per year (ANSM 2012). Among&#xD;
      these substances, some, not prescribed in an indication related to cognitive function,&#xD;
      however, will influence thereon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several drug candidates with potential preventive effects have already been explored with&#xD;
      little success (statins, antihypertensives, NSAIDs, aspirin, steroid hormones). Other studies&#xD;
      have suggested the existence of deleterious cognitive effects of certain substances&#xD;
      (benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, anti-cancer chemotherapy). However, only the effects of a&#xD;
      limited number of drugs were analyzed, and most drugs have not been specific study in&#xD;
      epidemiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of this research theme has often been restricted by the limited size of the cohort&#xD;
      of staff, not allowing the study of sometimes rare drug exposures, and poverty of the&#xD;
      information collected on drug exposures. Thus, most studies focuses on families of molecules&#xD;
      among the most prescribed. In addition, we now know that the pathophysiological process&#xD;
      underlying Alzheimer's disease (representing 2/3 of dementia), actually begins more than 10&#xD;
      years before the diagnosis of dementia. It is therefore essential to have a setback of&#xD;
      several years between drug exposure and diagnosis of dementia to assess their role in the&#xD;
      genesis and evolution of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Generalist Sample Beneficiaries (EGB) is a database containing data of health insurance&#xD;
      and those of medicalization program of information systems (PMSI) for a sample of 550 000&#xD;
      subjects enrolled in the general scheme of the insurance since 2004 and followed for a period&#xD;
      of 20 years.&#xD;
