      This study will assess the efficacy and safety of BL-8040 in combination with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      (Keytruda®) and BL8040/ Pembrolizumab in combination with liposomal irinotecan&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, two-cohort, phase IIa study in subjects with metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be comprised of 2 cohorts,. Each includes approximately 40 subjects with&#xD;
      unresectable metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cohort study consists of two periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monotherapy period: One week, with BL-8040 administered daily on days 1-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combination therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Three-week cycles of a combination of BL-8040 administered three times a week (TIW)&#xD;
      and pembrolizumab administered once every three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: Onivyde®/5-FU/LV every 2 weeks, pembrolizumab once every 3 weeks and BL-8040 twice&#xD;
      a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Subjects with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be enrolled and receive&#xD;
      BL-8040 monotherapy for five days followed by a combination treatment of BL-8040 and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. During the monotherapy period, eligible subjects will receive daily&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) injections of BL-8040 (1.25 mg/kg) on Days 1 - 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From Day 8, subjects will begin a combination period consisting of treatment with SC BL-8040&#xD;
      TIW and pembrolizumab once every three weeks. The combination therapy will continue for up to&#xD;
      35 cycles of pembrolizumab approximately two years), or until progression, clinical&#xD;
      deterioration or Early Termination, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: Subjects with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma that have progressed following&#xD;
      first-line treatment with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy will be enrolled and receive BL-8040&#xD;
      monotherapy for five days followed by a combination treatment of BL-8040, pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      chemotherapy. During the monotherapy period, eligible subjects will receive daily SC&#xD;
      injections of BL-8040 on Days 1 - 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From Day 8, subjects will begin a combination period consisting of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IV Onivyde® followed by IV leucovorin (LV), followed by IV fluorouracil (5-FU), every 2&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab every three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BL-8040 twice a week&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination therapy will continue for up to 35 treatments (approximately two years), or&#xD;
      until progression, clinical deterioration or Early Termination, whichever comes first.&#xD;
