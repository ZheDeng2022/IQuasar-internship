  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, multi-center, study. The study will be conducted in&#xD;
      approximately 12 ophthalmological clinics and practices throughout Greece. It is planned to&#xD;
      collect data on treatment of wet Age related Macular Degeneration (wAMD) from about 120&#xD;
      patients for which the decision to treat with intravitreal aflibercept injections is made at&#xD;
      the discretion of the attending physician, according to his/her medical practice. Visits will&#xD;
      be performed at baseline, aflibercept first injection (if different from enrollment) and at&#xD;
      12 and 24 months. The 12 and 24 month comprise the data collection visits during which any&#xD;
      data generated in the period preceding these visits will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All required information for the purposes of this study will be collected using electronic&#xD;
      Case Record Form (eCRF). The web-based electronic data capture (EDC) application will be&#xD;
      specifically designed for the needs of the study and will adhere to all applicable data&#xD;
      protection regulations and requirements with regard to electronic records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study observation period for each patient enrolled in this study is the time from the&#xD;
      beginning of treatment with intravitreal aflibercept injection up to two years or until&#xD;
      discontinuation of intravitreal aflibercept injection-treatment due to any reason including&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent or patient loss from follow-up.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale and background Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common&#xD;
      degenerative disease of the macula and the most common cause of legal blindness in the&#xD;
      Western world. AMD is a disease of the elderly affecting 10% of individuals aged 65 to 74&#xD;
      years and 30% of those aged 75 to 85 years. Two forms of AMD can be distinguished. The dry&#xD;
      form is more benign accounting for 90% of all AMD cases, but only for 10% of cases of&#xD;
      blindness due to AMD. On the other hand wet AMD affects only 10% of AMD patients. However, it&#xD;
      is more aggressive and rapidly progresses. Wet AMD (wAMD) accounts for 80% of cases of severe&#xD;
      visual impairment and represents the majority of cases of legal blindness. Thus, wet or&#xD;
      neovascular AMD is a disease with a great impact on both visual acuity and patients' quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1% of the population is affected by wAMD between 65-74 years of age, 5% between 75-84&#xD;
      years of age and 13% in people 85+ years. Given that wAMD is a strongly age-dependent disease&#xD;
      its prevalence is expected to significantly increase in western countries (including Greece)&#xD;
      in the near future. Therefore, early diagnosis and proper treatment will be a major public&#xD;
      health concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMD is diagnosed by stereoscopic biomicroscopy and additional examinations of the macula,&#xD;
      such as fluorescein angiography (FA), indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) and optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (OCT). The patient's visual status can be monitored with the Snellen&#xD;
      chart and Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart, the Snellen chart being&#xD;
      most often used in Greece.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wet AMD is caused by choroidal neovascularization (CNV) whereby new abnormal blood vessels&#xD;
      spread beneath the retina. These vessels may rupture and cause retinal damage. In addition,&#xD;
      vascular leakage may cause thickening and oedema of the retina, which is thought to&#xD;
      contribute to vision loss. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth&#xD;
      factor (PlGF) play a pivotal role in this scenario. VEGF-A and PlGF are members of the VEGF&#xD;
      family of angiogenic factors that act as potent mitogenic, chemotactic, and vascular&#xD;
      permeability factors for endothelial cells. VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine&#xD;
      kinases-VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2-which are located on the surface of endothelial cells. PlGF binds&#xD;
      only to VEGFR-1, which is also present on the surface of leukocytes. Excessive activation of&#xD;
      these receptors by VEGF-A can induce pathological neovascularization and excessive vascular&#xD;
      permeability. PlGF can synergize with VEGF-A in these processes, and is also known to promote&#xD;
      leukocyte infiltration and vascular inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment paradigms for wet AMD have changed tremendously since anti-VEGF treatment&#xD;
      (inhibition of all VEGF-A Isoforms) was introduced. As a consequence, most previous therapy&#xD;
      approaches lost significance and are applied in rare cases only. The pan-anti-angiogenesis&#xD;
      treatment with ranibizumab was the first to show significant improvements in visual acuity of&#xD;
      patients suffering from wAMD, thus becoming the first-choice therapy for most patients. The&#xD;
      phase III clinical trials MARINA and ANCHOR have shown that ranibizumab applied every month&#xD;
      is highly effective in improving visual impairment. However, in addition to the small risk of&#xD;
      endophthalmitis associated with intravitreal injections, monthly treatment, which may&#xD;
      continue for a patient's lifetime, is extremely burdensome to patients, their caregivers,&#xD;
      ophthalmologists and the healthcare system. As a consequence, in clinical practice the&#xD;
      monthly treatment regimen of ranibizumab is often altered to less frequent dosing intervals&#xD;
      to reduce the associated treatment burden, although this may result in notably reduced&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from observational studies such as WAVE and AURA, which investigated wAMD patients&#xD;
      treated with Lucentis (ranibizumab) in a real life setting in western countries, suggest that&#xD;
      these patients are not treated according to a continuous treatment pattern and are also&#xD;
      undertreated resulting in suboptimal treatment effects. In the WAVE Study (n=2587) patients&#xD;
      received 4.3 injections during the first treatment year and the visual acuity returned to the&#xD;
      baseline visual acuity at the end of the year. In the AURA study (n=420), German cohort,&#xD;
      patients received 4.3 injections in the first year and only 2.1 injections during the second&#xD;
      year. The visual acuity declined during year 1 to -1.4 letters and further declined to -2.4&#xD;
      letters during year 2 compared to baseline. In the AURA study (n =365), Italian cohort,&#xD;
      patients received 3.9 injections in the first year and only 1.4 injections during the second&#xD;
      year. The visual acuity declined during year 1 to 0 letters and further declined to -2.9&#xD;
      letters during year 2 compared to baseline .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravitreal aflibercept is the next generation of anti-angiogenesis treatments which also&#xD;
      introduces a new proactive every-other-month treatment regimen (after 3 monthly injections)&#xD;
      in the first year, followed by individually extended treatment intervals afterwards.&#xD;
      Aflibercept is a fusion protein consisting of portions of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2&#xD;
      extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1. It is purified and formulated as&#xD;
      a solution for intravitreal use. As such, aflibercept acts as a soluble decoy receptor that&#xD;
      binds VEGF-A and PlGF with higher affinity than naturally occurring VEGF receptors. Thus&#xD;
      aflibercept competitively inhibits VEGF-A and PIGF binding to the cognate VEGF receptors and&#xD;
      their activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravitreal aflibercept was recently approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in&#xD;
      November 2012. The aims of this study are to collect data on the effectiveness of&#xD;
      intravitreal aflibercept and to evaluate follow-up as well as treatment patterns in treatment&#xD;
      naive patients with wAMD in routine clinical practice in Greece treated with intravitreal&#xD;
      aflibercept injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions and objectives The main objectives of this observational study are to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of intravitreal aflibercept injection and to describe routine&#xD;
      clinical practice monitoring and treatment patterns in treatment-naïve wAMD patients in&#xD;
      Greece.&#xD;

           change in visual acuity with glasses from baseline to the 24-month timepoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the change in central retinal thickness at 12 and 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the proportion of patients with no fluid at 12 and 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the disease activity monitoring patterns and the treatment patterns used in&#xD;
           routine clinical practice (e.g. number of evaluation visits, injection visits, combined&#xD;
           visits, OCT tests, visual acuity tests, fundoscopy tests, Fluorescein Angiography (FA)&#xD;
           and Indocyanine Green Angiograpy (ICGA tests).&#xD;
