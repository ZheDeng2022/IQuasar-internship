      This is a single center, prospective study to calculate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFp)&#xD;
      using a non-invasive device and assess its role in the development of optic neuropathy due to&#xD;
      glaucoma or idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The study also aims to assess whether&#xD;
      CSFp differs between untreated and treated patients with glaucoma, ocular hypertension, IIH,&#xD;
      and other ocular diseases that may be associated with CSFp differences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pathophysiology of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) remains unclear, with potentially a&#xD;
      multifactorial etiology. Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only known modifiable risk factor,&#xD;
      yet two clinical conundrums remain - patients with elevated IOP who do not develop glaucoma&#xD;
      (ocular hypertension, OHTN) as well as patients with IOP &lt;21 mmHg who still develop glaucoma&#xD;
      (normal tension glaucoma, NTG). The etiology of these two scenarios remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFp) in glaucomatous optic neuropathy was&#xD;
      initially raised 30-40 years ago. This concept has garnered more interest recently due to new&#xD;
      findings in this area. Patients who underwent lumbar puncture (LP) and had POAG were found to&#xD;
      have lower CSFp compared to controls in a chart review. Further studies demonstrated a&#xD;
      positive correlation between optic nerve damage and the translaminar pressure gradient (TPG),&#xD;
      calculated as the CSFp subtracted from the IOP. In 2010, a Chinese group suggested that&#xD;
      normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) patients have significantly lower CSFp compared to POAG, and&#xD;
      that TPG is greater in NTG and POAG patients compared to controls. The same group also showed&#xD;
      that OHTN patients have higher CSFp than POAG patients, suggesting a protective effect of&#xD;
      high CSFp when IOP is elevated. Thus, a role for CSFp in the pathophysiology of glaucoma may&#xD;
      exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One can consider IIH as a model for these forms of glaucoma; CSFp is elevated in IIH, as&#xD;
      measured by lumbar puncture (LP). Visual field loss in this disease follows an arcuate&#xD;
      pattern, similar to glaucomatous loss. This would seem to suggest that glaucomatous optic&#xD;
      neuropathy and IIH optic neuropathy share similar mechanisms (i.e., increased TPG due to&#xD;
      either elevated IOP or CSFp).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main hindrances to testing these hypotheses further has been the invasive nature&#xD;
      of LP, which involves inserting a large-bore needle into the spinal column. This procedure&#xD;
      has a relatively high risk of complications given its proximity to the spinal cord and the&#xD;
      potential for traumatic nervous system injury if improperly performed. In contrast to this&#xD;
      invasive procedure, a non-invasive computational device was recently developed and CE mark&#xD;
      approved to measure CSFp using a two-depth transcranial Doppler device (TDTCD). The&#xD;
      underlying principle of the device involves the ophthalmic artery. When originating from the&#xD;
      internal carotid artery, the ophthalmic artery is within the subarachnoid space and thus is&#xD;
      mildly compressed by CSFp. After exiting the intracranial space into the orbit, the&#xD;
      ophthalmic artery loses its subarachnoid surrounding, and is no longer affected by CSFp. The&#xD;
      TDTCD applies minimal external pressure to the orbit such that the pressure exerted&#xD;
      externally on the extracranial segment is equivalent to the CSFp exerted on the intracranial&#xD;
      segment (as measured by Doppler signals of both vessels.) The safety of the device has been&#xD;
      demonstrated and verified; it has obtained CE certification in Europe, and is currently&#xD;
      awaiting FDA approval with a &quot;Non-Significant Risk&quot; categorization. Further details regarding&#xD;
      the device can be viewed at www.vittamed.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device has been shown to correlate extremely well with the gold standard of LP. Multiple&#xD;
      clinical trials utilizing this device in noninvasive CSFp monitoring in neurosurgical&#xD;
      patients are underway at various other institutions, including Johns Hopkins University,&#xD;
      NASA, and Baylor College of Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose utilizing TDTCD to non-invasively measure CSFp in glaucoma/OHTN&#xD;
      patients, IIH patients, and controls at various stages in treatment in order to further&#xD;
      delineate the possible role of TPG in the pathophysiology of these conditions. The&#xD;
      investigators believe this non-invasive approach has the potential to alter our current&#xD;
      understanding and management of these disease processes, thereby assisting in the&#xD;
      identification of at-risk patients more accurately, improving patients' quality of life.&#xD;
