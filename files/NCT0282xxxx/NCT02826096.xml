  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to examine the therapeutic effect of a brief version of biofeedback therapy&#xD;
      (developed bu the research team) on panic disorder. It is a randomized controlled design. The&#xD;
      severity of panic symptoms of two groups of panic patients (reveiving biofeedback therapy or&#xD;
      not) were measured before and after the six week duration. Besides, the severity of anxiety,&#xD;
      depressive, somatic symptoms, and physiological indexes were recorded.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is trying to find out whether our newly developed brief version of&#xD;
      biofeedback is an effective treatment approach for panic disorder. At the same time, the&#xD;
      investigators want to clarify the change of bio- and psycho- indices present through the&#xD;
      process. Patient recently experienced panic attacks are recruited in this study. The&#xD;
      diagnosis of &quot;Panic Disorder&quot; is made by psychiatrists according to The Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM-5) criteria. Subjects are randomly assigned to&#xD;
      medication group or biofeedback therapy. The biofeedback therapy is conducted by&#xD;
      psychologists following the structure way. Every subject will be measured both the bio and&#xD;
      psycho indices on week 0, 3, and 6 under 6-week observation. In the end of the study, the&#xD;
      investigators hope to analyze and clarify the treatment effects of our design, and also to&#xD;
      exam the meanings of these indices, in order to find out an effective treatment approach.&#xD;
