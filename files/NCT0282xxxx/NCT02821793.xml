  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of study is to describe the priorities of elderly patients (70 years and&#xD;
      over) undergoing a first medical treatment for cancer, at initiation of treatment and after 3&#xD;
      months of treatment. The main criterion is a prioritization of 4 items per patient from a&#xD;
      list of 8 expectations regarding the objectives of their treatment: treatment efficacy, life&#xD;
      expectancy, autonomy, daily activities, social activities, heaviness of treatment, toxicity,&#xD;
      economics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the primary endpoint assessment, this self-administered patient questionnaire will used&#xD;
      an opinion scale (Not at all, A little, Moderately, Enough, Many) to explore the eight&#xD;
      domains. Next to the completion of the expectations questionnaire, patients will have to&#xD;
      order 4 of the different 8 items that they prioritized in regard of the first line treatment&#xD;
      that has just been prescribed by their physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint will focus on those 8 proposed expectations of patients at different&#xD;
      periods of time since treatment initiation. Patients' priorities will be compared to&#xD;
      physician's priorities (using the same prioritization grid) before medical treatment and&#xD;
      after 3 months of treatment and to younger patients' priorities (18-69 years). Associations&#xD;
      between elderly patients' characteristics (social, medical…) and their priorities will be&#xD;
      search.&#xD;
