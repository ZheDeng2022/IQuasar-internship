      1. Analyze the influence of vitamin D supplementation in obese children during weight-loss&#xD;
           program on BMI, body composition and bone mineral density.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analyze the influence of vitamin D supplementation on the risk profile of&#xD;
           obesity-related complications, namely impaired tolerance of glucose, insulin resistance,&#xD;
           dyslipidemia and arterial hypertension, in obese children participating in weight-loss&#xD;
           program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analyze the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among obese children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Analyze the risk factors of vitamin D deficiency in obese children (age, gender,&#xD;
           pubertal status).&#xD;

      The study will be conducted as a continuation and development of &quot;6-10-14 for Health&quot;&#xD;
      program. The first phase of the program, financed by the municipality of Gdansk, was&#xD;
      conducted in 2011-2013. The program comprised of screening and survey conducted among all 6-,&#xD;
      10- and 14-year-old children attending primary and grammar schools. A total of 18 162&#xD;
      children (including 7 448 6-year olds, 6 720 10-year olds and 3 994 14-year olds) were&#xD;
      examined. A group of children with risk factors of civilization-related diseases (overweight&#xD;
      and obesity defined according to BMI percentile charts. was identified on the basis of the&#xD;
      screening. This group included 2 798 (16.32%) children, among them 9.17% of 6-years of age,&#xD;
      19.30% of 10-years and 20.48% of 14-years). All these children were qualified to intervention&#xD;
      and education program. A total of 1 627 children qualified on the basis of screening&#xD;
      eventually took part in the first edition of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 4 meetings with participating children and their caregivers were scheduled during&#xD;
      the 12-month-long education and intervention program: at enrollment, and 3, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      thereafter. The meetings had form of individual consultations with various specialists. The&#xD;
      first visit included complex medical examination, discussion on a health status of a child,&#xD;
      interpretation of laboratory findings, and consultations with dietician, psychologist and&#xD;
      physical education specialist. After consulting all the specialists involved in the program,&#xD;
      individual protocol of health intervention was developed for every child. The objectives of&#xD;
      the intervention included modification of diet, increasing health activity level and&#xD;
      strengthening of health-seeking behaviors of child's family members. Adherence to the&#xD;
      protocol and achieved results were evaluated during follow-up meetings with the specialists,&#xD;
      and constituted the basis for development of individualized intervention plans for subsequent&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preliminary evaluation of the program effects was conducted in the group of 300&#xD;
      participants. The average percentile of BMI at enrollment to the program and after 12 months&#xD;
      of participation amounted to 92.96 and 88.83, respectively. Participation in the program was&#xD;
      reflected by a significant decrease in BMI percentile (p=0.0001), as well as by a significant&#xD;
      drop off in fat mass content measured by bioelectrical impedance, from 39.0% to 31.4%&#xD;
      (p=0.0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of these findings, the municipality of Gdansk decided to support the program for&#xD;
      2014-2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment will follow a pattern of double blind randomized study. The enrolled subjects&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 - weight-loss program for 52 weeks + vitamin D 1200 (IU) daily for 26 weeks Group 2 -&#xD;
      weight-loss program for 52 weeks +placebo daily for 26 weeks&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  consultation of dietician, psychologist and specialist of physical activity, and&#xD;

&#xD;
      Within a week prior to Visit III - obtaining blood (ca. 5 ml) for laboratory testing&#xD;
      (complete blood count, lipid profile, hs-C-reactive protein, oral glucose tolerance test,&#xD;
      insulin, Interleukin 6, adiponectin and chemerin concentrations&#xD;

        -  termination of active compound/placebo administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit IV: after 52 weeks:&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  anthropometric evaluation and analysis of body composition (bioimpedance method)&#xD;
