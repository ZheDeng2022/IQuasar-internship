    <textblock>
      Patients with severe respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD) or obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) can benefit from having non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation (NIV). Non-invasive ventilation consists of a machine (ventilator) that is&#xD;
      blowing air through a mask. NIV provides patients with a bigger expansion of their lung when&#xD;
      they are breathing. This better expansion helps patients to have more oxygen and less waste&#xD;
      gas (or carbon dioxide) in their body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These improvements enhance survival and quality of life. In order to provide appropriate&#xD;
      ventilation for each patient, the ventilator can generate different types of blowing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) which delivers a constant pressure to the&#xD;
           mask&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pressure support ventilation (PSV) which delivers a constant pressure to the mask and,&#xD;
           on top of that, delivers more pressure when the patient begins to breathe in.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pressure control ventilation (PCV), which is similar to PSV, but use a fixed time to&#xD;
           generate the flow when the patient begins to breathe in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These different types of blowing have consequences on patient comfort as well as on the&#xD;
      improvement of their ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the improvement of the ventilation, the investigators currently use blood tests,&#xD;
      however, these reflect overall output and may miss more subtle changes in breathing that&#xD;
      could affect how patients feel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a new technology that involves wearing a belt of&#xD;
      sensors around the chest that provides information on how well the lungs are being filled&#xD;
      with air by the ventilator. It allows a non-invasive assessment of the effect of NIV onto&#xD;
      lung ventilation in real-time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to use the EIT technology to assess in real-time patients lung&#xD;
      ventilation when they are using the NIV. The investigators hope that EIT will provide them&#xD;
      with information on which type of blowing is more effective and more comfortable than the&#xD;
      others.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic lung disease can sometimes progress to the extent that patients can no longer clear&#xD;
      the waste gas from their blood. Treatment can be offered with a mask and machine (ventilator)&#xD;
      that helps people breathe and aims to improve their lung condition. It is common for people's&#xD;
      lungs to be affected variably, i.e. left more than right or top of lung more than bases of&#xD;
      lungs. The way in which the ventilator is set may affect how well the machine deals with&#xD;
      these differences. If the lung is better ventilator patients may find the machine more&#xD;
      comfortable and it may be more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a new technology that involves wearing a belt of&#xD;
      sensors around the chest that provides information on how well the lungs are being filled&#xD;
      with air by the ventilator. It allows the assessment of these differences, which previously&#xD;
      required the use of invasive equipment to obtain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimising ventilator settings in the administration of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) can be&#xD;
      improved with the addition of individual physiological data. This approach is limited due to&#xD;
      the invasive techniques required to obtain this information, often leading to less ideal NIV&#xD;
      settings promoting patient-ventilator asynchrony. It has been recently demonstrated by our&#xD;
      group that all patients established on domiciliary NIV have a degree of patient-ventilator&#xD;
      asynchrony and that the commonest type of asynchrony are triggering issues. Triggering&#xD;
      asynchrony is promoted by mismatch between a patient's intrinsic positive end-expiratory&#xD;
      pressure (iPEEP) and applied expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) with these&#xD;
      ineffective efforts contributing to an increased work of breathing and patient discomfort.&#xD;
      Previous strategies used to optimise patient triggering have involved the placement of&#xD;
      oesophageal catheters in order to measure neural respiratory drive (NRD) to the diaphragm by&#xD;
      electromyography (EMG) but again this process is invasive and often poorly tolerated.&#xD;
      Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, bedside monitoring technique that&#xD;
      provides semi-continuous, real-time information about the regional distribution of the&#xD;
      changes in electrical resistivity of the lung tissue due to variations in ventilation in&#xD;
      relation to a reference state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information is gained by repeatedly injecting small alternating electric currents (usually 5&#xD;
      mA) at high frequency of 50 - 80 kHz through a system of skin electrodes (usually 16) applied&#xD;
      circumferentially around the thorax in a single plane between the 4th and 6th intercostal&#xD;
      space. While an adjacent pair of electrodes 'injects' the current ('adjacent drive&#xD;
      configuration'), all the remaining adjacent passive electrode pairs measure the differences&#xD;
      in electric potential. A resistivity (impedance) image is reconstructed from this data by a&#xD;
      mathematical algorithm using a two dimensional model and a simplified shape to represent the&#xD;
      thoracic cross-section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resulting image possesses a high temporal and functional resolution making it possible to&#xD;
      monitor dynamic physiological phenomena (e.g. delay in regional inflation or recruitment) on&#xD;
      a breath by breath basis. It is important to realize that the EIT images are based on image&#xD;
      reconstruction techniques that require at least one measurement on a well-defined reference&#xD;
      state. All quantitative data are related to this reference and can only indirectly quantify&#xD;
      (relative) changes in local lung impedance (but not absolute).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EIT can be used in mechanically ventilated patients to assess recruitment and to optimise&#xD;
      ventilator settings to reduce risk of iatrogenic ventilator associated lung injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, EIT has only been validated in patient invasively ventilated or during&#xD;
      self-ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to use the EIT technology to assess patients breathing using different&#xD;
      ventilator modes in order to see if one is more effective and or more comfortable than the&#xD;
      others. The investigators can use this information to help them set ventilators for future&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
