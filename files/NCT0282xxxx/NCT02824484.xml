      This study aims to investigate the efficacy of Guided Written Disclosure Protocol (GWDP) in&#xD;
      promoting post-traumatic growth through a process of meaning reconstruction in cancer&#xD;
      patients at the end of chemotherapy. Also, the intervention (GWDP) intends to reduce distress&#xD;
      symptoms (i.e. intrusive thoughts, avoidance, depression and anxiety).&#xD;

      Study aims The primary aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of the Guided Written&#xD;
      Disclosure Protocol in promoting post-traumatic growth in stage I-III breast and colon cancer&#xD;
      patients at the end of their adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims of the study include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluating the efficacy of the GWDP in terms of intrusive thoughts and avoidance&#xD;
           reduction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessing the efficacy of the GWDP in terms of reduction of depression and anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigating the relationship between constructed meaning and post-traumatic growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design The study is a randomized controlled trial. Eligible patients who give&#xD;
      their consent to participate in the study will be randomized to receive the GWDP intervention&#xD;
      (experimental group) or a control intervention (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Participants will be recruited in the Oncological Day Hospitals (DH) of the&#xD;
      Scientific Research and Care Institute (IRCCS) Santa Maria Nuova Hospital of Reggio Emilia -&#xD;
      Oncology Unit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria will be assessed by reviewing the patients' medical record and verified&#xD;
      at the time of recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Eligible patients, who agree to participate in the study, will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the GWDP condition or to the control condition with an allocation ratio 1:1,&#xD;
      stratified by the oncological DH. Randomization is carried out through a central phone&#xD;
      randomization center using computer generated random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the registration of the patient basic information, the trial center will attribute a&#xD;
      unique code to the included patient, and communicate to the professional the allocated&#xD;
      condition. This code will be reported in all the forms related to each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions The experimental intervention (GWDP) consists of three 20-minutes writing&#xD;
      sessions in which instructions are provided to patients that have experienced the traumatic&#xD;
      event of cancer diagnosis and therapies. Initially, participants are invited to recall&#xD;
      chronologically the facts concerning the traumatic event, and then to label the emotions&#xD;
      related to those facts, appraise immediate changes in priorities, reflect on their current&#xD;
      feelings, and on coping mechanisms they have learned. Moreover, they are asked to reflect on&#xD;
      how the experience of cancer has changed their view about life and themselves, teaching them&#xD;
      to cope with other difficulties that may arise in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Below, investigators report a synthesis of the tasks concerning each of the three writing&#xD;
      sessions. Participants are asked to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. describe memories concerning cancer illness in a chronological order, with an objective&#xD;
           and detached attitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. describe: (a) thoughts and emotions perceived during the illness experience; (b) the&#xD;
           impact of illness on their daily lives, and how it has changed their attitudes toward&#xD;
           life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. focus on their actual situation, think about the entire illness experience, and report&#xD;
           on the following aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  their present thoughts and feelings, and how those differ from the ones felt during&#xD;
                the illness experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  to what extent they have come to terms with, understand and appreciate themselves&#xD;
                to have dealt successfully with the illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  what they have learned from illness in terms of personal insights, knowledge and&#xD;
                skills, and how these resources could be useful in their future.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  how they will cope with other similar events in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are asked to find a quiet place and time in their home to write without being&#xD;
      disturbed. The first writing session will be performed by two weeks from the initial&#xD;
      assessment (T0), and the following two sessions once every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Original instructions were translated into Italian, and adapted to the specific traumatic&#xD;
      experience of cancer diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control condition consists of three 20-minutes writing sessions in which participants are&#xD;
      requested to write about events of their daily routine happened during the past week; they&#xD;
      are also asked to focus on facts, with an objective and detached attitude. An active control&#xD;
      intervention is used to account for both general (i.e., due to a written general description)&#xD;
      and specific effects (i.e., due to a written emotional expression, together with a cognitive&#xD;
      reframing) of the writing task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for the experimental group, participants are asked to find a quiet place and time to write&#xD;
      without being disturbed. It was used the same time interval between sessions as for the GWDP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One day before each writing session, patients in both conditions will be contacted on the&#xD;
      telephone by the researcher, who will check their understanding of instructions included in&#xD;
      the booklet, and remind them to perform the writing task. Failure to contact the patient will&#xD;
      be recorded in the patient form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures of recruitment and assessment Recruitment and baseline assessment (T0). One or&#xD;
      more health care professionals (oncologists, nurses or psychologists) will participate as&#xD;
      recruiters and evaluators. They will be trained by the Steering Committee about study aims&#xD;
      and procedures, and provided with study materials. The preferred method of recruitment&#xD;
      involves the oncologist in informing eligible patients, who attend DH for their medical&#xD;
      consultation. In case of impediments to recruitment (e.g., oncologists' lack of motivation&#xD;
      for involvement in the study, medical consultation scheduled beyond eight months after the&#xD;
      end of chemotherapy, patients' unavailability at the time of medical appointment), a letter&#xD;
      will be sent to eligible patients presenting general information about the study. Three to&#xD;
      seven days later, a member of the study staff will call the patient by phone to give further&#xD;
      information, and to verify his/her availability to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients interested in the intervention will meet a health care professional, who will&#xD;
      explain both the study aims and the writing tasks, providing them with the information sheet,&#xD;
      and collecting socio-demographic data and health information (i.e., age, sex, educational&#xD;
      level, marital status, time since diagnosis, disease site and stage, and treatment received).&#xD;
      Patients, who agree to participate, will give their written consent. The health care&#xD;
      professional will administrate baseline questionnaires, and then will contact the trial&#xD;
      center for randomization. Finally, the booklet concerning the intervention, according to&#xD;
      allocation group, will be provided to the participant. Anonymity will be guaranteed for both&#xD;
      written texts and outcomes assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-intervention and follow- up assessments (T1 and T2). Participants will be re-assessed&#xD;
      for the study outcomes three months after baseline (T1), with a time tolerance of ± 15 days,&#xD;
      whenever is possible during any medical consultation. In this occasion, the booklet&#xD;
      containing the patient's written texts will be returned. Follow-up evaluation (T2) will be&#xD;
      performed six months after the post-intervention assessment (with the same time tolerance of&#xD;
      ± 15 days), whenever is possible during any medical consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses Main hypothesis. Investigators expect that, after the intervention, participants&#xD;
      in the GWDP group will have higher scores on the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory as compared&#xD;
      to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meaning construction is deemed as the mechanism underlying the restructuring of more adaptive&#xD;
      schemas that lead to growth. Therefore, investigators expect that increased levels of PTG&#xD;
      could be moderated by constructed meaning, measured by the Constructed Meaning Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypothesis. Investigators hypothesize that, after the intervention, participants in&#xD;
      the GWDP group will have lower scores on the Impact of Events Scale as compared to the&#xD;
      control group. Investigators also predict that participants in the GWDP group will have lower&#xD;
      scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale as compared with the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size A prospective power analysis revealed that the current study would require 250&#xD;
      participants to achieve 80% power. The predicted effect size (Hedges's g = 0.36) is estimated&#xD;
      according to a recent meta-analysis on the effect of psychological interventions on&#xD;
      post-traumatic growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis A preliminary analysis will be performed to compare, at baseline, the&#xD;
      differences of clinical and demographic data between the two groups (GDWP intervention vs.&#xD;
      control intervention). After that, a 2 X 3 mixed factorial design ANOVA will be performed for&#xD;
      each dependent variable (Post-traumatic growth, and distress measures). The &quot;between&quot; factor&#xD;
      is intervention with two levels (yes/no) and the &quot;within&quot; factor is time with three levels&#xD;
      (T0/T1/T2). Adjusted analysis of variance with sociodemographic and health variables as&#xD;
      covariant will be performed. Finally, the potential moderating role of constructed meaning on&#xD;
      the effect of GWDP will be according to the MacArthur approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical issues The data collection and the intervention will be performed in accordance with&#xD;
      the ethical standards of the local Ethical committee, which have approved the protocol.&#xD;
