  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the addition of ketamine to dexmedetomidine as adjunctive&#xD;
      therapies of severe alcohol withdrawal in medical ICU patients. Specifically, this study will&#xD;
      assess whether the combination of ketamine and dexmedetomidine reduces the doses of&#xD;
      conventional agents used for alcohol withdrawal while maintaining patient comfort and safety&#xD;
      and will explore if the combination alters the expression of catecholamines in the serum over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of ketamine and dexmedetomidine for alcohol withdrawal is pharmacologically&#xD;
      rationale and may provide additive benzodiazepine-sparing effects. All subjects will receive&#xD;
      benzodiazepine therapy as standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this randomized, double-blind pilot study of 20 subjects with severe&#xD;
      alcohol withdrawal are to a) determine if adding ketamine 0.5 mg/kg per hour to&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine 0.6 µg/kg per hour (both agents administered for up to 72 hours) as&#xD;
      adjunctive therapies to a symptom-triggered benzodiazepine protocol reduces the dose&#xD;
      requirements of conventional sedatives while maintaining patient comfort and safety; and to&#xD;
      b) explore whether epinephrine, a marker of autonomic activity, is expressed differently when&#xD;
      ketamine is added to dexmedetomidine as adjunctive therapies.&#xD;

    <measure>Cumulative Lorazepam Dose Over the First 12 Hours of Alcohol Withdrawal</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>As part of routine care, the bedside nurse will record the administration of all sedative agents. The hourly, daily and cumulative doses of agents will be determined by the sum of as needed doses, scheduled intermittent doses, and hourly infusion rates. All conventional therapies will be guided by the institution-specific, symptom-triggered alcohol withdrawal protocol to maintain CIWA scores ≤ 7. Intravenous lorazepam is the preferred benzodiazepine for management of alcohol withdrawal in the medical ICU. Phenobarbital and propofol are infrequently used and they are not included in the protocol. All benzodiazepine and barbiturate doses, whether oral or intravenous, will be converted to lorazepam equivalents using the following conversion: 1 mg lorazepam = 2 mg midazolam = 7.5 mg clorazepate = 15 mg phenobarbital.</description>

&#xD;
          1. Severe alcohol withdrawal defined by a CIWA score ≥ 15 and the need for at least 16 mg&#xD;
             of lorazepam equivalents over a four-hour period. All benzodiazepine and barbiturate&#xD;
             doses, whether oral or intravenous, will contribute to the cumulative amount using the&#xD;
             following conversion: 1 mg lorazepam = 2 mg midazolam = 7.5 mg clorazepate = 15 mg&#xD;
             phenobarbital.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients receiving standard therapy for severe alcohol withdrawal according to the&#xD;
             UCH-specific, symptom-triggered alcohol withdrawal protocol in the ICU (or admission&#xD;
             to the ICU is anticipated). Lorazepam is the preferred benzodiazepine agent for&#xD;
             patients requiring ICU admission due to alcohol withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Informed consent within 36 hours of qualifying for the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Patients &lt; 18 years of age or &gt; 85 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients receiving benzodiazepine therapy for purposes other than alcohol withdrawal&#xD;
             (e.g. sedation, seizure control other than alcohol withdrawal).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with alcohol withdrawal not requiring ICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients receiving epidural administration of medication(s).&#xD;

          9. Patient pending transfer to another facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with known or suspected severe adverse reactions to dexmedetomidine (or&#xD;
             clonidine) or ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Pregnant females or females suspected of being pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
