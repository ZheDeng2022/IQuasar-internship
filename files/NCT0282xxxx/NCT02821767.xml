      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Eye Institute (NEI) wants to evaluate and provide standard treatment to people&#xD;
      with eye diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine and treat people with eye diseases and learn more about eye diseases and how they&#xD;
      are inherited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with eye diseases who can give consent or have a guardian who can consent for them&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with an eye exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1 12 visits per year depending on their eye disease for up to 5 years.&#xD;
      Visits last about 4 hours and could include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and family history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye exam and photography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oculography: They put on contact lenses or goggles. They watch spots on a computer&#xD;
&#xD;
      screen for 20 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrooculography: Small metal disks are placed on the skin next to both eyes. They look&#xD;
      left&#xD;
&#xD;
      and right in the dark and light for about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroretinography: They sit in the dark with their eyes patched. A small metal disk is&#xD;
      taped&#xD;
&#xD;
      to the forehead. After 30 minutes, the patches are removed and contact lenses put in. They&#xD;
&#xD;
      watch flashing lights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluorescein angiography: A needle guides a thin plastic tube into an arm vein. A dye is&#xD;
&#xD;
      injected through the tube and travels up the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures are taken of&#xD;
      the&#xD;
&#xD;
      eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunosuppressive treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye cell sample: Samples are obtained from swabbing, pressing paper on, or taking a small&#xD;
&#xD;
      biopsy sample from the surface of the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin, tear, urine, saliva, stool, or hair sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exam under anesthesia for some children&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit participants could get medications, eye drops, eye injections, laser&#xD;
      treatments, or surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The National Eye Institute (NEI) is conducting a study to evaluate and provide standard&#xD;
      treatment to participants with various diagnosed and undiagnosed ocular conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of this protocol is to provide short term follow-up of&#xD;
      patients, usually in conjunction with a referring physician. In addition, this protocol&#xD;
      allows clinicians at the NEI to maintain their expertise in evaluating and treating various&#xD;
      eye disorders for which there may not be specific research studies. The knowledge gained may&#xD;
      lead to ideas for future clinical research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The number of participants to be enrolled has no logical upper limit, but&#xD;
      will be set to 1,000 patients with ocular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is an observational natural history study of multiple ocular diseases and their&#xD;
      progression and physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: No formal outcomes will be measured; however, the clinical assessments of&#xD;
      enrolled participants can be used to measure the response to standard treatment.&#xD;
