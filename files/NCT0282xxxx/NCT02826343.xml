  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      First, the investigators will image patients with hyperpolarized xenon (Xe) magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) to develop the technique of hyperpolarized xenon MRI at the&#xD;
      University of Virginia (UVA). Magnetic Resonance (MR) sequences will need to be developed and&#xD;
      optimized for the equipment at UVA. These sequences will need to be evaluated in healthy&#xD;
      adults for comparison with results obtained and in adults with lung diseases to optimize the&#xD;
      sequences for the detection and evaluation of lung diseases. The MR pulse sequences need to&#xD;
      be optimized for the parameters of a human MR coil and the gas exchange characteristics in&#xD;
      healthy and diseased lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, the investigators propose to exploit the power of Xe129 MRI as a diagnostic tool to&#xD;
      monitor therapeutic responses of a combination inhaler, Advair, which contains a long-acting&#xD;
      beta-adrenoceptor agonist (LABA) and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) - two major classes of&#xD;
      the current COPD therapeutics. The investigators will characterize the functional changes of&#xD;
      the lungs with COPD at baseline, and investigate the responses of the lungs to the treatment&#xD;
      after a three-month trial. Also the investigators will compare corresponding results obtained&#xD;
      by Xe129 dissolved phase (DP) MRI to the results obtained by gadolinium-based dynamic&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced perfusion MRI (perfusion MRI) and high resolution computed tomography&#xD;
      (HRCT) of the lung to indirectly validate the Xe129 DP MRI technique. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate that the results from this project will greatly improve the investigators&#xD;
      understanding of the lung functional responses of COPD subjects to current therapeutics.&#xD;
      Also, the investigators expect that this project will provide evidence to consider Xe129 MRI&#xD;
      as a diagnostic strategy to assess and monitor therapeutic responses of existing and new&#xD;
      pharmaceuticals, and thus Xe129 MRI will stimulate development of novel therapies for COPD in&#xD;
      the future&#xD;
