      Title of Research Program: Ultrasound Guided Axillary Brachial Plexus Block: Influence of&#xD;
      Obesity on Block Failure Rate, Performance Time and Incidence of Acute Complications- A&#xD;
      prospective observational cohort study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Axillary brachial plexus (ABP) block is commonly performed as the primary&#xD;
      anesthetic technique to provide surgical anesthesia and postoperative analgesia for elbow,&#xD;
      forearm and hand surgery. Compared to general anesthesia, ABP blocks have been shown to&#xD;
      result in better pain relief, less nausea and vomiting, shortened length of hospital stay,&#xD;
      decreased side effects of opioids painkillers and better patient satisfaction. These&#xD;
      beneficial effects of ABP blocks are particularly useful for patients who are overweight or&#xD;
      obese as this cohort is at a higher risk of experiencing complications from general&#xD;
      anesthesia. Traditionally, nerve blocks have been described technically challenging in obese&#xD;
      patients. This may not be true now with availability of high-resolution ultrasonography (US).&#xD;
      US imaging also allows doctors the ability to visualize the needle &quot;live&quot; to allow for more&#xD;
      accurate needle placement. This allows local anesthetic to be placed more precisely resulting&#xD;
      in faster onset anesthesia, decreased local anesthetic drug dosages, reduced complications&#xD;
      and higher success rate. Ultrasound guidance has not been used for performing ABP block in&#xD;
      previous studies in obese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the block failure rate is no worse in obese compared to&#xD;
      non-obese patients when US guidance is used to perform ABP blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether obese&#xD;
      patients receiving US guided ABP block as their primary anesthetic modality have a block&#xD;
      success rate (defined by a Composite Score ≥ 14 at 30 minutes) worse than their non-obese&#xD;
      peers. The secondary objective is to evaluate time parameters around ABP performance,&#xD;
      incidence of complications and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study will be conducted as an observational quasi-experimental multicenter&#xD;
      trial at St. Joseph's Health Care (SJHC), London, ON and the Nova Scotia Health Authority&#xD;
      (NSHA) Halifax Infirmary (HI) site, Halifax NS. There will be 250 patients taking part in&#xD;
      this study. One hundred and fifty patients have already completed the study in Ontario. The&#xD;
      duration of the study at the Halifax Infirmary is 10 months. Healthy patients (aged 18-75&#xD;
      years) scheduled to undergo elbow/ forearm/ or hand surgery will be invited to volunteer in&#xD;
      this observational study. A study investigator or resident under direction supervision of a&#xD;
      study investigator will perform the ABP block. There is NO experimental drug or treatment in&#xD;
      this study. Patient demographics including age, sex, arm circumference, height, weight and&#xD;
      Body Mass Index will be recorded. Nerve blocks will be performed in a designated area near&#xD;
      operating rooms called the block room. US will be used for identification of the nerves&#xD;
      supplying the arm and an ABP block will be performed with a total volume of 30 mL of 0.5%&#xD;
      ropivacaine according to a standardized procedure. Measurements of sensory and motor blockage&#xD;
      will be recorded every 5 minutes for 30 minutes following the ABP block. Block success will&#xD;
      be measured and is defined as a score of ≥ 14 on the Composite Score (CS) within 30 minutes&#xD;
      of ABP block completion. According to routine care, all patients will receive a phone call&#xD;
      from the investigators 24-48 hours after surgery to inquire about complications. The study&#xD;
      follows non-inferiority design to show that the success rate in the obese group is not worse&#xD;
      than the non-obese when anesthetized. In non-inferiority trials, both intention to treat and&#xD;
      per-protocol analysis are recommended; both approaches should support non-inferiority The&#xD;
      student's t-test (unpaired, two tailed) will be used for comparison of the means of&#xD;
      continuous, normally distributed data or Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. Categorical data&#xD;
      (success rate, complication rate) are to be analyzed using χ2 test or Fisher's exact test, as&#xD;
      appropriate. An interim analysis will not be conducted and set at 0.05 for significance and&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance/ Importance: This study would provide anesthesiologists additional information&#xD;
      to inform their clinical decision-making when dealing with obese patients. To date there are&#xD;
      no publications or any registered trials exploring the success rates and technical aspects of&#xD;
      ABP blockade in obese patients using US guidance technology for block performance. Therefore,&#xD;
      this study is novel and timely for the patient groups.&#xD;
