    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing major spinal surgery continue to experience moderate-to-severe pain&#xD;
      during the first 2-3 days following the operative procedure. Several factors contribute to&#xD;
      postoperative pain in this patient population. Many patients present to surgery dependent on&#xD;
      relatively high doses of oral opioids; this daily administration leads to tolerance to the&#xD;
      effects of these drugs as well as hyperalgesia (exposure to opioids makes subsequent pain&#xD;
      worse). In addition, surgical procedures on the spine are very painful. Furthermore, most of&#xD;
      the opioids used after surgery only produce analgesia (pain relief) for 2-4 hours, which&#xD;
      leads to fluctuations in levels of pain control (patients have to push a button to deliver&#xD;
      pain medication when they begin to feel discomfort). Recent data suggest that the use of a&#xD;
      long-acting opioid like methadone in the operating room, which provides analgesia for 24-36&#xD;
      hours, may improve pain control after spinal fusion surgery. However, other pain treatment&#xD;
      modalities are required in this patient population. Studies have demonstrated that ketamine,&#xD;
      a drug that prevents pain by a mechanism different from opioids, is effective in reducing&#xD;
      pain medication requirements when given in the perioperative period. Small-dose infusions not&#xD;
      only provide analgesia, but also prevent opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia. In particular,&#xD;
      the combination of methadone and ketamine may be especially effective in controlling pain in&#xD;
      patients following major operations. The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to examine&#xD;
      the effect of a low-dose perioperative infusion of ketamine, when given with methadone in the&#xD;
      operating room, on postoperative pain medication requirements, pain scores, and clinical&#xD;
      recovery characteristics after spinal fusion surgery.&#xD;

      Methadone is an opioid with the potential to provide prolonged and constant analgesia. It has&#xD;
      a half-life that is significantly longer than other clinically-used opioids (25-52 hours).&#xD;
      This unique property of methadone suggests that a single dose administered in the operating&#xD;
      room can result in extended pain relief following surgery. When given intravenously to&#xD;
      surgical patients, a half-life of 35 hours was observed, resulting in a median duration of&#xD;
      analgesia of 26 hours. In patients undergoing abdominal, orthopedic, or gynecologic surgery,&#xD;
      the use of a single dose of methadone (20 mg or 0.2-0.3 mg/kg) at induction of anesthesia&#xD;
      resulted in reduced analgesic requirements and improved pain scores for the first 24-48&#xD;
      postoperative hours (when compared to patients given traditional intraoperative opioids).&#xD;
      Only one retrospective study has examined the use of intraoperative methadone in adult&#xD;
      patients undergoing spinal instrumentation. In this investigation, methadone use was&#xD;
      associated with a 50% reduction in postoperative opioid requirements, compared to patients&#xD;
      receiving shorter-acting opioids. Despite the use of methadone and postoperative PCA opioids,&#xD;
      however, average pain scores were greater than 3 (on a 0 to 10 scale) in the methadone group.&#xD;
      These findings suggest that methadone alone is insufficient in alleviating pain after major&#xD;
      spine surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large number of clinical trials have examined the use of ketamine in the perioperative&#xD;
      period. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have assessed the benefits and risks of&#xD;
      ketamine in surgical patients. Bell et al. concluded that perioperative ketamine reduced&#xD;
      analgesic requirements or pain intensity, or both. The incidence of nausea and vomiting was&#xD;
      reduced, and adverse events were mild or absent. Himmelseher et al. noted that intravenous&#xD;
      subanesthetic ketamine in general anesthesia provided pain prevention after surgery.&#xD;
      Jouguelet-Lacoste et al. determined that low-dose ketamine reduced opioid consumption by 40%.&#xD;
      Pain scores were also reduced, and no major complications were noted. Laskowski et al.&#xD;
      concluded that ketamine resulted in a reduction in opioid consumption across all studies, and&#xD;
      lower pain score were reported in most investigations. No significant differences in adverse&#xD;
      events were noted in most meta-analyses, with the exception of a lower risk of nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting in patients randomized to receive ketamine (a higher risk of hallucinations was&#xD;
      reported in one meta-analysis). A large number of different dosing strategies have been used&#xD;
      for ketamine. However, the greatest efficacy appears to result when a bolus dose is given&#xD;
      (0.5 mg/kg) before incision, followed by an intraoperative (0.25-0.5 mg/kg/hr) infusion, and&#xD;
      a postoperative (0.06-0.12 mg/kg/hr) infusion continued for at least 24-48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like methadone, ketamine is used most frequently in patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery&#xD;
      due to the high incidence of pre-existing opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia (personal&#xD;
      communication). Ketamine infusions have been investigated in 6 randomized studies in this&#xD;
      patient population. In 5 of the trials, reduced postoperative opioid requirements, decreased&#xD;
      pain scores, or both, were observed in patients randomized to receive ketamine.&#xD;
      Shorter-acting opioids were used with ketamine in 5 of the investigations. Despite data&#xD;
      suggesting a beneficial effect of ketamine in patients undergoing major spine surgery, a&#xD;
      recent &quot;best evidence&quot; review stated that &quot;there is insufficient and /or conflicting evidence&#xD;
      that ketamine provides a significant reduction in postoperative pain or narcotic usage&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      In theory, the use of a combination of a long-acting opioid and ketamine may be particularly&#xD;
      efficacious in optimizing postoperative pain management. Recent evidence has demonstrated&#xD;
      that methadone, like ketamine, has the ability to block NMDA receptors. In a neuropathic&#xD;
      animal model, the combination of methadone and ketamine produced an analgesic synergy of a&#xD;
      supra-additive nature. In the clinical setting, the administration of methadone and ketamine&#xD;
      has only been examined in one small trial (20 patients). Patients randomized to receive&#xD;
      methadone and ketamine required 70% less pain medication than those administered methadone&#xD;
      alone. Although clinicians at NorthShore and other institutions are beginning to use&#xD;
      methadone and ketamine in patients undergoing spinal surgery, there is limited evidence&#xD;
      examining this approach in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this randomized, double-blind study is to examine a perioperative&#xD;
      analgesic strategy utilizing both ketamine and methadone in patients undergoing posterior&#xD;
      spinal fusion. Patients randomized to the ketamine group will be given 0.2 mg/kg of methadone&#xD;
      at anesthetic induction, and a ketamine infusion will be used intraoperatively and for 48&#xD;
      hours after surgery. Patients in the control group will receive 0.2 mg/kg of methadone at&#xD;
      anesthetic induction, and then a D5W (sugar water) infusion intraoperatively and for 48 hours&#xD;
      postoperatively. The total amount of PCA hydromorphone used postoperatively will be recorded,&#xD;
      as well as postoperative pain scores. Recovery variables will be measured and patients will&#xD;
      be assessed for adverse events potentially related to opioids and ketamine. NMDA receptor&#xD;
      stimulation is also thought to play an important role in the development of chronic pain&#xD;
      after surgery. Therefore, patients will be surveyed about chronic postsurgical pain 1, 3, 6,&#xD;
      and 12 months after the operation to determine whether intraoperative management may&#xD;
      influence the development of long-term adverse events.&#xD;
