  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study intends to examine the association between schistosomiasis seropositivity and&#xD;
      adverse pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It aims at the verification of the hypothesis that in pregnant women originating from endemic&#xD;
      areas for schistosomiasis, positive serology is associated with reduced Infant birth weight.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schistosomiasis is a widespread helminthic infection, with an estimated 249 million people in&#xD;
      78 countries requiring preventive treatment each year. This infection has a significant&#xD;
      association with morbidity worldwide. Earlier studies performed in endemic Areas showed that&#xD;
      the reproductive tract was affected in more than 60% of the women who excreted S. haematobium&#xD;
      ova in urine. Transplacental transmission has not been observed, but schistosomiasis of the&#xD;
      pregnant uterus has been reported and placental schistosomiasis has been associated with&#xD;
      stillbirth. Placental schistosomiasis (i.e. detection of schistosomiasis eggs in placental&#xD;
      tissue) has been reported occasionally. Schistosomiasis has been postulated to be associated&#xD;
      with premature delivery and low birth weight; however, existing data are inconsistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Migration to the European Union was estimated at 1.7 million people in 2012. Migrants were&#xD;
      predominantly from Africa and Asia. In these areas schistosomiasis has an estimated&#xD;
      prevalence of 10-20%. While a large number of migrants from schistosomiasis-endemic areas&#xD;
      enter Europe and receive Access to health care, many of them are unaware of helminthic&#xD;
      infections they may have been exposed to, and their potential outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of schistosomiasis during pregnancy is a matter of debate. The German society for&#xD;
      tropical medicine recommends treatment with praziquantel only after the completion of&#xD;
      pregnancy. Conversely, the South African Medicines Formulary suggests that pregnant women&#xD;
      should be offered treatment individually and that they should not necessarily be excluded&#xD;
      during treatment campaigns. By quantifying the effects of Schistosoma infection on pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes this study will help clinicians in deciding on the question of treatment during&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to examine the association of maternal schistosomiasis on adverse&#xD;
      birth outcomes (as defined by low birth weight, premature delivery or stillbirth) in migrants&#xD;
      to Europe from schistosomiasis endemic areas.&#xD;
