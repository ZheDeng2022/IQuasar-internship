  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ability to adhere to complex medical regimens is critical to achieving successful transplant&#xD;
      outcomes, as non-adherent patients suffer graft failure and death following transplantation.&#xD;
      Since potential recipients greatly exceed organ availability, identification of candidates&#xD;
      who will adhere to complex post-transplant regimens is critically important and emphasized by&#xD;
      practice guidelines. When selecting candidates for transplant, physicians try to subjectively&#xD;
      predict post-transplant adherence because, although tools exist to measure current adherence,&#xD;
      tools that reliably predict future adherence are lacking. Despite rigorous medical and&#xD;
      psychosocial screening pretransplant, non-adherence rates are high following transplant.&#xD;
      Therefore, the current approach for predicting future non-adherence is suboptimal,&#xD;
      subjective, and greatly needs strategies for improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-transplant self-management abilities represent a marker of future adherence&#xD;
      post-transplant. Assessing self-management as a means for predicting future adherence has&#xD;
      been largely overlooked. Self-management is defined as &quot;taking responsibility for one's own&#xD;
      behavior and well-being&quot; and consists of three management tasks: medical condition, emotions,&#xD;
      and social roles. Self-management ability can be measured. However, self-management has not&#xD;
      been systematically studied in heart and lung transplant patients. Fostering self-management&#xD;
      abilities may improve post-transplant outcomes by optimizing not only adherence, but also&#xD;
      proven pretransplant risk factors (e.g. frailty and obesity).Self-management abilities may be&#xD;
      improved via behavioral interventions such as health coaching.Self-management represents a&#xD;
      measurable criterion that could be utilized in pre-transplant screening and serve as a point&#xD;
      of intervention for optimizing adherence and pre-transplant risk factors.The overall&#xD;
      objective of the proposed research is to improve the knowledge gap regarding self-management&#xD;
      (and thereby adherence) in transplant by qualitatively and quantitatively studying patient&#xD;
      factors associated with self-management and testing an intervention that may improve&#xD;
      self-management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize: Individualized health coaching including strategies to address&#xD;
      poor resilience, coping with uncertainty, frailty, and/or negative affect will be an&#xD;
      effective therapeutic strategy at improving self-management while in the pre-transplant&#xD;
      state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim: To test whether transplant candidates who receive pre transplant health&#xD;
      coaching have greater improvement in self-management abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a randomized, controlled pilot trial testing the effectiveness&#xD;
      of health coaching versus usual care in a heart and lung transplant cohort on self-management&#xD;
      abilities (SMAS-30).&#xD;

      PROPOSED RESEARCH: Patients will be identified from the Mayo Clinic MN, heart and lung&#xD;
      transplant waiting lists and approached for recruitment in the Transplant Clinic at one of&#xD;
      their routine clinical (every 1 to 3 month) follow-up appointments or by phone or mail.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Aged 18 or older, consenting to research, and listed (active and&#xD;
      temporarily inactive) or deferred for lung or heart transplantation at Mayo Clinic in&#xD;
      Rochester, MN. Exclusion criteria: Patients will be excluded if ineligible for transplant,&#xD;
      non-English speaking, non-verbal or extremely hard of hearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH STRATEGY: This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, pilot study&#xD;
      comparing the effect of a phone-based, health coaching intervention versus usual care on&#xD;
      self-management. Methods: Initial encounter: Consented patients will be randomized using a&#xD;
      random number generator. Intervention patients will be introduced to the intervention, and&#xD;
      schedule the first phone meeting. Both intervention and control patients will undergo&#xD;
      baseline assessments (see &quot;data&quot; below). Subsequent Coaching Intervention patients will be&#xD;
      assigned a coach trained in motivational interviewing who will call the patient weekly for 12&#xD;
      weeks for a 15-30 minute intervention (based on the primary mentor's previous research).&#xD;
      Briefly a health coaching protocol will be utilized to guide training and the delivery of&#xD;
      intervention using open-ended questions, affirmations, reflections, and summaries (O.A.R.S.)&#xD;
      and Elicit-Provide-Elicit (E-P-E) techniques. Coaching sessions will be recorded and&#xD;
      externally monitored by an independent expert to assure treatment fidelity. A coaching&#xD;
      intervention protocol will include collaborative goal setting and confidence rating regarding&#xD;
      the patient's desired behavior change (and assessed risks). The control group will receive&#xD;
      usual care. Both intervention and control patients will complete follow-up questionnaires and&#xD;
      physiologic assessments at 12-16 weeks. Data: Baseline demographic, comorbidities, and&#xD;
      transplant details will be abstracted. Daily physical activity measure by a gold standard&#xD;
      activity monitor (Sensewear Armband, Body media, Pittsburgh,PA) will quantify daily steps, as&#xD;
      well as total and active energy expenditure. Grip Strength: will be measured using a Jamar&#xD;
      Digital Hand Held Dynamometer. Three serial measurements will be taken (using the dominant&#xD;
      hand), averaged, and adjusted by gender and BMI using normative table. Gait Speed:&#xD;
      self-selected walking speed will be timed over a distance of 15 ft (average of 3 adjusted for&#xD;
      gender and height). Body composition scan: will determine fat-free mass (body composition).&#xD;
      Height and weight will be recorded. Questionnaires: RISC-10, PANAS, MUIS, KCCQ, CRQ, FDI,&#xD;
      CES-D, PHQ-2, GAD-2, SMAS-30, and SMAQ will be collected to assess hypothesized predictors of&#xD;
      self-management. The primary outcome of the study is the effect of health coaching on&#xD;
      self-management abilities SMAS-30 (sentinel of post- transplant adherence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS PLAN: Sample size: This is a pilot and feasibility study. However, to inform our&#xD;
      enrollment we have made the following calculations. Change in SMAS-30. A sample size of 25 in&#xD;
      each group will have 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.81 using a two-group t-test with&#xD;
      a 0.05 two-sided significance level, where effect size is the end of study difference in&#xD;
      means between the two groups relative to the SD of the end of study measures, after adjusting&#xD;
      for baseline and other factors. From the literature, we estimate an unadjusted end of study&#xD;
      SD for SMAS-30 of 8.5.50 Whereas we do expect our intervention to impact SMAS-30, it is our&#xD;
      clinical impression that without intervention, patients tend to exhibit similar patterns over&#xD;
      time. Therefore, we expect the between-person variability in SMAS-30 to be at least as large&#xD;
      as the variability in assessing SMAS-30 for the same person at different time points. If&#xD;
      these two sources of variability were the same then they would both have a SD of 6.0, in&#xD;
      particular the end of study SD for SMAS-30 would be 6.0 or less. With this SD, we would have&#xD;
      power to detect a difference of 0.81x6.0=4.9. Thus, this pilot study is reasonably powered.&#xD;
      Allowing for a 20% withdrawal rate (primarily due to transplantation during intervention), we&#xD;
      will aim for a sample size of 30 per arm. Analysis plan: Demographic characteristics will be&#xD;
      summarized by mean, median, SD and range (continuous variables) and counts and percents&#xD;
      (categorical variables). Our primary variable will be end of study SMAS-30 (adjusting for&#xD;
      baseline), which we will analyze using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), estimating between&#xD;
      group differences. Subgroup analysis will be performed by sex, ethnicity, and race as&#xD;
      feasible. A similar procedure to that described above will be employed to impute data if&#xD;
      necessary. Missing data and end of study SDs for SMAS-30, adjusting for baseline, will guide&#xD;
      analysis and power calculations for future R01 studies. Secondary Outcomes will examine&#xD;
      between group differences of changes in gait speed, activity levels, body composition,&#xD;
      weights, and RISC-10, PANAS, MUIS, FDI, SMAQ, and KCCQ or CRQ measures to inform future R01&#xD;
      planning. A two-tailed p&lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Post&#xD;
      intervention focus groups/interviews of 5-7 participants will be conducted by the candidate&#xD;
      to obtain patient feedback to refine the intervention for future R01.&#xD;

    <description>The SMAS-30 is a 30-item patient-reported outcome measurement tool. There are six sub-scales, in sequence: Items 1 to 5: Take initiative, Items 6 to 10: Self-efficacy, Items 11 through 15: Investing, Items 16 to 20: Perspective, Items 21 to 25: Multifunctionality, Items 26 to 30: Variety. The total score of the whole scale is calculated as the average of the totals scores of the 6 sub-scales. The possible range of the total score of the whole SMA scale ranges from 0 (never) to 100 (very often).</description>
