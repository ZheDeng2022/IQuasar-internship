  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electrical stimulation currently has a wide range of clinical applications, being used for&#xD;
      activities such as strengthening, pain control, edema management, or inflammation control&#xD;
      after injury or surgery. One of the classic forms of electrotherapy is the Direct current&#xD;
      (galvanic current), which stands out for its unique effects (polar and interpolar effects)&#xD;
      and that are not achieved with other modalities of electrotherapy. Within these effects those&#xD;
      activators or suppressors of nervous system activity are described. One of the applications&#xD;
      of direct current is to produce sedation or excitation on the nervous system through&#xD;
      longitudinal applications (longitudinal galvanization). This application technique is known&#xD;
      as the upstream or downstream effect of the direct current or &quot;Leduc Effect&quot;, in which it is&#xD;
      postulated that an ascending type longitudinal galvanization has excitation effects of the&#xD;
      central and / or peripheral nervous system. The study will evaluate the influence of the&#xD;
      upward and downward direct current effect when performing a manual dynamometer test while&#xD;
      monitoring by miofeedback in college students.&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. Conceptual definition of the variables;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ascending effect: Excitation effect on the nervous system by a longitudinal direct&#xD;
                current application (Longitudinal Galvanization), in which the anode is placed at&#xD;
                the distal level and the cathode at the cranial level.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Descending effect: Sedative effect on the nervous system by a longitudinal direct&#xD;

                the cranial level and the cathode at the distal level.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Placebo: Phenomenon by which a patient's symptoms can be improved by treatment with&#xD;
                a safe substance, ie a substance with no effects directly related to the treatment&#xD;
                of symptoms or illness (a placebo will be applied in a control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Operational definition of variables;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Maximum Handgrip strength: Maximum Strength in kilograms evaluated through manual&#xD;
                dynamometry test the time for a grip. Force values are recorded in an Excel table&#xD;
                displaying data in kilograms evaluated. (Manual hydraulic dynamometer brand JAMAR®&#xD;
                be used).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Maximum activation threshold: measured in microvolts (μV) by a miofeedback device&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Direct upnstream current (Ascending Effect): it were applied through an electric&#xD;
                direct current quantified in milliamps (mA) in a longitudinal galvanizing technique&#xD;
                with the catode electrode in proximal position. The GYMNA® electrotherapy equipment&#xD;
                model COMBI 500 were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Direct downstream current (Descending effect): it were applied through an electric&#xD;
                direct current quantified in milliamps (mA) in a longitudinal galvanizing technique&#xD;
                with the anode electrode in proximal position. The GYMNA® electrotherapy equipment&#xD;

        5. Place of research;&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be conducted in the laboratory of Physiotherapy Rehabilitation Science&#xD;
           Faculty, building C5, 401 room floor, Campus Casona de la Universidad Andrés Bello, Av.&#xD;
           Fernández Concha 700, Las Condes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Methodology;&#xD;
&#xD;
           This research has the characteristics of an experimental randomized design. The study&#xD;
           will be carried out in the physiotherapy laboratory, room 401, 4th floor, building C5 of&#xD;
           the Andrés Bello University (UNAB), faculty of rehabilitation sciences, Casona Campus,&#xD;
           Las Condes commune, Calle Fernández Concha Nº700, Santiago de Chile.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The sample was selected from the university population that is part of the Faculty of&#xD;
           Rehabilitation Sciences (FCR) of the Andrés Bello University Andrés. The study will be&#xD;
           presented to the ethics committee of the Metropolitan Health Service East (SSMO). Once&#xD;
           the study is approved by the committee, the investigation will begin. The study group&#xD;
           will be determined through a simple random sampling process using a random number table&#xD;
           (RAND Corporation random number table ). The sample will be recruited from a survey with&#xD;
           closed questions built according to the proposed inclusive and exclusive criteria, which&#xD;
           will allow the selection of participants according to the proposed icriteria at work.&#xD;
           The number of participants for the research will be taken for convenience. As inclusion&#xD;
           criteria the following have been established; Participants over 18 years of age, people&#xD;
           who do not show discomfort or pain when performing manual grasping with the dominant&#xD;
           limb, and students belonging to the Faculty of Rehabilitation Sciences (FCR). As&#xD;
           exclusion criteria were considered: people with musculoskeletal pathologies of hand,&#xD;
           wrist and elbow in the last 6 months, osteosynthesis or prosthesis materials in areas of&#xD;
           current application, peripheral neurological pathologies such as neuropraxis or nerve&#xD;
           cuts, alterations of sensibility such as hypoesthesia, anesthesia or hyperesthesia,&#xD;
           alterations in the skin of the areas of application of the current and monitoring&#xD;
           through miofeedback that include burns, wounds, scars, apprehension or fear of the&#xD;
           application of electrotherapy, and non-completion of the evaluation protocol /&#xD;
           intervention designed for the study or abandonment of the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Three stages of conducting for this study were designated. The first stage called&#xD;
           &quot;Sampling Stage&quot; will be 3 weeks long. This stage consisted of the application of the&#xD;
           survey to the target population and its subsequent analysis based on the information&#xD;
           collected, allowing a first filter selection of the potential participants. The survey&#xD;
           will be applied to the students of the FCR of the Universidad Andrés Bello. The first&#xD;
           filter will be given by the questions of the survey itself. Participants who meet the&#xD;
           proposed participation requirements will then be physically contacted and invited to&#xD;
           participate in the study. Interested students will be given a detailed explanation of&#xD;
           the project and will be asked, in case they wish to participate, to give their consent&#xD;
           in writing. Informed consent reflects the 4 principles of bioethics in order to&#xD;
           safeguard the integrity of the person.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The second stage of the design was called &quot;Evaluation Stage&quot; had a duration of 2 weeks.&#xD;
           In this stage will be evaluate the ability to perform manual grip in a dynamometry test&#xD;
           will following the protocol established in the research. The test was performed in a&#xD;
           scenario with the same working conditions of the study. In addition, it was explained at&#xD;
           this stage everything concerning the characteristics of electrical stimulation used and&#xD;
           evaluation procedure through myofeedback device, as well as its form of application&#xD;
           according to the proposed intervention protocol. Stage two marked a second filter to&#xD;
           discard the participants who presented discomfort, or problems to execute the manual&#xD;
           grip by dynamometry. Once this stage is completed, the final number of participants will&#xD;
           be included in the study (sample), which will allow to advance to stage 3 or&#xD;
           &quot;Experimentation Stage&quot;. This stage will last for 5 weeks. The sample will be randomized&#xD;
           to establish 3 working groups, group 1 or &quot;Upstream direct current group,&quot; group 2 or&#xD;
           &quot;Downstream direct current group&quot;, and a third or &quot;control group&quot;. Randomization will be&#xD;
           performed by the director of the, through a simple random sampling process using a&#xD;
           number table (RAND Corporation number tables), thus reducing possible selection bias.&#xD;
           After this process a definitive list of participants will be counted by group and that&#xD;
           only the director of the study will handle. Demographic variables (secondary variables)&#xD;
           for each group, including age, body mass index (BMI) and gender, will be tabulated, in&#xD;
           addition to the primary variables such as &quot;Maximum handgrip strength&quot; (Kilograms) and&#xD;
           &quot;Maximum electromyographic surface activation threshold &quot;(Microvolts) measured with&#xD;
           dynamometry and miofeedback respectively in a first evaluation before the application of&#xD;
           electrotherapy or&quot; Pre-intervention Evaluation&quot;. This allowed to determine the initial&#xD;
           characteristics for each group to establish possible initial comparisons and to finalize&#xD;
           the measurements once having the results. An evaluator 2 will record the &quot;Maximum&#xD;
           Handgrip Force&quot; of the dominant limb of each individual while at the same time that&#xD;
           through the miofeedback (MF) procedure the &quot;Electromyographic Activation Threshold&quot;. The&#xD;
           maximum grip strength will be evaluated following the research protocol. Evaluator 2&#xD;
           will request three executions within 15 seconds, leaving a rest interval of 60 seconds&#xD;
           between each attempt (according to the proposed protocol based on the work of Watanabe&#xD;
           et al.). The records of the primary variables in this stage will be defined as &quot;Maximum&#xD;
           pre-intervention handgrip force&quot; (PRE MHF) and &quot;Maximum electromyographic activation&#xD;
           threshold of pre-intervention surface&quot; (PRE MEAT). The evaluator 2 will tabulate the&#xD;
           values of the three executions handgrip attempts with their corresponding&#xD;
           electromyographic values in an Excel® worksheet highlighting the best value of grip&#xD;
           strength (maximum grip force) which will be recorded as the maximum handgrip pre&#xD;
           intervation value. Following the process of evaluation of grip strength, the director&#xD;
           will refer each participant to the corresponding intervention group, ie &quot;Direct&#xD;
           Upstreamcurrent&quot; group, &quot;Direct Downstream current&quot; or &quot;Control&quot; group, according to the&#xD;
           randomization of the sample. In the laboratory there will be three working boxes, one&#xD;
           for each intervention procedure. In the laboratorywere three physical therapist, one by&#xD;
           box and one for each procedure. The therapist will not know the values obtained from the&#xD;
           evaluations of force or electromyographic activation threshold performed by the&#xD;
           evaluator 2, nor will they be aware of the participants that will make up the other&#xD;
           study groups. Interveners will be familiar with the application of direct current&#xD;
           modality, since they will be kinesiologists with more than 3 years of experience. Each&#xD;
           controller will work using the GYMNA® COMBI 500 equipment. In the application will work&#xD;
           with a single channel of the equipment in each individual, applying one of the&#xD;
           electrodes inside a bucket with water at a temperature of 25 °C. The participant must&#xD;
           introduce the hand of the dominant upper extremity into the bucket, while the other&#xD;
           electrode will close the circuit in the ventral region of the forearm thus generating a&#xD;
           longitudinal galvanizing arrangement. For Group 1 the red electrode will be used&#xD;
           distally in the bucket, and the black electrode in the forearm area (direct current). On&#xD;
           the other hand, in Group 2 the black electrode in the bucket and the red electrode in&#xD;
           the forearm (downward direct current) will be used, while for the control group the&#xD;
           electrode will be used either red or black distally and the other in The forearm,&#xD;
           because the difference will be that the first two groups will be applied a current of&#xD;
           4mA, based on safety recommendations when applying this type of currents (theoretical&#xD;
           framework), while the control group will not receive stimulation. None of the three&#xD;
           groups will experience any sensation, because with the programmed currents current&#xD;
           densities are imperceptible. With these parameters a current density of 0.02mA / cm2 is&#xD;
           obtained, considering that it will work with rectangular carbon rubber electrodes of&#xD;
           48cm2 area. To ensure that the installation is skewed, the studio director will mask the&#xD;
           color of the channel electrodes (red and black) by means of a white insulation tape, so&#xD;
           that the differences between the colors of the electrodes will not be distinguished,&#xD;
           thus ignoring Is the positive or negative. Only the letter A or B will appear on the&#xD;
           label. The application time for each group will be 12 minutes, according to the&#xD;
           electrotherapy application protocol established for the investigation, which generated a&#xD;
           current dose of 48mA / min according to the work intensity indicated previously.&#xD;
           Participants of the three groups will be installed in wooden chairs in a sedentary&#xD;
           position. The electrotherapy equipment will be placed on the side of the dominant limb&#xD;
           with its screen facing towards the participant's feet so that the adjusted intensity&#xD;
           value is not displayed. After completion of the current application time, the&#xD;
           participant will leave the intervention laboratory and the evaluation room will be&#xD;
           conducted, where the dynamometry test was applied. The holding force will be recorded&#xD;
           again following the measurement protocol, recording again 3 attempts, respecting the&#xD;
           same interval times performed before the application of direct current. The evaluator 2&#xD;
           will record in a Microsoft Excel® worksheet, the Kilograms of the best maximum grip&#xD;
           strength of the 3 trials and their corresponding value in μV of the electromyographic&#xD;
           surface register. These values will be defined as &quot;Maximum post-intervention handgrip&#xD;
           force&quot; (POST MHF) and &quot;Maximum electromyographic activation threshold of&#xD;
           post-intervention surface&quot; (POST MEAT).&#xD;
&#xD;
           After completing the weeks prepared for the measurement, 1 month will be left for the&#xD;
           data ordering and analysis of the information. This task will be taken be the study&#xD;
           director who will be responsible for storing and ordering the data received by the&#xD;
           evaluators and intervenors. For this process the Microsoft Excel® program will be used.&#xD;
           The descriptive statistics for the primary variables &quot;Maximum Handgrip force Difference&quot;&#xD;
           (DIF MHF), &quot;Maximum Pre-intervention Handrgrip force&quot; (PRE MHF) and &quot;Maximum&#xD;
           Post-Intervention Handgrip force&quot; (POST MHF) will use as analysis measures, averages,&#xD;
           fashion, frequencies and standard deviation. For the variables &quot;Maximum&#xD;
           electromiographic activation threshold difference&quot; (DIF MEAT), &quot;pre-intervention&#xD;
           electromyographic activation threshold&quot; (PRE MEAT) and &quot;post-intervention&#xD;
           electromyographic activation threshold&quot; (POST MEAT), the averages, frequencies and&#xD;
           standard deviation between and within groups will be recorded. This information will&#xD;
           also be presented in the form of bar charts. The secondary variables including age and&#xD;
           bone mass index will be expressed as averages, while sex will be expressed as frequency.&#xD;
           In terms of inferential statistics, SHAPIRO WILK (S-WILK) normality test will be used to&#xD;
           determine if the distribution of data obtained for the primary and secondary variables&#xD;
           is normal or not, and according to this will select the statistical test of greater&#xD;
           relevance , ANOVA test if the data distribute normal or Mann Whitney test if the data do&#xD;
           not distribute normal. For the statistical calculation, the SPSS v.24.0 program will be&#xD;
           used. Once the statistical analysis is done, a period of 1 month will be considered for&#xD;
           the analysis of the results, discussion and results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Measurement protocol of Dynamometric Handgrip strenght and of Miofeedback. The&#xD;
           measurement of grip strength will be carried out in the physiotherapy laboratory, room&#xD;
           401, 4th floor, building C5 of Andrés Bello University (UNAB), FCR, Casona Campus, Las&#xD;
           Condes Commune, Avenida Fernández Concha No. 700, Santiago , Chile. Initially&#xD;
           participants are instructed to sit in a straight back chair with dimensions of 42cm&#xD;
           high, 46cm wide by 40cm long, 10º tilt back and dimensions of 43cm high by 46cm wide.&#xD;
           Each participant should be located with; Feet supported flat on the floor, trunk erected&#xD;
           in contact with the back, head and neck in neutral position, adducted shoulder, in&#xD;
           neutral rotation, elbow flexed in 90º, forearm in prono neutral supination, without any&#xD;
           surface support and wrist in position Neutral test.67 The test will use a Jamar®&#xD;
           hydraulic hand-held dynamometer, weighing 600gr and whose dimensions are 26cm long and&#xD;
           13cm wide. The instrument allows double reading on a measurement scale of up to 200lbs /&#xD;
           90kg. For the investigation the Kilograms will be considered as a measurement value. In&#xD;
           addition it has five levels of manual adjustment, being fixed in the second level. The&#xD;
           evaluator will install 2 (active) electrodes on the anterior region of the forearm in&#xD;
           order to evaluate the &quot;Maximum Activation threshold with surface electromyography&quot; by&#xD;
           the miofeedback device. The electrodes shall be placed 3cm from the mid-point of elbow&#xD;
           flexion following the axis from that point to the middle finger. A third electrode&#xD;
           (reference electrode) will be installed at the midpoint of the brachial biceps muscle&#xD;
           following a line between the anterior portion of the acromion and the midpoint of the&#xD;
           elbow flexion fold. The estimated time of measurement per participant is 10 minutes&#xD;
           considering time of explanation of the test and the execution itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The grip strength will be evaluated in 3 opportunities. Participants will be instructed&#xD;
           to position themselves correctly in the work station and apply maximum force for 3&#xD;
           seconds, requesting the maximum effort in each attempt, turning the dynamometer marker&#xD;
           to 0lbs / kg after each grip. The rest between measurements will be 60 seconds81.&#xD;
           Subsequently, the best measured value of the 3 trials performed and its corresponding&#xD;
           value obtained with the MF were recorded. An Excel® spreadsheet was used to record data&#xD;
           for pre-application of electrotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Application of electrotherapy protocol. The intervention will be carried out in the&#xD;
           physiotherapy laboratory, room 401, 4th floor, building C5 of Andres Bello University&#xD;
           (UNAB), faculty of rehabilitation sciences, Casona Campus, Las Condes commune, Calle&#xD;
           Fernández Concha Nº700, Santiago , Chile. After the force measurement, the participants&#xD;
           will be placed in the electrotherapy station, where each person was placed in a chair&#xD;
           (Annex 9). The subject should support the trunk at the back of the chair at a 90 ° angle&#xD;
           of hip flexion, knee and both feet resting on the floor, the distal end of the dominant&#xD;
           upper limb inserted into a plastic bucket with water at 25 ° C. For the application of&#xD;
           electrotherapy, the Combi 500 brand Gymna® will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two carbon electrodes of 7.5cm long and 6cm wide were also covered by damp conducting pads&#xD;
      9,5cm long and 8cm wide, resulting in an area of 48cm2. One of the electrodes will be placed&#xD;
      inside the bucket with water while the other will be fixed to the proximal third of the&#xD;
      forearm on its anterior face (Annex 9), closing the circuit with a longitudinal&#xD;
      galvanization. For group 1 (direct current) the red electrode will be used distally in the&#xD;
      bucket with water, and the black electrode in the area of the forearm. For group 2 (direct&#xD;
      downward current) the black electrode in the bucket and the red electrode in the forearm will&#xD;

      red or black distally and the other in the forearm. The controllers will ignore the sign of&#xD;
      each electrode, because they will be masked with a white tape with only numbers A or B. The&#xD;
      director of the study will only know the polarity of the electrode and it will be the one who&#xD;
      will indicate if it is the electrode A or B that will In the bucket. In groups 1 and 2 direct&#xD;
      current will be applied at 4mA for 12 minutes (dose 48mA.min). The control group did not&#xD;
      apply any intensity keeping the equipment on but no emission during the same time as groups 1&#xD;
      and 2.&#xD;
