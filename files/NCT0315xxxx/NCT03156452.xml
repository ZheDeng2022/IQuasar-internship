    <textblock>
      This is a study of two treatment pathways [Standard steroid treatment versus combined steroid&#xD;
      and Mycophenolate (MMF)] for subjects with newly diagnosed Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP). ITP&#xD;
      is an illness that causes bruising and bleeding due to a low platelet count (blood cells&#xD;
      essential for normal clotting). Patients are first given high dose steroids but most suffer&#xD;
      side effects (e.g. difficulty sleeping, weight gain, moods swings, high blood pressure and&#xD;
      diabetes). In addition, the majority of patients become ill again when the steroids are&#xD;
      stopped - only about 20% stay well long term. ITP is relatively rare, non-cancerous in nature&#xD;
      and the rare impact on survival of ITP have prevented it from being a priority for research&#xD;
      funding, with first line treatment being unsatisfactory and unchallenged for decades. This&#xD;
      underestimates the profound adverse impact an ITP diagnosis and its treatment has on&#xD;
      individual patients, many of whom are young.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MMF is often used as the next stage treatment for ITP and it works well. However, it can take&#xD;
      up to 2 months to work during which patients continue to be at risk of bleeding, bruising,&#xD;
      fatigue and usually need more steroids which they find intolerable. They are required to come&#xD;
      to hospital for weekly blood tests and for many this impacts on work. We want to find out&#xD;
      whether it would benefit more patients if everyone takes MMF at diagnosis instead of current&#xD;
      practice (waiting for the illness to come back). We plan to test this by comparing the&#xD;
      current way we treat patients to a new way with patients given MMF right at the start of&#xD;
      their treatment. 120 patients from 20 different hospitals will be asked to take part and half&#xD;
      will be randomly chosen for the new pathway.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, randomised clinical trial of MMF with steroid as a first line&#xD;
      treatment for participants with ITP against the standard care pathway involving steroids&#xD;
      alone as first line treatment. This is not a blinded study, therefore patients and research&#xD;
      team will know which treatment arm the participant will be randomised to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no additional appointments or separate trial visits for this trial. Participants&#xD;
      will be seen at their usual hospital appointments, which may take slightly longer than they&#xD;
      do usually to gather all the information needed to carefully record information for the trial&#xD;
      and to see how the participants are.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened and given up to one week of steroid prior to randomisation to&#xD;
      enable sufficient time to read information, discuss and ask questions with informed consent&#xD;
      in an appropriate setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be randomised to one of either two treatment pathways below and be&#xD;
      asked to complete quality of life questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Steroid +MMF pathway: 1mg/kg once daily prednisolone 4 days (maximum of 100mg), 40mg&#xD;
           once daily 2 weeks, 20mg once daily 2 weeks, 10mg once daily 2 weeks, 5mg once daily 2&#xD;
           weeks then 5mg alternate days 2 weeks then stop, (Dexamethasone 20mg or 40mg daily for 4&#xD;
           days is an alternative option to prednisolone if deemed clinically more appropriate for&#xD;
           individual circumstances).&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the duration of steroid, patients will get a PPI (proton pump inhibitors) or H2&#xD;
           antagonist to protect against gastric bleeding and appropriate bone protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           From randomisation (alongside steroid), MMF 500mg twice daily starting dose then&#xD;
           increased to 750mg twice daily after 2 weeks if tolerated and 1g twice daily after&#xD;
           another 2 weeks if tolerated (4 weeks after starting).&#xD;
&#xD;
           After 6 months of MMF therapy, all patients who have remained in complete remission&#xD;
           (platelet count&gt; 100 x10 9/L) will reduce the dose by 250mg (one capsule) each month.&#xD;
           The aim is to continue on the lowest dose that achieves a haemostatic (safe) platelet&#xD;
           count (platelet 50-100 x10 9/L) and to ensure that patients who have gone into a&#xD;
           spontaneous remission do not continue to take the drug indefinitely.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Steroid only group: 1mg/kg once daily prednisolone 4 days (maximum of 100mg), 40mg once&#xD;
           daily 2 weeks, 20mg once daily 2 weeks, 10mg once daily 2 weeks, 5mg once daily 2 weeks&#xD;
           then 5mg alternate days 2 weeks then stop (Dexamethasone 20mg or 40mg orally daily for 4&#xD;
           days is an alternative option to prednisolone if deemed clinically more appropriate for&#xD;
           individual circumstances).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the duration of steroid, patients will get a PPI (proton pump inhibitors) or H2&#xD;
      antagonist to protect against gastric bleeding and appropriate bone protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen at the following time points after randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 months, 4 months, 6 months and 12 months when the following procedures will take place:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory tests (safety bloods)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date of treatment failure (refractory or relapse AND need for second line therapy). [If&#xD;
           treatment failure occurs, choice of second line treatment will be individualised&#xD;
           according to patient's clinical circumstances. Further steroid will be given according&#xD;
           to clinical need. Hospital monitoring of platelet levels is part of routine care for ITP&#xD;
           patients and we will collect these details from the medical notes without requiring&#xD;
           patients to come in for additional samples to be taken. These locally collected samples&#xD;
           may be collected monthly (or less often) for patients believed to be in stable remission&#xD;
           and weekly at lower or declining platelet levels. We expect this to allow us to&#xD;
           calculate the time in remission and time in relapse with reasonable accuracy over the 12&#xD;
           month follow up period].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sugar results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication side effects (including infections)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose and duration of steroids&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need for rescue or other treatments (including second or third line). [Emergency and&#xD;
           rescue treatments will be permitted throughout the study. These include platelet&#xD;
           transfusions, tranexamic acid and intravenous immunoglobulin. These are known not to&#xD;
           impact on the natural history of ITP and it is recognised that they may be important for&#xD;
           patient safety. The use of 'rescue treatments' will be recorded on the CRF]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital attendances or admissions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Days off work&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient questionnaires: Quality of life assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunoglobulins rechecked at 6 months and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition at Screening and 2 months, participants will have the option to give an extra&#xD;
      blood sample for the Bristol Biobank (ancillary translational basic science studies). There&#xD;
      is an additional patient information sheet and consent form for this. Participants can&#xD;
      consent to enter the trial, but decline to have bloods taken for bio banking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition at 6 and 12 months, immunoglobulins will be checked.&#xD;
