  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic patients suffering diabetic foot disease have sever comorbidities, as hypertension,&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease, autonomic neuropathy, infections and gastric reflux all of which&#xD;
      contribute to a high risk profile for anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      failure rate associated with ankle or popliteal nerve block may be higher than accepted, the&#xD;
      study hypothesized that combined ankle and popliteal block may increase the success rate with&#xD;
      no added complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic patients suffering diabetic foot disease regularly have sever co-morbidities, they&#xD;
      are more liable to hypertension, ischemic heart disease, autonomic neuropathy, infections and&#xD;
      gastric reflux all of which contribute to a high risk profile for anesthesia according to&#xD;
      American society of anesthesiologists patients classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic management for diabetic foot disease surgery is a frequent challenge and should be&#xD;
      undertaken with a careful consideration of the anesthetic techniques available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hazards of general anesthesia is more likely in diabetic patients as they have low reserves&#xD;
      to preserve against additional straining factors during general anesthesia consequently,&#xD;
      avoiding general anesthesia in this population may be a central concern to ensure optimal&#xD;
      peri-operative management following lower limb surgery. Neuraxial anesthesia is complicated&#xD;
      by urinary retention, hypotension and postdural puncture headache and backache. In chronic&#xD;
      ischemic legs, with multiple and diffuse stenosis in the leg segmental vessels, hypotension&#xD;
      can precipitate thrombosis easily. In addition fluid loading and vasopressor administration&#xD;
      may not be ideal methods to treat hypotension since end stage renal disease and coronary&#xD;
      artery occlusive disease are common in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relative to central nerve block, peripheral limb blocks are more discriminatory in their&#xD;
      action and consequently result in less interference of bladder function and motor&#xD;
      impairments. Also with peripheral nerve block, patients do not require postoperative fasting&#xD;
      that help in preserving patient glycemic control. Moreover. Nerve block anesthesia has the&#xD;
      advantages of improved postoperative pain control and it is more economical reducing hospital&#xD;
      and associated expenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ankle block alone has high failure rate and require more than usual dose to get effective. In&#xD;
      popliteal block larger dose is needed than ankle and there is more time delay. The&#xD;
      investigators thought to get the advantages of using local than general anesthesia with&#xD;
      combined ankle and popliteal blocks to increase potentiation and decrease doses in diabetic&#xD;
      foot surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study is to compare between single ankle, single popliteal and combined ankle&#xD;
      popliteal block in diabetic patients undergoing elective foot surgery to determine block&#xD;
      success rate, safety and efficacy to find the method of better outcome and lesser side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
