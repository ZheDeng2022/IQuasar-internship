  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to develop and evaluate three short corporate falls risk&#xD;
      awareness videos of approximately 1-2 minutes (each) by using the feedback from&#xD;
      community-dwelling people aged 50 years and above. The three videos aim to make a broad&#xD;
      audience aware of the risk of falling as one gets older.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year one in three people aged 60 years and above fall over. More than 96.000&#xD;
      Australians are admitted to hospital each year due to a fall and this number is rising by 2%&#xD;
      each year. People who have had a fall account for almost 40% of all hospitalised injury&#xD;
      cases, with almost half of those falls resulting in injuries such as broken hips, neck- and&#xD;
      head injuries. In 2015 almost 2300 Australians died as a direct result of a fall, a number&#xD;
      which is more than three times higher than the number of people who die in car accidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the high risk of experiencing (an) (injurious) fall(s), various campaigns have been&#xD;
      conducted with the aim of making older people aware that it is important to prevent falls.&#xD;
      Also, numerous resources (websites, leaflets) are available to the general public that inform&#xD;
      them of the several activities they can undertake to reduce their risk of falls. However,&#xD;
      these campaigns and available resources do not seem to be compelling enough. Research has&#xD;
      shown that people over the age of 60 still tend to underestimate their own risk of a fall,&#xD;
      and have low levels of knowledge about how to prevent falls. Also, many older people report&#xD;
      that they are not motivated to take action to reduce their risk of falls even thought they&#xD;
      think that falls prevention would be useful for other older people. In particular older&#xD;
      people state that they seek out information only after they fall and not before. It would be&#xD;
      beneficial if the broad population and people over the age of 60 in particular, were more&#xD;
      aware about falls and more motivated to take action(s) to reduce their risk of falling.&#xD;
      Therefore the investigators aim to develop three short falls risk awareness videos that are&#xD;
      appealing to people of all age groups and especially people aged 60 years and above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on research findings by the investigators, to date three prototype versions of short&#xD;
      falls risk awareness videos have been developed. During this research project these videos&#xD;
      will be evaluated and then amended and developed further according to the feedback given by&#xD;
      the participants. The feedback from participants will be sought in two phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 In the first phase 50 community-dwelling older people over the age of 50 will be&#xD;
      invited to share their thoughts and opinions about the prototype versions of the three falls&#xD;
      risk awareness videos. For the participants in this phase of the study it will involve&#xD;
      attending a focus group meeting of about 1½ hour in total together with 8-10 other&#xD;
      participants. During this focus group meeting (but prior to the actual discussion about the&#xD;
      videos) the researchers will also ask the participants to help test a questionnaire which is&#xD;
      developed specifically for the purpose of this study. Participants will be asked to fill in&#xD;
      the questionnaire twice (with a 20 minute rest in between). Questions pertain to the&#xD;
      participants' knowledge of falls and their capabilities and motivation towards undertaking&#xD;
      fall prevention activities. The researchers plan to use this questionnaire in the second&#xD;
      phase of the project. It this phase it is solely used to measure the time taken to complete&#xD;
      the questionnaire and to establish its reliability (and not to actually measure the outcomes&#xD;
      at this point). Then the prototype videos will be shown twice, followed by a discussion group&#xD;
      of around 45-50 minutes in which several questions will be asked about the content and the&#xD;
      appeal of the three videos. Subsequent to the focus groups, the participants' feedback on the&#xD;
      prototype videos will be evaluated and used to amend/develop the videos further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 During the second phase of this research study the amended videos will be screened to&#xD;
      a larger audience of about 100 community-dwelling people aged 50 years and above during a&#xD;
      World Café forum. This is a research design that specifically aims to gain consumers opinions&#xD;
      about topics of interest. The aim of this forum is to seek these people's feedback on the&#xD;
      three videos. In addition, the researchers will evaluate if having watched these three videos&#xD;
      has changed the forum attendees' knowledge, intentions and some basic beliefs towards falls&#xD;
      and engaging in falls prevention activities. This will be measured using the questionnaire&#xD;
      that was pretested for reliability in the first phase of the study. The participants'&#xD;
      feedback about the videos will be evaluated and used to develop the final versions of the&#xD;
      videos. These final videos will be used in a future research study, most likely by being&#xD;
      placed online and evaluated using the questionnaire previously developed.&#xD;
