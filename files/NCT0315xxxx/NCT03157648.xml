  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shivering is a physiologic response to early hypothermia in mammals. The definition of&#xD;
      shivering is an involuntary, oscillatory muscular activity that augments metabolic heat&#xD;
      production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routinely in post anesthetic care unit (PACU), the core temperature via tympanic membrane is&#xD;
      always measured in all patients. Sometimes patients who have low temperature have no&#xD;
      shivering symptom in other hand patients who have normal temperature have shivering symptom.&#xD;
      This indicates that, only core temperature is not enough for predicting or detecting patients&#xD;
      who will have shivering symptom in PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators hypothesise that the core-peripheral temperature difference in&#xD;
      postoperative period indicates patients who will have shivering symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the aims of this study are to evaluate the relationship between core-peripheral&#xD;
      temperature difference and shivering symptom in patients in PACU.&#xD;

      Humans are warm-blooded animal or homeotherms. They are able to regulate their body&#xD;
      temperature which in physiologic range themselves. The body temperature is controlled by&#xD;
      balancing heat production and heat loss. The normal body temperature refers to either core&#xD;
      temperature (eg. tympanic membrane, esophagus, and intra-urinary bladder) or peripheral&#xD;
      temperature (eg. skin, forehead, and axillar). Core temperature is the temperature of the&#xD;
      deep tissues of the body. The normal range of core temperature is between 36.5-37.5 degree&#xD;
      celsius. The peripheral temperature, in contrast to the core temperature, can be changed by&#xD;
      many factors such as the temperature of the surroundings environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term of hypothermia is the core temperature less than or equal to 36.4 degree celsius.&#xD;
      When the body exposes to cold temperature, heat loss is decreased and heat production is&#xD;
      increased as defense mechanism for keeping balance in several means: stop sweating,&#xD;
      piloerection, cutaneous arterioles constriction, shivering, which increases heat production&#xD;
      in skeletal muscles, conversion from fat to energy by mitochondria.Hypothermia is one of&#xD;
      factors, which relates to postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shivering is an oscillatory muscular activity that augments metabolic heat production.&#xD;
      Vigorous shivering increases metabolic heat production up to 600% above basal level.&#xD;
      Shivering is a common postoperative period complication. The pathophysiology of postoperative&#xD;
      shivering remains unclear otherwise various mechanisms have been proposed. Shivering may&#xD;
      happen as a thermoregulatory response to hypothermia or muscle hyperactivity with clonic or&#xD;
      tonic patterns. Although cold-induced shivering is an obvious source of postanesthetic&#xD;
      tremor. Some of the patients who suffer from shivering are believed to be nonthermoregulatory&#xD;
      because their core temperatures remain normal. The incidence of postoperative shivering is&#xD;
      65% of patients after general anesthesia and 33% of patients after regional anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the prospective observation clinical study. Investigators will observe shivering&#xD;
      symptom and measure the patients' temperature at tympanic membrane, forehead, and dorsal of&#xD;
      hand at many time points.&#xD;
