    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of vorinostat when given together&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular&#xD;
      lymphoma, or Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back after a period of improvement or that does&#xD;
      not respond to treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab,&#xD;
      may help the body's immune system attack the cancer and may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      cancer cells to grow and spread. Vorinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving vorinostat and pembrolizumab together may&#xD;
      work better than pembrolizumab alone in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,&#xD;
      follicular lymphoma, or Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of vorinostat plus pembrolizumab therapy by&#xD;
      evaluation of toxicities including: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and&#xD;
      duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      vorinostat when given in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain preliminary estimates of the anti-tumor activity of pembrolizumab plus&#xD;
      vorinostat therapy by assessing the overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR) rate,&#xD;
      duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate responses and disease progression according to the Lymphoma Response to&#xD;
      Immunomodulatory Therapy Criteria (LYRIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Explore genomic biomarkers of response and resistance to pembrolizumab plus vorinostat&#xD;
      therapy in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), or&#xD;
      Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Explore immunologic biomarkers of response and resistance to pembrolizumab plus&#xD;
      vorinostat therapy in patients with DLBCL, FL, or HL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Explore the value of circulating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) as a biomarker of&#xD;
      response to pembrolizumab plus vorinostat therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vorinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5 and 8-12 and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days for 24&#xD;
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

             detected)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy; Note:&#xD;
             seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
