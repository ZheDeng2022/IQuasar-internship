  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The era of precision medicine is an exciting time for clinicians, scientists and patients&#xD;
      alike. The increasing appreciation and identification of specific mutations that drive&#xD;
      cancers, leaves us on the threshold of a new era in which biomarkers will be used to direct&#xD;
      targeted agents to only those patients most likely to respond. The potential medical and&#xD;
      scientific benefits of such a personalised approach to cancer therapy are immense. However, a&#xD;
      number of barriers challenge successful implementation of this approach of which spatial and&#xD;
      temporal heterogeneity are a major concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gynaecological cancers are a major cause of mortality and morbidity internationally. In&#xD;
      Auckland 150 new patients with ovarian, endometrial or cervical cancer are seen by a medical&#xD;
      oncologist each year. In general, when these diseases recur, there are few effective&#xD;
      therapeutic options and prognosis is poor. Better therapeutic targets and treatments are an&#xD;
      unmet need across these tumour types with treatment paradigms still based upon platinum based&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROSPER (Profiling of Oncology Patients as part of Clinical care and Research) will&#xD;
      investigate the evolution of gynaecological cancers over time and in response to treatment to&#xD;
      develop better biomarkers to guide treatment decisions and ultimately improve patient&#xD;
      outcomes. Biopsies at relapse will be collected and profiled with a 580 cancer gene panel.&#xD;
      Circulating tumour DNA will be collected and analysed alongside biopsies as a potential&#xD;
      non-invasive alternative. Linking genomic and clinical data will allow us to learn more to&#xD;
      begin to change our paradigm of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PROSPER is a pilot project that will assess the ability to integrate genomic results into&#xD;
      patient care and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be consented to be involved. Involvement will be completely voluntary.&#xD;
      Patients with gynaecological cancers or patients potentially eligible for a phase I trial who&#xD;
      are receiving cancer care under medical oncology at Auckland City Hospital will be approached&#xD;
      to consider participation in this study. All patients who are over 18 and potentially&#xD;
      eligible for further therapy (standard of care or as part of a clinical trial) will be&#xD;
      considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who agree to participate in PROSPER will provide archived tumour specimens (primary&#xD;
      tumour and/or metastasis; tumour block or 15-20 unstained paraffin-embedded slides [minimum&#xD;
      of 15 unstained slides if block not available], plus one H&amp;E stained slide). Molecular&#xD;
      profiling will be performed at the University of Auckland taking advantage of local&#xD;
      expertise. A hybridisation capture DNA sequencing approach obtaining 500x-1000x coverage of a&#xD;
      panel of 578 cancer genes will be used. This approach has recently been used to successfully&#xD;
      analyse over 40 paired tumour and normal FFPE tissues by Prof. Cristin Print's University of&#xD;
      Auckland laboratory (NimbleGen comprehensive cancer panel). Tumour tissue that remains after&#xD;
      molecular profiling will be banked (with patients' consent) and may be subject to additional&#xD;
      genomic sequencing analysis (e.g. whole genome sequencing), RNA expression analysis&#xD;
      (Affymetrix Primeview), protein expression analysis (e.g. Western blot, IHC), and/or DNA copy&#xD;
      number analysis (e.g. array CGH, quantitative PCR, FISH) based on resources available. Only&#xD;
      validated results of these analyses will be conveyed to treating physicians and made&#xD;
      available in patients' records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must agree to provide whole blood for biobanking. This will provide a source of&#xD;
      normal DNA for differentiation of constitutional versus somatic (tumour) molecular changes.&#xD;
      Blood samples will also be used to detect circulating tumour DNA to assess this as an&#xD;
      alternative to fresh biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On documentation of relapse patients will be asked (where feasible) to provide a tumour&#xD;
      biopsy and blood sample for further profiling. As biopsies become an increasingly common&#xD;
      requirement in clinical trials, willingness of patients, procedural safety and useful tissue&#xD;
      acquisition are critical elements of success. In patients with high grade serous ovarian&#xD;
      cancer research biopsies have been shown to be safe, and feasible. In this project,&#xD;
      investigators will collect ctDNA (circulating tumour DNA) alongside tumour biopsies to allow&#xD;
      correlation and validation of the role of ctDNA as a non-invasive alternative to biopsies.&#xD;
      Relating baseline expression profiles to treatment outcomes for each patient will help&#xD;
      optimise drug therapy by improving patient selection and monitoring. This project will build&#xD;
      upon plasma genomic initiatives already underway in breast, colorectal, and neuroendocrine&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All decision making about the advisability of biopsy and site to be sampled will be at the&#xD;
      discretion of the clinician(s) who have primary care responsibility for the participants. The&#xD;
      possible risks and benefits of obtaining additional fresh tumour samples at the time of&#xD;
      relapse or emergence of drug resistance, will be fully explained to the patient. Consent to&#xD;
      undergo a biopsy to obtain fresh tumour will be entirely voluntary and will not affect the&#xD;
      patient's eligibility to participate in PROSPER or to participate in a related clinical&#xD;
      trial. Participants will be allowed to decline biopsies at any stage, even if they have&#xD;
      consented previously. Biopsies at relapse may be taken surgically or radiologically depending&#xD;
      on feasibility and what other interventions are being undertaken as part of standard of care.&#xD;
      A small proportion of these patients with isolated relapse may undergo surgery and in this&#xD;
      scenario samples will be collected at this time. If biopsies are to be done radiologically,&#xD;
      at least three 14-16 gauge core tumour biopsies will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROSPER will assess the clinical significance and feasibility of a profiling programme.&#xD;
      Measures of benefit will include the percentage of patients treated as part of a clinical&#xD;
      trial; number of patients receiving targeted therapy based on molecular aberrations; and&#xD;
      integration of molecular information in practice. The study aims to profile 50-100 patients&#xD;
      in the first year. In Auckland Hospital, 150 new patients with ovarian, cervical or&#xD;
      endometrial cancer are treated annually. Additionally, 100-150 patients with relapsed disease&#xD;
      are treated each year. This creates a large population that will be eligible for this&#xD;
      project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secure PROSPER database to register patients' clinical details will be established.&#xD;
      Throughout the study's duration, data management processes will be followed in accordance&#xD;
      with local SOPs, in an effort to maximise data quality and security.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry will be password protected and accessible to registered users only. Doctors&#xD;
      referring patients for enrolment in PROSPER will be able to view each of their patient's&#xD;
      results in an identifiable format for use in clinical decision making. Other registered&#xD;
      doctors will be able to see all other patient details in a de-identified manner allowing them&#xD;
      to view clinical details and assay results of like patients. If patients' information is sent&#xD;
      overseas as part of the study, only de-identified data will be sent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate steps will be taken to protect health information against loss, unauthorised&#xD;
      access, use, modification, or disclosure or other misuse. For collection of tissue, patient&#xD;
      information will be de-identified and a new unique alpha-numeric identifier will be assigned&#xD;
      to each participant for all tissue specimens. Identification of individuals will be possible&#xD;
      only by reference to a master index, which will be kept on hard copy in a locked file in a&#xD;
      secure area, and on a password-protected encrypted database. If tissue or isolated molecular&#xD;
      products are sent overseas for specialised scientific studies, only the anonymised study ID&#xD;
      would be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected by the principal investigator, project manager, local&#xD;
      clinical lead or other health professional under the approval of the local clinical lead,&#xD;
      from patients' medical records into a password protected central database housed on a secure&#xD;
      server under responsibility of the University of Auckland. All data will be de-identified at&#xD;
      the point of extraction from the database prior to any analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No directly identifiable information will be included in publications arising from this&#xD;
      study, nor will NHI numbers, dates of birth, or names of donors be shared with collaborators,&#xD;
      with the exception of collaborators involved in the care of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians involved with patient care will have access to the profiling results if patients&#xD;
      have provided consent for this.&#xD;
