  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Considering the impact of caregivers' oral health knowledge, attitudes and practices on the&#xD;
      oral health of their children; we introduced an educational program to the parents and&#xD;
      caregivers of children with developmental disabilities about the oral healthcare of their&#xD;
      developmentally disabled children to rise up with the oral health status of those children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Target Population; Parents of Children with DD enrolled in selected special education&#xD;
           centers in Khartoum state, Khartoum, Sudan, and their developmentally disabled children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A convenient sample of two special education centers were selected randomly from a list&#xD;
           of all the 105 special education centers registered at the State Ministry of Education,&#xD;
           and allocated into intervention and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One center was used as case who received the educational program and the other center&#xD;
           was used as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligibility Criteria: child aged 3-18, with a developmental disability, caregivers&#xD;
           approval to participate (signed the informed consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the Children who met the eligibility criteria in both centers were examined and all&#xD;
           their parents were interviewed, before and after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An interview questionnaire for the parents of Children with DD in both centers was used&#xD;
           to evaluate their knowledge and attitude toward the oral health care of their children&#xD;
           before and 3 months after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral examination was carried out to determine the baseline oral hygiene level and&#xD;
           treatment needs of the Children with DD, before the educational session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A second examination was carried out after a period of 3 months after the educational&#xD;
           session, to determine any change in oral hygiene and treatment needs of the children&#xD;
           after their parents and or caregivers' attendance to the educational session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The baseline and follow up examination were carried out blindly by a calibrated dentist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The same examiner carried out the baseline and follow up examinations to avoid any&#xD;
           inter-examiner variations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral examination was arranged according to oral health surveys basic methods recommended&#xD;
           by WHO in 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (measuring debris index and calculus index).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dentition Status and Treatment Needs chart provided in oral health assessment forms for&#xD;
           children by the WHO 2013 was used to determine the amount of unmet dental needs and help&#xD;
           in evaluating the caregivers' oral healthcare behaviours and the frequency of dental&#xD;
           visits.&#xD;
