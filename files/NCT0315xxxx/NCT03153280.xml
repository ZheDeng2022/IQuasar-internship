  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase Ib, open label, multi-centre trial designed to estimate the Maximum&#xD;
      Tolerated Dose (MTD) of lithium when combined with a standard chemotherapy regimen of&#xD;
      oxaliplatin and capecitabine in patients with advanced, unresectable, oesophago-gastric or&#xD;
      colorectal cancer who have received no previous treatment for advanced disease (previous&#xD;
      adjuvant or neo-adjuvant treatment is acceptable if completed at least 6 months prior to&#xD;
      registration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study follows a modified Fibonacci, 3+3, dose escalation design. Patients are enrolled in&#xD;
      cohorts of 3. All three patients in each cohort must complete at least two cycles of&#xD;
      treatment to be evaluable for toxicity. If a patient cannot complete 2 cycles, another&#xD;
      patient will be enrolled.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase Ib, open label, multi-centre, dose escalation trial to assess the dose&#xD;
      of lithium that can be safely combined with standard treatment oxaliplatin and capecitabine&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registered patients will be treated with lithium combined with a standard chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen of oxaliplatin and capecitabine until a maximum of 6 x 21 day cycles (18 weeks),&#xD;
      tumour progression, unacceptable toxicity, pregnancy, withdrawal of consent or withdrawal at&#xD;
      the discretion of the investigator, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discontinuation of study treatment, all patients will be followed for safety for at&#xD;
      least 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression will continue&#xD;
      to be followed every 9 weeks in accordance with standard of care for efficacy (i.e. tumour&#xD;
      assessment) until disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow up or&#xD;
      until the start of a new anti-neoplastic treatment, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient has documented disease progression, they will be followed up every three&#xD;
      months (Â±1 month) for survival status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be a traditional 3+3 design: cohorts of 3 patients will be treated with&#xD;
      lithium combined with standard treatment oxaliplatin and capecitabine chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doses of oxaliplatin and capecitabine have been established in prior phase II and III&#xD;
      studies and will not be escalated. Lithium target serum concentrations are assigned at&#xD;
      registration according to a defined dose escalation scheme. Study lithium dose escalation&#xD;
      will follow a modified Fibonacci 3+3 sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A -1 dose level (0.4mmol/L) is included in case dose de-escalation is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The levels of lithium achieved in each patient will be established by regular assessment of&#xD;
      steady state serum concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lithium will start at a low level and dose escalations will be performed in cohorts of 3&#xD;
      patients according to a standard 3+3 algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation and determination of MTD will be based on the occurrence of Dose Limiting&#xD;
      Toxicities (DLT) as defined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first cohort of 3 patients will commence at dose level 1. All patients in each cohort&#xD;
      will be observed for two cycles on the specified dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If none of 3 patients at a given dose level experiences a DLT, accrual will continue to&#xD;
           the next dose level according to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If 1 of 3 patients experiences a DLT at a given dose level, 3 additional patients will&#xD;
           be treated at the same dose. If no additional patient has a DLT in this cohort, accrual&#xD;
           will continue to the next dose level according to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If 2 or more patients in 3 or 6 patients treated at a given dose experience a DLT, the&#xD;
           next lowest dose level will define the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined as any of the following adverse events occurring&#xD;
      during the two first cycles (within 42 days from first dose) of treatment and possibly,&#xD;
      probably or definitely related to the combination of lithium, oxaliplatin and capecitabine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Grade 3 or 4 non-haematological toxicity other than nausea, vomiting or fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia: grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 25 x 109/L) or&#xD;
      grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia (grade 3 platelet count: 25 x 109/L to &lt; 50 x 109/L) associated&#xD;
      with bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Complicated grade 4 neutropenia (&lt; 0.5 x 109/L): fever, sepsis &gt; 5 days of duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Any significant* grade 2 and higher toxicity other than nausea, vomiting, rash, alopecia&#xD;
      or anaemia that persists longer than 35 days after the start of cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *&quot;Significant&quot; defined as affecting quality of life or patient safety as determined by&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and laboratory parameters will be assessed to evaluate disease response and toxicity&#xD;
      of study therapy. Safety assessments will be performed every 3 weeks for the 18 weeks.&#xD;
      Efficacy assessments (Radiological examination) will be performed on all patients every 9&#xD;
      weeks (+/- 1 week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An End of Treatment visit will be performed for patients within 30 days (+/- 1 week) post&#xD;
      last dose or disease progression.&#xD;
