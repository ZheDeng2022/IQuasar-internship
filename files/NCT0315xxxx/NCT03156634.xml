  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized pilot study comparing the impact of the Patient Activated Learning&#xD;
      System (PALS) on knowledge acquisition, recall, and decision making about antihypertensive&#xD;
      medication compared to an established online health information system (WebMD). We will also&#xD;
      compare the two systems with regard to user experience measures such as understandability and&#xD;
      trust.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Primary research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1)Do hypertensive participants who learn about hypertension medication with PALS&#xD;
      (intervention) have higher immediate and 1 week knowledge assessment scores than participants&#xD;
      randomized to learn the same information via WebMD (control)? The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that participants in the PALS group will have higher immediate and one week assessment&#xD;
      scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do participants in the PALS group feel more informed to make hypothetical decisions&#xD;
           about taking medications compared to participants in the WebMD group?&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators hypothesize that participants in the PALS group will be more likely to&#xD;
           indicate that they have sufficient information to make hypothetical decisions about&#xD;
           taking medications than participants in the WebMD group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do participants in the PALS group rate it higher on user experience measures such as&#xD;
           trust, usefulness, comprehensibility, and adequacy of the information, attractiveness of&#xD;
           the site, and level of engagement, than those in the WebMD group? The investigators&#xD;
           hypothesize ratings on these measures will be higher in the PALS group compared to the&#xD;
           WebMD group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Which questions about antihypertensives do participants consider most important and are&#xD;
           the 5 most highly rated questions more likely to be addressed on PALS vs. WebMD? The&#xD;
           investigators hypothesize that PALS will address more questions that participants rate&#xD;
           as important compared to WebMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with hypertension, who have been prescribed any antihypertensive medicine except&#xD;
      chlorthalidone will be recruited from the Weill Cornell Internal Medicine Associates (WCIMA)&#xD;
      practice. Potentially eligible participants who have an upcoming appointment at WCIMA will be&#xD;
      identified via a review of the electronic medical record. In cases where the participant's&#xD;
      eligibility is unclear, Research Assistants (RA's) will contact the participant's Primary&#xD;
      Medical Doctor (PMD) to confirm eligibility. Potentially eligible participants will be&#xD;
      contacted via the telephone to assess their interest in participating and to schedule a study&#xD;
      visit for those interested. Verbal consent will be obtained either on the phone or at the&#xD;
      study visit. Potentially eligible participants may also be recruited from the waiting room at&#xD;
      WCIMA if the RA's were unable to contact them by phone prior to their WCIMA visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants who agree to participate will be randomized to view information about&#xD;
      the antihypertensive, chlorthalidone, via the PALS or WebMD. The study procedures will be&#xD;
      identical for both the PALS and WebMD groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chlorthalidone was chosen because, despite its efficacy, it is not prescribed as often as&#xD;
      other antihypertensives. This will allow the investigators to select a sample of participants&#xD;
      who are less likely to have baseline knowledge of the information we are testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess knowledge acquisition and recall, participants will be shown up to 10 pre-specified&#xD;
      webpages within their site of randomization that contain information that answers up to 10&#xD;
      discrete questions about chlorthalidone. Participants will answer up to 10 corresponding&#xD;
      assessment questions immediately after viewing the information. The knowledge score will be&#xD;
      the percentage of correct responses. The RA's will evaluate knowledge retention by asking the&#xD;
      same assessment questions over the phone one week later. User experience, trust, and&#xD;
      participant decision-making will be assessed through a survey and through a short semi&#xD;
      structured interview. The investigators will also collect information on health literacy via&#xD;
      the REALM-SF health literacy questionnaire as well as demographic information including age,&#xD;
      level of education, race/ethnicity, prior Internet use, and access to the Internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess question prioritization/availability on PALS/WebMD, the investigators will show&#xD;
      participants a list of up to 40 questions and ask them to chose those most important to them.&#xD;
      The investigators will search for the answers to the highest prioritized questions to&#xD;
      determine availability on PALS/WebMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys and knowledge scores will be administered via Qualtrics. Participants will be&#xD;
      compensated with a $25 ClinCard after completing the study visit.&#xD;
