  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies in female .To the younger patients,&#xD;
      radical hysterectomy which is a standard operation during the earlier and middle therapy&#xD;
      stage as well as more effective technique like radiotherapy and chemotherapy give them a&#xD;
      longer life expectancy. However, the operation destroys patients' normal pelvic anatomy,&#xD;
      nutrient supplements and internal secretion so that postoperative pelvic floor functional&#xD;
      dysfunction has a destructive effect for their life. There are tremendous studies on clinical&#xD;
      symptoms while few on anatomical changes and the relationship between pelvic floor symptoms&#xD;
      and the dysfunction. Two-dimensional Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI), transperineal&#xD;
      ultrasonography， Urodynamic examination and anorectal manometry are frequently used in the&#xD;
      fine-structure varies and pelvic floor function. Now three-dimensional MRI has more&#xD;
      advantages in fine change of Pelvic anatomical and space position，as well as clearly showing&#xD;
      the relationships between the change and space with the pelvic floor function. Based on an&#xD;
      eight-year-study on three-dimensional MRI, we can analyze the postoperational anatomical&#xD;
      changes and the relationship between the changes and the dysfunction by combined anatomic&#xD;
      parameters which are measured on static-dynamic three- dimensional model with clinical&#xD;
      symptoms, transperineal ultrasonography,urodynamic examination and anorectal manometry. We&#xD;
      expect our study could provide scientific basis for on protective and repaired measures of&#xD;
      pelvic floor.&#xD;

    <description>A standard radical hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy was performed. Static and dynamic MRI were performed. A suggested urodynamic examination was done according to the ICS. A 3D reconstruction technique was used to construct the 3D model of the pelvis, pelvic floor muscle, pelvic organ such as bladder and urethral.</description>
