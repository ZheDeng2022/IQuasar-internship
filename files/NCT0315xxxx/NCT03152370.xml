  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1b study in participants with locally advanced&#xD;
      rectum cancer where primary resection without chemoradiotherapy is unlikely to achieve clear&#xD;
      margins as defined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is conducted to assess the safety,&#xD;
      to assess the tolerability, and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of E7046 in&#xD;
      combination with pre-operative chemoradiotherapy. The study will also assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      the combination in the expansion part at RP2D.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any other major illness that, in the investigator's judgment, will substantially&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with the participant's participation in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
             are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, Flu-Mist®) are live&#xD;
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;

          -  Females who are breastfeeding or pregnant at Screening or Baseline (as documented by a&#xD;
             negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [β-hCG] test with a minimum sensitivity of&#xD;
             25 International Units per Liter [IU/L] or equivalent units of ß-hCG). A separate&#xD;
             baseline assessment is required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained&#xD;
             more than 72 hours before the first dose of study drug. Females of childbearing&#xD;
             potential (all females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they&#xD;
             are postmenopausal [amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate&#xD;
             age group, and without other known or suspected cause] or have been sterilized&#xD;
             surgically [ie, bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dosing]) who:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Had unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days before study entry and who do&#xD;
                  not agree to use a highly effective method of contraception (eg, true abstinence&#xD;
                  if it is their preferred and usual lifestyle [defined as refraining from&#xD;
                  heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the&#xD;
                  study treatments], an intrauterine device, a contraceptive implant, an oral&#xD;
                  contraceptive, or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia)&#xD;
                  throughout the entire study period and for 6 months after study drug&#xD;
                  discontinuation;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Are not currently abstinent or do not agree to refrain from sexual activity&#xD;
                  during the study period and for 6 months after study drug discontinuation;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Are using hormonal contraceptives but are not on a stable dose of the same&#xD;
                  hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks before dosing and who do not&#xD;
                  agree to use the same contraceptive during the study or for 6 months after study&#xD;
                  drug discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males who have not had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and&#xD;
             their female partners do not meet the criteria above (ie, not of childbearing&#xD;
             potential or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period or&#xD;
             for 6 months after study drug discontinuation)&#xD;
