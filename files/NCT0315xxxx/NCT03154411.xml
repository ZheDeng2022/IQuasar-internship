  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary study objective is to determine if microdoses of ABY-029 (up to 6X) lead to&#xD;
      detectable signals (defined as signal-to-noise ratio, SNR ≥10, with the Odyssey NIR scanner&#xD;
      in sampled tissues with an EGFR pathology score ≥ 1 based on histological staining and&#xD;
      compare SNR to tissues with an EGFR pathology score &lt; 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary study objective is to assess if the spatial patterns of EGFR expression&#xD;
      correlate with the tumor targeting of ABY-029 detection by NIR scanner relative to&#xD;
      histopathology diagnosis, and other indicators (e.g. proliferation, infiltration, etc.) as&#xD;
      the gold standard, and to measure the molecular uptake and concentration of ABY-029 in&#xD;
      resected specimens.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to enroll a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 12 adult patients with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of primary soft-tissue sarcoma in this open label, single center, clinical trial of&#xD;
      ABY-029. The study will enroll patients with an EGFR pathology score ≥ 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial diagnostic biopsy specimens will be analyzed for EGFR positivity by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry following routine diagnostic processing by Pathologist. Patients will be&#xD;
      administered a single intravenous dose of ABY-029 1-3 hours before surgery. Following tumor&#xD;
      excision, the tumor will be transported to the Pathologist and will be inked and sectioned.&#xD;
      Following sectioning the tumor will be imaged using near-infrared imaging systems.&#xD;
      Quantitative measurements of fluorophore concentration will be measured for tumors with EGFR&#xD;
      pathology score ≥ 1 and compared to those with EGFR pathology score &lt; 1. Quantitative mapping&#xD;
      of fluorophore concentration will be correlated with local EGFR concentration and blood&#xD;
      vessel density. Upon specimen analysis, fluorophore measurements will be taken from normal,&#xD;
      marginal tissues (e.g. skeletal muscle, adipose) in addition to the tumor. Average EGFR&#xD;
      concentration and blood vessel density will be determined for each tumor through histological&#xD;
      analysis of sections by routine sarcoma protocol and analysis guided by regional variations&#xD;
      in ABY-029 concentration based upon near-infrared scan results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol is not a safety study since no physiological effects are expected at microdose&#xD;
      levels of ABY-029. No diagnostic or therapeutic intent is proposed, and administration of the&#xD;
      study drug is not intended to alter the extent of planned tumor resection during the surgical&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
