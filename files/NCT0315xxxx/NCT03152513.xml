  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to look at critical events in the pediatric operating room in&#xD;
      a retrospective and now prospective fashion to determine if there are any trends such as age,&#xD;
      presence of URI, type of surgery, type of airway, level of hands on provider, or other&#xD;
      predictive markers associated these events so that we may gain some insight into perhaps&#xD;
      reducing the incidence of these events or simply be more attune to the increased risks in&#xD;
      certain situations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to further characterize these events, determine the incidence in&#xD;
      the operating room, unmask associated issues to improve vigilance, and to look and see if&#xD;
      there are possibly improvements to be made in the investigators care of all pediatric&#xD;
      patients to further reduce the incidence or sequelae of these events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, the investigators want to characterize the details associated with these events. Do&#xD;
      these patients have prolonged PACU stays? How long are these events? Are they mostly&#xD;
      respiratory in nature? What is the average level of desaturation when it occurs. Is it&#xD;
      primarily at the beginning, middle, or end of procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will have a two pronged approach as the investigators have been collecting&#xD;
      prospective observational data already for the QI project looking at this issue using the&#xD;
      data sheet in Appendix 1. The investigators have been collecting this data since April of&#xD;
      2015 to the present. This data needs to be entered into a data base so that it can be&#xD;
      analyzed in greater detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to reviewing the data we have already obtained we would like to begin to collect&#xD;
      data prospectively to add to the data we have already collected. Patients that have already&#xD;
      been collected will assigned a study number based on the chronology of their event will older&#xD;
      event receiving a smaller study ID number and more recent patient receiving a higher study&#xD;
      number. This same sequence will continue into our prospective data base.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Going forward, the investigators will continue the current methodology of having study&#xD;
      personnel who are present in the pediatric operating room respond to stat calls within the&#xD;
      pediatric OR or other pediatric anesthetizing site. The study personnel will assist the&#xD;
      practioner or practioners already present first, and when possible will collect data related&#xD;
      to the event in real time or immediately afterward and enter that on the study data form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will record basic demographic data about the patient including age, weight,&#xD;
      height, presence of URI or Asthma, procedure, surgeon. The investigators will record the time&#xD;
      of the event, duration, significant changes in vital signs, practitioners opinion of&#xD;
      causality if possible, and any therapeutic steps that were instituted such as the&#xD;
      administration of other medications, assistance with breathing, administration of oxygen,&#xD;
      reintubation. This will be documented in the narrative section of the data sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data sheets will then have most data entered on them into a deidentified spread sheet.&#xD;
      A linkage file will be created so that a patient's study ID can be linked to their actual&#xD;
      medical record number in case other information would be necessary or helpful in further&#xD;
      evaluating the &quot;Anesthesia Stat,&quot; event already noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study personnel will also review the narratives of these cases to determine if there are any&#xD;
      common patterns that may not be readily apparent with simple numerical and case data entered&#xD;
      into the database.&#xD;

        Subjects under the age of 18 are included in the study only after an &quot;Anesthesia Stat,&quot; or&#xD;
        overhead call for help has been initiated by the provider in the room or other nursing or&#xD;
        operating room staff involved in that patient's care. Data will only be taken when a member&#xD;
        of the study staff is present which is typically during the week, during the typical OR&#xD;
        day, and not the weekends or late at night.&#xD;
