  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alongside efforts in public health and policy to reverse the childhood obesity epidemic,&#xD;
      medical providers seek to play effective roles in prevention and treatment. Limited&#xD;
      interventional studies with effective long-term maintenance of weight loss in children are&#xD;
      available. Moreover, interventions should focus on modifying lifestyle, by improving also&#xD;
      ludic educational training. In fact, the knowledge, attitudes, behaviors and skills developed&#xD;
      through effective health programs may result in a better quality of life and empower children&#xD;
      to make correct choices to promote the health of the individual the family and the community.&#xD;
      For this reason, in a cohort of obese pediatric subjects with visceral adiposity, the aim of&#xD;
      the study is to assess the efficacy of an educational training inspired to Mediterranean diet&#xD;
      and based on gamification (as &quot;The Mediterranean Goose&quot;) with respect to a conventional&#xD;
      treatment on weight loss and improvement of cardio-metabolic risk factors.&#xD;

      Study design: A single-center pilot open-label randomized control trial. Population: The&#xD;
      study will comprise a total of 60 subjects of both sexes, between 10 and 18 years of age,&#xD;
      obese, according to the IOTF criteria (Cole TJ et al., 2000) and with visceral adiposity, as&#xD;
      waist circumference ≥ 90th percentile (Cook S et al., 2003 - Cruz ML, Goran MI, 2004 - de&#xD;
      Ferranti SD et al., 2004), diet naïve or with failure of weight loss (defined as -1 kg/m2 BMI&#xD;
      in 1 year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/ Exclusion criteria (see Eligibility Criteria). Intervention: Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized in a open-label, into two groups homogeneous for number and sex of the subjects.&#xD;
      One group (group SD) will receive Standard Diet according to routine care and practice, and&#xD;
      one group (group SD+MSD) will receive a standard diet according to routine clinical practice&#xD;
      + a 30 minutes Mediterranean-Style Diet educational training with explanation of&#xD;
      Mediterranean pyramid + gamification to Mediterranean diet inside the Hospital and at home&#xD;
      throughout &quot;The Mediterranean Goose&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary restriction: Thestandard diet will be distributed with 55-60% of carbohydrates&#xD;
      (45-50% complex and no more than 10% refined and processed sugars), 25-30% lipids and 15%&#xD;
      proteins, and will be performedin accordance with the calories of an isocaloric balanced diet&#xD;
      calculated throughout the Italian LARN Guidelines for age and gender (Società Italiana di&#xD;
      Nutrizione Umana, 2014), inspired to Mediterranean pyramid.The standard diet will be given as&#xD;
      diet plans in writing, after explanation by a well-trained and experienced clinical&#xD;
      paediatric endocrinologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Education in Hospital: As well as receiving the aforementioned recommendations, the SD+MSD&#xD;
      group will also receive a simple visual guide of Mediterranean food pyramid explained by a&#xD;
      dietitian/nutritionist for 30 minutes (Bach-Faig A et al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gamification: The MSD Group will be involved inside the Hospital in an educational and&#xD;
      playful training playing to &quot;The Mediterranean Goose&quot; in the ludic area of the Pediatric&#xD;
      Department; this game has been proposed in an educational project known as &quot;Mediterranean&#xD;
      diet and enhancement of traditional foodstuff - MedDiet&quot;, founded by European Union in the&#xD;
      framework of the ENPI CBC Mediterranean Sea Basin Programme (www.med-diet.eu). This material&#xD;
      will be given to the family for continue to play also at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity: all subjects will receive general recommendations about performing&#xD;
      physical activity. Exercise will be conducted daily and will consist of 30 minutes of aerobic&#xD;
      physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Alternately per week, participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 to one&#xD;
      of the two dietary intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing: Patients will be evaluated firstly at time of enrollment (V0) and, during the first 2&#xD;
      weeks of study (V1), biochemical and ultrasound evaluations will be completed. During the&#xD;
      year of intervention, patients will be evaluated after 3 months, 6 months and 12 months (V2,&#xD;
      V3, V4).The following anthropometric measures, biochemical and ultrasound evaluations and&#xD;
      questionnaires will be obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anthropometric measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  height (V0, V2, V3, V4);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  weight (V0, V2, V3, V4);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  body mass index (BMI; Kg/m2) (V0, V2, V3, V4);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  waist and hip circumferences (V0, V2, V3, V4) for the calculation of the following&#xD;
                ratios: waist/hip, waist/height;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tanner stage (V0, V2, V3, V4) (Tanner JM, 1961);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  blood pressure and heart rate (V0, V2, V3, V4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Biochemical evaluations (after a 12-h overnight fast): CBC with formula, serum&#xD;
           insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1, ng/mL), 25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D (ng/mL), uric acid&#xD;
           (mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase (U/L), ACTH (pg/mL), cortisol (microg/dL), TSH (uuI/mL),&#xD;
           fT4 (ng/dL) (V1, V3, V4); aspartate aminotransferase (AST, IU/L), alanine&#xD;
           aminotransferase (ALT, IU/L); AST-to-ALT ratio will be calculated as the ratio of AST&#xD;
           (IU/L) and ALT(IU/L)(V1, V3, V4); serum creatinine concentration (mg/dL) will be&#xD;
           measured with the enzymatic method; according to the NKF-K/DOQI Guidelines for CKD in&#xD;
           children and adolescents (Hogg RJ et al., 2003), the eGFR will be calculated using&#xD;
           updated Schwartz's formula (Schwartz GJ et al., 2009): eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = [0.413 x&#xD;
           patient's height (cm)] / serum creatinine (mg/dL)(V1, V3, V4); glucose (mg/dL), insulin&#xD;
           (μUI/mL); insulin-resistance (IR) will be calculated using the formula of Homeostasis&#xD;
           Model Assessment (HOMA)-IR: (insulin [mU/L] x glucose [mmol/lL) / 22.5)(V1, V3, V4);&#xD;
           lipid profile: total cholesterol (mg/dL), High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol&#xD;
           (mg/dL), triglycerides (mg/dL); Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol will be&#xD;
           calculated by the Friedwald formula and non-HDL (nHDL)-cholesterol will be also&#xD;
           calculated(V1, V3, V4); oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT: 1.75 g of glucose solution&#xD;
           per kg, maximum 75 g) and samples willbe collected for the determination of glucose and&#xD;
           insulin every 30 min. The area under the curve (AUC) for parameters after OGTT will be&#xD;
           calculated according to the trapezoidal rule. Insulin sensitivity at fasting and during&#xD;
           OGTT will be calculated as the formula of the Quantitative Insulin-Sensitivity Check&#xD;
           Index (QUICKI) and Matsuda index (ISI). The stimulus for insulin secretion in the&#xD;
           increment in plasma glucose as insulinogenic index will be calculated as the ratio of&#xD;
           the changes in insulin and glucose concentration from 0 to 30 min (InsI). Βeta-cell&#xD;
           compensatory capacity will be evaluated by the disposition index defined as the product&#xD;
           of the ISI and InsI (DI) (Kahn SE et al., 1993)(V1, V4); a collection at rest of&#xD;
           first-morning urine sample. Physical and chemical urinalysis; urine albumin (mg/L) will&#xD;
           be determined by an advanced immunoturbidimetric assay and urine creatinine (mg/dL) will&#xD;
           be measured using the enzymatic method. Urine albumin to creatinine ratio (u-ACR -&#xD;
           mg/g), will be calculated using the following formula: [urine albumin (mg/dL) / urine&#xD;
           creatinine (mg/dL)] x 1000. For these calculations both albumin and creatinine will be&#xD;
           in the same unit. The subjects whose urine will be found positive, they will undergo a&#xD;
           collection of two more samples and will be considered the u-ACR mean value of these (V1,&#xD;
           V3, V4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ultrasound evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  liver ultrasound(V1, V4);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  echocardiography and carotid sonography(V1, V4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Nutritional and physical activity measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  KIDMED questionnaire for children and adolescents; the index comprises 16 yes or no&#xD;
                questions (Serra-Majem L et al., 2004), and the total score of the KIDMED index&#xD;
                ranged from -4 to 12 and is classified into 3 levels: 1)≥8: optimal Mediterranean&#xD;
                diet; 2) 4-7: improvement is needed to adjust intake to the Mediterranean diet; 3)&#xD;
                ≤3: very low diet quality; the Italian version is reported and approved by Istituto&#xD;
                Superiore Sanità in Rapporti ISTISAN 12/42(Istituto Superiore della Sanità,&#xD;
                Rapporti ISTISAN 12/42, 2012)(V0, V2, V3, V4);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the Food Frequency Questionnaire section of the Children's Eating Habits&#xD;
                Questionnaire (CEHQ-FFQ), performed by Identification and prevention of Dietary and&#xD;
                lifestyle-induced health Effects In Children and infantS (IDEFICS) study, on which&#xD;
                parents or other caregivers will be asked to report the number of meals the&#xD;
                children usually consumed at home or at other people's homes, such as of&#xD;
                grandparents and friends, in a typical week of the previous month (Huybrechts I et&#xD;
                al., 2011) (V0, V2, V3, V4);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  24-hour recall and a list of all foods and constituents included in the Dietary&#xD;
                Inflammatory Index (DII) along with the respective adjusted score will be&#xD;
                evaluated. Food- and constituent-specific scores will be multiplied by the intake&#xD;
                for each subject. and then will be summed to create the overall Inflammatory Index&#xD;
                score (Cavicchia PP et al., 2009 - Shivappa N et al., 2014) (V0, V2, V3, V4);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the Mediterranean Adequacy Index (MAI) will be obtained by dividing the sum of the&#xD;
                percentage of total energy from typical Mediterranean food groups by the sum of the&#xD;
                percentage of total energy from non-typical Mediterranean food groups, according to&#xD;
                the following equation (Alberti-Fidanza A, Fidanza F, 2004) (V0, V2, V3, V4);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) developed, validated for&#xD;
                Italian adolescents (IPAQ-A) will be developed; It covers four domains of physical&#xD;
                activity: (1) school-related physical activity, including activity during physical&#xD;
                education classes and breaks, (2) transportation, (3) housework and (4) leisure&#xD;
                time (Hagstromer M et al., 2008 - Mannocci A et al, Accepted to Minerva Pediatrica)&#xD;
                (V0, V2, V3, V4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes (see Outcome Measures). Information retrieval: A case report form (CRF) will be&#xD;
      completed for each subject included in the study. The source documents will be the hospital's&#xD;
      or the physician's chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical e sample size: A sample of 60 individuals (30 in each group) has been estimated&#xD;
      to be sufficient to demonstrate a difference of 0.4kg/m2 in BMISDS with a SD of 0.65 (Prodam&#xD;
      F et al, 2013) with 90% power and a significance level of 95% and a drop-out rate of 20%&#xD;
      using the Student test. Statistical significance will be assumed at P&lt; 0.05. The statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be performed with SPSS for Windows version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organization characteristics: The study will be conducted at the Pediatric Endocrine Service&#xD;
      of Division of Pediatrics, Department of Health Sciences, University of Piemonte Orientale,&#xD;
      in Novara.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blood samples will be measured evaluated using standardized methods in the Hospital's&#xD;
      Chemistry Laboratory, previously described (Prodam F et al., 2014 - Prodam F et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice: The protocol will be conducted in accordance with the declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki. Informed consent will be obtained from all parents prior to the evaluations after&#xD;
      careful explanations to each patient.&#xD;
