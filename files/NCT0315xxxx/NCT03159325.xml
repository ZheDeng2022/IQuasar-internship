  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart disease is a leading cause of death and disability in Canada. Providing social and peer&#xD;
      supports has been proven to help patients manage their health and stay out of the hospital.&#xD;
      The use of telehealth has opened up a wider possibility of patients receiving peer support&#xD;
      while staying in their homes and communities. The investigators plan to study a new&#xD;
      application for supporting patients through peer support. The application can be accessed by&#xD;
      smartphone, tablet and desktop/laptop computer. Over two years, the investigators anticipate&#xD;
      that the application (Healing Circles) will improve patient self care and reduce&#xD;
      hospitalizations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death and disability in Canada costing&#xD;
      $22.2 billion annually in health care costs and lost productivity. Cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
      are complex conditions that afflict older adults more so than any other population. As CVD is&#xD;
      a chronic condition, many patients live with their disease and are affected by it on a daily&#xD;
      basis in their homes and communities. Unfortunately, many patients 'suffer' in isolation. It&#xD;
      is well-accepted that patient self-management plays a key role in improving patient health&#xD;
      and reducing hospital admissions. Social and peer support, as well as timely access to&#xD;
      credible information on managing CVD are essential for patient self-management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there is a growing understanding that patients with CVD benefit from being actively&#xD;
      engaged in their own care, questions remain as to where and how self management support&#xD;
      should be delivered. Integration of self-management programs within the health care system&#xD;
      has been a challenge due to the system emphasis on the management of acute and episodic&#xD;
      conditions rather than the less intense and more drawn-out patient interactions&#xD;
      characteristic of chronic conditions. Clearly alternatives are needed to support patient&#xD;
      self-management and reduce needless hospital admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rise in technology and telecommunications has opened up an array of possibilities for&#xD;
      patients to be connected to their health while remaining in their homes and community.&#xD;
      Outside of the health care sector, peer support and social networking have seen tremendous&#xD;
      growth through the use of telecommunications. The value of these networks to improving health&#xD;
      and self-management, however, has not been robustly studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through an existing partnership between university-based researchers, industry (Curatio),&#xD;
      decision-makers (Vancouver Coastal Health), clinicians and patients the investigators have&#xD;
      developed a peer support and self-management platform called Healing Circles. The&#xD;
      investigator's 10-week pilot study of Healing Circles in patients with ischemic heart disease&#xD;
      demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability, and resulted in key improvements to social&#xD;
      support and self-management, as well as demonstrated ease of use of the application itself.&#xD;
      The current proposal represents the next phase in our program to scale-up and spread the use&#xD;
      of Healing Circles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that patients with CVD using the Healing Circles platform will have&#xD;
      improved self-management skills compared to patients receiving usual care. Secondary&#xD;
      hypotheses are that participation in Healing Circles application will improve quality of life&#xD;
      and health service use (and associated costs). Outcomes of end-user perceptions, attitudes&#xD;
      and satisfaction with the platform will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (n=250) will be recruited through cardiology and cardiac outpatient clinics in&#xD;
      Greater Vancouver, as well as through community presentations and mailouts. Patients with&#xD;
      documented CVD, who have regular access to a device that supports Healing Circles (computer,&#xD;
      tablet or smartphone) will be randomized to either the Healing Circles application or usual&#xD;
      care and followed for up to a 2.5 year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healing Circles participants will form 'Circles' with 8 to 10 other participants to connect&#xD;
      with and support one another as they learn to live day-to-day with their CVD. Patients also&#xD;
      have the ability to connect and engage all members of the wider Healing Circles community.&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that participation in Healing Circles will support patient&#xD;
      self-management for patients in their homes resulting in reduced need for health care and&#xD;
      hospital use.&#xD;
