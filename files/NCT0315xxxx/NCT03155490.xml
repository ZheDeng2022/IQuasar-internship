      Brief Summary: Trauma is a major public health burden; it is the fifth most common cause of&#xD;
      mortality overall in the US and accounts for the majority of deaths in patients younger than&#xD;
      45. Trauma resuscitations present unique patient care challenges due to the need to perform&#xD;
      complex tasks under uncertain and time-pressured conditions. It is not entirely surprising&#xD;
      that one-third to one-half of trauma patient-related errors occurred in emergency departments&#xD;
      during the initial resuscitation period. Effective team leadership can enhance teamwork and&#xD;
      team adaptability, thus improving teams' ability to handle unexpected and rapidly changing&#xD;
      situations. Simulation-based training provides a clinically relevant practice environment&#xD;
      that has been recommended for team and team leader training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the impact of simulation-based leadership&#xD;
      training on clinical teamwork, team leadership and patient care. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that team leadership training will improve team leadership, teamwork, and&#xD;
      critical patient care events during actual trauma resuscitations.&#xD;

      Detailed Description: This study will implement an individual randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
      Eligible trainee subjects (second or third year emergency medicine or general surgery&#xD;
      residents) will be randomized within each month in a 1:1 proportion to either the&#xD;
      intervention (team leadership training) or control (no training) conditions. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized each month to ensure that outcomes are not biased by opportunities for concurrent&#xD;
      learning throughout the residency year. The primary outcome is team leadership during actual&#xD;
      trauma resuscitations. The secondary outcome is patient care during actual trauma&#xD;
      resuscitations. Primary hypotheses include that the intervention group will demonstrate&#xD;
      improved leadership (H1) and patient care (H2) during actual trauma resuscitations. The&#xD;
      investigators will collect baseline data (pre-intervention, first 2 weeks of the month) and&#xD;
      post-intervention/control data (last 2 weeks of the month).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Condition: Subjects randomized to the control condition will receive a standard&#xD;
      orientation to the trauma team leader role at the start of their month in the ED. This&#xD;
      orientation involves review of key administrative information, including departmental policy&#xD;
      on chart completion, attendance policy, and available resources. No further formal trauma or&#xD;
      team leader training will be provided for the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Condition: Subjects randomized to the intervention arm of the study will also&#xD;
      receive the standard orientation to the trauma leader role at the start of their trauma&#xD;
      leader month in the ED. The study coordinator will then schedule these subjects for the&#xD;
      leadership training intervention to start 11-13 days after the start of the rotation.&#xD;
      Subjects will attend a session where they will complete the demonstration-based training and&#xD;
      simulation-based training (simulation + debriefing + additional practice, 4 hours total)&#xD;
      curriculum. A Laerdal SimMan 3G patient simulator and trained confederates (team members)&#xD;
      will operationalize the resuscitation scenario. The investigators will record all simulations&#xD;
      to allow for video-assisted debriefing and opportunity for self-reflection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trauma resuscitations will take place at Harborview Medical Center, an urban, tertiary care&#xD;
      center affiliated with the University of Washington Medical Center that serves as the sole&#xD;
      trauma center for a 5-state region (AK, WA, WY, MT, ID). Dedicated trauma resuscitation bays&#xD;
      are equipped for all levels of trauma resuscitations. Data collection during clinical&#xD;
      assessments will involve video recording of ongoing trauma resuscitations within two&#xD;
      resuscitation bays. All patients presenting to the ED with a trauma-related complaint will be&#xD;
      screened using inclusion and exclusion criteria (below). Criteria were chosen to ensure a&#xD;
      broad representation of trauma patient care and adequate opportunity to observe team leader&#xD;
      behaviors. Certain exclusion criteria (c-g) were selected to try to identify those patients&#xD;
      with near 100% mortality or those inappropriate for resuscitative efforts. Additionally,&#xD;
      pediatric and pregnant patients will be excluded as their team composition differs markedly&#xD;
      from those involved in standard adult trauma resuscitations. Criteria will be further honed&#xD;
      and tested prior to data collection to ensure eligible resuscitations are reliably identified&#xD;
      and appropriate for the proposed research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures Primary Outcome: Team leadership Trained raters will code video recordings of actual&#xD;
      trauma resuscitations using a team leadership rating scale that will produce a single&#xD;
      leadership score for each resuscitation. Raters will be blinded to study arm and will have no&#xD;
      prior history of interaction with the subject as a physician provider. Leadership rating&#xD;
      dimensions will be summed and averaged to create a reliable overall indicator for each trauma&#xD;
      case. Aggregation of the multiple trauma case assessments is necessary to both create&#xD;
      reliable indicators across trauma cases and to align the level of the data with the unit of&#xD;
      observation and the level of analysis (i.e., the subject team leader).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome: Patient care Trained raters will code video recordings of actual trauma&#xD;
      resuscitations using a patient care rating scale that will produce a single patient care&#xD;
      score for each resuscitation. Raters coding patient care will be distinct from those coding&#xD;
      team leadership to minimize bias. Raters will be blinded to study arm and will have no prior&#xD;
      history of interaction with the subject as a physician provider. Patient care rating&#xD;
      dimensions will be summed and averaged to create a reliable overall indicator for each trauma&#xD;
      case. Aggregation of the multiple trauma case assessments is necessary to both create&#xD;
      reliable indicators across trauma cases and to align the level of the data with the unit of&#xD;
      observation and the level of analysis (i.e., the subject team leader).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Outcomes (Pilot) are defined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis (Data Preparation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leadership and patient care rating dimensions will be summed and averaged to create a&#xD;
      reliable overall indicator for each primary dependent variable for each trauma case. The&#xD;
      sub-dimension ratings for each factor are on the same metric, so the combination of the&#xD;
      rating dimensions into an overall composite indicator is straightforward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control composites for the subject (team leader) and patient will be examined. The&#xD;
      investigators will first determine whether candidate control variables are associated with&#xD;
      the primary criteria. Those candidate control variables that significantly relate to&#xD;
      leadership behavior or patient care will be retained as controls. For retained variables, the&#xD;
      investigators will first transform the raw control variable metrics into standardized scores&#xD;
      to equalize their means and standard deviations. The standardized indicators will then be&#xD;
      summed and averaged to compute control composites for the subject (team leader) and patient.&#xD;
      Aggregation of the multiple trauma case assessments and controls (patient) is necessary to&#xD;
      both create reliable indicators across trauma cases and to align the level of the data with&#xD;
      the unit of observation and the level of analysis (i.e., the subject team leader).&#xD;
      Aggregation of the patient outcome assessments will be accomplished by summing and averaging&#xD;
      the pre- and post-interventions separately. Aggregation of the patient controls will be&#xD;
      accomplished by summing and averaging the patient control composites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to provide univariate summaries of the basic&#xD;
      characteristics of the team leader subjects and patients. These summaries will also be used&#xD;
      to identify outliers and to determine if randomization resulted in the composition of study&#xD;
      groups with similar characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis (Primary and Secondary Outcomes) With the data prepared and aligned to the unit of&#xD;
      observation, the experimental design is structured as a fixed effects two-condition pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention model. The analyses will contrast an intervention group receiving&#xD;
      leadership training with a control group receiving no training, controlling for relevant&#xD;
      subject (team leader) and patient factors and for pre-intervention subject performance. To&#xD;
      provide a measure of control for the overall Type I experiment-wise rate the investigators&#xD;
      will first conduct a Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) that will assess the&#xD;
      significant effect of training condition on the set of dependent variables (leadership and&#xD;
      patient care). A significant effect at the designated alpha level (.05), will trigger follow&#xD;
      up univariate analyses for each hypothesis (i.e., dependent variable) using Analysis of&#xD;
      Covariance (ANCOVA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was powered to address the impact of leadership training on leadership. The ability&#xD;
      to detect significant effects in an experiment depends on the target level of statistical&#xD;
      significance (alpha), sample size, and effect sizes of the experimental treatments. Given&#xD;
      that our research foci are innovative, estimating anticipated effect sizes represents the&#xD;
      major challenge for conducting a power analysis. A meta-analysis of leadership&#xD;
      training/development programs was consulted to estimate the effect size for leadership&#xD;
      training. Based on 35 studies with a total sample size of 3389, a mean effect size (Cohen's&#xD;
      d, corrected for sampling error and measurement error) of .65 was found for leadership&#xD;
      training and all outcome criteria. Using this effect size, a power analysis indicated a&#xD;
      sample size of 60 (30 per condition) would provide .80 power in detecting true effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot Outcome Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linkage: Assessed as the proportion of patients treated by study subjects (control and&#xD;
      intervention groups) linked to vital status at discharge after traumatic injury. Assessed&#xD;
      will be proportions linked to each of these groups as well as overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim Analyses: As this is a feasibility study to characterize linkage, there will be no&#xD;
      formal interim analyses that would allow stopping the study for either efficacy or futility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Analyses: The linkage rate will be summarized as a binomial proportion. Secondary&#xD;
      measures will be summarized descriptively, as recommended for pilot studies. Sample Size: A&#xD;
      sample size of 160 eligible patients will allow estimation of linkage from simulation&#xD;
      intervention to hospital outcome with a precision (as measured by half-width of 95% CI) of&#xD;
      7.7%.&#xD;
