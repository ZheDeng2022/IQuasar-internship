  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of guselkumab in participants with active PsA who are biologically naive and&#xD;
      have had inadequate response to standard therapies. It will evaluate the clinical efficacy of&#xD;
      guselkumab in the reduction of signs and symptoms, structural damage inhibition and the&#xD;
      safety profile of guselkumab in the treatment of PsA. The study will consist of a screening&#xD;
      phase (up to 6 weeks), a blinded treatment phase (approximately 100 weeks) including a&#xD;
      placebo controlled period from Week 0 to Week 24 and an active treatment period from Week 24&#xD;
      to Week 100 and a safety follow-up phase of 12 weeks after the last administration of study&#xD;
      agent. Efficacy, health economics, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, biomarker and&#xD;
      pharmacogenomics evaluations will be performed in the study at defined schedule.&#xD;

Joint erosion score is the summary of erosion severity in 40 joints of hand scored according to the surface area, from 0 (no erosion) to 5 (complete collapse of bone) and 12 joints of 2 feet (each side of the foot joint is graded on same 0-5 scale, thus maximum erosion score for a foot joint is 10), for a maximum erosion score of 320. JSN score is the total JSN score in same 52 joints as above, each joint scored according to the subluxation from 0 (normal) to 4 (bony ankylosis or complete luxation), for a maximum JSN score of 208. Total score ranges from 0 (best) to 528 (worst = worst possible erosion score of 320 + worst possible JSN score of 208). Higher score indicates more joint damage. Positive changes from baseline in the modified vdH-S total, erosion and JSN scores indicate progression of joint damage.</description>

EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each has 5 levels of perceived problems (1-no problem, 2-slight problems, 3-moderate problems, 4-severe problems, 5-extreme problems). Participant selects answer for each of 5 dimensions considering response that best matches his/her health &quot;today&quot;. Responses were used to generate a weighted summary index (EQ-5D index), which ranges from 0 (dead) to 1.00 (full health). A higher score indicates better health and positive changes from baseline indicate improvement of health.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI score assess functional status of participant. It is 20 question instrument that assess degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area were scored from 0=indicating no difficulty, to 3=indicating inability to perform a task in that area. Total HAQ score is average of the computed categories scores ranging from 0-3 where 0=least difficulty and 3=extreme difficulty. Lower scores are indicative of better functioning. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement of physical function.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Modified Van Der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>Modified vdH-S score is the sum of the erosion score (hand, feet) and joint space narrowing (JSN) score (hand, feet). Joint erosion score is the summary of erosion severity in 40 joints of hand scored according to the surface area, from 0 (no erosion) to 5 (complete collapse of bone) and 12 joints of 2 feet (each side of the foot joint is graded on same 0-5 scale, thus maximum erosion score for a foot joint is 10), for a maximum erosion score of 320. JSN score is the total JSN score in same 52 joints as above, each joint scored according to the subluxation from 0 (normal) to 4 (bony ankylosis or complete luxation), for a maximum JSN score of 208. Total score ranges from 0 (best) to 528 (worst = worst possible erosion score of 320 + worst possible JSN score of 208). Higher score indicates more joint damage. Positive changes from baseline in the modified vdH-S total, erosion and JSN scores indicate progression of joint damage.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Resolution of Enthesitis at Week 24 Among the Participants With Enthesitis at Baseline</title>
        <description>Enthesitis was assessed using the Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI), a tool developed to assess enthesitis in participants with PsA and evaluates the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of pain by applying local pressure to the following entheses: left and right lateral epicondyle humerus, left and right medial femoral condyle, and left and right achilles tendon insertion. The enthesitis index score is a total score of the 6 evaluated sites from 0 (0 sites with tenderness) to 6 (worst possible score; 6 sites with tenderness). A LEI score of 0 at a post baseline visit indicates resolution of enthesitis when baseline LEI&gt;0. The outcome measure was planned to be reported for pooled population from CNTO1959PSA3001 and CNTO1959PSA3002 studies.</description>

        <description>The presence and severity of dactylitis was assessed in both hands and feet using a scoring system from 0 to 3 (0-no dactylitis, 1-mild dactylitis, 2-moderate dactylitis, and 3-severe dactylitis) for each digit. The results were summed to produce a final score ranging from 0 to 60. Higher score indicates more severe dactylitis. Resolution of dactylitis was defined as a dactylitis score of 0 with the baseline dactylitis score &gt;0. The outcome measure was planned to be reported for pooled population from CNTO1959PSA3001 and CNTO1959PSA3002 studies.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Enthesitis Score (Based on LEI) at Week 24 Among the Participants With Enthesitis at Baseline</title>
        <description>Enthesitis was assessed using the LEI, a tool developed to assess enthesitis in participants with PsA and evaluates the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of pain by applying local pressure to the following entheses: left and right lateral epicondyle humerus, left and right medial femoral condyle, and left and right achilles tendon insertion. The enthesitis index score is a total score of the 6 evaluated sites from 0 (0 sites with tenderness) to 6 (worst possible score; 6 sites with tenderness). Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of enthesitis. The outcome measure was planned to be reported for pooled population from CNTO1959PSA3001 and CNTO1959PSA3002 studies.</description>

        <description>SF-36 is a multi-domain instrument with 36 items to evaluate the health status and quality of life. It included 8 subscales (physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental health), which yielded a Physical Component Summary (PCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) in addition to subscale scores. The PCS scores are normalized to a mean of 50 and standard deviations of 10, based upon general US population norms. A positive change indicates improvement while a negative change indicates worsening of health status and quality of life.</description>

          <description>SF-36 is a multi-domain instrument with 36 items to evaluate the health status and quality of life. It included 8 subscales (physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental health), which yielded a Physical Component Summary (PCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) in addition to subscale scores. The PCS scores are normalized to a mean of 50 and standard deviations of 10, based upon general US population norms. A positive change indicates improvement while a negative change indicates worsening of health status and quality of life.</description>

        <description>The Disease Activity Index Score (DAS28) based on C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is an index combining tender joints (28 joints), swollen joints (28 joints), CRP and patient's global assessment of disease activity. The set of 28 joint count is based on evaluation of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) MCP1 to MCP5, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) PIP1 to PIP5 joints of both the upper right extremity and the upper left extremity as well as the knee joints of lower right and lower left extremities. The values are 0=best to 10=worst. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of arthritis.</description>

          <description>ACR components include swollen joint count (66 joints), tender joint count (68 joints), patient's assessment of pain using visual analog scale (VAS; 0-100 mm, 0=no pain and 100=worst possible pain), patient's global assessment (PtGA) of disease activity (arthritis, VAS; 0-100 mm, 0=excellent and 100= poor), physician's global assessment (PGA) of disease activity (VAS; 0-100 mm, 0=no arthritis activity and 100=extremely active arthritis), patient's assessment of physical function measured by Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ-DI; a 20-question instrument assessing 8 functional areas; range: 0-3, 0=no difficulty, 3=inability to perform a task in that area), and CRP.</description>
          <population>Analysis population is FAS1. Here 'n' (number analyzed) signifies number of participants with observed data regardless meeting TF criteria at specified categories.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI Score at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI score assess functional status of participant. It is a 20 question instrument that assess the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area were scored from 0=indicating no difficulty, to 3=indicating inability to perform a task in that area. Total HAQ score is average of the computed categories scores ranging from 0-3 where 0=least difficulty and 3=extreme difficulty. Lower scores are indicative of better functioning. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of physical function.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved &gt;=0.35 Improvement From Baseline in HAQ-DI Score Through Week 24 Among Participants With HAQ-DI Score &gt;=0.35 at Baseline</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI score assess functional status of participant. It is a 20 question instrument that assess the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area were scored from 0=indicating no difficulty, to 3=indicating inability to perform a task in that area. Total HAQ score is average of the computed categories scores ranging from 0-3, where 0=least difficulty and 3=extreme difficulty. Lower scores are indicative of better functioning and a decrease of 0.35 from baseline in HAQ-DI score indicates a meaningful improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a DAS28 (CRP) Response Through Week 24</title>
        <description>DAS28 based on CRP is an index combining tender joints (28 joints), swollen joints (28 joints), CRP and patient's global assessment of disease activity. The set of 28 joint count is based on evaluation of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) MCP1 to MCP5, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) PIP1 to PIP5 joints of both the upper right extremity and the upper left extremity as well as the knee joints of lower right and lower left extremities. DAS 28 (CRP) response criteria was defined as follows: Good response: &lt;=3.2 at visit and &gt;1.2 improvement; Moderate response: &gt;3.2 at visit and &gt;1.2 improvement or &lt;=5.1 at visit and &gt;0.6-1.2 improvement; No response: &lt;=0.6 improvement, or &gt;5.1 at visit and &lt;=1.2 improvement. The values are 0=best to 10=worst. A DAS28 (CRP) responder is defined as achieving a good or moderate DAS28 response at a specific visit.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a DAS28 (CRP) Remission Through Week 24</title>
        <description>DAS28 based on CRP is an index combining tender joints (28 joints), swollen joints (28 joints), CRP and patient's global assessment of disease activity. The set of 28 joint count is based on evaluation of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) MCP1 to MCP5, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) PIP1 to PIP5 joints of both the upper right extremity and the upper left extremity as well as the knee joints of lower right and lower left extremities. The values are 0=best to 10=worst. DAS 28 (CRP) remission was defined as DAS 28 (CRP) value &lt;2.6 at the analysis visit.</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis population is FAS1. Participants who achieved a DAS28 (CRP) remission at a specific time point and did not meet any TF criteria before, were considered as responders at that time point. Participants who met 1 or more TF criteria before or with missing data at that time point were considered as non-responders.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Resolution of Enthesitis Through Week 24 Among the Participants With Enthesitis at Baseline</title>
        <description>Enthesitis was assessed using the LEI, a tool developed to assess enthesitis in participants with PsA and evaluates the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of pain by applying local pressure to the following entheses: left and right lateral epicondyle humerus, left and right medial femoral condyle, and left and right achilles tendon insertion. The enthesitis index score is a total score of the 6 evaluated sites from 0 (0 sites with tenderness) to 6 (worst possible score; 6 sites with tenderness). A LEI score of 0 at a post baseline visit indicates resolution of enthesitis when baseline LEI&gt;0.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Resolution of Dactylitis Through Week 24 Among the Participants With Dactylitis at Baseline</title>
        <description>The presence and severity of dactylitis was assessed in both hands and feet using a scoring system from 0 to 3 (0-no dactylitis, 1-mild dactylitis, 2-moderate dactylitis, and 3-severe dactylitis) for each digit. The results were summed to produce a final score ranging from 0 to 60. Higher score indicates more severe dactylitis. Resolution of dactylitis was defined as a dactylitis score of 0 with the baseline dactylitis score &gt;0.</description>

          <description>The presence and severity of dactylitis was assessed in both hands and feet using a scoring system from 0 to 3 (0-no dactylitis, 1-mild dactylitis, 2-moderate dactylitis, and 3-severe dactylitis) for each digit. The results were summed to produce a final score ranging from 0 to 60. Higher score indicates more severe dactylitis. Resolution of dactylitis was defined as a dactylitis score of 0 with the baseline dactylitis score &gt;0.</description>
          <population>FAS1 among participants with dactylitis at baseline. Participants who achieved dactylitis resolution at specific time point and did not meet any TF criteria before, were considered as responders at that time point. Participants who met 1 or more TF criteria before or with missing data at that time point were considered as non-responders.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Enthesitis Score (Based on LEI) at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 Among the Participants With Enthesitis at Baseline</title>
        <description>Enthesitis was assessed using the LEI, a tool developed to assess enthesitis in participants with PsA and evaluates the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of pain by applying local pressure to the following entheses: left and right lateral epicondyle humerus, left and right medial femoral condyle, and left and right achilles tendon insertion. The enthesitis index score is a total score of the 6 evaluated sites from 0 (0 sites with tenderness) to 6 (worst possible score; 6 sites with tenderness). Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of enthesitis.</description>

        <population>Analysis population is FAS1 among participants with enthesitis at baseline. Data after meeting 1 or more TF criteria were imputed as no change from baseline. Missing data were assumed missing at random and imputed using multiple imputation.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Psoriatic Arthritis Disease Activity Score (PASDAS) at Weeks 8, 16 and 24</title>
        <description>PASDAS (score range of 0 to 10, where higher score indicated more severe disease) is a compositive score of overall disease activity combining Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (arthritis and psoriasis, using VAS [0-100 mm, 0=excellent and 100= poor), Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (using VAS [0-100 mm, 0=no arthritis activity and 100=extremely active arthritis]), swollen joint count (0-66 joints), tender joint count (0-68 joints), CRP (mg/L), enthesitis based on LEI (0-6), tender dactylitis count (scoring each digit from 0-3 and recoding to 0-1, where any score &gt; 0 equaled 1), and the PCS score of the SF-36 health survey. The cutoffs for disease activity were 3.2 (low) to 5.4 (high). Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of overall disease activity.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 8, 16 and 24</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis population is FAS1. Data after meeting 1 or more TF criteria were imputed as no change from baseline. Missing data were assumed missing at random. The LS mean is based on Mixed-effect repeated measures (MMRM) model that included data from all visits for all participants included in the model.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Scores (Percent Work Time Missed) at Weeks 16 and 24</title>
        <description>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment was assessed using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire - Specific Health Problem (WPAI-SHP) of PsA (WPA-PsA). The WPAI-PsA consisted of 6 questions to determine employment status, hours missed from work due to PsA, hours missed from work for other reasons, hours actually worked, the degree to which PsA affected work productivity while at work and the degree to which PsA affected activities outside of work during the past 7 days. WPAI outcomes included percent work time missed due to PsA, percent impairment while working due to PsA, percent overall work impairment due to PsA, and percent activity impairment outside of work due to PsA. These WPAI outcomes were expressed as impairment percentages (0-100, 0=no impairment and 100=100% impaired), with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of work productivity and activity impairment.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Scores (Percent Impairment While Working) at Weeks 16 and 24</title>
          <description>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment was assessed using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire - Specific Health Problem (WPAI-SHP) of PsA (WPA-PsA). The WPAI-PsA consisted of 6 questions to determine employment status, hours missed from work due to PsA, hours missed from work for other reasons, hours actually worked, the degree to which PsA affected work productivity while at work and the degree to which PsA affected activities outside of work during the past 7 days. WPAI outcomes included percent work time missed due to PsA, percent impairment while working due to PsA, percent overall work impairment due to PsA, and percent activity impairment outside of work due to PsA. These WPAI outcomes were expressed as impairment percentages (0-100, 0=no impairment and 100=100% impaired), with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of work productivity and activity impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Modified Composite Psoriatic Disease Activity Index (mCPDAI) Score at Week 16 and 24</title>
        <description>The mCPDAI assessed 4 domains (joints, skin, entheses, and dactylitis). The mCPDAI scores were calculated using the following assessments: joints (66 swollen and 68 tender joint counts), HAQ-DI score, PASI, dactylitis, and enthesitis. Within each domain a score (range 0-3) was assigned, where 0= Not involved, 1= Mild, 2= Moderate and 3= Severe. The scores for each domain were then added together to give a final score range of 0 to 12. A higher score indicates more active disease activity. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of PsA disease activity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA) at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24</title>
        <description>DAPSA assessed the joint domain of PsA and was derived from the sum of the following components: tender joint count (0-68), swollen joint count (0-66), CRP level (mg/dL, value &lt;lower limit of quantification [LLOQ] is considered equal to half of the value of LLOQ for numerical calculations), patient assessment of pain (0-10cm VAS, 0=no pain, 10=worst possible pain), and patient's global assessment of disease activity on arthritis (0 to 10cm VAS, 0=excellent and 10=poor). A higher score indicates more active disease activity. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement of PsA disease activity. The assessment does not have a score range with an upper or lower bound.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis population is FAS1. Data after meeting 1 or more TF criteria were imputed as no change from baseline. Missing data were assumed missing at random. The LS mean is based on MMRM model that included data from all visits for all participants included in the model.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Minimal Disease Activity (MDA) Criteria Through Week 24</title>
        <description>MDA is a measure that defines a satisfactory state of disease activity that includes the 5 domains of PsA (joint symptoms, skin psoriasis, patient's perspective of pain and disease activity, physical function, and enthesitis). A participant was considered as having achieved the PsA MDA at a visit if the participant has fulfilled at least 5 of the following 7 criteria at that visit: Tender joint count (68 joints)&lt;=1, Swollen joint count (66 joints) &lt;=1, Psoriasis activity and severity index &lt;=1, Patient's Assessment of Pain &lt;=15 on a 100-unit VAS, Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (arthritis and psoriasis) &lt;=20 on a 100-unit VAS, HAQ-DI score &lt;=0.5, and Tender entheseal points &lt;= 1 (LEI index score &lt;= 1).</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 16 and 24</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis population is FAS1. Participants who achieved MDA at a specific time point and did not meet any TF criteria before, were considered as responders at that time point.

        <description>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) is a self-assessment tool that consists of 6 questions relating to the 5 major symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis: fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain, enthesitis, qualitative morning stiffness and quantitative morning stiffness. The first 5 items were scored on a 10 centimeter (cm) VAS ranging from 0=none to 10=very severe. Quantitative morning stiffness was scored on a 10cm VAS ranging from 0=0 hours to 10=2 or more hours. The 2 scores for qualitative and quantitative morning stiffness were averaged, and the total BASDAI score was the average of the 5 scores of each symptom, ranging from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe). Higher scores indicate greater disease severity and an improvement of 50% from baseline is considered clinically meaningful. Only participants with spondylitis with peripheral arthritis as their primary arthritic presentation of PsA completed the BASDAI indicate the degree of their symptoms over the past week.</description>

        <description>PASI is a tool to assess and grade severity of psoriasis and response to therapy. In PASI, body is divided into 4 areas: head, trunk, upper extremities, lower extremities. Each area was assessed separately for percentage of area involved and translated to numeric score ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90 to 100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, each rated on scale of 0 to 4 that is none to maximum severtiy. PASI numeric score range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. Higher scores indicate more severe disease. A PASI 75 response: &gt;=75% improvement in PASI score from baseline.</description>

          <description>PASI is a tool to assess and grade severity of psoriasis and response to therapy. In PASI, body is divided into 4 areas: head, trunk, upper extremities, lower extremities. Each area was assessed separately for percentage of area involved and translated to numeric score ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90 to 100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, each rated on scale of 0 to 4 that is none to maximum severtiy. PASI numeric score range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. Higher scores indicate more severe disease. A PASI 100 response: 100% improvement in PASI score from baseline.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved &gt;=5-point Improvement From Baseline in DLQI Score Through Week 24 Among the Participants With DLQI Score &gt;=5, &gt;=3% BSA Psoriatic Involvement and an IGA Score of &gt;=2 (Mild) at Baseline</title>
        <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a 10-item instrument questionnaire used to assess the patient's perspective of the impact of psoriasis on daily living. Each item was scored on a 4-point scale (0 =not at all /not relevant; 1 =a little; 2 =a lot; 3 =very much), and the total score (0-30) is the sum of the 10 items. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. An improvement of 5 points was considered clinically meaningful.</description>

        <description>In PASI, each area (head, trunk, upper and lower extremities) was assessed for % of area involved and translated to numeric score from 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90-100% involvement) and for erythema, induration, and scaling, each rated on scale of 0 to 4 that is none to maximum severtiy. PASI produces numeric score from 0 to 72. Higher scores=more severe disease. PASI 75: &gt;=75% improvement in PASI score from baseline. ACR 20: &gt;=20% improvement in swollen joint count (SJC) (66 joints) + tender joint count (TJC) (68 joints) and &gt;=20% improvement in 3 of 5: patient's assessment of pain (VAS; 0-100 mm, 0=no pain to 100=worst possible pain), PtGA of disease activity (VAS; 0-100 mm, 0=excellent to 100=poor), PGA of disease activity (VAS; 0-100 mm, 0=no arthritis to 100=extremely active arthritis), patient's assessment of physical function (HAQ-DI -20-question instrument; range- 0=no difficulty to 3=inability to perform task) and CRP.</description>

        <description>In PASI, each area (head, trunk, upper and lower extremities) was assessed separately for % of area involved and translated to numeric score ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, each rated on scale of 0 to 4 that is none to maximum severtiy. PASI produces numeric score range from 0 to 72. Higher scores=more severe disease. PASI 75 response: &gt;=75% improvement in PASI score from baseline. Modified PsARC response: improvement in at least 2 of 4 criteria: &gt;=30% decrease in SJC and TJC, &gt;=20% improvement in PtGA of Disease Activity (arthritis) on VAS (0-100 mm, 0=excellent and 100=poor), &gt;=20% improvement in PGA of Disease Activity on VAS (VAS: 0-100 mm, 0=no arthritis and 100=extremely active arthritis), and at least 1 of 2 joint criteria with no deterioration in other criteria.</description>

          <description>In PASI, each area (head, trunk, upper and lower extremities) was assessed separately for % of area involved and translated to numeric score ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, each rated on scale of 0 to 4 that is none to maximum severtiy. PASI produces numeric score range from 0 to 72. Higher scores=more severe disease. PASI 75 response: &gt;=75% improvement in PASI score from baseline. Modified PsARC response: improvement in at least 2 of 4 criteria: &gt;=30% decrease in SJC and TJC, &gt;=20% improvement in PtGA of Disease Activity (arthritis) on VAS (0-100 mm, 0=excellent and 100=poor), &gt;=20% improvement in PGA of Disease Activity on VAS (VAS: 0-100 mm, 0=no arthritis and 100=extremely active arthritis), and at least 1 of 2 joint criteria with no deterioration in other criteria.</description>
          <population>FAS1 with &gt;=3% BSA psoriatic involvement and IGA score &gt;=2 at baseline. Participants with both PASI 75 and modified PsARC responses at specific timepoint and did not meet TF criteria before, considered responders at that time point.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Modified vdH-S Erosion Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>Modified vdH-S score is the sum of the erosion score (hand, feet) and joint space narrowing (JSN) score (hand, feet). Joint erosion score is the summary of erosion severity in 40 joints of hand scored according to the surface area, from 0 (no erosion) to 5 (complete collapse of bone) and 12 joints of 2 feet (each side of the foot joint is graded on same 0-5 scale, thus maximum erosion score for a foot joint is 10), for a maximum erosion score of 320. JSN score is the total JSN score in same 52 joints as above, each joint scored according to the subluxation from 0 (normal) to 4 (bony ankylosis or complete luxation), for a maximum JSN score of 208. Total score ranges from 0 (best) to 528 (worst = worst possible erosion score of 320 + worst possible JSN score of 208). Higher score indicates more joint damage. Positive changes from baseline in the modified vdH-S total, erosion and JSN scores indicate progression of joint damage.</description>

        <description>Modified vdH-S score is the sum of the erosion score (hand, feet) and joint space narrowing (JSN) score (hand, feet). Joint erosion score is the summary of erosion severity in 40 joints of hand scored according to the surface area, from 0 (no erosion) to 5 (complete collapse of bone) and 12 joints of 2 feet (each side of the foot joint is graded on same 0-5 scale, thus maximum erosion score for a foot joint is 10), for a maximum erosion score of 320. JSN score is the total JSN score in same 52 joints as above, each joint scored according to the subluxation from 0 (normal) to 4 (bony ankylosis or complete luxation), for a maximum JSN score of 208. Total score ranges from 0 (best) to 528 (worst = worst possible erosion score of 320 + worst possible JSN score of 208). Higher score indicates more joint damage. Positive changes from baseline in the modified vdH-S total, erosion and JSN scores indicate progression of joint damage.</description>

        <description>Modified vdH-S score is the sum of the erosion score (hand, feet) and JSN score (hand, feet). Joint erosion score is the summary of erosion severity in 40 joints of hand scored according to the surface area, from 0 (no erosion) to 5 (complete collapse of bone) and 12 joints of 2 feet (each side of foot joint is graded on same 0-5 scale, thus maximum erosion score for a foot joint is 10), for a maximum erosion score of 320. JSN score is the total JSN score in same 52 joints as above, each joint scored according to the subluxation from 0 (normal) to 4 (bony ankylosis or complete luxation), for a maximum JSN score of 208. Total score ranges from 0 (best) to 528 (worst = worst possible erosion score of 320 + worst possible JSN score of 208). Higher score indicates more joint damage. SDC was defined as the cut-off above which the changes can be detected beyond measurement error. Without radiographic progression was defined as change from baseline in the modified vdH-S score &lt;=SDC of 2.18.</description>

        <description>SF-36 is a multi-domain instrument with 36 items to evaluate the health status and quality of life. It included 8 subscales (physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental health), which yielded a Physical Component Summary (PCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) in addition to subscale scores. The PCS scores are normalized to a mean of 50 and standard deviations of 10, based upon general US population norms. A positive change indicates improvement while a negative change indicates worsening of health status and quality of life.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in SF-36 PCS Score at Weeks 8, 16 and 24</title>
          <description>SF-36 is a multi-domain instrument with 36 items to evaluate the health status and quality of life. It included 8 subscales (physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental health), which yielded a Physical Component Summary (PCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) in addition to subscale scores. The PCS scores are normalized to a mean of 50 and standard deviations of 10, based upon general US population norms. A positive change indicates improvement while a negative change indicates worsening of health status and quality of life.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved &gt;=5-point Improvement From Baseline in SF-36 MCS Score Through Week 24</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a multi-domain instrument with 36 items to evaluate the health status and quality of life. It included 8 subscales (physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental health), which yielded a Physical Component Summary (PCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) in addition to subscale scores. The MCS scores are normalized to a mean of 50 and standard deviations of 10, based upon general US population norms. Higher score indicates better outcome, with an increase of 5 points considered to be clinically meaningful.</description>

        <population>Analysis population is FAS1. Participants who achieved &gt;=5-point improvement from baseline in SF-36 MCS score at specific time point and did not meet any TF criteria before, were considered as responders at that time point.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved &gt;=5-point Improvement From Baseline in SF-36 PCS Score Through Week 24</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a multi-domain instrument with 36 items to evaluate the health status and quality of life. It included 8 subscales (physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, emotional role functioning, and mental health), which yielded a Physical Component Summary (PCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) with score range 0-100 (higher score-better quality of life) in addition to subscale scores. The PCS scores are normalized to a mean of 50 and standard deviations of 10, based upon general US population norms. Higher score indicates better outcome, with an increase of 5 points considered to be clinically meaningful.</description>

Participants who achieved &gt;=5-point improvement from baseline in SF-36 PCS score at specific time point and did not meet any TF criteria before, were considered as responders at that time point. Participants who met 1 or more TF criteria before or with missing data at that time point were considered as non-responders.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Score at Weeks 8, 16, and 24</title>
        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue is a questionnaire that assesses self-reported tiredness, weakness, and difficulty conducting usual activities due to fatigue. The subscale consists 13-item instrument to measure fatigue. Each of the 13 items has a set of five response categories: Not at all (=0), A little bit (=1), Somewhat (=2), Quite a bit (=3) and Very much (=4). A total FACIT-Fatigue subscale score was calculated as the sum of the 13 item scores (reserved scores [4 - score]) and ranges from 0 to 52, with a higher score indicating less fatigue. Positive changes from baseline indicate improvement of fatigue. Items were reverse scored when appropriate to provide a scale in which higher scores represent better functioning or less fatigue.</description>

The EQ VAS self-rating records the respondent's own assessment of his or her overall health status at the time of completion, on a vertical line VAS with scale of 0 (the worst health you can imagine) to 100 (the best health you can imagine). A higher score indicates better health and positive changes from baseline indicate improvement of health status</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 16 and 24</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis population is FAS1. Data after meeting 1 or more TF criteria were imputed as no change from baseline. Missing data were assumed missing at random. The LS mean is based on MMRM model that included data from all visits for all participants included in the model.</population>

        <description>EQ-5D-5L is a 2-part instrument for use as a measure of health outcome, designed for self-completion by respondents. It consists of EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and EQ VAS. EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each has 5 levels of perceived problems (1-no problem, 2-slight problems, 3-moderate problems, 4-severe problems, 5-extreme problems). Participant selects answer for each of 5 dimensions considering response that best matches his/her health &quot;today&quot;. Responses were used to generate a weighted summary index (EQ-5D index), which ranges from 0 (dead) to 1.00 (full health). A higher score indicates better health and positive changes from baseline indicate improvement of health.</description>
