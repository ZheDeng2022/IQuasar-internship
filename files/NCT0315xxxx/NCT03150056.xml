    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the combination of GSK525762 with other agents that have been&#xD;
      shown to be effective in the treatment of CRPC or metastatic (m)CRPC. This study is designed&#xD;
      to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) based on&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy profiles of GSK525762 in combination with&#xD;
      either abiraterone (Arm A) or enzalutamide (Arm B).&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was an open-label, dose escalation and expansion study to investigate safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of GSK525762 in combination with abiraterone or enzalutamide in participants with castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This study has been terminated due to meeting protocol defined futility based on an interim analysis. One participant has chosen to continue to receive study drug. The study will conclude when the last participant has completed/discontinued study treatment and completed the end of treatment visit. The results presented are based on the primary analysis at approximately up to 3 years. Data collection is still on-going and additional results will be provided after study completion.</pre_assignment_details>

An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, any other situation according to medical or scientific judgement, or is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function.</description>

        <title>Disease Control Rate at Week 24</title>
        <description>Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the percentage of participants with &gt;=1 post-Baseline disease assessment who showed either a confirmed complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) observed at &gt;=24 weeks per prostate cancer working group 3 (PCWG3)-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1; where CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must be &lt;10 millimeter in the short axis; PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters; SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive diseases. Confidence interval (CI) was computed using exact two sided 95% CI.</description>

          <title>Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) Response Rate</title>
          <description>CTC response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a CTC conversion to &lt;5/7.5 mL blood at nadir (confirmed by a second consecutive value obtained four or more weeks later) for participants with unfavourable CTC (&gt;=5/7.5 mL) at Baseline. CI was computed using exact two sided 95% CI.</description>
          <population>Modified All Treated Population. Only those participants with data available at the indicated time points were analyzed. For GSK525762 40 mg+Abiraterone 1000 mg arm, there were no unfavorable values at Baseline, hence CTC response rate (change from unfavorable to favorable) could not be derived for this arm.</population>

        <description>rPFS is defined as the time from study treatment start until the first date of either disease progression or death due to any cause. The date of disease progression is defined as the earliest date of disease progression as assessed by the investigator using PCWG3-modified RECIST, version 1.1 or progression on bone scan. Progressive disease is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of diameters recorded since the treatment started.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30): Global Health Status (GHS)</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 includes 30-items with single and multi-item scales. These included 5 functional scales (physical functioning, role functioning, cognitive functioning, emotional functioning and social functioning, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting), a GHS/ Quality-of-Life (QoL) scale, and six single items (constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, dyspnea, appetite loss and financial difficulties). Response options for GHS/QoL range from 1 to 4, where 1=not at all and 4=very much. Scores were averaged and transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores representing a high QoL. Baseline is defined as the latest non-missing assessment time-point prior to the first study treatment dose. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline visit value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-SF): Pain Intensity- Pain at Worst in Last 24 Hours</title>
        <description>BPI-SF is 9-item self-administered questionnaire. Pain intensity score was calculated from the four items (items 3, 4, 5 and 6) for worst pain, least pain, average pain and current pain. Worst pain in last 24 hours was rated from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). Baseline is defined as the latest non-missing assessment time-point prior to the first study treatment dose (latest up to Week 1 Day 1). Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline visit value minus Baseline value.</description>
