  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the world. 17.5 million people died&#xD;
      in 2012 due to a cerebrovascular disease (31% of all causes of death). In Europe more than&#xD;
      50% of deaths are due to cardiovascular disease. The mortality rate for cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease is higher in the lower socio-economic levels. Three-quarters of deaths from&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease occur in developing countries. According to estimates in 2030,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease will be responsible for more deaths than the sum of infectious,&#xD;
      nutritional, maternal and perinatal diseases in developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures to prevent cardiovascular risk factors have been shown to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of an adequate primary care network in developing countries limits the screening and&#xD;
      treatment of patients with cardiovascular risk factors. As a result, these patients do not&#xD;
      benefit from adequate prevention, are diagnosed late and remain disabled or die at a young&#xD;
      age, resulting in significant additional costs for families but also at the macroeconomic&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions are possible on a large scale (policies against tobacco and adverse dietary&#xD;
      behavior, promote physical activity, etc.). Actions are possible on an individual level, both&#xD;
      in primary prevention (control of cardiovascular risk factors) and secondary prevention,&#xD;
      where many treatments have proved their effectiveness. These interventions are effective and&#xD;
      cost-effective from a macroeconomic perspective. It was estimated that the cost of such&#xD;
      interventions would not exceed 4% of health expenditure in developing countries and 1-2% in&#xD;
      rich countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization insists on the importance of the triad composed by the patient&#xD;
      and his family, community and health professionals. Results are possible only when these&#xD;
      three components work together for the same purpose. Numerous studies show the benefit of the&#xD;
      involvement of patients in their care in the rich countries and in the developing countries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project builds on advances in the treatment of HIV / AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa and in&#xD;
      chronic disease management through the WHO Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions Framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These projects emerged from the observation that the rich country model of care&#xD;
      (patient-centered, hospital-centered and specialist approach with regular clinical and&#xD;
      paraclinic follow-up) was not transferable to developing countries, The limitation of human,&#xD;
      technical and financial resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A paradigm shift is needed to improve cardiovascular disease control in a more cost-effective&#xD;
      manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SPICES project plans to integrate the current knowledge of new studies to improve the&#xD;
      prevention and control of cardiovascular disease in high-, middle-, and low-income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rich countries and developing countries will therefore be involved in the study: the selected&#xD;
      sites are France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, South Africa and Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a stage of observation in the different countries which will make it possible&#xD;
      to make an inventory of the places and to target the most adapted interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to define the representations on cardiovascular prevention and the&#xD;
      follow up of patients with cardiovascular disease or FDRCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to identify:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the brakes in the management of patients with CVD or FDRCV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the institutional care network for these patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the &quot;informal&quot; care network, that is, family and community caregivers and&#xD;
           within them the potential barriers and facilitators to their care.&#xD;
