  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Internet-based self-help programs are personalized, self-guided interventions delivered over&#xD;
      a computer, mobile device, or other Internet platform and focused on improving knowledge,&#xD;
      awareness, or behavior change for a mental or physical health problem. Through previous and&#xD;
      on-going projects at VACT, the investigators are developing a general strategy for&#xD;
      implementing Internet-based Self-help programs in VA primary care, specifically among Patient&#xD;
      Aligned Care Teams (PACT) and Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI) providers. An&#xD;
      implementation strategy is defined as a systematic intervention to integrate evidence-based&#xD;
      health innovations into usual care. The strategy the investigators propose to test consists&#xD;
      of four core components: (1) a clinical intermediary for patient support, (2) provider/staff&#xD;
      facilitation and education, (3) patient education, and (4) stepped-care for those requiring&#xD;
      additional treatment. In the proposed study, the investigators will compare this strategy to&#xD;
      a low intensity (control) strategy with respect to the implementation related outcomes of&#xD;
      patent engagement, provider adoption through referral to the program, and patient completion,&#xD;
      over a six-month active implementation period. The investigators will target the very common&#xD;
      clinical problem of insomnia and use the SHUTiTM program, a 6-week self-guided program&#xD;
      utilizing standard cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques for the treatment of chronic&#xD;
      insomnia. The program has been shown to improve insomnia severity and other sleep related&#xD;
      outcomes in a number of controlled trials. The clinical effectiveness of SHUTiTM will be&#xD;
      evaluated using clinical insomnia outcomes obtained on all patients enrolled over the 6-month&#xD;
      active implementation periods. The purpose this study is to evaluate the preliminary (1)&#xD;
      effectiveness of an implementation strategy for Internet-based Self-help Interventions and&#xD;
      (2) clinical outcomes of a specific Internet-based self-help program for insomnia, SHUTiTM,&#xD;
      in VA Connecticut outpatient primary care. The primary hypothesis is that the experimental&#xD;
      implementation strategy the investigators are developing, relative to a control strategy,&#xD;
      will result in higher rates of program engagement by patients, greater provider adoption&#xD;
      through referral to the program, greater program completion, and improved patient insomnia&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

      Objective: The purpose this study is to evaluate the preliminary (1) effectiveness of an&#xD;
      implementation strategy for Internet-based Self-help Interventions and (2) clinical outcomes&#xD;
      of a specific Internet-based self-help program for insomnia, SHUTiTM, in VA Connecticut&#xD;
      outpatient primary care. The primary hypothesis is that the experimental implementation&#xD;
      strategy the investigators are developing, relative to a control strategy, will result in&#xD;
      higher rates of program engagement by patients, greater provider adoption through referral to&#xD;
      the program, greater program completion, and improved patient insomnia outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design: The investigators will employ a hybrid implementation-effectiveness study&#xD;
      design through which the investigators will primarily test the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      implementation strategy, while secondarily evaluating the clinical effectiveness of the&#xD;
      SHUTiTM program. The investigators will use a quasi-experimental pre-/post-cohort design&#xD;
      whereby SHUTiTM will initially be implemented using a low-intensity (control) strategy,&#xD;
      followed by implementation using the experimental strategy. The SHUTiTM program's association&#xD;
      with clinical response will be evaluated in an uncontrolled pre-/post-format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Internet-based self-help programs are personalized, self-guided interventions&#xD;
      delivered over a computer, mobile device, or other Internet platform and focused on improving&#xD;
      knowledge, awareness, or behavior change for a mental or physical health problem. Through&#xD;
      previous and on-going projects at VACT, the investigators are developing a general strategy&#xD;
      for implementing Internet-based Self-help programs in VA primary care, specifically among&#xD;
      Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) and Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI)&#xD;
      providers. An implementation strategy is defined as a systematic intervention to integrate&#xD;
      evidence-based health innovations into usual care. The strategy the investigators propose to&#xD;
      test consists of four core components: (1) a clinical intermediary for patient support, (2)&#xD;
      provider/staff facilitation and education, (3) patient education, and (4) stepped-care for&#xD;
      those requiring additional treatment. The investigators' currently approved protocol (#0002)&#xD;
      involves interviewing VA providers, administrators, and staff in order to expand and modify&#xD;
      the components of this strategy. In the proposed study, the investigators will compare this&#xD;
      strategy to a low intensity (control) strategy with respect to the implementation related&#xD;
      outcomes of patent engagement, provider adoption through referral to the program, and patient&#xD;
      completion, over a six-month active implementation period. Use of the program will continue&#xD;
      and implementation outcomes will be gathered over an additional one-year sustainment phase.&#xD;
      The investigators will target the very common clinical problem of insomnia and use the&#xD;
      SHUTiTM program, a 6-week self-guided program utilizing standard cognitive-behavioral therapy&#xD;
      (CBT) techniques for the treatment of chronic insomnia. The program has been shown to improve&#xD;
      insomnia severity and other sleep related outcomes in a number of controlled trials. The&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness of SHUTiTM will be evaluated using clinical insomnia outcomes obtained&#xD;
      on all patients enrolled over the 6-month active implementation periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact/Significance: The development and testing of evidence-based implementation strategies&#xD;
      for Internet-based self-help programs in VA outpatient care is essential given that (1) there&#xD;
      is an increasing number of Internet-based self-help programs providing evidence-based&#xD;
      treatment for a variety of mental and behavioral health disorders, (2) VA has committed to&#xD;
      improving access to care, especially evidence-based and self-care resources, and (3) there is&#xD;
      a Congressional mandate that VA implement Internet-based care. This will be first controlled&#xD;
      trial of an implementation strategy for Internet-based self-help programs in a VA primary&#xD;
      care (PACT/PCMHI) context.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Internet-based Self-help Insomnia Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>The investigators will use the program, SHUTiTM for the treatment of insomnia. The intervention is a CBT-based 6-week, self-administered course accessed via the Internet on mobile, desk-top, and other devices. The program is split into six modules, completed weekly, which include instruction on psycho-education, stimulus control, relaxation training, sleep restriction, medication tapering, and addressing cognitive distortions. The content is delivered via text, video vignettes, case histories, interactive learning tools, interactive skills assessments, symptom assessments, and a sleep log. Homework is assigned after each module. Providers and support staff can follow treatment progress via access to a dashboard of patient information collected by the program. Such information includes progress through the modules, date of last engagement, symptom assessment outcomes, and sleep log data abstracted into commonly used sleep indices such as sleep onset latency and sleep efficiency.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment to digital CBTi occurred through primary care providers who made a referrals to the intervention. Referrals were addressed by the digital intervention coach (or research team member, depending on the cohort), who provided and initial education session about digital CBTi. Participants could then enroll in the trial if they wished. Over the entire course of the trial, 153 individuals were referred and 77 chose to enroll.</recruitment_details>
