    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a prevalent disorder that affects about 10% of the adult&#xD;
      population and &gt; 40% of elderly. It is defined by the presence of urgency, with or without&#xD;
      urge incontinence, in the absence of infection or other pathology. In 1997 through 1999,&#xD;
      sacral nerve stimulation SNS (InterStim, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota) was approved&#xD;
      by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating urge urinary incontinence,&#xD;
      urinary urgency, and frequency. Despite the large numbers of SNS performed, the only&#xD;
      objective clinical evaluation of OAB is urodynamic detrusor instability (UDI) with some&#xD;
      evidence suggesting a correlation with outcomes after sacral neuromodulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, the mechanism of action of SNS is not fully understood. Theories include&#xD;
      direct activation of efferent fibers to the striated urethral sphincter causing reflex&#xD;
      relaxation of the detrusor or potential activation of afferent fibers selectively which can&#xD;
      lead to inhibition at spinal and supraspinal levels. Somatic sacral afferent inflow&#xD;
      activation at sacral level affects the storage and emptying reflexes in the bladder and&#xD;
      central nervous system, explaining the beneficial effects of neuromodulation on both storage&#xD;
      and emptying functions of the bladder. Malaguti and his colleagues detected somatosensory&#xD;
      evoked potentials during sacral neuromodulation, revealing that sacral neuromodulation works&#xD;
      by both sacral afferent activity and somatosensory cortex activation. As sacral&#xD;
      neuromodulation is clinically proven for both storage and emptying bladder dysfunctions, it&#xD;
      is difficult to isolate its action to either sacral afferent or efferent circuits in the&#xD;
      micturition reflex pathway. In our study, we are going to study sacral neuromodulation&#xD;
      outcome predictors from the clinical and urodynamic perspectives in order to help identifying&#xD;
      the right candidates for sacral neuromodulation procedure.&#xD;

&#xD;
      2.0 Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific aim#1: Using the medical reporting systems, we will identify all patients who,&#xD;
           underwent sacral neuromodulation at University Hospitals of Cleveland from January 1,&#xD;
           2012 through February, 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific aim#2: Reporting on the efficacy outcomes including: rate of successful&#xD;
           placement, rate of reported patient improvement after peripheral nerve (PNE) stage 1 and&#xD;
           stage 2 procedure. The proportion of patients who undergo stage 2 compared to patients&#xD;
           who had PNE. Rate of removal after full implantation and rate of battery change.&#xD;
           Finally, will report on patient satisfaction, change in disease-specific severity scores&#xD;
           and change in health-related quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific aim #3: Will identify preoperative clinical and urodynamic factors that can&#xD;
           predict successful outcome and or/ failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific aim #4: to identify predictors in subgroups of patients with OAB including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Wet versus dry subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. With urodynamic detrusor instability (UDI) versus no UDI subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Neurogenic versus non-neurogenic.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Staged versus non-staged procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific aim #5: Validating the identified predictors in a different established set of&#xD;
           patients from Cleveland Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific aim#6: Reporting on safety outcomes including intraoperative complications,&#xD;
           early postoperative complications (within 30 days) and later postoperative&#xD;
           complications. A modified Dindo classification will be utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 Data management and analysis: Data collection: Data will be collected from the medical&#xD;
      reporting systems (Ambulatory medical reporting system and physician portal), University&#xD;
      Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center and affiliated Hospitals, Cleveland, OH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data storage: REDCap software will be used for data storage. Computer software: SPSS 24 will&#xD;
      be used for statistical analysis. Statistical tests: Continuous characteristics will be&#xD;
      summarized with mean, median, and range; categorical characteristics will be summarized with&#xD;
      number and percentage. For specific aim#2 and #3, #4, #5: associations of baseline&#xD;
      characteristics with outcomes will be further evaluated using univariate, and multivariate&#xD;
      logistic regression models and summarized with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals&#xD;
      (CIs). Model calibration will be evaluated using the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test&#xD;
      to identify the best model. The comparison will be performed using independent sample T -test&#xD;
      for normally disturbed continuous variables and Wilcoxon test for skewed data. Chi-square&#xD;
      tests will be used for comparing categorical variables. For specific aim#6, Cox proportional&#xD;
      hazard models will be used to evaluate the predictors of failure after device implantation,&#xD;
      we will be using Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. All tests will be 2 sided; P&#xD;
      values less than .05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses will be&#xD;
      performed using SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina).&#xD;
