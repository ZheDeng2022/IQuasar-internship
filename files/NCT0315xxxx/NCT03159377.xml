  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will perform an ultra low-dose CT (ULDCT) in addition to a regular chest CT scan for adult&#xD;
      patients undergoing a clinically indicated chest CT. Using a recently developed&#xD;
      computationally efficient algorithm for the denoising of ULDCT scans after image&#xD;
      reconstruction, we will compare the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of lesion detection&#xD;
      with the ULDCT as compared to the regular CT scan.&#xD;

      Patient cohort: Two hundred patients will be recruited for this study. Patients will be&#xD;
      comprised of two groups: an inpatient group of patients from the Internal Medicine Department&#xD;
      E for which a chest CT is ordered during their hospitalization; and ambulatory patients&#xD;
      arriving for an ambulatory chest CT in the early afternoon. The treating clinician ordering&#xD;
      the chest CT for the patients from Internal Medicine E will consent the inpatients while a&#xD;
      chest radiologist from the Radiology Department will consent the outpatients arriving in the&#xD;
      early afternoon for a chest CT study. For inclusion in the study, patients will be adults,&#xD;
      older than 18 years old with the ability to follow orders and hold their breath for 8 seconds&#xD;
      as determined by the physician at time of study consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging method: All patients consented for this study will be imaged on a dedicated scanner&#xD;
      for the study, Revolution (GE, Milwaukee, WI). Immediately following the patient's diagnostic&#xD;
      chest CT scan, an ultra low dose chest CT scan will be obtained. The routine CT scans of the&#xD;
      patients consented for this study will be performed using our routine protocol on the GE&#xD;
      Revolution which typically delivers at our institution an average effective dose of 2.9mSv&#xD;
      (range 0.95-3.01mSv) while our other Philips routine chest CT scan delivers an average&#xD;
      effective dose of 10.5mSv (range 10.29-12.95mSv). With the addition of the ultra low dose&#xD;
      technique, which delivers a radiation dose of a range of 0.5-1 mSv (calculated from a pilot&#xD;
      study we obtained on pigs), patients are expected to get an total radiation dose for both&#xD;
      scans together of about 4 mSv which is less than 10.5mSv (the normal dose for the Phillips CT&#xD;
      machine at our institution). Just as a comparison, a meticulous study looking at multiple&#xD;
      institutions showed that the average effective dose from a routine chest CT is 7mSv, range&#xD;
      4-18mSv and for a chest CT with pulmonary embolism protocol an average effective dose of&#xD;
      15mSv with a range of 13-40mSv .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image evaluation: The diagnostic chest CT scan will be sent to the PACS as usual and&#xD;
      interpreted immediately, during the same day, as per normal inpatient clinical operations&#xD;
      protocol at our institution. The ultra low dose CT scan will be automatically sent to the&#xD;
      computational imaging lab processing station, which will denoise the image. After denoising&#xD;
      the images will be automatically forwarded to the PACS under the same accession number of the&#xD;
      routine chest CT scan. Comparison of the ultra low dose denoised images to the routine chest&#xD;
      CT images will be performed by an experienced chest radiologist at a later date, at least one&#xD;
      week after date of acquisition to prevent any memorability of the original image.&#xD;
      Radiologists' memory of findings has been shown to be poor, even when viewed immediately but&#xD;
      slightly worse when time passes [Evans]. The radiologist will document the presence of&#xD;
      nodules, consolidation, ground glass opacities, emphysema, fibrosis with abnormalities marked&#xD;
      on the images in the PACS. Following completion of the table, the routine chest CT scan will&#xD;
      be used as the gold standard for the presence of the imaging findings. The documented ultra&#xD;
      low dose CT findings will be compared to the images from the routine chest CT scans. Each&#xD;
      finding documented will be individually documented as a true finding if also seen on the&#xD;
      routine chest CT scan or false finding if not present on the routine chest CT scan.&#xD;
      Additional findings only seen on the routine chest CT scan will be documented as missed&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;
