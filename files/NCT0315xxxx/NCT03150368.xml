  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study for extended use of ModraDoc006/r in patients with advanced solid tumours,&#xD;
      available after completed treatment in one of the phase I trials with ModraDoc006/r. The&#xD;
      primary goal is to explore the safety of extended use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label extended use programme, designed to make extended use treatment with&#xD;
      weekly ModraDoc006/r available for patients who completed treatment in one of the phase I&#xD;
      trials with ModraDoc006/r, who might have clinical benefit of continued treatment with the&#xD;
      oral docetaxel formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive oral docetaxel (as ModraDoc006 10 mg tablets) and ritonavir (100 mg&#xD;
      tablet) once- or bi-daily, once a week in a fasted condition. Treatment can be continued&#xD;
      weekly as long as the patient experiences clinical benefit from the treatment as judged by&#xD;
      the treating oncologist, unless unacceptable toxicity despite dose modifications and&#xD;
      supportive measures occurs.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histological or cytological proof of cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who might benefit from a weekly (oral) docetaxel regime as judged by the&#xD;
             treating oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who received treatment with ModraDoc006/r with acceptable safety (as judged&#xD;
             by the PI; for criteria see below in section 3 of exclusion criteria) in phase I&#xD;
             trials with ModraDoc006/r, including (but not limited to) the N15FED (food-interaction&#xD;
             study), N16AED (absorption-excretion study), N16DOL (normal or impaired liver&#xD;
             function). A maximum delay of 21 days between the last dose in the previous phase I&#xD;
             trial and the first dose in the N17DEX is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. WHO performance status of 0, 1 or 2;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Minimal acceptable laboratory values defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ANC of ≥ 1.5 x 109 /L&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Platelet count of ≥ 100 x 109 /L&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Renal function as defined by serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Clinically significant safety issues during previous therapy with ModraDoc006/r as&#xD;

             use a reliable contraceptive method throughout the study (adequate contraceptive&#xD;

             allowed.&#xD;

             examination finding or laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or&#xD;
             condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or puts the patient&#xD;
             at high risk for treatment-related complications.&#xD;
