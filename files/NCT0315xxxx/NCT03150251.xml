  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One objective of this study is to examine the blood glucose and serum insulin responses over&#xD;
      2hr elicited by oats soaked overnight in milk compared to Cream of Rice soaked overnight in&#xD;
      milk and compared to Cream of Rice cooked in water. In addition a second objective of the&#xD;
      study is to measure subjective ratings of hunger and fullness under the same conditions.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male or non-pregnant females, 18-75 years of age, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 20.00 and 34.99 kg/m² inclusive at screening (visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to maintain habitual diet, physical activity pattern, and body weight&#xD;
             throughout the trial and to refrain from smoking for 12hr prior to each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to maintain current dietary supplement use throughout the trial. On test days,&#xD;
             subject agrees not to take any dietary supplements until dismissal from the GI labs.&#xD;
             Failure to comply will result in a rescheduled test visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal fasting serum glucose (&lt;7.0mmol/L capillary corresponding to whole blood&#xD;
             glucose &lt;6.3mmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to abstain from alcohol consumption and avoid vigorous physical activity for&#xD;
             24 h prior to all test visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of health conditions that would prevent fulfillment of study requirements as&#xD;
             judged by the Investigator on the basis of medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Understanding the study procedures and willing to provide informed consent to&#xD;
             participate in the study and authorization to release relevant protected health&#xD;
             information to the study investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to meet any one of the inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of AIDS, hepatitis, a history or presence of clinically important&#xD;
             endocrine (including Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus), cardiovascular (including,&#xD;
             but not limited to, atherosclerotic disease, history of myocardial infarction,&#xD;
             peripheral arterial disease, stroke), pulmonary, biliary or GI disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of medications known to influence carbohydrate metabolism, including, but not&#xD;
             limited to adrenergic blockers, diuretics, thiazolidinediones, metformin and systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids within 4 weeks of the screening visit, or with any condition which&#xD;
             might, in the opinion of Dr. Wolever, the president of GI Testing, either: 1) make&#xD;
             participation dangerous to the subject or to others, or 2) affect the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major trauma or surgical event within 3 months of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness or inability to comply with the experimental procedures and to follow GI&#xD;
             Labs safety guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known intolerance, sensitivity or allergy to any ingredients in the study products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Extreme dietary habits, as judged by the Investigator (i.e. Atkins diet, very high&#xD;
             protein diets, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic blood&#xD;
             pressure ≥100 mm Hg as defined by the average blood pressure measured at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Change in body weight of &gt;3.5kg within 4 weeks of the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any signs or symptoms of an active infection within 5 d prior to any test&#xD;
             visit. If an infection occurs during the study period, test visits should be&#xD;
             rescheduled until all signs and symptoms have resolved and any treatment (i.e.&#xD;
             antibiotic therapy) has been completed at least 5 d prior to each test visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cancer in the prior two years, except for non-melanoma skin cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent history (within 12 months of screening) or strong potential for alcohol or&#xD;
             substance abuse. Alcohol abuse is defined as &gt; 14 drinks per week (1 drink=12 oz beer,&#xD;
             5 oz wine, or 1.5 oz distilled spirits).&#xD;
