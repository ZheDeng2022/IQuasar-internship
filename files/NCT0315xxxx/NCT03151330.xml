  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Preterm birth (PTB) remains the leading cause of neonatal mortality and long term&#xD;
      disability throughout the world. Recently treatments early in pregnancy such as progesterone,&#xD;
      cervical support and maternal support have been demonstrated to delay delivery amongst at&#xD;
      risk women. Nonetheless, the majority of women who are at risk are not identified using&#xD;
      current screening modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A cohort of pregnancies who are screened using the PreTRM® test around 20 weeks&#xD;
      gestation in which a bundle of interventions is given for elevated PreTRM® risk will show&#xD;
      either decreased neonatal morbidity/and mortality (measured as a composite score, &quot;NMI&quot;), or&#xD;
      decreased length of neonatal stay in the hospital (NNOLOS). Secondarily, they will show an&#xD;
      increase in gestational age at birth (GAB) and a reduction in length of neonatal NICU stay&#xD;
      (NICULOS), compared to an unscreened historical control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Type: Prospective cohort study of screened women compared to a historical&#xD;
      control of 10000 women.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Population: Women who are 18 years or older, with a singleton pregnancy between 195/7 weeks&#xD;
      and 206/7 weeks gestational age (GA) confirmed by ultrasound prior to enrollment, and no&#xD;
      history of prior preterm birth (delivery between 160/7 weeks and 366/7 weeks) will be invited&#xD;
      to participate. A comparable population will be identified using a historical control group&#xD;
      in a contemporaneously maintained database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Qualifying women will be screened using the PreTRM® test (Sera Prognostics,&#xD;
      Inc.) at a large tertiary care center. Predicated upon the degree of risk, women will be&#xD;
      treated according to a prespecified algorithm. The outcomes of these women will be compared&#xD;
      to a historical control group at the same tertiary care center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Co-Primary outcomes: To determine whether a cohort of women who are screened&#xD;
      with the PreTRM® test and then managed according to a prespecified protocol will have&#xD;
      statistically significant reductions in either (a) composite neonatal morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      (NMI score), or (b) length of neonatal hospital stay (NNOLOS), compared to a historical&#xD;
      control group. The NMI is defined below&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEFINITIONS OF COMPOSITE PERINATAL MORTALITY/NEONATAL MORBIDITY OUTCOME SCORES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) 0 to 4 scale without NICU: This score was derived as an ordinal scale based upon severity.&#xD;
      The score was defined by the following: 0 = no events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. = one event for (RDS, BPD, grade III or IV IVH, PVL, proven sepsis, or NEC) and no&#xD;
           perinatal mortality,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. = two events and no perinatal mortality;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. = three or more events and no perinatal mortality; 4=perinatal mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) 0 to 4 scale with NICU: This score was defined as the following: 0 = no events,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. = one event for (RDS, BPD, grade III or IV IVH, PVL, proven sepsis, or NEC) or &lt;5 days&#xD;
           in the NICU, and no perinatal mortality;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. = two events or between 5 and 20 days in the NICU, and no perinatal mortality;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. = three or more events or &gt;20 days in the NICU, and no perinatal mortality;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. = perinatal mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) 0 to 6 scale without NICU: This score was defined as the following: 0 = no events;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. = one event for (RDS, BPD, grade III or IV IVH, proven sepsis, or NEC) and no perinatal&#xD;
           mortality,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. = two events and no perinatal mortality;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. = three events and no perinatal mortality;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. = four events and no perinatal mortality;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. = five events and no perinatal mortality;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. = perinatal mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) Any morbidity or mortality event: (yes/no)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adapted from Hassan SS, et al. Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol 2011; 38:18-31 Supplementary&#xD;
           Information&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: To determine whether women who are screened with the PreTRM® test and&#xD;
      then managed according to a pre-specified treatment algorithm will have a statistically&#xD;
      significant reduction in proportion of any type of preterm births (spontaneous and&#xD;
      indicated), the total length of hospital stay for spontaneous preterm births, and total&#xD;
      length of hospital stay for any preterm birth.&#xD;

           sPTB&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation of blood levels of 17-OHPC and other progestin levels to outcomes and&#xD;
           observations&#xD;
