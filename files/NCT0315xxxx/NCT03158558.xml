      The purpose of this study is to test an intensive, multi-couple group version of a couple&#xD;
      therapy for PTSD delivered to active duty Service Members or Veterans with PTSD and their&#xD;
      romantic partners in a single weekend retreat. The study will be conducted on or near Fort&#xD;
      Hood in Kileen, Texas. Twenty-four couples will be treated with this therapy and assessed&#xD;
      immediately before treatment, 1 month after treatment, and 3 months after treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have documented an association between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)&#xD;
      symptoms and intimate relationship problems in both Service Members and Veterans and their&#xD;
      partners, including relationship distress, physical and psychological aggression, and&#xD;
      psychological distress in partners. In prior work, the investigators have demonstrated that&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral conjoint therapy for PTSD (CBCT for PTSD), a 15-session couple-based&#xD;
      therapy for PTSD, is efficacious in simultaneously treating PTSD and comorbid symptoms and&#xD;
      improving intimate relationship functioning. However, the current format of fifteen 75-minute&#xD;
      sessions over 15 weeks presents challenges for large-scale dissemination for active duty&#xD;
      Service Members and recently discharged Veterans who have deployed in support of 9/11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this uncontrolled trial is to pilot a brief, scalable version of CBCT for PTSD&#xD;
      in which session content is taught in an accelerated, multi-couple group format (AM-CBCT for&#xD;
      PTSD) that has the potential for rapid dissemination and implementation, while capturing the&#xD;
      majority of the benefits of the original therapy format. Accelerated, multi-couple group CBCT&#xD;
      for PTSD (AM-CBCT for PTSD) will be delivered in a single weekend retreat to 24 active duty&#xD;
      Service Members and recently discharged Veterans with PTSD who have deployed post-9/11 and&#xD;
      their partners. Participants will be assessed at pre-treatment, one month after treatment,&#xD;
      and 3 months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study seeks to answer the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Will accelerated, multi-couple group CBCT for PTSD delivered in a weekend retreat&#xD;
           (AM-CBCT for PTSD) be associated with significant improvements in clinician-rated PTSD&#xD;
           symptom severity, as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5&#xD;
           (CAPS-5), one month after treatment and at 3-month follow-up?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Will accelerated, multi-couple group CBCT for PTSD delivered in a weekend retreat&#xD;
           (AM-CBCT for PTSD) be associated with significant improvements in secondary outcomes&#xD;
           (e.g., patient self-reported PTSD and comorbid symptom severity, relationship&#xD;
           satisfaction), one month after treatment and at 3-month follow-up?&#xD;
