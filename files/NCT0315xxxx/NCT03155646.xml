  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A laparoscopic approach offers several advantages over an open procedures; potentially&#xD;
      reduces the surgical stress and fluid shifts that may accompany it; in addition there is less&#xD;
      need for postoperative analgesia, reduction of postoperative respiratory and wound&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the minimally invasive nature, pain can be moderate to severe in the immediate&#xD;
      postoperative period that requires multimodal analgesia. Inadequate control of post-operative&#xD;
      pain leads to several unwanted adverse events ranging from patients' discomfort and prolonged&#xD;
      immobilization to thromboembolic phenomenon and pulmonary complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a type of peripheral nerve block that involves&#xD;
      innervation of the anterolateral abdominal wall. With the aid of ultrasound, local anesthetic&#xD;
      (LA) is injected into the transversus abdominis fascial plane, where the nerves from T6 to L1&#xD;
      are located.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound TAP block is accompanied by a good pain relief and reduced intraoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative opioids requirements after laparoscopic surgery. In this case a bilateral TAP&#xD;
      block is necessary because the abdominal skin incisions for the ports of laparoscopic&#xD;
      procedure are performed on both sides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, TAP block duration is limited to the effect of administered LA. Recently,&#xD;
      adjuvant medications were added to LA to prolong the effect of TAP block. Dexmedetomidine is&#xD;
      a selective alpha 2 (α2) adrenergic agonist with both analgesic and sedative properties. Its&#xD;
      use with bupivacaine either epidurally or intrathecally is associated with prolongation of&#xD;
      the LA effect. A major advantage of dexmedetomidine is its higher selectivity compared with&#xD;
      clonidine for α2A receptors, responsible for the hypnotic and analgesic effects of such&#xD;
      drugs.10 Clonidine action, similar to local anesthetic action, and its interaction with local&#xD;
      anesthetics have been explained by three possible mechanisms. First, clonidine blocks Ad and&#xD;
      C fibers. Secondly, clonidine may cause local vasoconstriction, thus decreasing local&#xD;
      anesthetic spread and removal around neural structures. Thirdly, clonidine used in peripheral&#xD;
      blocks intensifies and prolongs analgesia.&#xD;

      Preoperative assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day prior to surgery, all children will undergo pre-anesthetic checkup including detailed&#xD;
      history, thorough general, physical, systemic examination and weight of the patient. All&#xD;
      children will be kept nil per mouth 8 hours for solids and 2 hours for clear liquids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written consent, coagulation profile, emergency resuscitation equipments including&#xD;
           airway devices, pediatric advanced life support drugs for LA toxicity will be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will be pre-medicated with oral midazolam of 0.5 mg/kg about 20 minutes&#xD;
           before induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative monitoring will include ECG, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure,&#xD;
      capnography and temperature probes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in this study will be anesthetized by the same team of anesthesiologists and&#xD;
      operated upon by the same team of surgeons who will be unaware of the study medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia will be standardized for all patients in both groups using 6-8 MAC&#xD;
      sevoflurane in 100% O2 with appropriate size face mask. After intravenous access securing,&#xD;
      atropine 0.02 mg/kg and fluid bolus of 10 ml/kg will be given to offset hemodynamic effects&#xD;
      when pneumoperitoneum is created. Endotracheal intubation with appropriate size to the&#xD;
      patient's age will be inserted and secured after administration of 2 mg/kg propofol and 0.5&#xD;
      mg/kg of atracurium. After tracheal intubation, the stomach is deflated with an orogastric&#xD;
      tube and bladder catheterization is inserted in order to decrease the risk of visceral injury&#xD;
      during trocar insertion. Controlled mechanical ventilation will be used to maintain end-tidal&#xD;
      CO2 at 35±5 mmHg. General anesthesia will be maintained with 2-3 MAC sevoflurane delivered in&#xD;
      100% O2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique of TAP block:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be placed in the supine position and TAP block will be performed under&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance. After skin preparation, the linear ultrasound probe (high frequency&#xD;
      probe 7-12 MHz) connected to a portable ultrasound unit ( MANDRAY ) will be placed in the&#xD;
      axial plane across the mid-axillary line midway between the costal margin and the highest&#xD;
      point of iliac crest. A 22 G × 50 mm PAJUNK needle attached with tubing system to a syringe&#xD;
      filled with the LA solution will be inserted in plane with the ultrasound probe and advanced&#xD;
      until it reaches the plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles.&#xD;
      After careful aspiration to exclude vascular puncture, injection of the study medication will&#xD;
      be performed leading to separation between the internal oblique and the transversus abdominis&#xD;
      muscles which will appear as a hypoechoic space on ultrasound. This procedure will be&#xD;
      repeated on the opposite side of the midline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HR, MAP, SpO2 and ETCO2 will be recorded before induction of anesthesia, before block, after&#xD;
      the block and every 10 minutes till end of surgery. Skin incision will be made 15-20 minutes&#xD;
      after TAP block. 4 An increase in HR and MAP above 20% of baseline values with skin incision&#xD;
      will be considered signs of inadequate analgesia. In these cases, fentanyl 1 μg/kg will be&#xD;
      given intravenously, and the case will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operative table position itself may need to be changed repeatedly during the operation;&#xD;
      both the Trendelenburg and the reverse Trendelenburg positions are often used. Children may&#xD;
      be placed near the foot end of the table. Accordingly, care must be taken to secure the&#xD;
      patient to the table (e.g. using rolls of gauze and tape). Well padding of extremities should&#xD;
      be ensured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restriction of the intra-abdominal pressure to 6-12 mmHg in children will be recommended.&#xD;
      These pressures have minimal effects on cardiac index. Intraoperative hypotension defined as&#xD;
      fall in MAP by 20% from the baseline requiring a fluid bolus and bradycardia defined as a&#xD;
      decrease in HR by 20% from the baseline value requiring atropine will be recorded.&#xD;
      Perioperative blood loss will be replaced using crystalloids and blood as indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the surgical procedure, reversal of neuromuscular blockade effect&#xD;
      (Neostigmine 0.04 mg/kg and Atropine 0.02 mg/kg) and extubation will be done after ensuring&#xD;
      adequate orogastric suction and empting of pneumoperitonem. Bilateral air entry should be&#xD;
      checked at the end of anesthesia. Patients will be transferred to the postanesthesia care&#xD;
      unit (PACU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PACU: HR, MAP, SpO2 modified CHEOPS and nausea &amp; vomiting score will be recorded on&#xD;
      admission to PACU, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24 h postoperatively by an observer who will be&#xD;
      unaware of the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHEOPS = SUM (points for all 6 parameters)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interpretation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minimum score: 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum score: 13 Patients with modified CHEOPS ≥ 4 will be given rescue analgesia with&#xD;
           15 mg/kg paracetamol intravenously (Perfalgan_, Paracetamol 1000 mg. UPSA laboratories,&#xD;
           France). Pain scores will be recorded every 10 minutes after administration of rescue&#xD;
           analgesia to evaluate pain relief or need for further rescue analgesia. The number of&#xD;
           children who will need postoperative rescue analgesics and the durations of analgesia&#xD;
           will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be discharged from the hospital when they are pain free and there is no other&#xD;
      medical reason to admit them to a surgical ward. The parents who will be involved in the&#xD;
      clinical trial will be invited to complete a postoperative chart with a simple pain scale (0&#xD;
      = no pain/child calm; 1 = minimum pain/child irritable; 2 = mild pain/child consolable; and 3&#xD;
      = severe pain/child inconsolable). Parents will be instructed to give their children oral&#xD;
      Ibuprofen 10 mg/kg when pain scores 2 or 3, and not more frequently than every 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative vomiting episodes will be recorded and treated with intravenous Metoclopramide&#xD;
      0.5 mg/kg. Postoperative sedation will be assessed using sedation score described by Culebras&#xD;
      et al, 2001 (1. Awake and alert. 2. Sleeping but easily arouses to voice or light touch. 3.&#xD;
      Arouses to loud voice or shaking. 4. Arouses with painful stimuli only. 5. Unrousable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other postoperative complications as infection or hematoma formation will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will be asked to evaluate their satisfaction regarding pain control at the end of 24&#xD;
      hours postoperatively through 5-point Likert scale (1 = very satisfied, 2 = satisfied, 3 =&#xD;
      neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 4 = dissatisfied, 5 = very dissatisfied).&#xD;
