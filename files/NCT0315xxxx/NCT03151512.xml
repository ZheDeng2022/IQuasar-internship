      This is a three-year project funded by a Cancer Research UK Multidisciplinary Award and&#xD;
      brings together a team from UCL Division of Medicine, Computer Science and University College&#xD;
      London Hospital. The aim is to develop Magnetic Resonance (MR) sequences and mathematical&#xD;
      algorithms to reduce the distortions in MR images, especially of the prostate. Current NICE&#xD;
      guidelines include a type of MR imaging called Diffusion Weighted MRI for the detection of&#xD;
      tumour within the prostate, and for active surveillance of low risk confirmed disease.&#xD;
      However, approximately 40% of prostate diffusion images suffer from severe localised&#xD;
      distortions and this is most marked in the peripheral zone of the prostate where 75% of&#xD;
      prostate cancers occur. The source of these distortions is magnetic field imperfections due&#xD;
      to the presence of rectal gas or metallic hip implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study will ask both healthy volunteers and patients to undergo research MR scans&#xD;
      and use the acquired data for analysis. For patients, the scans may be either additional&#xD;
      sequences acquired during an extended clinical session, or a separate additional session&#xD;
      entirely for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The output from the research will be modified ways to run an MR scanner and compute the final&#xD;
      images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The work should lead to improved diagnostic accuracy and a reduced number of non-diagnostic&#xD;
      studies. It will have broader impact through application to diffusion imaging of other body&#xD;
      sites, including whole-body diffusion MRI and non-cancer applications. If successful, the&#xD;
      results would provide evidence for a larger trial with the eventual outcome being&#xD;
      manufacturers incorporating modified MR sequences and data processing into clinical systems&#xD;
      worldwide.&#xD;

        This study will recruit patients within the UCLH imaging pathway and healthy participants&#xD;
        for research Magnetic Resonance imaging. There is no requirement for participants to be&#xD;
        imaged more than once for this study. Following the MR scan, no further involvement is&#xD;
        required from the participants. This is a single-centre study and all imaging will take&#xD;
        place at UCLH. The de-identified data will be processed by members of the study team within&#xD;
        UCL.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the development and testing phases, there are no specific inclusion criteria.&#xD;
             Assessment of the primary outcome measure (reduced distortions) also does not require&#xD;
             specific inclusion criteria. The intended application of our methods is to prostate&#xD;
             cancer and this is reflected in some of the secondary outcome measures. Recruitment&#xD;
             will come from the UCLH imaging bookings system. This list will include many men&#xD;
             having prostate scans and many of these will subsequently be found to have at least a&#xD;
             suspicion of cancer. Note there is no requirement for a suspicion of cancer to be&#xD;
             recruited for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects unable to have an MRI scan due to contraindications for MRI, for example,&#xD;
             pacemaker and certain other implants, severe claustrophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects unable to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children and vulnerable populations.&#xD;
