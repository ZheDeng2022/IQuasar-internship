  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic patients with a history of diabetic foot are considered to be a high-risk population&#xD;
      for increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (1,2,3,). Diabetic foot (DF) is&#xD;
      responsible for more hospitalizations than any other complication of diabetes and are the&#xD;
      leading cause of non-traumatic lower extremity amputations, resulting in nearly 100 000&#xD;
      amputations annually in the US alone (4,5,6). Surgical debridement, as an important component&#xD;
      of standard of care of diabetic foot, is intended to remove healing-impaired tissue,&#xD;
      decreases bacterial burden, thus to stimulate overall wound closure, while removing as little&#xD;
      of healing-competent skin as possible. Furthermore, debrided tissue is often used as a&#xD;
      valuable tissue source for research purposes (7,8,9,10). Debrided tissue presents valuable&#xD;
      diagnostic and research source to verify pathology, assess prognosis and gain insights into&#xD;
      DF molecular pathology, all of which ultimately leads to improved outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aimed to validate tissue obtained from surgical debridement of DF for the&#xD;
      cellular/molecular tissue analyses and biomarkers, to evaluate the pathophysiology of DF and&#xD;
      understanding mechanisms that inhibit healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The age range will be 50-70 years, in order to minimize the effects of irreversible vascular&#xD;
      wall changes induced progressively by the aging process. All patients will undergo screening&#xD;
      procedures that will include full anamnesis, physical examination, basic laboratory blood&#xD;
      tests (full chemistry, CBC); urine examination and EKG will be performed at start and at the&#xD;
      end of the study. Patients with a significant myocardial, and renal, cerebrovascular or&#xD;
      hepatic disease will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective study, we will collect wound edge tissue specimens from 75 patients with DF&#xD;
      during surgical debridement. From each patient, 1-4 specimens will be obtained per&#xD;
      debridement. To evaluate debrided tissue, each specimen will be processed for paraffin&#xD;
      embedding and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Histopathology analysis of multiple&#xD;
      specimens acquired from the same wound will be analysed.&#xD;

        7. Insulin, c-peptid&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. HOMA-IR Blood sampling for chemistry and metabolic markers including lipids, fasting&#xD;
           glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1C, HOMA-IR , CRP, plasma adiponectin, visfatin, resistin,&#xD;
           and plasma leptin will be performed. Additionally, relationship between serum and tissue&#xD;
           adipokines level will be evaluated.&#xD;
