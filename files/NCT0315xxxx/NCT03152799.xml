  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischaemic stroke causes significant morbidity and mortality and is a leading cause of&#xD;
      disability within an ageing United Kingdom (UK) population. Proximal anterior circulation&#xD;
      occlusion is associated with a particularly poor prognosis, but its management has undergone&#xD;
      a paradigm shift following clinical introduction of endovascular recanalization, establishing&#xD;
      rapid reperfusion of the ischaemic penumbra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is highly effective at attenuating cerebral infarction in&#xD;
      basic research studies and has the potential to further improve patient outcome if used as an&#xD;
      adjunct to invasive revascularisation strategies. We aim to trial remote ischaemic&#xD;
      conditioning at the time of revascularisation, and then daily for the duration of the&#xD;
      seven-day in-patient stay, compared to a sham conditioning procedure. This pilot,&#xD;
      single-centre study will determine efficacy/ tolerability of RIC to reduce cerebral&#xD;
      infarction (primary endpoint: determined by brain magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and&#xD;
      improve functional status (secondary end-points: National Institutes of Health Stroke&#xD;
      Severity (NIHSS); European Quality of Life questionnaire EurQoL), with the data providing the&#xD;
      necessary parameters for power calculations and leveraging charitable funding for a&#xD;
      subsequent multi-centre study.&#xD;

      The aims of our study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demonstrate safety of remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) in stroke patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Demonstrate practicality of the intervention (RIC);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Demonstrate the practicality of the study protocol and imaging modalities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determining appropriate and measurable end-points: e.g. cerebral infarct reduction&#xD;
           (MRI), reduction of cerebral oedema, functional assessment and quality of life survey;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Provide preliminary data on likely effect size of the RIC intervention versus the sham&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute ischaemic stroke represents a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the UK.&#xD;
      It is estimated that 110,000 strokes occur in England each year, with an incidence of between&#xD;
      1-36/1000/year. Patients presenting with a proximal vessel occlusion in the anterior&#xD;
      circulation have a particularly poor prognosis, with approximately 20% 90-day mortality and&#xD;
      significant morbidity despite thrombolysis. Recently, endovascular recanalization with&#xD;
      mechanical thrombectomy trials have brought about a paradigm shift in the optimal management&#xD;
      of this high-risk group of patients; the interventional extraction of the occluding thrombus&#xD;
      demonstrating significant benefits in MR-CLEAN(3), ESCAPE, EXTEND-IA (intra-arterial), SWIFT&#xD;
      PRIME and REVASCAT (revascularisation) studies. Echoing primary percutaneous intervention in&#xD;
      the management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction, endovascular recanalization represents&#xD;
      rapid restoration of blood flow to the ischaemic cerebrum - with the promise of improved&#xD;
      neurological salvage and functional outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reperfusion Injury:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reperfusion is not, however, a benign process. Demonstrable in many organ systems including&#xD;
      the brain (but studied most extensively in the heart), reperfusion leads to rapid restoration&#xD;
      of intracellular pH, mitochondrial calcium overload and generation of reactive oxygen species&#xD;
      - conditions that are prime for the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore&#xD;
      (mPTP). The mPTP, a large capacitance pore that forms on the inner mitochondrial membrane,&#xD;
      leads to mitochondrial disruption and the release of proteins that trigger cell death.&#xD;
      Therefore modifying conditions of reperfusion/ triggering cellular protection pathways are&#xD;
      the key targets for optimising tissue salvage associated with reperfusion following any acute&#xD;
      revascularisation intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remote ischaemic conditioning:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain has been demonstrated to share many of the cytoprotective signalling pathways found&#xD;
      in other organs such as the heart, and like the heart, can be protected by ischaemic&#xD;
      conditioning(6). Ischaemic conditioning can be either applied either directly to the organ,&#xD;
      or more conveniently to a remote tissue (such as an arm, through inflation of a blood&#xD;
      pressure cuff), either prior to, during or immediately following the restoration of blood&#xD;
      flow to the ischaemic tissue (pre-, peri- and post-conditioning respectively). The remote&#xD;
      conditioning stimulus leads to the activation of cellular survival kinases (termed the&#xD;
      reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) cascade) that in turn leads to inhibition of mPTP&#xD;
      opening, and thus cell survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ischaemic conditioning and neuro-protection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the phenomenon of ischaemic conditioning was first described and best characterised in&#xD;
      the heart, it is well recognised that the ischaemic conditioning can result in cytoprotection&#xD;
      across many mammalian organs, including the brain. Indeed, contemporaneous with the seminal&#xD;
      myocardial preconditioning paper by Reimer, Murray and Jennings in the dog, Schurr et al&#xD;
      demonstrated ischaemic preconditioning could also protect adult rat hippocampal slices&#xD;
      against injurious anoxia/re-oxygenation. Ischaemic conditioning of neuronal tissue has&#xD;
      subsequently been demonstrated to be triggered and mediated by similar receptor and&#xD;
      downstream signalling pathways (e.g. G-protein coupled receptors, RISK pathway activation and&#xD;
      suppression of cell death pathways), and that remote ischaemic conditioning is also effective&#xD;
      at significantly attenuating the volume of cerebral necrosis in rat experimental models of&#xD;
      acute right middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke (typically reducing infarct size by&#xD;
      40-60%). Similar results are observed in mouse (middle cerebral embolization, followed by&#xD;
      thrombolysis with tissue-plasminogen activator) and in piglet, where the injurious effects of&#xD;
      hypothermic circulatory arrest were attenuated, improving both functional and histological&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With building evidence of efficacy against cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion injury in the&#xD;
      pre-clinical basic science studies, there is enthusiasm to translate these encouraging data&#xD;
      into an effective clinical strategy for the management of acute stroke in man. A recent&#xD;
      prospective, open-label, blinded outcome proof-of-concept study in Danish patients undertook&#xD;
      ischaemic per-conditioning in patients presenting with an acute stroke syndrome. With the&#xD;
      conditioning stimulus performed in the ambulance, the ischaemic stroke diagnosis was&#xD;
      made/confirmed later in hospital. In patients with confirmed ischaemic stroke, they found&#xD;
      patients in the intervention arm had a better functional status by National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health Stroke Scale score on admission and an overall smaller infarct, but the study was&#xD;
      overall neutral on the pre-specified primary endpoint (penumbral salvage, defined as the&#xD;
      volume of the perfusion-diffusion mismatch not progressing to infarction after 1 month).&#xD;
      There are useful lessons and observations to be made regarding the design of this trial that&#xD;
      influences the design of the trial proposed within this application. First, thrombolysis does&#xD;
      not guarantee re-canalisation of the culprit artery, and where restoration of blood flow does&#xD;
      occur, the time of onset of reperfusion may be unpredictable. Thus, restoration of blood flow&#xD;
      may either not have occurred, or when it had, may have occurred outside the protective&#xD;
      time-frame of the remote ischaemic conditioning stimulus (classical conditioning has a&#xD;
      protective &quot;window&quot; of typically just 2-3 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we are seeking to combine ischaemic conditioning with an effective endovascular&#xD;
      re-canalisation procedure where the success and time of reperfusion are known. Second, in the&#xD;
      Danish study, there would have been significant heterogeneity in aetiology of the presenting&#xD;
      stroke symptoms that will include both anterior and posterior circulation occlusion and also&#xD;
      small vessel disease. The pre-clinical efficacy of remote ischaemic conditioning is&#xD;
      predominantly with models of anterior circulation occlusion and therefore, we have made this&#xD;
      cohort of patients the focus of our study. And finally, there is emerging evidence that in&#xD;
      order to ensure persistent infarct size reduction, it is critical to combine both initial&#xD;
      ischaemic per-conditioning and subsequent post-conditioning to tackle both the acute&#xD;
      reperfusion injury (the first 15 minutes of reperfusion) and the subsequent second phase of&#xD;
      reperfusion injury (that occurs in the following hours and days). Thus our study is designed&#xD;
      to combine both ischaemic per-conditioning and repeated post-conditioning over the following&#xD;
      seven days to harvest the benefit of both conditioning strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, a Chinese study (RIC to both arms daily for 300 days after the initial stroke)&#xD;
      was shown to be safe and effective. While this study had a different outcome to ours&#xD;
      (attenuating the rate of stroke recurrence following the initial presentation), the efficacy&#xD;
      of the RIC intervention nonetheless provides further encouragement that RIC may be an&#xD;
      effective intervention in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary therefore, we are seeking to combine ischaemic conditioning with an effective&#xD;
      endovascular re-canalisation procedure where the success and time of reperfusion are known,&#xD;
      in a vascular territory that is known to benefit from RIC and are looking to combine both&#xD;
      ischaemic per-conditioning and repeated post-conditioning over the following seven days to&#xD;
      harvest the benefit of both conditioning strategies upon acute and inflammatory phases of&#xD;
      reperfusion injury - encompassing the period over which peak cerebral oedema is typically&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
