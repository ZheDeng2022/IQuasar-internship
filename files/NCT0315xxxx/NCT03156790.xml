  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-controlled, single-arm, open-label clinical trial to describe the PK, PD,&#xD;
      immunogenicity and safety of ASNase. All subjects enrolled will receive the IP recombinant&#xD;
      ASNase (Spectrila®). Since Spectrila is already approved in the European Economic Area for&#xD;
      first-line treatment of ALL patients of all age groups and showed similar efficacy and safety&#xD;
      in comparison to Asparaginase medac no blinding or control groups are necessary. As&#xD;
      underlying treatment protocol the BRALL 2014 treatment protocol will be used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BRALL (Brazilian Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia) treatment protocol was developed to&#xD;
      standardise adult ALL treatment in Brazil since previously each centre used a different&#xD;
      protocol. As in other treatment regimens of study groups, ASNase is an important component of&#xD;
      ALL therapy. The rationale of the BRALL protocol was to use less myelotoxic drugs as&#xD;
      daunorubicin, etoposide and cyclophosphamide and focus on more specific ALL directed&#xD;
      therapies as asparaginase and methotrexate. The higher asparaginase dose regimen was chosen&#xD;
      in BRALL 2014 to strengthen ASNase as major component of the treatment protocol while&#xD;
      etoposide administration is reduced. Native ASNase is widely used and the data investigating&#xD;
      non-inferiority, safety and tolerability of Asparaginase medac vs. Spectrila received a&#xD;
      positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Nevertheless, data on efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Spectrila in adults are limited. Therefore, robust data on PK, pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      (PD), safety and immunogenicity of Spectrila will be investigated in this trial in subjects&#xD;
      with de novo ALL. The measurement of ASNase activity is considered to correlate with clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness and therefore chosen as primary objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects eligible for participation in this clinical trial will be treated with 3 intravenous&#xD;
      doses of Spectrila of 10 000 U/m² BSA each during induction phase I of the underlying BRALL&#xD;
      2014 treatment protocol. Spectrila will be administered on Days 21, 23 and 25. Additionally,&#xD;
      the subjects (standard risk subjects only) will receive doses of 10 000 U/m² BSA Spectrila&#xD;
      each on Days 2, 4, 6, 9, 11 and 13 of the consolidation phase II, III and VI of BRALL 2014&#xD;
      treatment protocol. One final Analysis is planned.&#xD;
