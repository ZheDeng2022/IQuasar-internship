    <textblock>
      Action tremor of the arms can be an invalidizing symptom of diseases such as Essential&#xD;
      Tremor, Dystonic Tremor, Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis. In this study we compare&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of two different brain targets for deep brain stimulation (DBS) that&#xD;
      both are known to reduce action tremor of the arms. These two targets are called the VIM&#xD;
      nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) and the posterior subthalamic area (PSA), which includes the&#xD;
      Zona Incerta. Both targets can be reached by one lead (wirh four electrode contact).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that are found eligible for DBS because of severe action tremor of the arms are&#xD;
      invited to participate. After randomization, half of them are stimulated first in the VIM for&#xD;
      3 months and then in the PSA for 3 months, and the other half first in the PSA and then VIM&#xD;
      for 3 months each. Tremor severity is scored on a clinical quantitative scale at baseline and&#xD;
      at the end of each of these two 3-month periods, and eventual side-effects are registered.&#xD;
      The best target is then selected and after another 6 months scoring is repeated. We intend to&#xD;
      provide robust data about whether one of the two targets is superior to the other both&#xD;
      regarding ability to reduce tremor efficiently and to avoid or minimize side-effects, or if&#xD;
      there is no significant difference between the two targets. We also carefully check the exact&#xD;
      position of the active electrode contact in the brain and compare this with efficacy and&#xD;
      safety evaluations. Long-term follow-up is planned after 3, 5, 7 and 10 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tremor is defined as rhythmic and oscillating involuntary movements of a body part. Action&#xD;
      tremor occurs when a body part is activated, and is clinically most frequently seen in&#xD;
      Essential (idiopathic) Tremor (ET), with an overall prevalence of 0.9 %, and of 4.6 % in&#xD;
      people over 65 years. But it can also be the most disabling symptom in many other&#xD;
      neurological diseases such as dystonia, multiple sclerosis (MS), advanced Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (PD), and some spino-cerebellar ataxias/hereditary disorders with dysfunction of cerebellar&#xD;
      connections. The cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway is probably involved in all tremors. The&#xD;
      exact mechanisms that disrupt these pathways and produce tremor remain, however, largely&#xD;
      unknown. The cerebello-thalamic tract originates from the cerebellar nuclei (dentate,&#xD;
      emboliform and globose), ascends and crosses in the pons and enters the red nucleus (RN) in&#xD;
      the mesencephalon. Most fibers project further to the ventral thalamic nuclei - oralis (VO)&#xD;
      and intermedius (VIM). The posterior subthalamic area (PSA) is the region inferior to VO and&#xD;
      VIM, dorsal and posterior to the subthalmic nucleus (STN) , and lateral to RN. Its principal&#xD;
      components are the nucleus called Zona Incerta (ZI) and the fiber bundle called the&#xD;
      prelemniscal radiation (RaPrl). Whereas STN and RN are visible on standard T2-weighted&#xD;
      MRI-scans, PSA is only indirectly defined by these surrounding structures. Classification and&#xD;
      differential diagnosis of action tremor disorders can be difficult, since with rare&#xD;
      exceptions there are no confirmative diagnostic tests or biomarkers for the primary tremor&#xD;
      forms. Differential diagnosis of primary action tremor forms such as ET, Dystonic tremor (DT)&#xD;
      and Cerebellar tremor (CbT), therefore relies mainly on clinical examination and the&#xD;
      exclusion of underlying diseases causing secondary action tremors (such as PD and MS). Action&#xD;
      tremor is divided into postural (when a position is maintained), or kinetic (when a movement&#xD;
      is made). Other neurological findings (dystonia, cerebellar, pyramidal, parkinsonian,&#xD;
      neuropathic signs), and systemic signs must be assessed. Supplementary diagnostic workup&#xD;
      includes MRI in all cases to show/exclude tremor-causing lesions such as infarcts, MS plaques&#xD;
      or other inflammatory diseases, cerebellar atrophy, or atrophy or pathological signal changes&#xD;
      along the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuits, including the basal ganglia. DAT-scan&#xD;
      (131I-FP-CIT SPECT) of the DopAmine Transporter (DAT) shows reduced binding in the striatum&#xD;
      in PD and other degenerative parkinsonian disorders, but not in ET, DT or CbT. It is&#xD;
      performed in all patients who have rest tremor or other parkinsonian signs. Necessary&#xD;
      laboratory tests of blood (+/- CSF and urine) are also performed. Medical treatment available&#xD;
      for primary (and most secondary) action tremor disorders are only symptomatic. The two most&#xD;
      commonly used drugs for ET, the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol and the anticonvulsant&#xD;
      primidone both received a level A recommendation of efficacy by the American Academy of&#xD;
      Neurology in 2005. This was based on mostly small and short-term studies (3-6 weeks), showing&#xD;
      an average tremor reduction of about 50-60% in about 50% of patients. No controlled long-term&#xD;
      studies have been done, but open-label studies indicate development of tolerance and reduced&#xD;
      effect in 10-15%. Level B evidence of a probable effect has been given to other beta-blockers&#xD;
      (atenolol, sotalol) and the antiepileptics alprazolam, topiramate and gabapentin. There have&#xD;
      been no systematic studies for other tremors like dystonic or cerebellar tremors. Thus, for&#xD;
      these patients no medications with established efficacy exist, except intramuscular botulinum&#xD;
      toxin injections for dystonic head tremor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the Nucleus Ventralis Intermedius of the thalamus (VIM) is&#xD;
      still considered the target of choice for patients with disabling action tremor at most&#xD;
      centers. Open-label, mostly short-term studies of VIM-DBS in ET have reported up to 80-90%&#xD;
      reduction of action tremor, but long-term clinical experience and studies show that gradual&#xD;
      loss of tremor control over months and years occurs in many patients. Masked raters were not&#xD;
      used, except for one study. The problem termed &quot;development of tolerance&quot; to stimulation, is&#xD;
      emphasized in recent reviews and clearly limits the functional long-term benefit of VIM-DBS.&#xD;
      VIM-DBS also tends to be less effective on proximal tremor, which is often the most severe&#xD;
      symptom. Because VIM cannot be clearly outlined on MRI or mapped using microelectrode&#xD;
      recordings, targeting it employs the use of standard stereotaxic coordinates.The definition&#xD;
      of these varies between centers. They are defined in relation to the inter-commissural line&#xD;
      (ICL). Final placement of the electrode is decided after peroperative clinical testing of&#xD;
      effect on tremor and side effects in the awake patient. Bilateral VIM-stimulation is&#xD;
      associated with a relatively high rate of side effects. In a meta-analysis of 430 patients,&#xD;
      19 % had paresthesias, 9 % dysarthria, 7 % headache and 6 % unsteadiness or gait&#xD;
      difficulties. Therefore, many centers offer only unilateral stimulation to most patients even&#xD;
      if they have bilateral tremor. The limitations of VIM-stimulation have led to a renewed&#xD;
      interest in exploring the PSA as an alternative. Open label case series from several centers&#xD;
      indicate better results from PSA-DBS than VIM-DBS, particularly in reducing kinetic tremor,&#xD;
      including proximal arm tremor and intention tremor. The targeted area within the PSA varies&#xD;
      among centers. Plaha et al reported results from blinded 1-year follow-up of bilateral&#xD;
      stimulation of the caudal ZI in 5 patients with PD tremor, and 13 patients with action&#xD;
      tremors from a range of diseases (ET, MS, CbT, DT, Holmes tremor). Average improvement of&#xD;
      postural/action tremor was 88% and of rest tremor 95%. In the MS-patients, both severe&#xD;
      proximal arm tremor, truncal ataxia and severe head-and-neck tremor improved. There was no&#xD;
      significant decline of clinical efficacy or significant change in stimulation parameters&#xD;
      during serial follow-ups, but some side-effects were seen in a few patients due to misplaced&#xD;
      electrodes or edema. Blomstedt et al reported results of PSA-DBS in 21 patients with ET (most&#xD;
      unilateral), achieving on average 95% tremor reduction and 87% functional improvement in the&#xD;
      contralateral arm. Transient, mild expressive dysphasia was observed in eight patients. In&#xD;
      summary, the most frequent side-effects reported in PSA-DBS series are paresthesias,&#xD;
      dysarthria, dysequilibrium and blurred vision, and thus similar to those observed with&#xD;
      VIM-DBS, but are consistently reported to be mild and transient in almost all patients. So&#xD;
      far no controlled comparison of the efficacy and safety between stimulation of the two&#xD;
      targets has been reported.With respect to the ICL, the targets for PSA used in the above&#xD;
      studies were 10-14 mm lateral, 6-7.5 mm posterior to the midpoint of the ICL, and 2-4 mm&#xD;
      inferior. Few authors have studied different targets in the same patients. Herzog et al&#xD;
      compared stimulation with the upper electrode contacts the thalamic level, and with the lower&#xD;
      contacts 1.5mm below the ICL in 21 patients with ET or MS-tremor. The results favoured the&#xD;
      contacts below the ICL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome the limitations of today´s standard method of treating severe action tremors with&#xD;
      VIM-DBS, we are performing a double-blind, randomized, controlled and comparative study of&#xD;
      VIM-DBS versus PSA-DBS in patients with disabling action tremor. We will implant one&#xD;
      quadripolar electrode (each contact 1.5 mm, interspace 0.5 mm) so that it covers both targets&#xD;
      on one side, unilaterally or bilaterally as indicated clinically. The efficacy of stimulating&#xD;
      each target will be studied in individual patients and between patient groups in a cross-over&#xD;
      design, in two consecutive randomized 3-month periods, by the use of validated tremor scores.&#xD;
      Further continuous stimulation of the most effective target in each patient will be evaluated&#xD;
      after another 6 months. This will provide unbiased efficacy-data about the two targets, both&#xD;
      within each patient, and between patient groups. Stimulation efficacy will also be evaluated&#xD;
      in relation to the exact target localization, defined by merging post-op helical CT scan&#xD;
      (which shows the four electrode contacts), with pre-op MRI, including Diffusion Tensor&#xD;
      Imaging/fiber tracking. Such high-resolution correlation data has to date only been published&#xD;
      in a few action tremor patients world-wide, and will add important new data to aid DBS&#xD;
      targeting in the future. Since little is known about whether cognitive functions are altered&#xD;
      by the disease or the treatment, we will include neuropsychological testing before and after&#xD;
      effective DBS treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: i) Clinical evaluation and scoring. Before the patients are invited to participate,&#xD;
      they have been thoroughly evaluated for correct diagnosis, including a complete clinical&#xD;
      neurological examination, MRI of the head/brain (+/- spine/spinal cord), laboratory tests,&#xD;
      etc. The inclusion examination ensures that inclusion criteria are fulfilled and that none of&#xD;
      the exclusion criteria are met. The study examinations include clinical examination and&#xD;
      scoring performed at baseline -end of 1. Random.per./3 mo. - end of 2. Random.per./6 mo.- 1&#xD;
      year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performed at all study visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor scale contains 21 items scored 0-4, with 0 indicating no&#xD;
           tremor/disability and 4 severe tremor (constant, high amplitude)/inability to perform a&#xD;
           task due to tremor. Item 1-9 score tremor for face, tongue, voice, head, trunk and the&#xD;
           four extremeties. For face only rest tremor is scored, for tongue, head and trunk rest&#xD;
           and postural tremor, and for the extremities action/intention tremor is also scored.&#xD;
           Items 10-13 test handwriting, and spiral drawing with right and left hand, and line&#xD;
           drawing between defined points. Item 14 tests pouring of water from one plastic cup to&#xD;
           the other, and Item 15-21 describe functional disability of speaking, feeding (not&#xD;
           liquids), bringing liquids to mouth, hygiene, dressing, writing, working.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life in Essential Tremor- scale (QUEST). A 30 item questionnaire developed&#xD;
           specifically for tremor patients, evaluating quality of life, cognitive, and emotional&#xD;
           aspects of the tremor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VAS of Global Disease Burden (patient evaluated). Visual analogue 0-10 centimeter&#xD;
           continuous scale, on which the patient scores at which severity they assess the global&#xD;
           tremor disease burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. A well-established and validated self-report&#xD;
           questionnaire which contains 14 items expressing emotions, alternating between 7&#xD;
           emotions of anxiety and 7 of depression. Scores for each item ranging from 0-3. Cut-off&#xD;
           sum-scores exist for clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression,&#xD;
           respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition,complete neurological exam. and neuropsychological testing is performed at&#xD;
      baseline and at 1 year of DBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Operation. Preoperative axial MRI sequences (T2-weighted fast-spin-echo,&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo-planar imaging, and 3D inversion prepared T1-weighted&#xD;
      gradient-echo) will be obtained on a 3 Tesla MRI-scanner the day before the operation. In&#xD;
      local anaesthesia a CRW™ stereotactic frame, (Radionics, MA, USA) is mounted, placed&#xD;
      parallell to the AC-PC line, before performing a stereotactic 3D CT scan. The MRI and CT&#xD;
      scans are merged using the iPlan™ (version 3.0 or later) computer-aided neuronavigation&#xD;
      system (BrainLAB, München, Germany), which is also used to plan the targets based on&#xD;
      predefined stereotactic coordinates for VIM and PSA, refined according to relationship to the&#xD;
      MRI-visible STN and RN. Trajectory angle will be chosen to cover VIM and to enter PSA&#xD;
      slightly posterior and medial to STN, at the level of maximal diameter of RN. To ensure&#xD;
      safety, trajectories are always planned to avoid vessels, sulci and ventricles.&#xD;
      Microelectrode recordings (MER) will not be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical test stimulation will be performed in the awake patient, at four 2 mm steps, from 8&#xD;
      mm above the most caudal target in the PSA (Caudal Zona Incerta) using the permanent&#xD;
      quadripolar electrode, and the placement accepted if good tremor suppression is confirmed and&#xD;
      no unacceptable side effects observed. Electrode position is checked using perioperative&#xD;
      radiography, and the electrodes fixed to the scull. After removal of the stereotactic frame,&#xD;
      the electrodes are connected to a pulse generator implanted in the subclavicular or abdominal&#xD;
      region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Randomization periods/stimulation treatment. Half the patients are randomized to receive&#xD;
      VIM-stimulation from 0-3 months after surgery and then switched to receive PSA-stimulation&#xD;
      for the next 3 months, and the other half to receive PSA-stimulation the first three months&#xD;
      and VIM-stimulation the next 3 months. During these two randomization periods the pulse width&#xD;
      will be held constant at 60 microseconds and frequency 130 Hz, monopolar mode (bipolar mode&#xD;
      only if monopolar leads to intolerable side effects). Current should not exceed 3 mA during&#xD;
      the randomization periods. After scoring at the end of the last 3-month randomization period,&#xD;
      the electrode contact yielding the best tremor reduction with no or only minor/possible side&#xD;
      effects is chosen for further treatment. During follow-up to 1-yr post-op there may be 2&#xD;
      additional visits for optimal adjustment of stimulation parameters. Randomization is&#xD;
      performed through a web-based program provided by Faculty of Medicine, unit for Applied&#xD;
      Clinical Research at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) Neuropsychological examinations. A standard set of well-known and validated&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests will be performed pre-op and 1-yr post-op.&#xD;
