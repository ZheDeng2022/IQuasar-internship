    <textblock>
      Burden of HF in India is approximate 2-5 million patients with an estimated prevalence of&#xD;
      2-3/1000 population. HF is responsible for approx1.8 million admissions annually in India.&#xD;
      Very few studies are there in India which shows the detailed documentation of HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manipal Heart failure Registry (MHFR) is an institutional level Heart Failure disease&#xD;
      registry. In MHFR the investigator will document the detailed information about heart failure&#xD;
      patients admitted or referred to Department of Cardiology, Kasturba Medical College, a&#xD;
      constituent college and teaching hospital of Manipal University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MHFR will include cohorts of patients with acute heart failure (AHF), with the intention of&#xD;
      implementing a long-term follow-up, the use of health economic assessment to evaluate the&#xD;
      degree of resource utilization; and quantifying the burden on quality of life for patients.&#xD;
      Utilization of drug in HF patients will be evaluated as a part of this study to prevent the&#xD;
      use of inappropriate drug therapy and to improve overall drug effectiveness and outcomes.&#xD;
      Hence the protocol sought to identify the characteristics and long-term outcomes of Indian&#xD;
      patients with acute heart failure admitted in an Indian tertiary care center in South India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no risks to patients participating in the registry study, as standard of care&#xD;
      quality will not be affected. It is unlikely that there will be any direct benefit as a&#xD;
      result of participation in the HF-disease registry. However, the information contained within&#xD;
      this non-interventional registry study will be used for research studies directed at&#xD;
      improving the knowledge and treatment of acute heart failure as well as improving patients&#xD;
      treatment in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential impact of proposed research (Manipal Heart Failure Registry) is envisioned to&#xD;
      be four-fold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to enable a broad overview of the routine medical practices for HF treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to assess the healthcare resource utilization and drug utilization review for heart&#xD;
           failure patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to assess the burden of disease (mortality, re-hospitalization) in the long term; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to provide a novel overview of the impact of HF syndrome on quality of life as well as&#xD;
           health economics.&#xD;

      RESEARCH GAPS IDENTIFIED:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a couple of registry studies in India have followed patients for not more than one year&#xD;
      and therefore long-term data on disease management and healthcare resource utilization and&#xD;
      health economics has never addressed adequately. Typically, these studies have focused&#xD;
      primarily upon inpatient HF clinical profiles, where detailed long-term documentation of&#xD;
      cardiac function, treatment patterns, and outcomes is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term follow up of heart failure patients can identify the disease characteristics,&#xD;
      clinical outcomes and help in the development of a disease progression model, thereby&#xD;
      eventually improving the practice standards. Proper utilization of healthcare resources&#xD;
      decrease in-hospital and follow up mortality in heart failure patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team also hypothesize that the commonest cause of acute heart failure in our&#xD;
      population in present era is myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed observational study is a single center HF-disease registry that will document&#xD;
      the routine patterns of diagnosis and medical care for heart failure as well as treatment&#xD;
      type, long-term HF-related clinical events, and re-admission rates following the acute&#xD;
      admission index event. In addition to the long-term data collection, the study will also link&#xD;
      treatment plans and clinical outcomes, to identify best practice in the HF treatment, as well&#xD;
      as extent of healthcare resources use. The registry will also collect data on health-related&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients and caregivers may only be included in the study after providing written&#xD;
      (witnessed, where required by law or regulation), IRB/IEC-approved informed consent, or, if&#xD;
      incapable of doing so, after such consent has been provided by a legally acceptable&#xD;
      representative of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS AND BENEFITS There are no risks to patients participating in the registry study, as&#xD;
      standard of care quality will not be affected. It is unlikely that there will be any direct&#xD;
      benefit as a result of participation in the HF-disease registry. However, the information&#xD;
      contained within this non-interventional registry study will be used for research studies&#xD;
      directed at improving the knowledge and treatment of acute heart failure as well as improving&#xD;
      patients' treatment in the future.&#xD;
