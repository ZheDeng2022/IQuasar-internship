  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The digestive system may be involved in various pathologic conditions, with different&#xD;
      inflammatory, metaplastic and neoplastic aspects. As the therapeutic tool-box for digestive&#xD;
      diseases grows and becomes more focused, at times targeting specific molecules, decision&#xD;
      making in managing patients becomes more and more important, and must be evidence based.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defining biomarkers with predictive value will theoretically allow physicians in making&#xD;
      diagnosis, deciding on a suitable first line therapy (with specific endpoints suggesting&#xD;
      response or indicating 2nd line therapy is indicated) and finally may suggest surgical&#xD;
      intervention is warranted, thus forming an &quot;individually tailored treatment&quot; for each&#xD;
      patient. These biomarkers may be located in the peripheral blood, in the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract in general, or confined to specific intestinal lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chitinase 3-like 1 protein (YKL-40) is produced by different tissues (e.g. - synovium, smooth&#xD;
      muscle, intestinal epithelium). Its specific action is unknown, but several reports have&#xD;
      described it in different inflammatory conditions including those involving the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal system. Chitinase 3 like-1 protein (YKL-40) has also been studied for its&#xD;
      possible role in angio and onco-genesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of peripheral and tissue&#xD;
      Chitinase 3-like-1 (YKL 40) levels in gastrointestinal and liver diseases.&#xD;

      For periphery tests: 10 ml blood will be collected from all eligible subjects into SST tubes.&#xD;
      Then serum will be separated and freeze at -80 degrees until analysis of Chitinase 3 like-1&#xD;
      protein by ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For tissue tests: biopsies will be taken from colons of eligible participants. One part of&#xD;
      these biopsies will be freeze until analysis of Chitinase 3 like-1 protein by ELISA. The&#xD;
      other part of the biopsies will be placed in dishes with appropriate media and will be&#xD;
      incubated in 37 degrees in order to follow cytokine secretion for 24 h. Media will be&#xD;
      collected after 24 h and then freeze until further analysis of Chitinase 3 like-1 protein by&#xD;
      ELISA. The investigators will also measure mRNA levels of Chitinase 3 like-1 protein in&#xD;
      collected biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will try to correlate between the Chitinase 3 like-1 protein levels in the&#xD;
      blood and in tissue among various groups of participants and will compare between healthy&#xD;
      participants and IBD participants. The investigators will also follow mRNA expression in&#xD;
      tissue biopsies taken from all the participants.&#xD;

      The study allows the measurements of chitinase 3 like 1 proteins in blood and tissues. Upon&#xD;
      consenting to participation in the study, each volunteer may consent to specimens' storage&#xD;
      and additional testing. Even though the samples contain DNA, and participation may include&#xD;
      analysis in the RNA level, direct DNA sequencing will not be performed and is not included in&#xD;
      the additional testing permitted by the subject.&#xD;
