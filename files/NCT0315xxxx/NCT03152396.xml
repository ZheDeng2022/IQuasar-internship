  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) (disease of the heart and blood vessels) is one of the leading&#xD;
      causes of death and disability in Canada today. The majority of CVD cases are caused by&#xD;
      factors that can be controlled. These factors include tobacco use, obesity, high blood&#xD;
      pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and physical inactivity. Such factors are common and&#xD;
      not well controlled. Inflammatory arthritis (IA) (Inflammation of the joints and other&#xD;
      tissues) is considered another risk factor or CVD. As such, people who have IA and any of the&#xD;
      previously mentioned risk factors would be at high risk for developing CVD. Controlling these&#xD;
      factors will bring down the risk of having cardiovascular disease and make the quality of the&#xD;
      individuals' life better. Pharmacists work with patients and their family doctors to provide&#xD;
      cardiovascular care. Having a pharmacist involved in the care process may help patients with&#xD;
      IA reduce their CV risk. Pharmacists are easier to reach and may have more opportunities to&#xD;
      educate people about medications. This might lead to better prevention and control of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      worldwide and in Canada accounting for nearly one third of the total deaths in both&#xD;
      instances.1-2 The majority of CVD cases are caused by modifiable risk factors such as tobacco&#xD;
      use, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and physical inactivity.3 Inflammatory&#xD;
      arthritis, inclusive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and ankylosing&#xD;
      spondylitis (AS), is also recognized as an independent risk factor for CVD.4-7&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF) and CV&#xD;
      death among patients with IA is 2-3-fold greater than in the general population.8-10 This&#xD;
      increased CV risk reflects the combined impact of systemic inflammation, burden of&#xD;
      traditional CVD risk factors and impact of certain medications (e.g. steroids, non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatories [NSAIDs]).5,6 An elevated risk of CVD can be identified early after IA&#xD;
      diagnosis, emphasizing the need for early efforts in CV risk screening.11&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite being recommended by international IA management guidelines,7 CV risk assessment has&#xD;
      not been incorporated into clinicians' daily routine.7 Indeed, it has been reported that such&#xD;
      assessments generally only exist in larger centers for non-rheumatology patients.12-14&#xD;
      Moreover, Keeling and colleagues reported that most rheumatologists, who are the main care&#xD;
      givers for IA patients, conducted suboptimal CV risk assessments. 15 This gap in care for&#xD;
      patients with IA is not consistently absorbed by family physicians due to lack of recognition&#xD;
      of CV risk in these patients and competing demands of other healthcare needs (e.g. other&#xD;
      chronic diseases, cancer, diabetes). 7&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special considerations need to be taken into account when calculating CV risk in patients&#xD;
      with IA, as the 'classic' risk engines (such as Framingham16) might underestimate the overall&#xD;
      risk,17 since they have not been adequately evaluated in this patient population.18,5 For&#xD;
      example, IA patients who might benefit from lipid-lowering agents may be categorized &quot;low&#xD;
      risk&quot; when using the Framingham risk engine.17 As such it has been recommended to use a&#xD;
      modified Framingham risk engine (multiply the overall risk with 1.5) in patients with IA. 19&#xD;
&#xD;
      CV risk screening and management in patients with IA takes time and effort, but can be&#xD;
      performed by other trained health professionals. As such, it has been recommended to utilize&#xD;
      a multidisciplinary approach (integration of rheumatology, cardiology and primary care) to&#xD;
      support the care of IA patients.6,20-23 Pharmacists are front line, accessible, primary&#xD;
      healthcare professionals who see patients more frequently than any other healthcare&#xD;
      provider.24 The efficacy of their interventions in managing chronic diseases including&#xD;
      osteoarthritis,25, diabetes,7, 26 dyslipidemia,27 hypertension,28,29 heart failure,30 and CVD&#xD;
      31-34 has been well demonstrated in the literature. Pharmacists can systematically identify&#xD;
      patients at high risk of CVD,35 improve their medication use,36 and help them achieve their&#xD;
      treatment targets.27,28 In addition to clinical outcomes, pharmacist involvement in patient&#xD;
      care is associated with improved patient satisfaction and adherence to therapy.28,35,36 This&#xD;
      evidence, coupled with their advanced scope of practice, ideally position pharmacists to&#xD;
      conduct CV risk screening and management. In addition, Canadian pharmacists have access to&#xD;
      practice guidelines for management and prevention of cardiovascular disease in the general&#xD;
      population.37 They also have access to the RxEACH CV risk calculator, an interactive CV&#xD;
      screening and management tool, which will help them determine CV risk, simply communicate&#xD;
      contributing risks to patients, and show patients the impact of modifying their risks. 34&#xD;
