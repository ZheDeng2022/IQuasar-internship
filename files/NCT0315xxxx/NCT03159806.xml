  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be invited to participate from an outpatient nephrology clinic at Hammersmith&#xD;
      Hospital. They will have a microdialysis catheter inserted into a peripheral vein and&#xD;
      connected to a sampling system. The samples will be sent for analysis in the hospital&#xD;
      laboratory. All medical devices to be used are already CE-marked and approved for these&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;

      Patients attending Professor Tam's outpatient clinic will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
      study. After time to read the relevant protocol and consent form, and agreeing to proceed, a&#xD;
      patient will be taken to a separate room in the outpatient department by Dr. Robert M.&#xD;
      Learney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this room, the patient will have a suitable vein identified on the forearm or back of the&#xD;
      hand. Dr. Learney will then insert a venous cannula into the vein with aseptic technique,&#xD;
      secure it in place, and then draw a 3-5mL preliminary blood sample for creatinine and&#xD;
      potassium analysis in the hospital lab. Outpatients attending the nephrology department would&#xD;
      have one blood test for these biochemicals (and others) taken as part of routine care anyway.&#xD;
      This sampling would replace the routine blood test for this attendance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Learney will then insert a single-use type 67 intravenous microdialysis catheter into the&#xD;
      venous cannula, attach a sampling vial to the outlet of the catheter, and a pump for&#xD;
      delivering a sterile saline solution to the inlet of the catheter. All devices and liquids&#xD;
      are CE-marked and licensed for human use. Half of the 20 patients in the study will have a&#xD;
      short 1cm microdialysis catheter inserted, and half will have a longer 2cm microdialysis&#xD;
      catheter inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pump will be started at a flow rate of 2 microlitres per minute, and 50 microlitres of&#xD;
      sample will be collected over the next 25 minutes. The patient will be free to walk around&#xD;
      and/or read a book, but must return at the end of 30 minutes for the sample vial to be&#xD;
      exchanged for a new one. At this point the pump flow rate will be adjusted down to 1&#xD;
      microlitre per minute by turning a small dial on the side. The patient will be free again for&#xD;
      the next 50 minutes to produce the next 50 microlitres of sample. The sample vial will be&#xD;
      exchanged again at this point, and the flow rate adjusted down one final time to 0.5&#xD;
      microlitres per minute for 100 minutes to collect a final 50 microlitres of sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this final experiment, the patient will have the microdialysis catheter removed from&#xD;
      the cannula for inspection and disposal. A final 3-5mL blood sample will be withdrawn from&#xD;
      the cannula, and if this is not possible then it will be taken from a different visible vein.&#xD;
      These first and last blood draws ensure that the baseline levels of the two chemicals of&#xD;
      interest have not changed significantly during the three hours of the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All samples collected in this experiment will be assayed in the hospital laboratory for the&#xD;
      biochemicals of interest.&#xD;
