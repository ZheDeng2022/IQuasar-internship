      The investigators are conducting a prospective study to determine the safety and outcomes of&#xD;
      placebo-controlled graded drug challenges without prior skin testing in patients with a&#xD;
      low-risk history of antibiotic hypersensitivity reaction based on history alone. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the rate of reaction to graded drug challenges without prior&#xD;
      skin testing in patients with a low-risk history of drug hypersensitivity reaction based on&#xD;
      history alone will not be meaningfully more than the rate of reaction to placebo. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the rate of adverse reactions to drug challenges without prior&#xD;
      skin testing will not be meaningfully more than the rate of adverse reactions with prior skin&#xD;
      testing as was observed in the investigators' historical clinic cohort.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Graded drug challenges are the gold standard to exclude an immediate hypersensitivity&#xD;
      reaction in patients with a low likelihood of drug allergy and are considered standard of&#xD;
      care. Patients who tolerate a graded challenge are deemed to not be allergic to the drug and&#xD;
      are not at increased risk for future reactions compared with the general population. Prior&#xD;
      studies of graded challenges in appropriately selected patients have demonstrated low&#xD;
      reaction rates with symptoms that were mainly mild and subjective in nature. The&#xD;
      investigators are conducting a prospective study to determine the safety and outcomes of&#xD;
      placebo-controlled graded drug challenges without prior skin testing in patients with a&#xD;
      low-risk history of antibiotic hypersensitivity reaction based on history alone. Skin testing&#xD;
      requires a separate visit and is, therefore, more time-consuming and costly than performing a&#xD;
      graded challenge without skin testing. The investigators believe that they can determine if&#xD;
      patients are at low-risk to react to an antibiotic based on a detailed history and,&#xD;
      therefore, do not require skin testing prior to a challenge. Given the majority of symptoms&#xD;
      to graded drug challenges reported in prior studies were mild and subjective, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the rate of reaction to graded drug challenges without prior&#xD;
      skin testing in patients with a low-risk history of drug hypersensitivity reaction based on&#xD;
      history alone will not be meaningfully more than the rate of reaction to placebo. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the rate of adverse reactions to drug challenges without prior&#xD;
      skin testing will be not meaningfully more than the rate of adverse reactions with prior skin&#xD;
      testing as was observed in the investigators' historical clinic cohort. All patients age 7&#xD;
      years or older with a history of a non-life-threatening reaction to an antibiotic are&#xD;
      eligible to participate in a placebo-controlled graded drug challenge. The challenge is&#xD;
      comprised of placebo followed by 30 minutes of observation, 1/10th of the treatment dose of&#xD;
      the antibiotic the patient reported a reaction followed by 30 minutes of observation, and the&#xD;
      full dose of the antibiotic followed by 1 hour of observation. All patients will be contacted&#xD;
      via telephone within one month of a negative challenge to determine whether they experienced&#xD;
      a delayed reaction. All patients will also be contacted via telephone within one year of a&#xD;
      negative challenge to determine if they have safely taken the challenge drug.&#xD;
