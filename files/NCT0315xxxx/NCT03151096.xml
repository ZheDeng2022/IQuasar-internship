  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension, which results from a combination of multiple lifestyle and genetic factors, is&#xD;
      a global public health problem affecting 1 billion people worldwide. The identification of&#xD;
      cheap treatment interventions without adverse side effects would be hugely advantageous&#xD;
      particularly in low-income settings with high prevalence of hypertension such as sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa where up to 46% of adults are affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging evidence links a functional polymorphism in the MTHFR gene (rs1801133 C677T),&#xD;
      encoding the folate-metabolising enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase to high blood&#xD;
      pressure in adults. Variation at rs1801133 is relatively common and has 3 genotypes;&#xD;
      homozygous &quot;normal&quot; CC, heterozygous CT and homozygous &quot;variant&quot; TT genotypes. Of these&#xD;
      genotypes, the homozygous &quot;variant&quot; TT is more strongly associated with a higher BP. The&#xD;
      precise mechanism by which MTHFR is associated with BP remains unclear. It has been recently&#xD;
      shown in 3 separate randomized controlled trials that BP is highly responsive to riboflavin&#xD;
      and that this response is differential by MTHFR rs1801133 genotype. In all these clinical&#xD;
      trials, significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed in&#xD;
      the homozygous variant TT genotype and an intermediate effect seen in those with the&#xD;
      heterozygous CT genotype. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of riboflavin&#xD;
      supplementation on blood pressure in a riboflavin-deplete population as well as comparing&#xD;
      plasma riboflavin status before and after supplementation. This will be achieved by&#xD;
      conducting a randomized single-blind placebo controlled trial over a period of 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will use the Keneba biobank to invite about 100 adults with the CT genotype&#xD;
      and a similar number of age-, sex and village-matched CC homozygotes. Participants within&#xD;
      each of the groups will be randomized to receive either riboflavin (5mg/d) or a matching&#xD;
      placebo which would be supplied on a weekly basis. Blood sample, blood pressure measurement,&#xD;
      socio-demographic data and their anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist and hip&#xD;
      circumference and body composition by BIA) will be taken during the initial visit. An&#xD;
      additional blood sample will be taken at the end of the study whilst additional BP&#xD;
      measurements will be taken respectively at 8 weeks and at the end of the intervention. The&#xD;
      possibility that riboflavin deficiency represents a new, easily-correctible causal factor in&#xD;
      hypertension in sub-Saharan Africa would require further large-scale interventions if this&#xD;
      pilot study yields encouraging results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a recall-by-genotype randomized single-blind placebo-controlled micronutrient&#xD;
      supplementation trial. The Keneba biobank will be used to identify all potential participants&#xD;
      i.e. individuals genotyped for MTHFR C677T for this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will invite all 163 adults with the CT genotype in the Keneba biobank and a&#xD;
      similar number of age- sex- and village-matched CC homozygotes to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Field assistants will visit the homes of potentially eligible participants, to provide full&#xD;
      information about the purpose and methods of the study, potential risks and benefits, and&#xD;
      participants' rights. Participants will then provide written informed consent. The field&#xD;
      assistant will ensure that the conversation and consent process occurs in a private area or&#xD;
      room, to maintain privacy and confidentiality. After exclusions and non-consenters the&#xD;
      investigators anticipate at least 102 subjects per group. Using standard deviation estimates&#xD;
      from our own and published literature (14mmHg for SBP and 10mmHg for DBP) the investigators&#xD;
      will have 95% confidence (at p&lt;0.05) of detecting differences of 3.88mmHg for SBP and&#xD;
      2.76mmHg for DBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants within each of the groups will be randomized to riboflavin or placebo in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio according to a computer generated randomization scheme. This will be done by randomly&#xD;
      assigning study numbers within the CT carriers to a treatment group and enrolling&#xD;
      participants sequentially from lowest to highest study identification number. The subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized upon dispensing the study drug associated with the subject pair's study&#xD;
      identification number. Field, clinical, laboratory and data entry staff will be blinded to&#xD;
      the genotype of the study participants and to the identity of the treatment arm to which a&#xD;
      participant is assigned from the time of randomization to the time of unblinding. The&#xD;
      placebos are designed to be indistinguishable from the active drugs. Double-blinding is not&#xD;
      possible because subjects randomized to the riboflavin will have yellow urine (a harmless&#xD;
      outcome that will be explained to them).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will then be invited for a visit to the MRC Keneba field station. At&#xD;
      the initial visit, socio-demographic data and anthropometric measurements (height, weight,&#xD;
      waist and hip circumference and body composition by BIA) will be taken. Thereafter, BP will&#xD;
      be measured with an automated device in triplicate using a standard protocol by the same&#xD;
      investigator who will be blinded to genotype and treatment group. The investigators will also&#xD;
      collect 10ml sample of blood for laboratory assessment of vitamin B status. During the&#xD;
      intervention phase of the trial, the investigators will supplement participants with 5mg/day&#xD;
      of riboflavin or a matching placebo for 16 weeks. The pills will be supplied on a weekly&#xD;
      basis with instructions to return any unused pills. Another BP measurement following similar&#xD;
      protocol as before will be taken at 8 weeks as well as at 16 weeks after the start of the&#xD;
      intervention. Finally, a 10ml blood sample will be collected at 16 weeks. Blood samples will&#xD;
      be analysed for riboflavin, homocysteine, red cell folate, cobalamin and pyridoxine.&#xD;
      Participants who were randomized to receive placebo will be offered riboflavin&#xD;
      supplementation at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use multilevel modeling test for a main effect of intervention on&#xD;
      delta BP from baseline to 16wk (and repeated at 8wk) adjusted for sex and age. Chi-squared&#xD;
      test will be used to test for changes in frequency of raised BP (&gt;140/90). Then the&#xD;
      investigators will test for effect modification according to MTHFR variant.&#xD;
