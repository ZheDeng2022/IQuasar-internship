  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this work is to improve antenatal care (ANC) and postnatal care (PNC) at the&#xD;
      health center level in five districts in Rwanda (Bugesera, Burera, Nyamasheke, Nyarugenge,&#xD;
      and Rubavu). 36 health centers in these districts are included in this cluster randomized&#xD;
      control trial (RCT) of group ANC and PNC care to measure this alternative model's effects on&#xD;
      gestational age at birth, survival of preterm and low birth weight infants at 42 days of&#xD;
      life, and ANC and PNC coverage. To improve antenatal assessment of gestational age, nurses&#xD;
      will be trained in obstetric ultrasound at 18 health centers. These facilities will also&#xD;
      incorporate pregnancy testing with urine dipstick to be performed by community health workers&#xD;
      in charge of maternal health to facilitate early entry into ANC. This trial will test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that women who participate in this alternative model of group ANC will experience&#xD;
      increased gestational age at birth, as compared to women who receive standard focused ANC.&#xD;
      This study is a collaboration with the University of Rwanda, the Rwandan Ministry of Health&#xD;
      (MOH), the Rwanda Biomedical Center, and UCSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group care model used in this study is Rwanda-specific model developed by a Rwandan&#xD;
      technical working group. The model includes an individual clinical visit for the first&#xD;
      antenatal visit, followed by three group visits spaced about 8 weeks apart throughout&#xD;
      pregnancy and a postnatal group visit at approximately 6 weeks after birth. Women will be&#xD;
      grouped into stable groups of approximately 8-12 women with similar due dates. A community&#xD;
      health worker (CHW) and a health center nurse will work together as co-facilitators to lead&#xD;
      each of the groups. Each group visit includes clinical assessment, education, and treatments&#xD;
      as appropriate for the women who attend. The model is founded on facilitative leadership of&#xD;
      the groups, in which the co-facilitators allow women's experiences and interests to drive the&#xD;
      content and women are encouraged to help one another cope with obstacles to optimal health.&#xD;
      Facilitators will be supported by master trainers who will visit health centers to observe&#xD;
      group sessions and offer supportive feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected in this trial will include measures of the satisfaction of both women and&#xD;
      providers with the group care, content of care differences between standard and group care,&#xD;
      and perinatal outcomes such as gestational age at delivery and 42-day preterm and low birth&#xD;
      weight infant survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the effect of a group care model, which incorporates both group&#xD;
      care antenatal (ANC) and postnatal care (PNC), on the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gestational age (GA) at birth;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adherence to the recommended four ANC and one facility-based PNC visits; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mortality at 42 days among preterm and low birth weight infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this cluster RCT at the health center level, facilities will be pair-matched based on&#xD;
      factors affecting GA at delivery such as monthly ANC enrollment, quality of ANC and PNC&#xD;
      delivery, potential lost-to-follow-up (LTFU) rate, and additional criteria pertaining to&#xD;
      facility capacity. Within each pair, a facility will be randomly chosen to implement the&#xD;
      intervention, group ANC and PNC, while the control facility will continue to provide standard&#xD;
      ANC and PNC. Pairs will then be further matched with other pairs into quadruples (to the&#xD;
      extent possible), within which one pair will be assigned to additionally implement ultrasound&#xD;
      at the health center level and early pregnancy testing at the community level. Overall, each&#xD;
      facility will have one of the following assignments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1: Standard ANC and PNC care only&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2: Standard ANC and PNC care, with the addition of early pregnancy testing and&#xD;
           ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 3: Group ANC and PNC only&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 4: Group ANC and PNC care, with the addition of early pregnancy testing and&#xD;
           ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
      This design will allow a primary analysis on the difference between group care and standard&#xD;
      care and will also make it possible to assess the effect of early pregnancy testing in the&#xD;
      community and obstetric ultrasound at the health center on early entry into ANC and number of&#xD;
      visits attended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rwanda group ANC/PNC model was developed by a Technical Working Group of representatives&#xD;
      from maternal-child health stakeholders in Rwanda. Key characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Women sit in a circle in a group space where confidentiality and mutual respect are&#xD;
           prioritized. Key messages consistent with Rwanda's ANC/PNC packages are delivered&#xD;
           through facilitated discussion; women speak more than the facilitators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Women and newborns receive the routine assessments, screening, and treatments described&#xD;
           in the Rwanda guidelines, as well as treatments indicated for special conditions. Health&#xD;
           assessments are conducted at the start of the visit, and women participate as much as&#xD;
           possible in their own self-assessments. Individual consultations with facilitators are&#xD;
           conducted in a semi-private area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Two co-facilitators lead each group visit (one midwife/nurse and one CHW).&#xD;
           Co-facilitators &quot;debrief&quot; after every group visit in a continuous learning and quality&#xD;
           improvement process. The group care co-facilitators are trained and supported by 6&#xD;
           Rwandan Master Trainers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Women can return to the health facility at any time for evaluation of danger signs or&#xD;
           other concerns. Referrals to the district hospital are done per current national&#xD;
           guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both control and intervention sites, as well as district hospitals that may receive referrals&#xD;
      from our study sites, will receive the initial intervention of data strengthening and&#xD;
      training around data use activities so as to improve the quality of data being collected and&#xD;
      strengthen outcome measurement within all facilities involved in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, in order to evaluate other secondary outcomes, data will also be collected&#xD;
      through: (1) questionnaires administered to a random sample of ANC and PNC participants and&#xD;
      all providers at baseline and different time points throughout the study; (2) observations&#xD;
      and debriefs of group care sessions; (3) qualitative research around acceptability of the&#xD;
      group model from participants and providers; (4) cost-effectiveness analysis of the group&#xD;
      care model.&#xD;

    <description>The primary intervention is group antenatal and postnatal care wherein women receive their care in a group with other women with similar due dates. After an initial individual visit all care is given in groups although the majority of the time is dedicated to facilitated discussion and women can come for additional acute care if needed. Group antenatal care will be three group visits between 20 and 40 weeks gestation and group postnatal care will be one group visit and approximately 6 weeks post delivery.</description>
