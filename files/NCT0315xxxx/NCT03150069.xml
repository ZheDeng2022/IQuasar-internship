    <textblock>
      The present study seeks to interview women with Morquio A and Morquio B syndrome, to explore&#xD;
      their concerns surrounding pregnancy and the impact of ERT on their perspectives, in&#xD;
      comparison with the control group of Morquio B subjects for whom no ERT treatment exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will be conducted by a health psychologist, in-person or over the telephone. Data&#xD;
      will be analyzed using MAXQDA 12.0 software and Grounded Theory. Differences in thematic&#xD;
      trends between Morquio A subjects, for whom treatment exists, and a control group of Morquio&#xD;
      B subjects, for whom there is no treatment, will be compared.&#xD;

      The present study seeks to interview women with Morquio A and Morquio B syndrome themselves,&#xD;
      to explore and discover their perspectives and concerns surrounding pregnancy and having&#xD;
      biological children, the impact of the advent of ERT for Morquio A on their perspectives and&#xD;
      concerns in comparison with the control group of Morquio B subjects for whom no ERT treatment&#xD;
      exists, as well as what each group is being told by the medical community and others in their&#xD;
      lives in this regard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will be conducted by a health psychologist, either in-person or over the&#xD;
      telephone. We will interview 1) those women with Morquio syndrome who are known to have been&#xD;
      pregnant and 2) those women with Morquio syndrome who have not been pregnant and/or chose to&#xD;
      adopt children. All information will be kept confidential, except as in accordance with&#xD;
      Georgia law relating to reporting of child or elder abuse, suicidal and/or homicidal intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using MAXQDA 12.0 software to develop code which can be used to&#xD;
      describe and compare the data using Grounded Theory. Differences in thematic trends between&#xD;
      Morquio A subjects, for whom treatment exists, and a control group of Morquio B subjects, for&#xD;
      whom there is no treatment, will be compared.&#xD;
