  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Progression Free Survival (PFS) at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of palbociclib combination treatment up to Month 12 (data recorded during 4 years of retrospective observation period)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from palbociclib combination treatment initiation until 1) clinician documented disease progression (PD) while on palbociclib, 2) death, 3) start of a new therapy line after final palbociclib dose, if the reason for discontinuation of palbociclib was disease progression, or 4) last available follow-up, whichever occurred first. Participants who did not experience a progression event (items 1, 2 and 3) were censored at date of last available follow-up. PFS (in months) was calculated as (first event date - palbociclib initiation date + 1)/30.4. Progressive disease - An increase in visible disease and/or presence of any new lesions; included cases where the clinician indicated progressive disease. Percentage of participants with PFS events at 12 months based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate were reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Progression Free Survival at Month 24</measure>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From initiation of treatment up to disease progression (data recorded during 4 years of retrospective observation period)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on palbociclib combination therapy according to the RECIST version 1.1 recorded from first dose of study treatment until disease progression due to any cause. Complete response: complete resolution of all visible disease. Partial response: partial reduction in size of visible disease in some or all areas without any areas of increase in visible disease.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Alive After 1 Year Post Palbociclib Treatment Initiation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year (Month 12) post Palbociclib treatment initiation (data recorded during 4 years of retrospective observation period)</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants alive from date of initiation of palbociclib treatment through up to 2 or above progression-based lines of therapy were recorded and reported in this outcome measure. Percentage of participants who alive after 1 year post Palbocicib treatment initiation were based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Alive After 2 Years Post Palbociclib Treatment Initiation</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years (Month 24) post Palbociclib treatment initiation (data recorded during 4 years of retrospective observation period)</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants alive from date of initiation of palbociclib treatment through up to 2 or above progression-based lines of therapy were recorded and reported in this outcome measure. Percentage of participants who alive after 2 years post Palbocicib treatment initiation were based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From initiation of treatment up to disease progression (data recorded during 4 years of retrospective observation period)</time_frame>
    <description>CBR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved complete (where 'complete response' was recorded at any time on treatment) or partial response (where 'partial response' was recorded at any time on treatment), or stable disease at greater than equal to (&gt;=) 24 weeks on palbociclib combination therapy. Stable disease was defined as no evidence of complete or partial response, and no progression on palbociclib therapy for 24 weeks or greater. Complete response - Complete resolution of all visible disease. Partial response - Partial reduction in size of visible disease in some or all areas without any areas of increase in visible disease.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From initiation of treatment up to disease progression (data recorded during 4 years of retrospective observation period)</time_frame>
    <description>Best overall response was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved complete (where 'complete response' was recorded at any time on treatment), partial response (where 'partial response' was recorded at any time on treatment) and stable disease at greater than equal to (&gt;=) 24 weeks on palbociclib combination therapy. Stable disease was defined as no evidence of complete or partial response, and no progression on palbociclib therapy for 24 weeks or greater.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Progression Free Survival (PFS) at Month 12</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from palbociclib combination treatment initiation until 1) clinician documented disease progression (PD) while on palbociclib, 2) death, 3) start of a new therapy line after final palbociclib dose, if the reason for discontinuation of palbociclib was disease progression, or 4) last available follow-up, whichever occurred first. Participants who did not experience a progression event (items 1, 2 and 3) were censored at date of last available follow-up. PFS (in months) was calculated as (first event date - palbociclib initiation date + 1)/30.4. Progressive disease - An increase in visible disease and/or presence of any new lesions; included cases where the clinician indicated progressive disease. Percentage of participants with PFS events at 12 months based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate were reported.</description>

          <population>FAS population included participants aged &gt;=18 years, diagnosed with HR+/HER- breast cancer with confirmed ABC/MBC, received palbociclib + letrozole/AI or palbociclib + fulvestrant in line with the licensed indication, had no prior or current enrolment in an interventional clinical trial for ABC/MBC, had minimum of 3 months of follow up data since palbociclib with fulvestrant initiation, or minimum of 6 months of follow up data since palbociclib with letrozole/AI initiation.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response</title>
        <description>Best overall response was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved complete (where 'complete response' was recorded at any time on treatment), partial response (where 'partial response' was recorded at any time on treatment) and stable disease at greater than equal to (&gt;=) 24 weeks on palbociclib combination therapy. Stable disease was defined as no evidence of complete or partial response, and no progression on palbociclib therapy for 24 weeks or greater.</description>
