  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a European study which is part of a larger research project (The TackSHS project)&#xD;
      funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (Grant&#xD;
      Agreement No 681040) and led by the Catalan Institute of Oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the efficacy of using personalised air quality measurements in homes&#xD;
      of smokers to encourage behaviour-change towards having a smoke-free home environment.&#xD;
      Building on recent quantitative and qualitative work showing that feedback of second-hand&#xD;
      smoke (SHS) measurement information can help motivate smokers to change their behaviour. This&#xD;
      study will develop a targeted intervention for use with socio-economically deprived smokers&#xD;
      in four countries (Scotland, Spain, Greece, Italy) across the EU. Two-hundred smokers (50 in&#xD;
      each country) will be recruited and offered low-cost, simple to operate particle counting&#xD;
      instruments to measure and log SHS levels in their home for a period of 30 days. During this&#xD;
      time near real-time, personalised feedback will be provided to, and discussed with, the&#xD;
      smoker along with target-setting and exploration of suitable methods of behaviour-change.&#xD;
      Feedback will be given via text message to mobile phones, emails and personal voice calls. A&#xD;
      final visit will gather data on changes made while a proportion of participants (10-20%) in&#xD;
      each country will take part in a further qualitative interview by phone to gather data on&#xD;
      their experience of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcomes will include quantitative measures such as changes in average and maximum fine&#xD;
      particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations and self-declared household smoking rules, while&#xD;
      qualitative data will be gathered using questionnaire and interview to explore what elements&#xD;
      of the intervention were useful/unhelpful, particularly well/poorly understood, and what were&#xD;
      the barriers for those who did not make changes. This WP will provide a comprehensive&#xD;
      database of baseline measurements of SHS concentrations in home settings from across the EU&#xD;
      with the potential to generate over 8 million minutes of measurements of household air&#xD;
      quality. Analysis of the differences by country and possible determinants of exposure will be&#xD;
      carried out.&#xD;

      Main Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To create a smoke-free environment for children of parents who smoke, by having parents&#xD;
      exchange ineffective strategies to create a smoke-free environment (e.g. smoking in another&#xD;
      room in the house) for effective strategies (e.g. smoking outside, delaying smoking, quitting&#xD;
      smoking).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the feasibility and effectiveness of using new, internet-connected air quality&#xD;
      monitors to record and upload air quality information as part of an educational intervention&#xD;
      on the effects of smoking on household air quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can low-cost, internet-connected air quality monitors effectively detect second-hand&#xD;
           smoke-related PM2.5 and relay this information to researchers?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can delivering this information together with advice about keeping homes smoke-free on a&#xD;
           daily basis over a month promote behaviour change?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is providing remote feedback on air quality levels a feasible method of engaging with&#xD;
           parents living in areas of socio-economic deprivation?&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-country study using a single arm pre-test/post-test design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SETTINGS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in smokers' homes in areas of multiple deprivation in Greece,&#xD;
      Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. These countries have variable rates of smoking&#xD;
      prevalence and a range of smoke-free places legislation, smoke-free homes policies and&#xD;
      therefore varying prevalence of childhood exposure to second-hand smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited using targeted adverts and leaflets within public sector and&#xD;
      third sector environments in socio-economically deprived areas. Environments used to recruit&#xD;
      may include nurseries, libraries, family centres and other family directed help services&#xD;
      within the community. Where necessary direct advertising using traditional or social media&#xD;
      may also be employed. Participants will be able to express interest in taking part in the&#xD;
      study by contacting the research team by phone, email or text.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a contact is made the research team will then initiate a brief telephone conversation to&#xD;
      address any queries and determine eligibility for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the potential participant is identified as suitable for inclusion and verbal consent has&#xD;
      been given then a Participant Information Sheet (PIS) will be sent to the participant by&#xD;
      email. Participants will have a minimum of 48 hours to consider the information they have&#xD;
      been sent, after which one of the researchers will contact them again to check whether they&#xD;
      are still happy to take part in the study, and if so, to arrange a suitable time for the&#xD;
      first home visit to install the Air Quality Monitor (AQM) to take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given a £10 (or equivalent in Euros) shopping voucher for taking take&#xD;
      part in the study, and a further £10 if they decide to take part in the qualitative&#xD;
      interview. These vouchers acknowledge any minimal electricity/WiFi costs incurred as a result&#xD;
      of taking part in the study, and provide a means of thanking participants' for their time in&#xD;
      participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOUSEHOLD VISITS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed, signed consent will be obtained at the beginning of the visit based on the&#xD;
      previously obtained PIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AQM will be installed in the main living area of the home by the visiting researcher. The&#xD;
      monitor will be placed in a position that should be elevated at between 0.5-1.5m from the&#xD;
      floor, and at least 0.5m from a wall, window or door. The AQM will require a functioning&#xD;
      electrical outlet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AQM will be tethered to the household WiFi network. If the participant does not have&#xD;
      wireless broadband in their home, a pre-paid 3g/4g WiFi router will be assigned and&#xD;
      installed. Where a pre-paid 3g/4g WiFi router is installed this will not permit any other&#xD;
      devices to use the connection and will solely be for transfer of data from the AQM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Knowledge, Beliefs &amp; Attitudes&quot; module previously developed for the AFRESH programme&#xD;
      (http://www.smokefreehomes.network/) will be explored with the smoker and the baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire completed. This whole process should take approximately 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AQM will then be left in situ for 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA SOURCES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Air quality monitoring Fine particulate matter will be monitored in each participant's home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Foobot (www.foobot.io) AQM will be used in this intervention. The Foobot is a low-cost&#xD;
      monitor containing particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compound (VOC), temperature and&#xD;
      humidity sensors. For the purposes of this study, the PM sensor will be used, as fine PM&#xD;
      (PM2.5) is an effective marker for the presence of SHS. Data such as VOC, temperature and&#xD;
      humidity may be utilised to help develop a predictive algorithm to help with the&#xD;
      differentiation of SHS from other sources of fine PM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Foobot's PM sensor has been tested internally in lab trials with second-hand smoke and&#xD;
      other air pollutants. Each participating institute will be assigned 8 Foobot instruments&#xD;
      providing them with the maximal capability of measuring in 8 homes per month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire at the first visit from&#xD;
      the researcher. This questionnaire will ask about their home's inhabitants, their smoking&#xD;
      behaviours, smoking rules for others in the home and questions and their intention to change&#xD;
      smoking behaviours in the home. This will validate their inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up questionnaire will gather data on changes in smoking rules in the home and views&#xD;
      on the intervention as an outcome measure. This questionnaire will be delivered at the end of&#xD;
      the 30 day intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 4 and 8 participants in each country will be recruited to take part in&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews to discuss their experience of the intervention. A shopping&#xD;
      voucher of value £10 will be provided to reimburse participants for their time. The consent&#xD;
      form and interview topic guide for this work were adopted from AFRESH Programme (see above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be stored on Foobot company servers and downloaded each day using a custom&#xD;
      programme developed by University of Aberdeen researchers No identifying information on the&#xD;
      participants will be stored on the Foobot company servers, but researchers will have access&#xD;
      to personal information, including name, address, telephone number and email address.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Email and text message feedback will be sent using the custom developed programme or (where&#xD;
      appropriate or required) personal accounts. The Clockwork SMS API (www.clockworksms.com) will&#xD;
      be used to send SMS messages over the internet, while university or insitutional email&#xD;
      accounts will be used to send emails.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal information will be treated as confidential in line with relevant country and EU&#xD;
      data protection legislation. Consent forms and questionnaires, once collected, will be posted&#xD;
      (by secure mail) to the University of Aberdeen and retained in a locked filing cabinet for&#xD;
      seven years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERSONALISED FEEDBACK&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the baseline measurement week the research team will initiate a series of&#xD;
      contacts with the participant for the following 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly a feedback text will be sent to the participant's mobile phone providing them with&#xD;
      details of their average levels of PM in the previous week (day 8). An email with a link to&#xD;
      their detailed weekly graph will also be provided on this day. This will be followed up the&#xD;
      next day (day 9) with a telephone call at a pre-arranged time to discuss their results and to&#xD;
      talk through facilitators, barriers and solutions, and planning around 'What if…' scenarios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From day 9 onwards daily text message results with supportive comments and suggestions will&#xD;
      be sent to the participant's mobile phone (days 9-29). Support phone calls providing more&#xD;
      detailed feedback and revisiting AFRESH modules &quot;Barriers, solutions and facilitators to&#xD;
      creating a smoke-free home&quot; and &quot;Planning for creating a smoke-free home&quot; will be given after&#xD;
      week 2 (day 16) and 3 (day 23). Weekly graphs/reports will be sent by email to the&#xD;
      participant the day prior to these telephone conversations (day 15 and 22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 30 the researcher will visit with personalised feedback covering the whole one-month&#xD;
      period grouped in to the 4 previous weekly blocks. Discussion will be around progress&#xD;
      achieved and plans for the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LOCAL VARIATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out in Scotland (the UK), Catalonia (Spain), Greece, and Italy.&#xD;
      The general protocol will be similar in all four countries with some minor changes to the&#xD;
      recruitment process depending on local and cultural norms. Consent forms, questionnaires, the&#xD;
      PIS and email and text messages will be translated into local languages as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POWER CALCULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      At an individual country level the study will recruit 50 households to participate. Using&#xD;
      PM2.5 concentrations in the final 7 days of the 30 day measurement period as the study&#xD;
      primary outcome measure, and assuming that participants achieve a 50% reduction in fine&#xD;
      particle levels compared to the baseline measurements in days 1-7, a sample of 35 will give a&#xD;
      power of &gt;80% with an alpha level of 0.05. This is based on data gathered from the First&#xD;
      Steps to Smoke-Free (FS2SE) project where it wasfound an average baseline PM2.5 concentration&#xD;
      of 67.5 µg/m3 (SD 79.7 µg/m3). Recruiting 50 subjects will thus provide sufficient numbers&#xD;
      assuming drop-out is &lt;12% (broadly in line with investigators' experience in the FS2SF study&#xD;
      where 15 participants were lost from the 117 that completed baseline). A 50% reduction in the&#xD;
      mean PM2.5 value is realistic in terms of the size of change seen in other study, REFRESH,&#xD;
      (geometric mean fell from 19 to 11 µg/m3 at one-month). Pooled across the 4 study sites&#xD;
      (assuming similar exposures) a total study size of 175 homes completing the 30 day study&#xD;
      would provide 80% power to detect a decrease of 22% in PM2.5 concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arithmetic mean concentrations of PM2.5 will be calculated for homes over the days 1-7, days&#xD;
      23-29 and whole sampling time, and presented with standard deviations and ranges. All-sample&#xD;
      mean and median concentrations over each time period will be calculated and compared for each&#xD;
      country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first descriptive analysis will be conducted for all outcomes included in the study.&#xD;
      Categorical variables will be described by raw frequencies and percentages and continuous&#xD;
      variables will be described by means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile&#xD;
      range (IQR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medians and IQR of PM2.5 concentrations will be calculated by country and overall for the&#xD;
      complete intervention group. Box-plots will be used to visualize the distribution of PM2.5&#xD;
      concentrations. A separate secondary analysis of data by country will also be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis will be conducted using Microsoft Excel 2013 and IBM SPSS v24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in line with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki, along with applicable EU and local legislation.&#xD;
