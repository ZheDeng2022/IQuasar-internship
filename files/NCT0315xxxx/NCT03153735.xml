  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to confirm the efficacy and safety of transdermal penis enlargement&#xD;
      for 24 weeks after CMDHA0101 injection in subjects who wanted penile enlargement in male&#xD;
      patients with small-penis syndrome *.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Small-penis syndrome is the anxiety of thinking one's penis is too small - even though it&#xD;
      isn't.&#xD;

      This study was designed as a 24-week, randomized, blinded, active control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject signing a clinical trial agreement and satisfying the selection / exclusion&#xD;
      criteria is enrolled in this clinical trial, he / she will receive the medical device for&#xD;
      clinical testing at the baseline time, return to his / her home after the training . At 4&#xD;
      weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after the application of the medical device for clinical&#xD;
      testing at baseline, the safety, penile girth, length, and satisfaction of the subject were&#xD;
      evaluated. 24 weeks after application, the clinical trial sponsor (or trustee) retrieves the&#xD;
      data necessary for the analysis of results, such as case records, for the purpose of validity&#xD;
      and safety evaluation&#xD;
