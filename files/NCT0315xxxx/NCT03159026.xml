  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The natural history of patients with PA-AMV has not been systematically studied before and&#xD;
      there is no published data in the literature about this condition since 1980. There is no&#xD;
      evidence-based approach to care of these patients, particularly the younger patients who may&#xD;
      no come to medical attention until significant cardiac problems develop. Through systematic&#xD;
      review of existing medical records on essentially all known patient with this condition,&#xD;
      investigators plan to develop an evidence-based management plan for preventive care of these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study is designed to provide a comprehensive description of the clinical and biochemical&#xD;
      features of propionic academia, Amish/Mennonite variant (PA-AMV). From these data, the&#xD;
      investigators hope to identify biomarkers for assessment of clinical course and efficacy of&#xD;
      ongoing management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to identify essentially all known patients who have the&#xD;
      Amish/Mennonite variant of Propionic academia (PA-AMV) through collaboration with clinicians&#xD;
      who proved care to this extended community. Signed consents include permission to access&#xD;
      life-long medical records to allow investigators to define the natural history of this&#xD;
      biochemical variant condition. This will include a description the clinical and biochemical&#xD;
      features and natural history of patients with propionic acidemia in the Amish/Mennonite&#xD;
      population. In particular, there is interest in the cardiac complications of this variant, so&#xD;
      investigators will analyze EKG, echo and cardiac MRI findings in above patients. These data&#xD;
      will be used to Identify biomarkers for clinical assessment and ongoing management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been no published data on patients with PA-AMV since 1980. Accumulated clinical&#xD;
      experience with PA Amish/Mennonite variant patients suggests that these patients tend to have&#xD;
      less severe clinical features compared to classic PA. Severe neonatal metabolic&#xD;
      decompensation and ketoacidosis are not present in Amish/Mennonite patients we have followed.&#xD;
      Describing the natural history and clinical course is essential in this group of patients to&#xD;
      further guide their management. There is currently no evidence-based approach to care of&#xD;
      these patients, but rather individual medical centers manage patients symptomatically and&#xD;
      differently. A uniform, data-driven approach to patient management is needed.&#xD;
