  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the effect of a test antimicrobial oral rinse from Next Science on the prevention&#xD;
      of oral biofilm formation and thereby preventing gingivitis by monitoring the oral microbial&#xD;
      flora and measuring gingival inflammation and bleeding.&#xD;

      Baseline, Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to this visit subjects will be asked not to perform any oral hygiene the morning of the&#xD;
      visit. They will also be asked not to use medicated lozenges, breath mints, toothpicks, eat,&#xD;
      drink (except water), smoke and/or chew gum the morning of the study visit. Subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to read and sign an informed consent and they will be given a signed copy. Personal&#xD;
      medical history information will be reviewed and retained as site source documentation.&#xD;
      Demographic Information and entrance criteria will be assessed. A comprehensive oral&#xD;
      examination will then be conducted to evaluate the oral and perioral region, including hard&#xD;
      and soft tissues. This will include periodontal charting for pocket depths, plaque scores as&#xD;
      well as gingival index and bleeding scores. Plaque samples will be collected from the&#xD;
      following four sites- mesial surface of maxillary first molar on left side, distal surface of&#xD;
      maxillary first premolar on right side, mesial surface of mandibular second molar on left&#xD;
      side and distal surface of mandibular lateral incisor on right side. If any of these four&#xD;
      teeth are missing, the next tooth mesial to it will be used to collect the plaque sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Dental Prophylaxis, Oral Hygiene Instruction and Product Dispensation Subjects will&#xD;
      receive a whole-mouth dental prophylaxis by the dental hygienist. For logistical reasons, the&#xD;
      Dental Prophylaxis visit may occur within 2 weeks of the Baseline Visit. This visit will also&#xD;
      include instructions on oral hygiene, dispensation of tooth brush/toothpaste and the oral&#xD;
      rinse product. The experimental oral rinse product and the placebo will be provided by the&#xD;
      manufacturer fully coded in prepacked bottles with the code numbers. Subjects will be&#xD;
      instructed to brush their teeth and rinse their mouth with the dispensed product twice daily&#xD;
      (AM/PM) for 30 seconds. A sheet of paper with pre-marked dates will be provided to each&#xD;
      subject for them to record the time of the day they rinsed and duration. Subjects will be&#xD;
      asked not to perform any oral hygiene the morning of their next visit. They will also be&#xD;
      asked not to use medicated lozenges, breath mints, toothpicks, eat, drink (except water),&#xD;
      smoke and/or chew gum the morning of the next study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 6, Visit 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked if they have performed any oral hygiene the morning of the visit. They&#xD;
      will also be asked if they have used medicated lozenges, breath mints, toothpicks, eaten, had&#xD;
      anything to drink (other than water), smoked and/or chewed gum the morning of the study&#xD;
      visit. The paper sheet with recording of their rinsing habits will be collected. An oral&#xD;
      examination will be conducted, an assessment of plaques and gingival scores will occur with&#xD;
      periodontal charting for pocket depths, plaque scores as well as gingival index and bleeding&#xD;
      scores. Dental plaque samples will be collected as before from the same sites. Any untoward&#xD;
      experiences and findings will be recorded (example- change in taste sensation, any ulcers,&#xD;
      blisters, etc.). New paper sheet to document their daily use of oral rinse will be provided.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked not to perform any oral hygiene the morning of their next visit. They&#xD;
      will also be asked not to use medicated lozenges, breath mints, toothpicks, eat, drink&#xD;
      (except water), smoke and/or chew gum the morning of the next study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 12, Visit 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked if they have performed any oral hygiene the morning of the visit. They&#xD;
      will also be asked if they have used medicated lozenges, breath mints, toothpicks, eaten, had&#xD;
      anything to drink (other than water), smoked and/or chewed gum the morning of the study&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The paper sheet with recording of their rinsing habits will be collected. Full mouth&#xD;
      periodontal charting to include plaque and bleeding scores as well as gingival index will be&#xD;
      recorded and dental plaque samples collected as before (from the same sites). Any untoward&#xD;
      experiences and findings will be recorded (example- change in taste sensation, any ulcers,&#xD;
      blisters, etc.). Patients will be informed of any dental treatment needs and general comments&#xD;
      and Adverse Events, if applicable, will be recorded. A subject accountability form will be&#xD;
      completed and subjects will be dismissed from the study. A subject accountability form will&#xD;
      also be completed for subjects who drop out of the study prior to its completion.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The identity of the experimental oral rinse and its placebo will be disguised. Test and control kit boxes will contain toothpaste, a toothbrush, dose cups and a timer. The kit boxes will be labeled with a unique kit number representing the test product or placebo known only to the manufacturer. Kit box labels will also contain the study number, emergency phone number, distributor name/address, appropriate caution statements, content statement and other information as required by internal regulations and clinical SOPs. Kit box content statement will be worded to maintain the study blind.</masking_description>
