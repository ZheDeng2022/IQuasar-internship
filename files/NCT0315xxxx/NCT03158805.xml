      Taken together these data support the hypothesis that liraglutide 3.0 mg sc injection will&#xD;
      reduce body weight and improve metabolic variables in obese or overweight patients with BP&#xD;
      without worsening psychiatric symptoms. The investigators predict that liraglutide 3.0 mg sc&#xD;
      injection will display greater efficacy as compared to placebo in decreasing body weight in&#xD;
      patients with BP who are obese or overweight. To prove this hypothesis, investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, 2-arm&#xD;
      clinical trial of liraglutide 3.0 mg sc injection in 60 obese or overweight outpatients with&#xD;
      stable BP. The investigators have chosen BP rather than another SMI because it is the most&#xD;
      common SMI (more common than schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) and has a&#xD;
      particularly strong association with obesity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is common among persons with severe mental illness (SMI), especially those with&#xD;
      bipolar disorder (BP) (1-5). It is estimated that 45-55% of people with SMI are obese, making&#xD;
      obesity 1.5-2 times more common among those with SMI than among the general population.&#xD;
      Indeed, in a recent pragmatic lithium trial conducted in BP, 69% of the subjects were&#xD;
      overweight or obese. Although the precise mechanism underlying the relationship between&#xD;
      obesity and SMI is unknown, it is thought to be multifactorial, involving genetic factors,&#xD;
      intrinsic features of SMI (e.g., overeating, poor dietary choices, sedentary lifestyle, and&#xD;
      sleep dysregulation), and the weight-gaining effects of most of the psychotropic medication&#xD;
      used to treat SMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, obesity is thought to contribute to the well-documented elevated mortality from&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) among those with BP. Thus, weight reduction in obese people with&#xD;
      BP might be important for reducing their morbidity and mortality from CVD and other&#xD;
      obesity-related conditions (e.g., diabetes and metabolic syndrome). Conversely, the presence&#xD;
      of obesity in patients with BP is associated with a more severe course of illness , a lower&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (18), reductions in brain gray and white volumes (19, 20), and&#xD;
      non-adherence with antipsychotic medications . Indeed, it has been hypothesized that&#xD;
      successful treatment of obesity in those with BP might benefit mental as well as physical&#xD;
      health. It is thus imperative that obesity be a focus of treatment in those with BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive behavioral weight management programs have shown some effectiveness for obesity&#xD;
      in patients with SMI, but the weight loss is modest at best and such programs are difficult&#xD;
      to implement and not widely available. Several medications have been shown to mitigate&#xD;
      psychotropic-induced weight gain, particularly metformin and topiramate, but many patients&#xD;
      either do not respond to these agents or are unable to tolerate them. Importantly, the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of newly available weight-loss agents have not been evaluated in people&#xD;
      with SMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In December 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved liraglutide [rDNA origin] 3&#xD;
      mg/day subcutaneous [sc] injection) (Saxenda®) as a treatment option for chronic weight&#xD;
      management in individuals with obesity. The drug is approved for use in adults with a body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater (obesity) or adults with a BMI of 27 or greater&#xD;
      (overweight) who have at least one weight-related comorbid condition such as hypertension,&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, or dyslipidemia, in combination with reduced-calorie diet and increased&#xD;
      physical activity. Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist.&#xD;
      Saxenda® and Victoza® contain the same active ingredient (liraglutide) at different doses (3&#xD;
      mg and 1.8 mg, respectively). However, unlike Victoza®, Saxenda® is not indicated for the&#xD;
      treatment of type 2 diabetes, as the safety and efficacy of Saxenda® for the treatment of&#xD;
      diabetes has not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several lines of evidence suggest that liraglutide 3.0 mg sc injection (Saxenda®), in&#xD;
      combination with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, would be a useful&#xD;
      weight-loss treatment for patients with BP who are overweight or obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, GLP-1 is a gut/brain peptide that is secreted from intestinal mucosal enteroendocrine&#xD;
      L cells in response and in proportion to nutrient stimulation of the gut, and that suppresses&#xD;
      food intake by acting on receptors in key areas of the brain that regulate energy balance&#xD;
      (e.g., hypothalamus and hindbrain) (34-37). In humans, administration of GLP-1 reduces food&#xD;
      intake and increases satiation in a dose-dependent manner (37). Obesity in people with BP, as&#xD;
      well as psychotropic-induced weight gain, are thought to be due to in part to increased food&#xD;
      intake (2). It is thus possible that liraglutide 3.0 mg sc injection will decrease food&#xD;
      intake in obese patients with BP, thereby reducing body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, preliminary preclinical and clinical findings suggest liraglutide 3.0 mg sc injection&#xD;
      may be effective for antipsychotic-induced weight gain and antipsychotic-induced obesity&#xD;
      (38). Thus, liraglutide has been shown to produce weight loss in animal models of&#xD;
      olanzapine-induced weight gain. In one of these studies, liraglutide also produced&#xD;
      antidepressant-like effects. (Indeed, other animal studies suggest that liraglutide may have&#xD;
      antipsychotic properties. In the only published case of liraglutide use in a patient with&#xD;
      SMI, an obese (BMI 33.5=mg/kg2) 60-year-old woman with schizophrenia treated with clozapine,&#xD;
      liraglutide (1.8mg/day) produced a sustained weight loss of 7.7 kg (an 8.7% body weight&#xD;
      reduction) over two years. Liraglutide was well tolerated and there were no psychiatric&#xD;
      adverse events (i.e., the patient's schizophrenia remained stable). At our own center, we&#xD;
      have treated a 32-year-old woman with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type and obesity&#xD;
      (BMI=36 mg/kg2) receiving one depot and two oral antipsychotics with liraglutide 3.0 mg sc&#xD;
      injection and, to date, she has lost 7.5 kg (an 8.3% body weight reduction) over a 4-month&#xD;
      period. She reports the liraglutide 3.0 mg sc injection has reduced her hunger and improved&#xD;
      her satiety. She has tolerated liraglutide 3.0 mg sc injection well and has had no&#xD;
      difficulties with giving herself the injections, her psychological symptoms have remained&#xD;
      stable, and there have been no adverse psychiatric effects. Indeed, her mild tardive&#xD;
      dyskinesia is much improved&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third, relative to other weight loss agents, liraglutide 3.0 mg sc injection has a favorable&#xD;
      psychiatric and cardiovascular adverse event profile. Regarding psychiatric events, in the&#xD;
      pivotal liraglutide 3.0 mg sc injection clinical trials, 6 (0.2%) of 3384 liraglutide 3.0 mg&#xD;
      sc injection-treated patients had suicidal ideation (one of these individuals made a suicide&#xD;
      attempt) compared with none of the 1941 placebo-treated patients. Additionally, 2.4% of&#xD;
      liraglutide 3.0 mg sc injection recipients had insomnia and 2.0% had anxiety, compared with&#xD;
      1.7% and 1.6 %, respectively, of placebo recipients. Conversely, lorcaserin (Belviq®) was&#xD;
      associated with euphoria (0.2% vs &lt; 0.1% for placebo) and is contraindicated in patient's&#xD;
      receiving serotonergic medications (and many psychotropics enhance serotonin function).&#xD;
      Phenermine/topiramate combination (Qsymia®), at the highest approved dose, was associated&#xD;
      with insomnia (11.1% vs 5.8% for placebo), depression/mood problems (7.6% vs 3.4% for&#xD;
      placebo), and anxiety (7.9% vs 2.6% for placebo). Additionally, one of the components of&#xD;
      Qsymia®, topiramate, is associated with suicidality. Bupropion/naltrexone combination&#xD;
      (Contrave®), at the highest recommended dose, was associated insomnia (9.2% vs 5.9% for&#xD;
      placebo), anxiety (4.2% vs 2.8% for placebo), and irritability (2.6% vs 1.8% for placebo).&#xD;
      Moreover, there are reports of components of these latter medications (e.g., phentermine and&#xD;
      bupropion) causing severe adverse psychiatric events, such as mania and psychosis. Taken&#xD;
      together, these findings suggest that liraglutide 3.0 mg sc injection may be the least likely&#xD;
      of these weight management medications to exacerbate psychiatric symptoms in people with BP.&#xD;
      Indeed, GLP-1 analogues have been reported to produce enhanced well-being in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together these data support the hypothesis that liraglutide 3.0 mg sc injection will&#xD;
      reduce body weight and improve metabolic variables in obese or overweight patients with BP&#xD;
      without worsening psychiatric symptoms. We predict that liraglutide 3.0 mg sc injection will&#xD;
      display greater efficacy as compared to placebo in decreasing body weight in patients with BP&#xD;
      who are obese or overweight. To prove this hypothesis, we will conduct a single-center,&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, 2-arm clinical trial of&#xD;
      liraglutide 3.0 mg sc injection in 60 obese or overweight outpatients with stable BP. We have&#xD;
      chosen BP rather than another SMI because it is the most common SMI (more common than&#xD;
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) and has a particularly strong association with&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis (es):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central research question is whether liraglutide 3.0 mg sc injection is efficacious for&#xD;
      reducing body weight in obese or overweight patients with BP. We hypothesize that liraglutide&#xD;
      3.0 mg sc injection will be an efficacious, safe, and well tolerated treatment for weight&#xD;
      loss in obese or overweight patients with stable BP. We predict that liraglutide 3.0 mg sc&#xD;
      injection will display greater efficacy as compared to placebo in decreasing body weight in&#xD;
      patients with BP who are overweight or obese without increasing psychiatric adverse events.&#xD;
      We also predict that liraglutide 3.0 mg sc injection will produce a greater percentage of&#xD;
      patients who lose ≥ 5% of baseline body weight, and improve BMI, waist circumference, fasting&#xD;
      lipid and glucose levels, HgA1c levels, and measures of eating psychopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the percent change in body weight from Baseline (Week 0) to week&#xD;
      40/Early Termination (ET) (see Table 1 for a schedule of assessments). Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      will include proportion of participants who lose ≥ 5% of baseline body weight, and change&#xD;
      from baseline in body weight (kg), BMI, waist circumference, and metabolic variables (fasting&#xD;
      lipids and glucose, and HgA1c levels). Exploratory secondary endpoints will be change from&#xD;
      baseline in eating psychopathology, assessed with the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire&#xD;
      (TFEQ) and Binge Eating Scale (BES). Safety endpoints assessed at each study visit will be&#xD;
      mental status examination, clinically-administered scales that assess psychopathology (CGI-BP&#xD;
      scale [both Severity and Improvement subscales], YMRS, MADRS, and CSSRS), vital signs, and&#xD;
      adverse events determined by clinical interview. Laboratory tests and 12-lead&#xD;
      electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be obtained at Screening, week 8, week 16/ET, and week 40/ET.&#xD;
      Compliance will be assessed at each visit with inspection of returned multi-dose pens.&#xD;
      Potential interactions between liraglutide and psychiatric medications will be monitored and&#xD;
      recorded on the Potential Drug Interaction form (see p. 28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study type:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-arm,&#xD;
      parallel-group, fixed-dose efficacy and safety study with 3 phases: a 3-27 day Screening&#xD;
      period; a 40-week randomized, double-blind Treatment period (4 weeks of dose titration and 36&#xD;
      weeks of dose maintenance); and a 1-week Follow-up (drug discontinuation) period. The purpose&#xD;
      of the 40-week Blinded Treatment phase is to establish the efficacy of liraglutide 3.0 mg sc&#xD;
      injection for weight loss in obese patients with stable BP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to screen about 90 subjects in order to randomize 60 subjects in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      drug or placebo. Patients will be recruited from the Lindner Center of HOPE, Mason, OH, a&#xD;
      University of Cincinnati College of Medicine Affiliate. Patients will be recruited by&#xD;
      clinician referral and advertisement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will include 60 outpatients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of BP that is stable, who are&#xD;
      obese or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity, and who have been receiving&#xD;
      a stable psychotropic regimen for the past three months. The weight-related comorbidities to&#xD;
      be included will be hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Allowed psychotropic&#xD;
      medications for BP will include mood stabilizers (lithium, valproate, and lamotrigine),&#xD;
      antipsychotics (asenapine, aripiprazole, cariprazine, chlorpromazine, clozapine, haloperidol,&#xD;
      loxapine, olanzapine, paliperidone, perphenazine, quetiapine, resperidone, thiothixene,&#xD;
      trifluoperazine, or ziprasidone), antidepressants, and anxiolytics (benzodiazepines,&#xD;
      gabapentin or pregabalin, and buspirone). Stable BP will be operationally defined as a&#xD;
      CGI-BP-Severity score of 1through 3 (1= normal, not at all; 2= borderline mentally ill;&#xD;
      3=mildly ill); a YMRS score ≤12; a MADRS score ≤19, and the absence of clinically significant&#xD;
      suicidality and psychosis. Participants must be 18 through 65 years of age, be able to&#xD;
      provide informed consent, and if female, be postmenopausal, surgically incapable of&#xD;
      childbearing, or practicing a medically acceptable method(s) of contraception (e.g., hormonal&#xD;
      method, intrauterine device) for at least 1 month prior to study entry and throughout the&#xD;
      study. Exclusion criteria include subjects with a lifetime DSM-5 Axis I diagnosis of&#xD;
      dementia, a psychotic or depressive disorder, or a substance use disorder within the past&#xD;
      three months; those with clinically significant psychotic features or suicidal ideation;&#xD;
      those with serious or unstable general medical illnesses; those with a personal or family&#xD;
      history of medullary thyroid cancer or Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2; those&#xD;
      who are allergic to or who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to liraglutide 3.0 mg sc&#xD;
      injection or any of its components; and females who are pregnant, nursing, or intend to&#xD;
      become pregnant. Specific entry criteria are listed below.&#xD;
