  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the most appropriate dose for the combination of&#xD;
      ibrutinib and pembrolizumab and to see if the combination is active for the disease. The&#xD;
      study will monitor for any side effects and if the combination of ibrutinib and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      works in the cancers being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 2 experimental drugs given to the subject in this study. One experimental drug&#xD;
      used in this study is called ibrutinib and the second is called pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first time that ibrutinib will be used in combination with pembrolizumab. This&#xD;
      combination is considered experimental. Experimental means that it is still being tested to&#xD;
      see if it is safe and effective. Ibrutinib is a new drug known as a 'Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase&#xD;
      (BTK) inhibitor'. Ibrutinib blocks an enzyme (protein) that affects how certain types of&#xD;
      blood cancer cells grow and survive. Blocking this enzyme is a very important mechanism in&#xD;
      killing blood cancer cells. Ibrutinib has been approved in the United States, Israel, and the&#xD;
      European Union for use in adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and adult patients&#xD;
      with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is an antibody (a type of human protein) that is being tested to see if it will&#xD;
      allow the body's immune system to work against tumor cells. Pembrolizumab is approved for use&#xD;
      by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with&#xD;
      melanoma (skin cancer) who have received prior treatments. Pembrolizumab is not FDA approved&#xD;
      to treat patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL] and mantle cell lymphoma [MCL].&#xD;

      (1) Objective: a. (Phase 1) Assess the safety of fixed dose or, as needed, de-escalated&#xD;
      ibrutinib/pembrolizumab in patients with MCL (Cohort A) and CLL (Cohort B) to determine&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. (Phase 2A): Assess CR rate of combination ibrutinib/pembrolizumab therapy, in comparison&#xD;
      to historical data of ibrutinib monotherapy, in patients with MCL (Cohort C) and CLL (Cohort&#xD;
      D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label Phase 1/2A study, which consists of Phase 1 (Safety Assessment Cohorts)&#xD;
      utilizing a 3+3 dose de-escalation design and Phase 2A (Expansion Cohorts) utilizing a single&#xD;
      arm one-stage design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receive a 28 day lead-in of ibrutinib and thereafter, a treatment 'cycle' is&#xD;
      defined as a course of treatment of 21 days starting with the intravenous administration of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab on Day 1 of each cycle along with once daily oral intake of ibrutinib on all&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The combination of ibrutinib and pembrolizumab will be safe and well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The combination of ibrutinib and pembrolizumab will result in higher CR rates compared&#xD;
           to historic data of ibrutinib monotherapy in cohorts of CLL and MCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives &amp; Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Objective: (Phase 2A): Assess duration of response, overall response rate, and duration&#xD;
      of stable disease, compared to historical data of single agent ibrutinib, in patients with&#xD;
      MCL (Cohort C) and CLL (Cohort D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The combination of ibrutinib and pembrolizumab will increase duration of&#xD;
      response, overall response rate and duration of stable disease when compared to historical&#xD;
      data of single agent ibrutinib.&#xD;

             Patients who have previously discontinued btk inhibitor therapy because of intolerance&#xD;
             may be considered for eligibility per the assessment of the PI and treating physician&#xD;
             if there is reason that the patient may better tolerate btk inhibitor therapy at&#xD;

&#xD;
         19. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
