      Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of preemptive administration of&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Piroxicam-beta-Cyclodextrin on risk and level of tooth&#xD;
      sensitivity caused by in-office bleaching procedures using 35% hydrogen peroxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty patients will be selected for this triple-blind, randomized, cross-over,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical trial. Piroxicam-beta-Cyclodextrin (200 mg) or placebo will be&#xD;
      administrated in a single-dose thirty minutes prior to bleaching procedure. The whitening&#xD;
      treatment with 35% hydrogen peroxide will be carried out in two sessions with a 7-day&#xD;
      interval. Tooth sensitivity will be assessed Immediately before bleaching agent removal and&#xD;
      up to 24 hours after each session the procedure using analog visual and verbal scales. Color&#xD;
      alteration will be assessed by a bleach guide scale 7 days after each session. Relative risk&#xD;
      to sensitivity will be calculated and adjusted by session; while comparison of overall risk&#xD;
      will performed by Fisher's exact test. Data on the sensitivity level for both scales and&#xD;
      color shade will be subjected to the Mann-Whitney and Friedman tests, respectively (α =&#xD;
      0.05).&#xD;

      Methods &amp; Materials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial was approved by the Scientific Review Committee and by the Ethics&#xD;
      Committee on Research Involving Humans at the University Hospital of the Federal University&#xD;
      of Sergipe (CAAE 50511415.1.0000.5546).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with a&#xD;
      cross-over design. The patients included will be submitted to two in-office bleaching&#xD;
      sessions receiving placebo (control) or Piroxicam-beta-Cyclodextrin prior to the bleaching&#xD;
      procedure; while different treatments will be allocated for each session. A delay of 1 week&#xD;
      between the sessions (wash-out) will be established. The study will be conducted at the&#xD;
      clinic of the School of Dentistry of the local university from December 2016 to May 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in this clinical trial will be at least 18 years old with good oral health.&#xD;
      Patients with any of the six upper anterior teeth with caries lesions, restoration, severe&#xD;
      discoloration (e.g., stains caused by tetracycline), fluorosis, gingival recession, dentin&#xD;
      exposure, periodontal diseases, pulpitis, or endodontics treatment will be excluded.&#xD;
      Participants submitted to previous bleaching procedures, presenting prior tooth sensitivity,&#xD;
      known allergy to any component of medication used in the study, Continuous use of drugs with&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory actions, pregnant or breastfeeding will be also excluded. Only patients&#xD;
      presenting all six upper anterior teeth with shade mismatching with 2.5 M2 (Vita Bleachguide&#xD;
      3D-Master scale, Vita-Zahnfabrik, Bad Sackingen, Germany) or darker will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample calculation will be based on the primary binary outcome (sensitivity risk 24 hours&#xD;
      after the procedure) for superiority trial. Power of the test will be set at 80%, considering&#xD;
      a type I error of 0.05; risk to tooth sensitivity of 90%, based on a prior study using&#xD;
      similar bleaching agent, while a reduction around 30% with the treatment will be expected.&#xD;
      The calculation resulted in fifty patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized list will be computer-generated by a person not involved in intervention or&#xD;
      evaluation. The participants were defined as blocks in the randomization process, where the&#xD;
      sequence of treatment (placebo or piroxicam-beta-cyclodextrin) will be randomly set for each&#xD;
      block by using computer-generated tables (www.sealedenvelope.com). The sequence will be&#xD;
      inserted into sealed envelopes numbered from 1 to 50 that were opened by the operator only at&#xD;
      the moment of the intervention. The patients were numbered according to the sequence of&#xD;
      enrollment. Neither the participant nor the operator knew the group allocation determining&#xD;
      blinding to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to bleaching procedure, the teeth will be cleaned using rubber cups associated to&#xD;
      pumice and water. The shades of six upper anterior teeth will be assessed on a baseline using&#xD;
      the bleach guide scale (Vita Bleach Guide,Vita-Zahnfabrik, Bad Säckinge, Germany). The&#xD;
      shades' tabs selected will be converted to scores ranging from 1 (whiter shade - 0M1) to 15&#xD;
      (darker shade - 5M3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty minutes prior to each bleaching session, the patients will receive a capsule&#xD;
      containing 20mg of piroxicam-beta-cyclodextrin or 20mg of placebo (inert content), according&#xD;
      to the randomization, while the capsules will present the same appearance. The capsules with&#xD;
      similar presentation will be manufactured by a person not involved in intervention or&#xD;
      evaluation and will be placed into two bottles identified by letters according to treatment.&#xD;
      Neither the operators responsible for intervention and evaluation nor the patients knew the&#xD;
      content of each capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A light-cured resin dam will be applied (Top Dam, FGM, Joinville, SC, Brazil) on the gingival&#xD;
      tissue corresponding to the teeth to be bleached. A 35% hydrogen peroxide based bleaching&#xD;
      agent (Whiteness HP Maxx, FGM, Joinville, SC, Brazil) will be mixed and applied on the&#xD;
      vestibular surface of teeth, remaining for 45 minutes. After this time, the bleaching agent&#xD;
      will be removed. A second session will beas carried out after 1 week following the same&#xD;
      procedures. At this time, the patient received a single-dose capsule containing&#xD;
      piroxicam-beta-cyclodextrin or placebo (different from the ones received at first session)&#xD;
      thirty minutes before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tooth sensitivity reported by patients will be recorded using both VAS and a verbal&#xD;
      rating (VRS) scales. For VAS, the patient set her/his sensitivity level by pointing with a&#xD;
      pen to the colored 10-cm scale and the distance from the border corresponding to absence of&#xD;
      pain will be recorded. Tooth sensitivity will be also scored according to VRS, where 0 =&#xD;
      none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = considerable, and 4 = severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum level of tooth sensitivity will be evaluated during the bleaching procedure,&#xD;
      during the first 24 hours and the level of sensitivity at that time. VRS will define the&#xD;
      presence (score different from 0) or absence of tooth sensitivity in all time assessments.&#xD;
      One week after each session the tooth color will be evaluated again using the same procedure&#xD;
      described previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demographic data from patients will be analyzed to determine age and gender for each&#xD;
      allocation sequence. Comparisons between the allocation sequences will be performed by the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test (age) and Fisher's exact (gender).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on presence of any tooth sensitivity (scores different from 0 for VRS), the absolute&#xD;
      risk, odds ratio and relative risk will be calculated regarding the treatments for each&#xD;
      moment of evaluation/session of bleaching, as well as its confidence intervals (95%). For&#xD;
      each moment, differences on presence/absence ratios will be analyzed by Fisher's exact test.&#xD;
      For the overall risk related to each treatment, the odds ratio will be adjusted to&#xD;
      independent variable &quot;session of bleaching&quot; using the Mantel-Haenszel statistic. The&#xD;
      homogeneity of odds ratios will be analyzed by the Breslow-Day and Tarone's tests. Following,&#xD;
      the odds ratio estimated will be converted to relative risk and the overall presence/absence&#xD;
      ratios will be analyzed by the McNemar's test, considering the study design (cross-over).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For VRS, the data from scores observed in each time of evaluation/session of bleaching will&#xD;
      be submitted to the Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Despite the measurement of tooth sensitivity&#xD;
      using VAS giving a continuous outcome, data assessed with this scale did not show a normal&#xD;
      distribution (Shapiro-Wilk's test). Thus, data from VAS will be also analyzed by the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney rank sum test, while one test per time of evaluation will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For color evaluation, comparisons between the sequences of treatment will be performed using&#xD;
      the Mann-Whitney rank sum test. The Friedman test followed by Dunn's post hoc test will be&#xD;
      used to analyze the difference between the moments of evaluation for each sequence of&#xD;
      treatment. All statistical analyses will be performed adjusting the initial significance&#xD;
      level (α = 0.05) by Bonferroni correction.&#xD;
