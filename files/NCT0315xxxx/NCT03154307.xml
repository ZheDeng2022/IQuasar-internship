    <textblock>
      Perform non-invasive neuro-navigated repeated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) at low&#xD;
      frequencies (LF) with the intent to reduce the occurrence of seizures over time (long-term&#xD;
      protocol). Seizure reduction and improvements in the quality of life in patients with&#xD;
      epilepsy will be associated with increased cortical inhibition resulting from the LF-rTMS&#xD;
      sessions over time. This procedure using rTMS at low frequencies (LF-rTMS) between 0.5 and 1&#xD;
      Hz is a safe and painless method for noninvasive focal cortical brain stimulation, which will&#xD;
      be evaluated in its efficacy at reducing/suppressing seizures. Accordingly, we propose a&#xD;
      clinical trial in patients with epilepsy to test whether LF-rTMS can improve seizure&#xD;
      suppression. The location of the presumed 3D source in the brain will be stimulated for few&#xD;
      minutes (10 to 15 min.). With the same rTMS modality, we will also perform motor threshold&#xD;
      mapping in conjunction with its fully integrated and compatible electroencephalography (EEG)&#xD;
      module. Up to 100 individuals 18 to 80 years with epilepsy will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a short-term protocol has been added to test whether LF-rTMS can reduce or&#xD;
      suppress status epilepticus in medically refractory participants.&#xD;

      Long term protocol: Perform non-invasive neuro-navigated repeated Transcranial Magnetic&#xD;
      Stimulation (rTMS) at low frequencies (LF) with to reduce the occurrence of seizures over&#xD;
      time. Seizure reduction and improvements in the quality of life in patients with epilepsy&#xD;
      will be associated with increased cortical inhibition resulting from the LF-rTMS sessions&#xD;
      over time. This procedure using rTMS at low frequencies (LF-rTMS) between 0.5 and 1 Hz is a&#xD;
      safe and painless method for noninvasive focal cortical brain stimulation, which will be&#xD;
      evaluated in its efficacy at reducing/suppressing seizures. Accordingly, we propose a&#xD;
      clinical trial in patients with epilepsy to test whether LF-rTMS can improve seizure&#xD;
      suppression. The location of the presumed 3D source in the brain will be stimulated for few&#xD;
      minutes (10 to 15 min.). Using a double-blinded, sham-controlled design, we will enroll up to&#xD;
      100 participants aged 18-80 with focal and generalized retractable epilepsy. Baseline data&#xD;
      will include a detailed seizure diary over 4 weeks, psychometric testing/neuropsychology&#xD;
      evaluation, and 20-minute EEG recordings. Each patient will then begin treatment with 14&#xD;
      minute sessions of 1 Hz rTMS or sham rTMS, 120%MT, and 800 stimuli on the position of the&#xD;
      calculated 3D source using EEG, MRI, and digitized electrode locations. The protocol will be&#xD;
      divided in 3 groups (Groups 1, 2 and 3) as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Groups 1, 2, and 3: LF-rTMS for 2 weeks (5 days per week for total of 10 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: protocol total duration: 1 year: LF-rTMS 1 session/week for 1 month (4 days),&#xD;
           and LF-rTMS 1 session/month for 11 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: protocol total duration: 1 year: LF-rTMS 1 session/month for 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 (placebo protocol, total duration: 1 year): LF-rTMS 1 session/week for 1 month&#xD;
           (4 days); and LF-rTMS 1session/month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each session EEG may be recorded. Also, we will obtain the number, frequency, and&#xD;
      duration of seizure events from an ongoing seizure diary. Psychometric testing will be&#xD;
      performed at the beginning of study, 3 months, and at the end of the study. Thus, each&#xD;
      patient will have rTMS testing, psychometrics, and EEG recordings. With the same rTMS&#xD;
      modality, we will also perform motor threshold mapping in conjunction with its fully&#xD;
      integrated and compatible electroencephalography (EEG) module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short-term protocol: Use LF-rTMS protocol as described but for up to 5 days in 10&#xD;
      participants with medically refractory status epilepticus. During each session EEG will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
