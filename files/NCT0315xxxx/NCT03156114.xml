  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study in adults with advanced solid tumors including non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study tests the combination of two medicines called BI 754111 and BI 754091 that may help&#xD;
      the immune system to fight the cancer. Such medicines are called immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two parts. In the first part, doctors want to find out the highest dose of 2&#xD;
      medicines that people with solid tumors can tolerate. This dose is then used for the second&#xD;
      part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part, the combination of the two medicines is tested in patients with non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer and other types of solid cancer. These patients had gotten treatment with&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 medicines but their tumors have come back. The doctors check whether&#xD;
      the combination of BI 754111 and BI 754091 makes tumors shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both medicines are given as an infusion into the vein every 3 weeks. If there is benefit for&#xD;
      the patients and if they can tolerate it, the treatment is given for maximum of 1 year.&#xD;
      During the entire study doctors will regularly check the health of the patients.&#xD;

                  both.&#xD;
