      The overall aim of this proposal is to compare a new state-of-the-art ex-vivo organ&#xD;
      preservation method with standard ischemic cold static storage of donor hearts in adult&#xD;
      cardiac transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard heart preservation before transplantation consists of cold ischemic storage of the&#xD;
      heart. Clinical studies has shown that the morbidity and mortality risk increases with&#xD;
      extension of the allograft ischemic time over four hours. For each additional hour the&#xD;
      mortality risk increase with 25% the first year. This time constrained is costly and results&#xD;
      in severe logistical problems, leading to loss of transplantable organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially the study is prospective, single-institution, open-label, non-randomised trial&#xD;
      comparing the NIHP method with the conventionally SCS in adult heart transplanted patients at&#xD;
      Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. Six patients will be transplanted using the&#xD;
      non-ischemic hypothermic cardioplegic perfusion. These will be compared with contemporary&#xD;
      control patients transplanted with standard ischemic cold static storage. The results will be&#xD;
      analysed and reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initially six patients have been completed, the study will become a single center,&#xD;
      prospective, open, blinded endpoint, randomized, controlled clinical trial including 34&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-point is a composite of mortality, primary graft dysfunction (PGD), need for&#xD;
      extra corporal support, or acute cellular rejection (ACR) within 30- days post-transplant.&#xD;
      PGD and ACR will be accessed blinded.An improved preservation of the transplanted organ will&#xD;
      reduce the major limitations for survival in the early post-transplant period such as&#xD;
      non-specific graft failure and acute rejection. Furthermore, it will make it possible to&#xD;
      increase the donor pool.&#xD;

      SURVEY OF THE FIELD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ischemia and reperfusion (I/R)-elicited tissue injury contributes to morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality4. In organ transplantation, it is a major challenge. The imbalance in metabolic&#xD;
      supply and demand within the ischemic organ results in tissue hypoxia and microvascular&#xD;
      dysfunction4. The following reperfusion enhances the activation of innate and adaptive immune&#xD;
      responses resulting in a cell death programs4,5. Furthermore, it has been report that miRNA&#xD;
      expression profile for heart transplantation is associated with I/R injury. Standard heart&#xD;
      preservation before transplantation consists of cold ischemic storage of the heart. Clinical&#xD;
      studies have shown that the mortality risk increases sharply with extension of the allograft&#xD;
      ischemic time over 4 hours. For each additional hour, the mortality risk increase with 25%&#xD;
      the first year. Different myocardial cardioplegic preservation solutions and an ex-vivo&#xD;
      perfusion machine have been developed. That technique includes use of whole blood from&#xD;
      deceased donor and a normothermic beating heart consuming nutrients during the preservation.&#xD;
      Despite some promising experimental results, no consistent differences in outcome have been&#xD;
      found. Improved preservation of the endothelium of the coronary arteries is instrumental to&#xD;
      achieve improved patient short and long term outcome. A damaged endothelium could result in&#xD;
      cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) and increases the risk of ACR. Therefore, prolonged time&#xD;
      and improved storage of the donor heart would save lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE AND AIM&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to compare a new state-of-the-art organ preservation&#xD;
      technique, non-ischemic continous/intermittent hypothermic cardioplegic perfusion (NICHCP),&#xD;
      on immediate and long term heart allograft function and rejection episodes, with standard&#xD;
      ischemic cold static storage (ICSS) of donor hearts in adult cardiac transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new ex-vivo heart perfusion technique where the heart is perfused during explantation,&#xD;
      using an independent portable heart-lung-machine, has been developed by Prof. Steen's&#xD;
      research group3. Pre-clinical studies have shown that the new technology using NICHCP of&#xD;
      donor hearts can be safely applied for 24 hours in pigs, however this new perfusion technique&#xD;
      has never been used on man.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that the NICHCP is superior to ischemic cold static storage of&#xD;
      donor hearts. The primary end-point is a composite of mortality, primary graft dysfunction,&#xD;
      need for extra corporal mechanical support, or Acute Cellular Rejection (ACR) ≥ grade 2&#xD;
      within 30-days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will investigate the superiority of the new methodology (NICHCP) in terms of&#xD;
      improved immediate and prolonged organ function. More specifically, it is hypothesized that&#xD;
      the weaning period of cardio-pulmonary bypass, will be shorter, the need for inotropic&#xD;
      support reduced, and the major limitations for survival in the early post-transplant period&#xD;
      such as non-specific graft failure, multiorgan failure, ACR, and infection will decrease.&#xD;
      Furthermore, in the late post-transplant period, it is hypothesized that the development of&#xD;
      CAV and immunosuppressive side effects, such as malignancy, will be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WORK PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the initial phase, it is excepted that 1 - 2 patients will be enrolled per month. During&#xD;
      the randomized part of the study It is expected to enroll 1 - 4 patients per month. With that&#xD;
      pace, the study is completed within about 24 months. The patient short term follow-up is 30&#xD;
      days and long term follow up is 12 months. For short-term-analysis purpose the study is&#xD;
      considered completed as the last patient of the study has passed 30-days post-surgery. The&#xD;
      long-term study will continue to monitor the patients for 12 months. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      recorded even if occurring after completion of the study and all patients will be followed&#xD;
      throughout life according to standard clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this is successful, this will be introduced as standard among other national and&#xD;
      international collaborators. The investigators estimate that this technique will be the&#xD;
      golden standard within 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially the study is a prospective, single-institution, open-label, non-randomised trial.&#xD;
      Here, six patients will be transplanted with the NICHCP method. These will be compared with&#xD;
      contemporary control patients transplanted with standard ICSS. An interim assessment will be&#xD;
      performed when these six patients has passed 180-days post-transplant. The results from this&#xD;
      study will be analysed and published. A report will be sent to the Ethical review bord for an&#xD;
      approval to continue with the second part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After six patients have been transplanted with the NICHCP method and a new approval has been&#xD;
      achieved from the local ethical board, the study will become a single center, prospective,&#xD;
      open, blinded endpoint, randomized, controlled clinical trial. The continued study will&#xD;
      comprise 17 patients in the test group and 17 control patients. The main outcomes will be&#xD;
      reported on intention to treat basis. PGD and ACR assessment will be performed by a blinded&#xD;
      access. Listed heart recipients (aged &gt;18 years) at Skåne University Hospital will be&#xD;
      screened. Patients who full-fill all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be included&#xD;
      after they signed the informed consent form. In the initial phase, it is excepted that 1-2&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled per month. During the randomized part of the study it is expected&#xD;
      to enroll 1-4 patients per month. With that pace, the study is completed within 24 months.&#xD;
      The patient short term follow-up is 30 days and long term follow up is 12 months. For&#xD;
      short-term-analysis purpose the study is considered completed as the last patient of the&#xD;
      study has passed 30-days post-surgery. The long-term study will continue to monitor the&#xD;
      patients for 12 months. Adverse events will be recorded even if occurring after completion of&#xD;
      the study and all patients will be followed throughout life according to standard clinical&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYS PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be presented as means, standard deviations, medians and inter&#xD;
      quartile ranges for the continuous variables and as counts and percent for categorical&#xD;
      variables. An alpha level of 5% will be used for all analyses, unless otherwise stated.&#xD;
      Demographics will be tabulated overall and by treatment group. The results from the&#xD;
      laboratory analysis will be calculated based on continuous variables. All data analyses will&#xD;
      be performed on data available. After three of the patients have been enrolled a safety&#xD;
      assessment will be performed. An interim assessment of the initial six patients in the test&#xD;
      group will be performed when all six patients has passed 30-days post-transplant or expired.&#xD;
      A protocol deviation is any event where investigator or study personnel did not conduct the&#xD;
      study per the protocol or applicable laws. All deviations will be reported to the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator (regardless of cause or prior approval) and will be noted on the eCRF form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL AND SCIENTIFIC IMPLICATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of an ex-vivo machine for the preservation of a donor heart requires more resources&#xD;
      than the technology used today, such as special equipment, suitable transportation and bank&#xD;
      blood to prime the perfusion module. Compared with cold static techniques for preservation,&#xD;
      this will initially be costly. However, this must be weighed against the value of more donor&#xD;
      hearts become available for transplant and cost savings in the form of shorter time to&#xD;
      perform the surgery, reduced incidence of the primary graft dysfunction (PGD), less need for&#xD;
      expensive mechanical cardiac support post-transplant, shortened hospitalization and&#xD;
      longer-term risk reduction of chronic rejection. The costs of complications directly&#xD;
      connected to the transplant is cost driven, especially if the recipient develops PGD&#xD;
      requiring mechanical circulatory support with a prolonged ICU stay. Furthermore, in the&#xD;
      future the transplantation can be scheduled to day-time surgery and complexed high risk cases&#xD;
      can be done with the highest competence available without time limitation. An improved&#xD;
      preservation of the transplanted organ will reduce the major limitations for survival in the&#xD;
      early post-transplant period such as PGD. Furthermore, it will make it possible to increase&#xD;
      the donor pool. Theoretically in the nordic countries, this would enable international organ&#xD;
      sharing with Europe and the eastern United States. This expansion of the donor pool is one of&#xD;
      the main potential benefits of this device.&#xD;
