CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions, and all pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to &lt;10 mm in short axis. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameters), no progression in non-target lesions, and no new lesions.

    <description>DOR is defined as the time from when response (CR or PR), based on RECIST v.1.1, will be first documented to first documented disease progression or death (whichever occurs first). CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions, and all pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to &lt;10 mm in short axis. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameters), no progression in non-target lesions, and no new lesions.
