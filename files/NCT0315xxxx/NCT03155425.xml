  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, phase2 trial to evaluate efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of SHR-1210 in patients with relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to assess ORR of SHR-1210 in patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      classic Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this phase 2 study is to assess objective response rate of SHR-1210&#xD;
      in patients with relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. The secondary objective&#xD;
      is to observe the duration of response,progression free survival,time to response,overall&#xD;
      survival and safety of SHR-1210 in relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphoma.Pharmacokinetic index is also investigated in 12 patients.&#xD;
