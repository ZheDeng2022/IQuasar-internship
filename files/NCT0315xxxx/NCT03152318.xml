    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating an investigational drug, an oncolytic virus called&#xD;
      rQNestin34.5v.2. This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of&#xD;
      an investigational drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational&#xD;
      drug as a possible treatment for this diagnosis of recurrent or progressive brain tumor.&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug as a possible&#xD;
      treatment for this diagnosis. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved rQNestin34.5v.2 as a&#xD;
      treatment for any disease. This is the first time that rQnestin34.5v.2 will be given to&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research drug, rQNestin34.5v.2, is an oncolytic viral vector made from the herpes simplex&#xD;
      virus type 1 (HSV1). The large majority of humans already have regular HSV1 in their nervous&#xD;
      system. Normally, this virus can cause cold sores in areas like the lips, fingers and&#xD;
      genitals in humans by making copies of itself in normal healthy cells. In some cases, HSV1&#xD;
      can cause severe infection of the brain and liver and/or death. However, scientists have&#xD;
      removed or changed parts of the rQNestin virus being used on this study so it can only make&#xD;
      copies of itself in glioma cells and not normal healthy cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it is effective, the rQNestin34.5v.2 drug will spread to a glioma cell, kill it, and then&#xD;
      make a copy of itself and spread again. This should be repeated over and over until all&#xD;
      glioma cells are reached. If rQNestin34.5v.2 moves into a normal brain cell, it should not&#xD;
      grow and make copies, and therefore should not spread to other normal brain cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to test if rQnestin34.5v.2 is safe to use in humans,&#xD;
      and if it is effective in treating malignant glioma. This study is also looking for the&#xD;
      highest dose of rQNestin34.5v.2 that can be given safely to people with malignant brain&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
