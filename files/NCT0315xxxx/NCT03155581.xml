    <textblock>
      Although health-related interventions should become increasingly diversity-sensitive, there&#xD;
      will always be a need of adapting specific interventions to some immigrant populations.&#xD;
      Adapting selected services to the individual cultural and religious background is necessary&#xD;
      to reduce health inequalities and provide effective health care and is dependent on the&#xD;
      active involvement of users. In this proposal the investigators present a community-based&#xD;
      health intervention trial with two parallel interventions aimed at increasing participation&#xD;
      of immigrant women to the existing cervical cancer-screening program. Through this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will provide new practice-based knowledge and a firmer evidence base to improve&#xD;
      health interventions that can contribute to equal health care and good health for all -&#xD;
      including the immigrant population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on identified barriers and factors that influence the interactions between immigrants&#xD;
      and health care professionals for screening of cervical cancer in Norway, the investigators&#xD;
      have develop two adapted interventions. One strategy will target immigrant women, and the&#xD;
      other one will focus on general practitioners. Thus, this proposal will specifically&#xD;
      contribute to the development of personalized health prevention interventions for the most&#xD;
      common cancer-screening program in Norway, with a focus on immigrant's personal circumstances&#xD;
      and health care needs.&#xD;

      Goals and objectives of the project The present study is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of two different community-based strategies to increase the attendance to the&#xD;
      cervical cancer screening prevention program. Interventions have been developed together with&#xD;
      stakeholders and conducted in two different geographical areas in Norway. Each intervention&#xD;
      group will be compared to a control population in the same county in the first place. The&#xD;
      main outcome to compare will be the percentage of women in each group attending to the&#xD;
      screening program. However, the investigators will not only focus on this quantitative&#xD;
      outcome, but also on the underlying processes determining how communities and individuals&#xD;
      change their behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, the effect of the interventions measured quantitatively will be compared to each&#xD;
      other in order to be able to prioritise one of the two strategies if needed, although&#xD;
      strategies will probably be complementary. A particular interest of the interventions is to&#xD;
      examine whether and how immigrant women respond to different intervention strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This study is designed as a community-based health intervention trial. A key feature&#xD;
      of such trials is the allocation of intact communities or clusters of individuals rather than&#xD;
      individuals themselves to different intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will rely on both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the interventions. For&#xD;
      the quantitative part,each of the two interventions will be compared to its control. In&#xD;
      addition, the effects of the interventions will be compared. Additionally, to know how the&#xD;
      interventions increased (or not) attendance to the screening program post-intervention focus&#xD;
      groups among intervention subjects will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions, participants and participating areas Two different intervention strategies&#xD;
      have developed, one of them meant to increase awareness and attendance among users, and the&#xD;
      other one targeting health professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. User intervention Area and design The developed User intervention will be implemented in&#xD;
           the counties of Akershus and Buskerud. Women from Somalia and Pakistan were chosen as&#xD;
           targets for this intervention after previous analyses for register data. Sample size was&#xD;
           calculated for an increase in cancer screening participation from 0.45 to 0.55 with 80%&#xD;
           power and 5% significance level. The investigators tried several intra class correlation&#xD;
           (ICC) levels, and ended dividing the area in 16 clusters that were matched according to&#xD;
           the calculated number of female immigrants aged 20 to 66 from Somalia and Pakistan.&#xD;
           After assuring that pairs were not naturally linked by a mosque or other natural known&#xD;
           gather centre for these populations, clusters were randomly assigned to intervention or&#xD;
           control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants All women from Somalia and Pakistan living in the intervention clusters&#xD;
           compose the intervention groups; immigrant women from the same countries of origin&#xD;
           living in control clusters will be control participants. It is estimated that 625 and&#xD;
           915 women in screening age from Somalia and Pakistan respectively live in the study area&#xD;
           (Akershus and Buskerud). Approximately half part of the women from each country will be&#xD;
           in the intervention clusters.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention Bilingual key women from the two chosen countries were recruited and&#xD;
           trained as peer educators for their respective communities to increase awareness&#xD;
           regarding the importance of cervical cancer prevention and to help peers overcome&#xD;
           detected barriers and increase attendance to screening. The strategy to achieve these&#xD;
           goals relied upon meetings with the women organised according to their practical needs,&#xD;
           using videos and other interactive materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Heath professional intervention Area The developed Heath professional intervention will&#xD;
           be implemented in Bergen. Sample size was calculated for an increase in cancer screening&#xD;
           participation for non-Western immigrants (all groups together) from 0.45 to 0.55 with&#xD;
           80% power and 5% significance level. The investigators tried several intra class&#xD;
           correlation (ICC) levels, and finally divided the area in 20 clusters that were matched&#xD;
           according to the cluster size and the calculated number of female non-Western immigrants&#xD;
           aged 20 to 66. The clusters were thereafter randomly assigned to intervention or control&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants All General practitioners working in the intervention cluster areas were&#xD;
           assigned to the intervention group; similarly, health professionals working in the other&#xD;
           clusters will be chosen as controls. Women will for the analyses be linked to their&#xD;
           general practitioner through the General Practice Database.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention Based on the existing evidence and on interviews conducted with health&#xD;
           professionals, an appropriate intervention was developed to increase awareness of the&#xD;
           health professionals involved in screening working in the chosen areas. Health&#xD;
           professionals in the intervention areas will be contacted by letter and a personal&#xD;
           appointment was made to explain the intervention. No change in &quot;screening as usual&quot; will&#xD;
           be implemented for health professionals working in the control areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post-intervention qualitative studies Among participants included in the intervention&#xD;
           areas, focus groups/in depth-interviews will be conducted right after the interventions&#xD;
           are implemented among both users and health professionals to understand whether and how&#xD;
           each of the interventions worked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements The study relies on both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Outcome information on screening attendance for intervention and control groups will be&#xD;
           obtained from the Norwegian Cytology registry, where all pap smears taken in Norway are&#xD;
           registered. The leader of the Norwegian Cytology register is part of the Reference group&#xD;
           for this study, and this register can provide data for the variables Morphology (if the&#xD;
           test is taken, if it is normal or pathological) and date for test for all women in&#xD;
           Norway after the necessary permissions are given. This register will be then linked at&#xD;
           the individual level to the Norwegian National Registry in order to obtain information&#xD;
           regarding immigrant background, country of origin as explained below, reason for&#xD;
           migration and length of stay in Norway for all 25 to 69 years old registered in Norway,&#xD;
           in addition to other socioeconomic variables (age, education, income level, work status,&#xD;
           cluster area for those in intervention and control areas, geographical centrality, civil&#xD;
           status, husbands' immigrant background and GP's immigrant background) that will be used&#xD;
           to adjust our results, and to two variables from the GP database (GP's age and gender)&#xD;
           to identify the GPs in the intervention and control groups in the Health professional&#xD;
           strategy. Data will be linked by Statistics Norway before being accessible to the&#xD;
           researchers. However, since ethnicity is considered sensitive data, and in order to make&#xD;
           the dataset completely anonymous for the research group, we will only apply for the&#xD;
           following groups with regard to country of origin (see page 1 for approximate numbers):&#xD;
           Norway, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Middle-East, South-East, South Asia, Africa,&#xD;
           North America, Central and South America, Poland, Sweden, Pakistan and Somalia. As&#xD;
           explained below, data will be obtained for several years (2012-2018) in order to be able&#xD;
           to distinguish secular trends in attendance to cervical screening versus the effect due&#xD;
           to our intervention. Data will be stored in a secure server at the University of Bergen&#xD;
           (BIOS, Core Facility for Biostatistics and Data Analyses) in an anonymised form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In addition, the process of how communities and individuals change their behaviour will&#xD;
           be studied using a qualitative approach to the intervention groups after the&#xD;
           interventions. These data will do not include any information that can lead to personal&#xD;
           identification of the women.&#xD;
