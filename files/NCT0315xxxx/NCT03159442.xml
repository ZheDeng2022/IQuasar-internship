  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AZD8871 is a new chemical entity possessing long-acting dual-pharmacology (muscarinic&#xD;
      receptor antagonist and β2 adrenoceptor agonist [MABA]) in a single molecule. This type of&#xD;
      agent presents a novel approach to the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD) and potentially asthma (in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid). AZD8871 is&#xD;
      being developed for inhalation, formulated with alpha lactose monohydrate and delivered by&#xD;
      dry powder inhaler (DPI) that allows delivery of a single dose of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD8871 at steady&#xD;
      state in healthy male Japanese subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single centre, randomised, single blind, placebo-controlled study to&#xD;
      investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and multiple&#xD;
      ascending doses of inhaled AZD8871 in healthy male Japanese subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will sign an Informed Consent Form before starting any study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four healthy subjects, aged 20 to 55 years, will participate in 3 cohorts. All&#xD;
      subjects will be admitted to the unit the day preceding the 1st dose and will be housed in&#xD;
      the unit until 96 hours (4 days) post last dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP)&#xD;
      (Day 20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight subjects will participate in each cohort and will receive either AZD8871 or placebo,&#xD;
      randomised 3:1 (6 subjects to receive AZD8871:2 subjects to receive placebo). Each subject&#xD;
      will only be dosed in 1 cohort. The study design allows a gradual escalation of dose (Cohorts&#xD;
      2 and 3) with intensive safety monitoring to ensure the safety of the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohort 1, subjects will receive only a single dose of AZD8871 300 µg or placebo on Day 1,&#xD;
      followed by once daily dosing on Days 5 to 16. The dosing schedule of all cohorts will be&#xD;
      single dose of IMP (active or placebo) on Day 1, followed by once daily dosing on Days 5 to&#xD;
      16. Within 5 to 7 days of discharge from the unit, there will be two follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following each cohort, a maximum dose of 2 times the dose administered in the previous cohort&#xD;
      will be considered for the subsequent cohort. However, the planned dose for Cohort 2 is 600&#xD;
      µg and for Cohort 3 is 900 µg. Dosing of Cohorts 2 and 3 will be preceded by a SRC meeting,&#xD;
      which will confirm the adequacy of the planned doses. A minimum of 5 subjects on active&#xD;
      treatment need to complete dosing per cohort in order to proceed to the next dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study for each subject will be approximately 58 days (from&#xD;
      Screening [up to -28 days before randomization] to Final Follow up visit [Day 30]).&#xD;

    <description>Recording adverse events. An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a preexisting medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally related to the product. An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal results of an investigation (e.g., laboratory findings, ECG). In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.</description>
