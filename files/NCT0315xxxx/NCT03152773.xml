      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A heart catheterization is a diagnostic heart procedure used to measure pressures and take&#xD;
      pictures of the blood flow through the heart chambers. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      fluoroscopy shows continuous pictures of the heart chambers that doctors can watch while they&#xD;
      work. Researchers want to test this procedure with catheterization tools routinely used in&#xD;
      x-ray catheterization called guidewires. Guidewires will help move the heart catheter through&#xD;
      the different heart chambers. Guidewires are usually considered unsafe during MRI because MRI&#xD;
      can cause a guidewire to heat while inside the blood vessels and heart. Researchers are&#xD;
      testing special low energy MRI settings that allow certain guidewires to be used during MRI&#xD;
      catheterization without heating. Using these guidewires during MRI may help to decrease the&#xD;
      amount of time you are in the MRI scanner, and the overall time the MRI catheterization&#xD;
      procedure takes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if certain MRI settings make it safe to use a guidewire during MRI fluoroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18 and older whose doctors have recommended right heart catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will screen participants by reviewing their lab results and questionnaire&#xD;
      answers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give 4 blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be sedated. They will have a tube (catheter) placed in the groin, arm, or&#xD;
      neck if they don t already have one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patches on the skin will monitor heart rhythm. Special antennas, covered in pads, will be&#xD;
      placed against the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will lie flat on a table that slides in and out of the MRI scanner as it makes&#xD;
      pictures. Participants will get earplugs for the loud knocking noise. They can talk on an&#xD;
      intercom. They will be inside the scanner for up to 2 hours. They can ask to stop at any&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a heart catheterization, catheters will be inserted through the tubes already in&#xD;
      place. The catheters are guided by MRI fluoroscopy into the chambers of the heart and&#xD;
      vessels. The guidewire will help position the catheter.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart catheterization is a minimally invasive procedure to measure pressure into specific&#xD;
      heart cavities. Heart catheterization usually uses X-ray guidance, which involves radiation&#xD;
      exposure, and which fails to visualize soft tissue. For several years, real-time magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) fluoroscopy has been the standard technique to guide right heart&#xD;
      catheterization at the NIH clinical center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidewires are standard tools used to steer catheters through the body and heart. Guidewires&#xD;
      have not been used during MRI fluoroscopy catheterization because of the risk of heating. We&#xD;
      have developed MRI techniques that do not risk heating using specific commercial guidewires.&#xD;
      In this protocol we will use this new low-energy real-time MRI fluoroscopy technique to&#xD;
      enable use of guidewires during otherwise standard MRI catheterization of the right side of&#xD;
      the heart through veins, and of the left side of the heart through the aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase of the protocol, we will begin performing systematic MRI guidewire heart&#xD;
      catheterization without X-ray whenever possible. We will assess the heart s response to&#xD;
      hemodynamic provocation during MRI catheterization tailored to the patient s problem. We will&#xD;
      use this protocol to further refine the technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will enable future testing of devices for adult and pediatric MRI-fluoroscopy&#xD;
      catheterization, which may lead to new non-surgical treatments of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
