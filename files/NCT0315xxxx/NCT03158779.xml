      The aim of this phase II study is to assess the efficacy and safety of sequentially&#xD;
      integrated treatment of FOLFIRINOX or Gemcitabine-Abraxane and SBRT in patients with&#xD;
      unresectable pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

      The aim of this prospective mono-institutional phase II study is to assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of sequentially integrated treatment of FOLFIRINOX or Gemcitabine-Abraxane and SBRT&#xD;
      with a total dose of 54 Gy in 6 fractions of 9 Gy /fractions in patients with locally&#xD;
      unresectable pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint is to evaluate overall survival (OS); the overall survival time will be&#xD;
      calculated from the start of chemotherapy to death. Secondary end points are to evaluate&#xD;
      acute and late toxicities, freedom from local progression (FFLP) and progression&#xD;
      free-survival (PFS). Acute and late toxicities will be scored according to the NCI Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0. Local progression will be defined&#xD;
      according to RECIST criteria. Time to toxicity and time to local or distant progression will&#xD;
      be defined from the start of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technical success will be defined as the ability to implant at least 2 fiducials in the tumor&#xD;
      area. Migration will be defined as a change in inter-fiducial distance. Clinical success will&#xD;
      be defined as the ability to guide the application of SBRT by using the fiducials. Any&#xD;
      adverse event will be recorded (acute pancreatitis, clinically relevant upper GI bleeding&#xD;
      requiring blood transfusion, abscesses in the area of the fiducials, sepsis).&#xD;

    <description>Participants received 4 months of FOLFIRINOX or Gemcitabine-Abraxane before SBRT was administered. A 3-weeks break from chemotherapy and restaging with thorax-abdominal CT scan to confirm the absence of distant metastases was required before SBRT delivery.&#xD;
Before SBRT simulation, patients may will have implanted fiducial into the pancreatic tumor.&#xD;
The SBRT schedule will be [6 x 9 Gy = 54 Gy] delivered in consecutive days.</description>
