  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) during migraine attacks is possible and could&#xD;
      contribute to pain initiation and maintenance. From now on, it was not possible to measure&#xD;
      ICP in a non-invasive way. The development of a new tool allows non-invasive self-measures of&#xD;
      ICP variations. Thus, it is possible for the first time to look for such ICP variations&#xD;
      during migraine attacks and to conclude if this mechanism is implied in the pathophysiology&#xD;
      of migraine.&#xD;

      Womens presenting with regular menstrual migraine treated with triptans will be included in&#xD;
      the study. Self-measure of ICP will be performed outside and during menstrual migraine&#xD;
      attacks. The potential variations will be compared to the measures done on matched healthy&#xD;
      women outside and during menses.&#xD;
