  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Five-year, Prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, non-controlled study of the ATTUNE®&#xD;
      Revision total knee prostheses, utilizing the fixed bearing (FB) and rotating platform (RP)&#xD;
      tibial component with the posterior stabilizing (PS) femoral component in revision total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a non-comparative, worldwide, multi-center study with up to 30 sites&#xD;
      that will intend to implant a total of 400 Subjects (200 PS RP and 200 PS FB) with the study&#xD;
      devices. The follow-up period of 5 years was selected to cover both the early post-operative&#xD;
      period as well as the medium term period which is a good indicator of longer term&#xD;
      survivorship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of survivorship at 5 years was selected to capture the time period&#xD;
      during which the majority of revision failures occur while providing a good indication of&#xD;
      long term survivorship. The secondary outcomes include commonly used measures of clinical&#xD;
      performance that will allow for comparison with published literature. Additionally, patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes, AORI bone defect classification , satisfaction and pain scores will be&#xD;
      collected and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female Subjects, age 22-80 years, inclusive, with a failed primary knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty, including unicompartmental or failed previous revision TKA, who are suitable&#xD;
      candidates for revision TKA using the ATTUNE® Revision system are eligible for enrollment in&#xD;
      this study. The use of the ATTUNE Revision system includes both partial and complete revision&#xD;
      surgical procedures, including implantation of revision components as the second stage within&#xD;
      a two-stage treatment for infection.&#xD;
