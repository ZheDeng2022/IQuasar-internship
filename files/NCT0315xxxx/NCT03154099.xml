    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients are at risk for the development of Critical Illness-Related&#xD;
      Corticosteroid Insufficiency (CIRCI). This may present as hypotension, unresponsiveness to&#xD;
      catecholamine infusions, and/or ventilator dependence. Such patients may benefit from&#xD;
      administration of exogenous steroids to restore their hemodynamic stability. Cortisol is&#xD;
      vitally important to the maintenance of vascular tone, endothelial integrity, vascular&#xD;
      permeability, and total body water distribution. It also potentiates the vasoconstrictor&#xD;
      actions of both endogenous and exogenous catecholamines. Appropriate activation of the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in the critically ill patient is essential to&#xD;
      stress adaptation and maintenance of homeostasis. Common causes of adrenal insufficiency in&#xD;
      the critical care setting include infection, systemic inflammation, previous glucocorticoid&#xD;
      use, and sepsis . Adrenal insufficiency among critically ill patients is also known as&#xD;
      relative adrenal insufficiency; there is either insufficient cortisol or a cortisol level&#xD;
      that may be high in absolute terms but insufficient to respond to the degree of stress. Thus,&#xD;
      serum cortisol concentrations that are normal in well patients may be inappropriately low in&#xD;
      severely sick patients. This inability to mount the appropriate response increases the risk&#xD;
      of death during severe illness. While the incidence of CIRCI in the critically ill has been&#xD;
      under appreciated, the detrimental impact of such dysfunction is well recognized. CIRCI may&#xD;
      be characterized by any of the following findings with delayed weaning from mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation and hypotension refractory to fluids and vasopressors being most common&#xD;
      Hypotension Unresponsiveness to catecholamine infusions Ventilator dependence Abdominal or&#xD;
      flank pain High fever with negative cultures and unresponsive to antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      Unexplained mental changes (i.e., apathy or depression) Electrolyte abnormalities&#xD;
      (hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia) Neutropenia, eosinophilia Diagnostic criteria for&#xD;
      CIRCI in the critically ill are not well established, but evidence suggests that&#xD;
      modifications from standard testing are warranted. Random serum cortisol levels, free&#xD;
      cortisol, and delta cortisol (change in baseline cortisol at 60 minutes after ACTH&#xD;
      stimulation using 250 mcg cosyntropin) are all ways to evaluate for CIRCI.&#xD;
