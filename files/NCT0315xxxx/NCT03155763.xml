  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The morphology of transplanted kidney is considered to be important for graft outcomes in&#xD;
      early and late posttransplant period. Individual histological lesions at the time of kidney&#xD;
      transplantation, such as sclerosis of glomeruli, vascular narrowing and interstitial&#xD;
      fibrosis, and composite histological lesions, which integrate histopathological findings in&#xD;
      different compartments, showed association with suboptimal graft outcomes. However there are&#xD;
      no consistent association between individual or composite lesions and transplant outcomes.&#xD;
      Some possible explanations for such inconsistent results are non-uniformity in grading&#xD;
      histological lesions or in defining graft outcomes. Furthermore, studies vary in terms of&#xD;
      patient selection, and some results are not corrected for covariates. It is also unclear,&#xD;
      whether acute biopsy features associated with the donor kidney can provide prognostic&#xD;
      information, in addition to the chronic lesions? This single-center study aimed to evaluate&#xD;
      which acute and chronic histological lesions and composite histological scores in donor&#xD;
      kidney intraoperative biopsies alone or in combination with clinical variables are best&#xD;
      associated with short- and long-term kidney graft outcomes, such as impairment of early&#xD;
      kidney allograft function, immunological acute kidney allograft rejection, pyelonephritis,&#xD;
      allograft function at 1, 3, 6, 12 months, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years, and graft survival at 1 and 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      130 consecutive patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), receiving a kidney only&#xD;
      transplant from April 2005 to December 2010 in a single center, and having both&#xD;
      intraoperative biopsies with ≥ 7 glomeruli and ≥ 1 arteries and complete follow-up data up to&#xD;
      5 years were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative biopsy consisted of preimplant biopsy (at the backtable, 1 core) and&#xD;
      30-minutes postreperfusion biopsy (1 core), which were taken in order to study the impact of&#xD;
      ischemia/reperfusion injury on transplant outcomes and to serve a reference for subsequent&#xD;
      biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor population included live donors (32.6%), ideal deceased donors (50%), expanded-criteria&#xD;
      donors (7.9%) and 9.0% of non-heart-beating donors. Donors were subjected to donor evaluation&#xD;
      protocol in accordance with local guidelines, including a standard clinical, instrumental and&#xD;
      laboratory examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All recipients and donors were Caucasians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histological scoring Needle (14-18-gauge) biopsies were obtained and tissue was fixed in 10%&#xD;
      buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. A 3-4 µm sections of preimplant and&#xD;
      postreperfusion kidney allograft implantation biopsies (KALIMBO) were stained for light&#xD;
      microscopy with hematoxylin-eosin (3 slides), periodic acid-Schiff (3 slides), and Masson's&#xD;
      trichrome (1 slide). A minimum of 21 tissue sections were examined for each biopsy.&#xD;
      Banff-1997 criteria for posttransplant biopsies, Banff-2016 criteria for preimplant biopsies,&#xD;
      as well as criteria suggested by Remuzzi et al. (1999) and Cosyns et al. (1998) were applied&#xD;
      for scoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the estimation of individual acute and chronic lesions, the acute, chronic and total&#xD;
      posttransplant and preimplant Banff scores, Remuzzi score, and acute, chronic and total&#xD;
      lesion indexes by Cosyns were calculated. In addition, previously published composite&#xD;
      histological scores, such as chronic allograft damage index (CADI), donor damage score (DDS),&#xD;
      chronic damage score (CDS), and interstitial fibrosis and fibrous thickening score (CIV) were&#xD;
      computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical risk factors and outcomes examined The analysis was performed 60 months later after&#xD;
      the last transplant in the study population. Donor, graft and recipient characteristics and&#xD;
      transplant outcomes were extracted from archival patient records and outpatient cards blinded&#xD;
      to all pathologic data. Data were retrieved on donor source, sex and age, and cause of death,&#xD;
      donation after cardiac death or expanded criteria donation for deceased donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipient's pretransplant variables included: age, gender, cause of ESRD, body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI), dialysis modality and duration, previous transplants, and presence of chronic arterial&#xD;
      hypertension, defined as a regular intake of antihypertensive drugs. The information related&#xD;
      to transplantation (cold ischemia time and second warm ischemia time) was also obtained.&#xD;
      Posttransplant data retrieved were limited to initial graft function (immediate, delayed or&#xD;
      slow), and the number and time of occurrence of acute rejection episodes or pyelonephritis,&#xD;
      and time of graft failure defined as return to dialysis therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All recipients received triple maintenance immunosuppressive therapy consisting of&#xD;
      calcineurin-inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus), mycophenolate mofetil, and steroid. Each&#xD;
      patient, enrolled in this study, was followed for five years until death/return to dialysis&#xD;
      or until December 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end points of the study were impairment of early kidney allograft function, immunological&#xD;
      acute kidney allograft rejection, pyelonephritis, allograft function at 1, 3, 6, 12 months,&#xD;
      2, 3, 4 and 5 years, and graft survival at 1 and 5 years.&#xD;
