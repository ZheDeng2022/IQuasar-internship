      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of IdeS in patients with severe anti-GBM&#xD;
      (Glomerular Basement Membrane) disease receiving standard care consisting of&#xD;
      pulse-methylprednisolone, oral prednisolone and intravenous cyclophosphamide combined with&#xD;

      This is an Open-Label Phase 2 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of IdeS in anti-GBM&#xD;
      disease (Goodpasture's disease, i.e. GP) with Adverse Renal Prognosis. The primary efficacy&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the efficacy of an IdeS based regimen to salvage independent renal&#xD;
      function measured as no need for dialysis at 6 months after IdeS treatment. The primary&#xD;
      safety objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IdeS in patients&#xD;
      with severe anti-GBM disease on background of standard care consisting of&#xD;
      pulse-methylprednisolone, oral prednisolone and intravenous cyclophosphamide (CYC) combined&#xD;
      with plasma exchange (PLEX). The patients will be followed during 6 months according to the&#xD;
      study visit plan.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Anti-GBM antibodies detected by ELISA above a level that is considered toxic by the&#xD;
             investigator using local laboratory. Patients double-positive for anti-GBM and ANCA&#xD;
             may be entered in the trial, but only if their level of anti-GBM antibodies fulfil the&#xD;
             criteria listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. eGFR &lt; 15 ml/min/1.73 m2 (by MDRD equation) or if the patient is non-responsive to&#xD;
             standard treatment, and has lost &gt;15 ml/min/1.73 m2 after start of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;

             values that are outside of normal limits (other than those specified in the Exclusion&#xD;
             Criteria) and/or with other abnormal clinical findings that are judged by the&#xD;
             Investigator not to be of clinical significance, may be entered into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Anuria for more than 2 days (less than 200 ml during last 48 hours);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Dialysis dependency for more than 5 days (maximum 3 sessions before signing informed&#xD;
             consent);&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ongoing moderate to severe pulmonary haemorrhage (or having ceased within the last two&#xD;
             weeks), defined as requiring assisted ventilation, oxygen or blood transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Symptomatic congestive heart failure (NYHA class 2-4) and requiring prescription&#xD;
             medication or clinically evident peripheral edema of cardiac origin;&#xD;
&#xD;

             active tuberculosis as indicated by chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients should not have received investigational drugs within 30 days prior to&#xD;
             screening or within 4 half-lives (whichever is longer); and&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History or presence of any medical condition or disease which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
