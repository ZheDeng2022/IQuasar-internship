  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine is allowed in Switzerland for intravenous (IV) medication in the intensive&#xD;
      care unit in the adult patient. Its active molecule, Dexmedetomidine (Dex), is a selective&#xD;
      and powerful α2-Adrenoreceptors (AR) agonist that shows the following complementary&#xD;
      properties: anxiolytic, sedative and analgesic. Moreover, it displays interesting&#xD;
      cardiovascular, respiratory and neuropsychic safety and tolerance profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing number of promising studies for the use of intranasal (IN) Dex in&#xD;
      pediatric sedation due to its non-invasive nature, its efficiency and its rare secondary&#xD;
      effects. However, there is currently no information in the literature on the use of IN Dex in&#xD;
      elderly multi-medicated patients in palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this end-of-life population, pain is controlled with administration of opioids.&#xD;
      Procedures, such as nursing cares, can generate pain and anxiety to the patient. Preventive&#xD;
      analgesia, subcutaneous (SC) opioids, is administered before the care. However, most of the&#xD;
      time, this additional dose fails to relieve the patient from his pain. In SPdol observational&#xD;
      study, 42% daily hygiene and comfort nursing care remained painful despite the administration&#xD;
      of a preventive analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IN Dex seems to be a good candidate for non-invasive analgesia and sedation in patients&#xD;
      admitted in palliative care before the nursing procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators compare the efficiency of IN Dex to the regular extradose of&#xD;
      SC opioids for analgesia before daily nursing care on elderly patients in the palliative care&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a cross over, two-sided, superiority, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      and randomized clinical trial.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although necessary for patient wellbeing, nursing care procedures potentially produce&#xD;
      discomfort, that should be addressed before the procedures begin. In palliative care setting,&#xD;
      daily procedures include mobilisation, hygiene care, wound dressing changes, etc.&#xD;
      Non-invasive and simple nursing care procedures may cause anxiety and pain that can lead to a&#xD;
      refusal of care or an increased distress. The data on procedural pain prevalence are almost&#xD;
      only available in pediatrics and are scarce in palliative care and geriatric population.&#xD;
      However, the SPdol french study, conducted on elderly people with palliative situations,&#xD;
      showed that 85% of procedural pain was related to daily hygiene and comfort care. Results&#xD;
      indicate also that in 42%, this type of care remained painful despite preventive&#xD;
      pharmacologic measures as opioids administration. Intensity of procedural pain associated&#xD;
      with daily and hygiene care is expected to be moderate to severe and not related to presence&#xD;
      or absence of pain before initiation of the procedure but to bad prognostic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of chronic health problems, comfort management pharmacological interventions&#xD;
      to achieve analgesia, slight or conscious sedation during nursing care procedures must&#xD;
      ideally combine the following properties:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rapid recovery and excellent cardiovascular and respiratory security profile;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be administrable in the regular place of care of the patient;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minimal requirement for medical surveillance in terms of time, equipment and staff;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reproducible inset and outset of the analgesic and anxiolytic effect;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Easy to titrate;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Convenient, little or non-invasive and administration route as painless as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is allowed in Switzerland for intravenous (IV) medication in the intensive&#xD;
      care unit in the adult patient. It is indicated to obtain a level of sedation no deeper than&#xD;
      that allowing a response to a verbal stimulus. Its active molecule, Dexmedetomidine (Dex) is&#xD;
      a selective and powerful agonist of α2-adrenoreceptors (AR). This drug has come to be of&#xD;
      growing interest in anesthesia and sedation field these last years in literature. Its&#xD;
      pharmacological actions on the central nervous system consist in sedative, anesthetic,&#xD;
      anxiolytic, analgesic action with good cardiovascular, respiratory and neuropsychic tolerance&#xD;
      profile. The main possible secondary effect with IV Dex is bradycardia, due to decreased&#xD;
      circulating epinephrine and norepinephrine levels observed with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intranasal (IN) administration is an easy-to-use and more efficient alternative than placebo&#xD;
      or other sedatives (Midazolam, Ketamine, Chloral) for the sedation of sensitive or less&#xD;
      collaborative populations as children and young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IN Dex applications described in the literature include analgesia and sedation for the&#xD;
      realization of radiologic investigation, surgical procedures leading to pain and anxiety,&#xD;
      dental care, endoscopy and electrochemotherapy, in combination with local anesthesia. IN Dex&#xD;
      doses from 1 to 2µg/Kg in young adults and up to 4µg/Kg in children,have been shown to be&#xD;
      effective for analgesia and sedation, in these contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a pharmacological point of view, the superiority of the IN way compared to the oral one&#xD;
      has been demonstrated in pediatrics. In healthy adults volunteers IN Dex bioavailability is&#xD;
      82% after a short time (2.6 min on average). The plasmatic peak of concentration is reached&#xD;
      after 30 min on average (Tmax range 15-60min). The onset of sedation occurs at 45 min, with a&#xD;
      peak effect observed at 90 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing number of promising studies for the use of IN Dex for pediatric sedation&#xD;
      due to its non-invasive nature, its efficiency and its rare secondary effects. However, there&#xD;
      is currently no information in the literature on the use of IN Dex neither in elderly&#xD;
      patients nor in palliative situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In end-of-life population, pain is controlled with a subcutaneous administration of opioids&#xD;
      as preventive analgesia before nursing cares, when necessary. Most of the time, this&#xD;
      supplementary dose fails to relieve the patient from his pain. In SPdol observational study,&#xD;
      42% daily hygiene and comfort nursing care remained painful despite the administration of a&#xD;
      preventive analgesia. Opioids limitations to prevent procedural pain are probably linked to&#xD;
      anxiety and global discomfort induced by nursing care that opioids alone cannot alleviate. IN&#xD;
      Dex seems to be a good candidate for procedural pain comfort pharmacological management&#xD;
      giving its analgesic, anxiolytic and sedative properties in old people admitted with&#xD;
      palliative situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators compare the efficiency of IN Dex to the regular additional&#xD;
      dose of opioids for analgesia, sedation and anxiolysis for daily nursing care on end-of-life&#xD;
      elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population of interest is widely heterogeneous according to its disease and medication.&#xD;
      Moreover the pain feeling is specific to each person. Therefore a cross-over design was&#xD;
      chosen so the patient is his own control. Each patient participates to 2 nursing care&#xD;
      procedures where he receives both SC and IN administration. However, each time only one&#xD;
      treatment is active while the other one is a placebo. Ex : SC placebo and IN Dex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a period of wash-out (24 to 48h), the patient receives , on the next nursing care&#xD;
      procedure, the complementary treatment combination (ex: SC opioids and IN placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize bias, randomization is done by the pharmacy, on the treatment sequence and the&#xD;
      study is double-blinded. In case of inefficient analgesia, the patient receives a rescue dose&#xD;
      of Dormicum, 0.05mg/Kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each procedure the patient is monitored with validated tools for pain, anxiety,&#xD;
      sedation, heart rate and oxygen saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sedation state of the patient is assessed up to 45 minutes after treatment&#xD;
      administration. At 45 minutes, the peak effect of the drugs (opioids as well as Dex) is&#xD;
      reached and the nursing care can start and lasts for 15 to 30 minutes. The patient is&#xD;
      followed-up during two hours after the end of the care. The total procedure lasts for 3h30&#xD;
      total.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Minutes 35</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the pain of the patient, a nurse will use the ECPA scale (Elderly Pain Caring Assessment). This is a validated tool to assess pain and anxiety intensity with 8 items based on the behaviour of the non-communicating elder person. The scale is divided in two: the first part is used for the pain assessment before the care while the second part assesses the pain during the care.&#xD;
The minimum score is 0. The maximum score is 32. One to five minutes are needed to do the evaluation depending on the experience of the observer.&#xD;
The pain is assessed 5 minutes before the care and then continuously during the care. When the total score between &quot;before&quot; and &quot;during the care&quot; exceeds 5, the patient is considered as having pain.</description>
