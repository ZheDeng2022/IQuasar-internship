  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis is the most common autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, most&#xD;
      ranging in age from 40-20 years of age is associated with neurons inflammation and&#xD;
      demyelination. Increasing aggressive activities of Th17 and Th1 cells that their function is&#xD;
      to secrete proinflammatory cytokines and decreasing the number and activity of regulatory T&#xD;
      cells, which normally leads to controlling inflammation, are seen in these patients.Many&#xD;
      studies have carried out to assess the prevalence of Tregs and Th17 in autoimmune disorders&#xD;
      such as MS. The Treg /Th17 functional balance is necessary for the impediment of autoimmune&#xD;
      and inflammatory diseases by preventing harmful injury to the host and increasing effective&#xD;
      immune responses. miRNAs have been shown to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      various diseases including autoimmune or auto-inflammatory diseases. Curcumin, the active&#xD;
      principle constituent of turmeric, is proved to be capable of regulating cellular responses&#xD;
      and the growth of different cell types in the immune system such as B cells, T cells,&#xD;
      macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer cells. Curcumin has a combination of&#xD;
      activities such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-proliferation, anti-invasive, and can&#xD;
      used in the treatment of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Multiple sclerosis, Cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, Bacterial diseases and Arthritis. The solubility of curcumin in nanomicelles&#xD;
      spherical water increases to more than 100 thousand times, which significantly enhances the&#xD;
      absorption of curcumin. The present study aimed at investigating the effects of nanocurcumin&#xD;
      on the frequency of Treg and Th17 cells, expression levels of their associated transcription&#xD;
      factors and cytokines, secretion levels of their associated cytokines and also related miRNAs&#xD;
      expression levels in peripheral blood of patients with MS.&#xD;

      In this study, fresh blood samples were acquired from 50 MS patients introduced by&#xD;
      corresponding physician and Neurologist. As the aim of the current study was the assessment&#xD;
      of nanocurcumin in MS patients, the peripheral blood collection was collected in two steps.&#xD;
      After the first blood collection via venipuncture, 25 patients received nanocurcumin capsules&#xD;
      each day and the remaining 25 patients took placebo for 6 months. Accordingly, the second&#xD;
      sampling from the mentioned population was collected after 6 months. 9 patients were excluded&#xD;
      from the study: 3 did not provide informed consent, 5 lived quite far away from the place in&#xD;
      which follow-up examinations were performed, and 1 patient developed cancer. In all cases, 15&#xD;
      ml of blood was utilized for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolation. PBMC is&#xD;
      used to measure the expression levels of miRNA-106b, miRNA-25 and miRNA-326. In this regard,&#xD;
      specific kits extracted miRNA from cells is used. Then the version of miRNA using&#xD;
      Quantitative Real time polymerase chain reaction(qPCR).Then the frequency of Treg and Th17&#xD;
      cells in peripheral blood of patients will be examined by Flowcytometry and compared to the&#xD;
      control group. The expression of key transcription factor (Foxp3) and specific cytokines&#xD;
      (TGF-β) related to the Treg cells and key transcription factor (RORγt) and specific&#xD;
      cytokines, interleukin-17(IL-17), related to the Th17 are measured by Quantitative Real time&#xD;
      PCR. Elisa methos is used to assess the amount of the cytokine TGF-β and IL-17 in cultured&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
