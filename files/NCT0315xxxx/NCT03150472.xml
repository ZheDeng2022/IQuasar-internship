      Device Description - Investigational Medicinal Product Ivory Dentin Graft is a bone graft&#xD;
      material for the repair or augmentation of bone defects in dental procedures. It consists of&#xD;
      sterile 300 - 900 μm porous particles of hydroxyapatite which retain the natural form of the&#xD;
      source porcine dentin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ivory Dentin Graft is intended to be used as a bone graft material for the repair or&#xD;
      augmentation of bone defects in dental procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OsteoBiol Gen Os. - Comparator control device A natural replicate of autologous bone, Gen-Os®&#xD;
      conserves the same intimate structures (matrix and porous form) and presents a highly&#xD;
      osteoconductive properties. Gen-Os® is gradually resorbable and provides support in bone&#xD;
      neoformation helping to preserve the original graft shape and volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The Ivory Dentin Graft study is a prospective, randomized, semi double blinded&#xD;
      with blinded assessments study comparing patients grafted with Ivory Dentin Graft&#xD;
      (Investigational group) and patients grafted with OsteoBiol Gen Os (comparator group) for&#xD;
      alveolar ridge preservation following tooth extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population and Justification: A total of 44 adult patients in 2 study groups scheduled&#xD;
      to undergo at least one dental implant placement of mandibular premolar or molar are planned&#xD;
      to be enrolled. The patients will be randomized into two treatment groups: One group is to be&#xD;
      grafted with Ivory Dentin Graft while the second group will be grafted with OsteoBiol Gen Os,&#xD;
      randomization ratio of 1:1 between the experimental and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Justification and Statistical Analysis Plan: The rationale for sample size&#xD;
      calculation is based on demonstrating non-inferiority in the study primary endpoint between&#xD;
      the tested and the reference treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculations assume a difference of up to 30% (percent as in unit of measure and not of&#xD;
      relative difference) woven bone between the treatments, which will be considered equivalent&#xD;
      (non-inferiority) and standard deviation of 32%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a sample of 15 patients per group, a difference of up to 30% in the mean woven bone&#xD;
      between the treatment groups will be considered equivalent with 5% significance level and 80%&#xD;
      statistical power. Assuming expected dropout rate of ~30%, 44 patients (22 per group) will be&#xD;
      recruited in order to ensure final sample size of 30 study completers (15 per group). All&#xD;
      tests will be two-tailed, and a p value of 5% or less will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant. The data will be analysed using the R version 4.0.1 (R development Core Team.&#xD;
      Vienna, Austria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints: 95% Confidence Interval of the Differences between the treatments (Mean&#xD;
      Ivory Graft - Mean Comparator) in woven bone ratio at 4 months after grafting will be&#xD;
      applied. The non-inferiority endpoint will be achieved if the lower limit of the confidence&#xD;
      interval will be higher than -30 (meaning that the comparator is less than 30 points better&#xD;
      than Ivory Graft or not better at all).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints: Differences in categorical secondary endpoints will be tested for&#xD;
      significance using Chi-Square test or Fisher's Exact test (as appropriate) Differences in&#xD;
      numeric secondary endpoints will be tested for significance using the two-sample T-test or&#xD;
      Non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Rank sum test for independent samples (as is&#xD;
      appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Endpoints: Usability, defined as ease of procedure using 10-points satisfaction&#xD;
      scale, will be summarized in appropriate tables by treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percent of teeth which require additional grafting at implant placement will be&#xD;
      summarized and compared using Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test (as is appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling of Participant Withdrawals: Participants who leave the study prematurely will be&#xD;
      replaced. A patient discontinuing the study before grafting of Ivory Dentin Graft (Visit 2)&#xD;
      will be followed for safety. Each case of premature withdrawal will be properly recorded in&#xD;
      the Screening Failure Log as deemed necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Screening: Prior to any study-related screening procedure, delegated study team&#xD;
      members will approach potentially eligible adult patients who are waiting to be scheduled for&#xD;
      tooth extraction and grafting for necessary titanium implant placement. Patients who do not&#xD;
      meet inclusion criteria or who are for any other reason determined to be unsuitable for&#xD;
      inclusion in the study, or who decline to participate in the study, will be considered and&#xD;
      recorded as &quot;screening failure&quot; and receive standard and appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent: The informed consent document will be signed and dated for screening and&#xD;
      enrollment and each patient consenting will be documented in the patient medical binder. The&#xD;
      patient will be given a copy of the consent form together with the study doctor's letter at&#xD;
      the time of enrollment. The clinician will ask the patient about his plans and his&#xD;
      willingness to attend all scheduled follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be done by Castor EDC web-software. The patients will be randomized into&#xD;
      two treatment groups: One group is to be grafted with Ivory Dentin Graft while the second&#xD;
      group will be grafted with OsteoBiol Gen Os, randomization ratio of 1:1 between the&#xD;
      experimental and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL PROCEDURES: After informed consent is obtained, a case record form including all&#xD;
      aspects listed below will be recorded. Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and&#xD;
      be treated according to standard treatment protocols for tooth extraction, grafting, implant&#xD;
      placement, dental biopsy and dental radiographic procedures and with the standard protocol&#xD;
      for local anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Screening and Enrolment, as part of pre-operative visit (0-90 days before grafting&#xD;
      procedure ) The following assessments will be performed: Demographics, Medical history, Vital&#xD;
      signs, Current medications. A CT scan will be performed in order to verify patient&#xD;
      eligibility and graft procedure preparation Visit 2: Randomization and extraction socket&#xD;
      graft filling by Ivory Dentin Graft or Gen Os after tooth extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The designated randomization groups (Ivory Dentin Group and Gen Os) will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recorded in the patient CRF&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A sticker of the used study item and the used package will be achived in the patient&#xD;
           binder- this will be used as source to verify correct allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be operated by study delegated physicians using the same method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socket debridement and cleaning: After exposure of the defect the sounding walls should be&#xD;
      debrided by surgical curette and all granulation tissue removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extraction site will be graft filled either using Ivory Dentin Graft or OsteoBiol Gen-Os&#xD;
      according to the respective Instructions for Use using either vial or syringe applicators&#xD;
      with dental membrane. Only the graft performing sub-investigator and the study coordinator&#xD;
      will be un-blinded to the patient allocation. All efforts and measures would be taken by the&#xD;
      study team to keep the patient and blinded assessors blinded of allocation- semi double&#xD;
      blinded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periapical x-ray imaging will be performed on each enrolled patient once completing the graft&#xD;
      filling in order to validate the bone grafting procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments will be performed following the procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Extraction socket grafting Physician usability Form&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Patient Discharge form. Patients will be monitored for short-term follow-up (1&#xD;
           week, 1 and 4 months following their extraction socket grafting procedure) and for&#xD;
           long-term follow-up and will be evaluated for their medical and dental conditions.&#xD;
           Implantation of titanium implants will be conducted 4 months following the grafting&#xD;
           procedure at grafted site of each enrolled patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short-term Visit 3: Follow up 1 week following grafting procedure The patient will be asked&#xD;
      to report any dental complication- all will be investigated by the sub-investigator using&#xD;
      Visit 3 safety Follow Up Form. In addition, vital signs will be taken by study investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: Follow up 1 month following grafting procedure The patient will be asked to report&#xD;
      any dental complication- all will be investigated by the sub-investigator using Visit 4&#xD;
      safety Follow Up Form. In addition, vital signs will be taken by study investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Computerized Tomography (CT) will be performed prior to visit 5 Visit 5: Follow up 4 months&#xD;
      following grafting procedure and dental Implant placement (Short-term Termination visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the procedure, the patient will be asked to report any dental complication. The&#xD;
      following assessments will be conducted during the visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vital Signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Implant placement Physician usability Form&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Patient Discharge form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Short-term termination visit The alveolar bone strength (torque measurement) will be&#xD;
           measured by torque measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequacy of bone graft (need for additional grafting at implant placement) will be evaluated&#xD;
      by the study investigator based on the clinical examination, torque measurement and CT scan,&#xD;
      and will be specified and justified in the Case Report Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Un-scheduled visit: The study investigator will instruct the patient to immediately contact&#xD;
      the study team in case of: Implant failure, loose graft particles, loss of grafting material,&#xD;
      graft site infection, insufficient healing of graft site, excessive bleeding and wound&#xD;
      dehiscence. The patient must call the study nurse to schedule an un-scheduled visit which may&#xD;
      only be performed by the principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Market Clinical Follow-up: Patients will be monitored also for long-term follow-up (6&#xD;
      and 10 months, 2.5 and 5 years following their extraction socket grafting procedure) and will&#xD;
      be evaluated by the study nurse for their medical and dental conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Monitoring and Quality Control:The investigator, through an appointed Clinical Research&#xD;
      Associate (CRA), will be responsible for implementing and maintaining quality assurance and&#xD;
      quality control systems with written Standard Of Procedures to ensure that trials are&#xD;
      conducted and data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the&#xD;
      protocol, GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirement(s), including ISO 14155.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will be responsible for ensuring direct access to all trial related sites,&#xD;
      source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the&#xD;
      hospital, and inspection by Israeli regulatory authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control should be applied to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are&#xD;
      reliable and have been processed correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study CRA will verify that (a) The rights and well-being of human patients are protected,&#xD;
      (b) The reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents and&#xD;
      (c) The conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved&#xD;
      protocol/amendment(s), with GCP, and with the applicable regulatory requirement(s) (including&#xD;
      ISO 14155). The full responsibilities of the trial monitor appear in full in the ICH-GCP. The&#xD;
      monitor(s) should follow Ivory Graft (or their CRO representative) written for monitoring the&#xD;
      specific trial. The monitor will submit a written report after each trial-site visit or&#xD;
      trial-related communication. A report should include the date, site, name of the monitor, and&#xD;
      name of the investigator or other individual(s) contacted. A report should include a summary&#xD;
      of what the monitor reviewed and the monitor's statements concerning the significant&#xD;
      findings/facts, deviations and deficiencies, conclusions, actions taken or to be taken and/or&#xD;
      actions recommended to secure compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure compliance of this investigator initiated trial with current national regulations&#xD;
      and the ICH guidelines, data generated by this study will be available for inspection upon&#xD;
      request by representatives of the local health authorities- IRB or the national authorities -&#xD;
      MOH, or any entity providing support for this trial. Routine monitoring or audit activities&#xD;
      for this study will be conducted by authorized representatives. The general scope of such&#xD;
      visits would be to inspect study data (regulatory requirements), source documentation and CRF&#xD;
      completion in accordance with current GCP, the ICH guidelines and the respective local and&#xD;
      national government regulations and guidelines.&#xD;
