          -  Participant must have a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 30.0 kilogram per meter&#xD;
             square (kg/m^2) (BMI = weight [kg] / height [m]^2), and a body weight of not less than&#xD;
             50 kilogram (kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, neurological&#xD;
             examination, medical history, vital signs, and 12 lead (electrocardiogram) ECG, and&#xD;
             peripheral capillary oxygen saturation [(SpO2) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 97&#xD;

             hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may&#xD;
             be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from&#xD;
             normal to be not clinically significant. This determination must be recorded in the&#xD;
