  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is is looking at the effect of the dietary supplement &quot;Nicotinamide&#xD;
      mononucleotide&quot; (NMN) on key cardiovascular and metabolic functions, specifically those that&#xD;
      are important risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Accordingly, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the effect of NMN on how well the hormone insulin works to&#xD;
      control blood sugar. The investigators will also look at the effects of NMN on blood lipids;&#xD;
      body fat and liver fat; and other blood, fat tissue and muscle tissue markers of&#xD;
      cardiovascular (heart) and metabolic health. Data from studies conducted in rodents have&#xD;
      shown that NMN supplementation has beneficial effects on cardiovascular and metabolic health,&#xD;
      but this has not yet been studied in people.&#xD;
