      The primary purpose of this study is to test if the STARK comprehensive autonomy health care&#xD;
      package improves lower extremity function over time at 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months after hip&#xD;
      or pelvis fracture compared to the standard of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip fractures are the most frequent and most severe fractures among seniors age 75 and older&#xD;
      and they have severe consequences: After a hip fracture, 50% of older persons have permanent&#xD;
      functional disabilities, 15-30% require long-term nursing home care, and 10-20% die within&#xD;
      one year. Besides the personal burden, hip fractures account for substantial increasing&#xD;
      health care expenses. Given the high prevalence, severity and cost of hip fractures, novel&#xD;
      care concepts such as STARK are urgently needed to support functionality and autonomy of hip&#xD;
      fracture patients - especially in for the first year after the fracture&#xD;
&#xD;
      The STARK Intervention is a new care concept for hip fracture patients, which was developed&#xD;
      based on prior evidence from clinical trials performed at the Centre on Aging and Mobility at&#xD;
      the University of Zurich and important interdisciplinary clinical expertise collected at the&#xD;
      Geriatric Trauma Centre at the University Hospital Zurich, the Spitex Zürich, the Dept. of&#xD;
      Geriatrics at the University Hospital Zurich, and the Federal Department of Health at the&#xD;
      City of Zurich (Gesundheits- und Umweltsdepartement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the STARK intervention is to enable hip fracture patient to return to their home&#xD;
      directly after discharge from acute care by providing a high-quality care concept provided by&#xD;
      an interdisciplinary team bridging acute Geriatric Care at the University Hospital and Spitex&#xD;
      services (ambulant nursing service at home).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this pilot study, the investigators want to test if the STARK comprehensive autonomy&#xD;
      care package improves lower extremity function in the first year after a hip fracture&#xD;
      compared to standard of care. Most important secondary outcomes are rate of falls, health&#xD;
      care utilization, re-hospitalization and nursing home admission, as well as quality of life,&#xD;
      cognitive function, bone mineral density and muscle mass in senior hip fracture patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 20 community-dwelling men and women aged 70+ who are hospitalized at&#xD;
      the University Hospital Zurich or City Hospital Waid due to an acute hip or pelvis fracture&#xD;
      and who are not capable to return home without help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled pilot trial with two parallel groups including a control&#xD;
      group receiving standard of care (inpatient rehabilitation or home-based or inpatient&#xD;
      transitional nursing care) and an intervention group receiving the STARK comprehensive&#xD;
      autonomy health care package. The STARK comprehensive autonomy health care package consists&#xD;
      on one hand of the STARK-Spitex who will support the participants during the first three&#xD;
      months at home and on the other hand of a secondary prevention program including home&#xD;
      exercise (3x/week), protein enriched food preparation (20 g whey protein/day), motivation and&#xD;
      recommendation for vitamin D supplementation(2000 IE/day), calcium intake and physical&#xD;
      activity. The intervention starts already during acute care and involves a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      team of geriatricians, nurses and Spitex who assess the care and utilities needs of the&#xD;
      patient. Each study participant will undergo 5 clinical visits (at baseline, after 6 weeks, 3&#xD;
      months, 6 months, and 12 months). Between clinical visits, participants will be contacted by&#xD;
      phone every month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The STARK comprehensive autonomy health care package can contribute to a faster and&#xD;
      sustainable recovery of autonomy after a hip fracture in seniors and might help to lower&#xD;
      direct and indirect health care costs by reducing the number of re-hospitalization due to&#xD;
      fall-associated injuries.&#xD;
