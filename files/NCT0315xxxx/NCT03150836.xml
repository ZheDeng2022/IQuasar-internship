  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, randomized, prospective, open-label phase II study. Patients in this&#xD;
      study will have localized (cT3-cT4), or metastatic bladder cancer with a symptomatic, intact&#xD;
      primary bladder tumor. In this study, patients will undergo stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy (SBRT) to the bladder tumor and will receive durvalumab with or without tremelimumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will commence with a safety lead-in phase at UCSF in which 6 patients are accrued&#xD;
      to Regimen A1 (RT + durvalumab). If this is not tolerated then an alternative Regimen A2,&#xD;
      containing a lower total radiation dose will accrue 6 patients. If either A1 or A2 is&#xD;
      tolerated then patients will be accrued to Regimen B1 (durvalumab, tremelimumab x 2 doses,&#xD;
      and RT dose determined from Regimen A) following a 3+3 design for safety. If Regimen B1 is&#xD;
      not tolerated an alternative Regimen B2 (durvalumab, tremelimumab x 1 dose, and RT dose&#xD;
      determined from regimen A) will accrue following a 3+3 design for safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the safety lead-in for each group is completed, an expansion cohort will accrue&#xD;
      patients. In this expansion cohort, patients will be randomized 1:1 to be treated with either&#xD;
      regimen A or regimen B dose selected from the safety lead-in stratified by patient population&#xD;
      (localized patients and metastatic patients).&#xD;

                  consultation with their physician].&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 x institutional upper limit of&#xD;
                  normal unless liver metastases are present, in which case it must be less than or&#xD;

                  recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence&#xD;

                  under investigation.)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         17. QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 470 ms calculated. Any clinically significant abnormalities detected require&#xD;
             triplicate ECG results and a mean QT interval corrected for heart rate using&#xD;
             Fridericia's formula (QTcF) greater than or equal to 470 ms calculated from 3 ECGs).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first&#xD;
             dose of durvalumab or tremelimumab, with the exceptions of intranasal and inhaled&#xD;

             exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. History of primary immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;

             bleeding diatheses including any subject known to have evidence of acute or chronic&#xD;
             hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements or&#xD;
             compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical&#xD;
             history, physical examination, and radiographic findings, and TB testing in line with&#xD;
             local practice).&#xD;

&#xD;
         26. Receipt of live attenuated vaccination within 30 days prior to study entry or within&#xD;
             30 days of receiving durvalumab or tremelimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with&#xD;
             evaluation of study treatment or interpretation of patient safety or study results&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. Brain metastases or spinal cord compression unless the patient's condition is stable&#xD;
             (asymptomatic, no evidence of new or emerging brain metastases) and off steroids for&#xD;
             at least 14 days prior to the start of study treatment. Following radiotherapy and/or&#xD;
             surgery, patients with suspected brain metastases at screening should have an MRI&#xD;
             (preferred)/CT, preferably with IV contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
         29. Subjects with uncontrolled seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;

             therapy or 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy, whichever is the&#xD;
             longer time period&#xD;
