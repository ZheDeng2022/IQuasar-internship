  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Gastric cancer (GC) is the world's second leading cause of neoplastic mortality.&#xD;
      Genetic alterations, response to treatments and mortality rates are highly heterogeneous&#xD;
      across different regions. In Chile, GC is the leading cause of cancer death, affecting 20 per&#xD;
      100,000 people and &gt;3,000 deaths/year. Clinical outcomes and response to &quot;one size fits all&quot;&#xD;
      therapies are highly heterogeneous and thus a better stratification of patients may aid&#xD;
      cancer treatment and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design/methods. The Gastric Cancer Task Force (GCTF) is a Chilean collaborative,&#xD;
      non-interventional retrospective study that seeks to stratify gastric adenocarcinomas (GACs)&#xD;
      using retrospect clinical outcomes and genomic, epigenomic and protein alterations in a&#xD;
      cohort of 200 patients. Tumor samples from the pathology department and the Cancer Center at&#xD;
      UC Christus healthcare network at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile will be analyzed&#xD;
      using a panel of 143 known cancer genes (Oncomine Comprehensive Assay) at the Center of&#xD;
      Excellence of Precision Medicine (CEMP) in Santiago, Chile. Additionally, gene promoter&#xD;
      methylation will be performed and selected clinically relevant proteins (e.g. PD-L1, Erb-2,&#xD;
      VEGFR2 among others) will be assessed by Tissue Microarray, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status&#xD;
      will also be assessed. Observations will be correlated to 120 clinical parameters, including&#xD;
      general patient information, cancer history, laboratory studies, comorbidity index,&#xD;
      chemotherapy, targeted therapies, efficacy and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion. The development of a clinically meaningful classification that encompasses&#xD;
      comprehensive clinical and molecular parameters may improve patient treatment, predict&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, aid patient selection for clinical trials and offer insights into future&#xD;
      preventive and/or therapeutic strategies.&#xD;

      Participating entities: The Chilean Gastric Cancer Task Force (GCTF) is a collective effort&#xD;
      between two principal identities: 1- The Center of Excellence of Precision Medicine (CEMP),&#xD;
      which was established through a joint funding by the government agency for economic&#xD;
      development (Corporacion de Fomento de la Produccion, CORFO) and Pfizer Chile and 2- The&#xD;
      Center UC for Investigation in Oncology (CITO) based at the Pontificia Universidad Católica&#xD;
      de Chile. Both entities are non-profit research organizations aimed at enhancing public&#xD;
      education and implementing strategies to improve clinical outcomes in oncology treatment and&#xD;
      cancer prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To stratify Chilean GC patients into prognostic subgroups, and to&#xD;
      correlate therapy response according to clinical, protein, epigenetic and genetic alterations&#xD;
      in a cohort of 200 GAC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the mutation profile in Chilean GC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the percentage of Chilean GC patients that could benefit from currently&#xD;
           available druggable targets (actionable genes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate EBV presence to clinical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the expression levels of proteins associated with molecular stratifications&#xD;
           and currently targeted therapies (eg. PD-L1 and antiangiogenics)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the profile of SNPs in the DPYD and TYMS genes in Chilean GC patients and&#xD;
           their correlation with adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics approval The GCTF is a non-interventional, collaborative, prospective non-concurrent&#xD;
      study that seeks to stratify GAC patients based on their prognosis and therapy response. The&#xD;
      study will strictly adhere to all legal requirements, regulations and general principles&#xD;
      established by international agencies governing the ethical conduct in biomedical research on&#xD;
      human subjects, following the good clinical practices and the declaration of Helsinki. The&#xD;
      GCTF study protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the University hospital&#xD;
      (Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile , CEC MED UC approval number 16-046, resolution&#xD;
      dated April 21st, 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment &amp; characteristics Diagnosed GC patients will be recruited from the Red UC&#xD;
      Christus network in Santiago, Chile. Patient recruitment and signing of informed consent&#xD;
      forms, maintenance and monitoring of patient medical records, biological material and sample&#xD;
      extractions will be managed by CITO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient and treatment history reveals that besides surgery and chemotherapy, approximately&#xD;
      10% of patients received Trastuzumab (ERBB2 targeted therapy, also called Herceptin), another&#xD;
      10% received immunotherapy including pembrolizumab and Ipilimumab (checkpoint inhibitors).&#xD;
      Finally approximately 5% of patients received antiangiogenic therapy (consisting of VEGFR2&#xD;
      targeted therapy with Ramucirumab). Additionally, histological analysis showed that&#xD;
      approximately 50% of patients were classified as intestinal type, 30% as diffuse, and 20%&#xD;
      were either mixed or undetermined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult male or female, aged &gt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosed with gastric cancer (histological or cytological)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attending health centers of the Red UC Christus network for at least 3 months with&#xD;
           clinical follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Capable to read and speak Spanish&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent to the study that should be dated&#xD;
           and signed at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With small biopsy samples insufficient for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whose medical records cannot be collected or are unavailable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Without signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data Clinical data from patients will be obtained by healthcare providers and&#xD;
      entered into an online electronic platform. Samples will be coded and patient identity known&#xD;
      only to the attending physician. Clinical variables are divided into sections: General&#xD;
      Patient Information, Cancer History, Laboratory Studies, Comorbidity (Charlson) Index,&#xD;
      Chemotherapy, Efficacy &amp; Follow Up and Toxicity. Patient chemotherapy will be classified by:&#xD;
      regime, number of cycles &amp; time of treatment and chemotherapy dose-intensity during the first&#xD;
      6 months. Chemotherapy regimens representing the first line chemotherapy prescribed to the&#xD;
      patients. Full chemotherapy dose intensity during the first 6 months will be obtained through&#xD;
      patient interviews and entered directly into the online platform. Finally, efficacy &amp;&#xD;
      follow-up and toxicity data obtained from patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main clinical outcomes Main outcomes will be inferred from obtained clinical data, these&#xD;
      include overall survival, progression-free, and recurrence-free survival rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological samples &amp; Oncomine Comprehensive Assay Biological materials obtained at the Red UC&#xD;
      Christus will be transported to CEMP in Santiago de Chile under standardized protocols. A&#xD;
      total of 200 patient tumor samples will be obtained from archived Formalin Fixed Paraffin&#xD;
      Embedded (FFPE) samples. Nucleic acids will be extracted using the RecoverAll kit (Thermo&#xD;
      Fisher Cat #AM1975) and analyzed using the commercially available Oncomine Comprehensive&#xD;
      Assay kit. This assay simultaneously analyzes DNA and RNA from samples allowing the&#xD;
      assessment of 73 gene hotspots (based on DNA), 49 focal copy number variations (CNVs, DNA&#xD;
      based), 26 full coding sequences (for mutations and CNV loss), and 22 gene fusion drivers&#xD;
      (RNA). Notably, 72 of these genes are drug targets. Genomic raw data obtained (.vcf and .pdf&#xD;
      files) will be stored and backed up in a local Data Center for subsequent genomic analysis.&#xD;
      Upon publication of the findings of this study, the Oncomine results along with clinical&#xD;
      classification of individual tumors will be made publicly available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue Micro Array (TMA) Analysis The following genes will be further analyzed by a TMA using&#xD;
      specific antibodies against: PD-L1 (Dako, Cat # SK00521), PD-L2 (Thermo Cat# B7-DC/CD273),&#xD;
      Phosphorylated mTOR (Abcam Cat#AB118815), p53 (Cat # 5278074001), VEGFR2 (Abcam Cat&#xD;
      #AB39256), Phosphorylated Akt (Thermo Cat #473), HER2 (Roche, Cat # 05278368001), p16 (Roche,&#xD;
      Cat # 06695221001), Met (Abcam Cat #AB51067), HA-4 (Abcam Cat #AB24480) and four&#xD;
      microsatellite markers (all from Roche): MLH1 (Cat # 06472966001), MSH2 (Cat # 05269270001),&#xD;
      MSH6 (Cat # 5929911001), PMS2 (Cat # 06419216001). Manual TMA will be prepared as described&#xD;
      previously. Briefly, paraffin blocks will be obtained and cut and stained by Hematoxylin &amp;&#xD;
      Eosin (H&amp;E) in order to select the best histological area. Subsequently selected tissue area&#xD;
      will be placed into the TMA by circling the identified area in the corresponding block.&#xD;
      Cylindrical core biopsies will be extracted from each paraffin block using a 1 mm stylet and&#xD;
      placed into a new recipient block. Selected adequate cases had tumors that occupied at least&#xD;
      10% of the core area. Each case will be processed in triplicate to prevent tissue loss during&#xD;
      cutting. Sections from each tissue array block will be cut, de-paraffinized and dehydrated&#xD;
      for H&amp;E and immunohistochemical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene methylation Promoter gene methylation on six selected genes that have previously shown&#xD;
      promoter regulation by methylation associated with GC will be assessed. Methylation analysis&#xD;
      will include the reprimo gene and other mRNAs associated with GC progression. Analysis will&#xD;
      be performed by bisulfite sequencing as described previously using the EZ DNA methylation&#xD;
      Gold kit (Zymo Research) with minor modifications. Briefly, bisulfite treated DNA is&#xD;
      amplified using specific PCR primers, with PCR products subsequently cloned and sequenced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EBV identification EBV subtypes in patient samples will be assessed using the chromogenic in&#xD;
      situ hybridization (CISH) method with minor modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis A significant proportion of GC patients can&#xD;
      develop serious toxicity from 5-FU treatment including bone marrow suppression, neuropathy,&#xD;
      low white blood cell numbers, fever, infections, nausea, vomiting, severe diarrhea, mouth and&#xD;
      digestive tract inflammation, all of which are recorded in the patient history of other&#xD;
      cohorts. Subtle personal and population changes in DNA, called SNPs can account for increases&#xD;
      in the risk of 5-FU toxicity; 5-FU metabolism is predominantly hepatic, where the enzyme DPYD&#xD;
      is responsible for metabolizing &gt;80% of the drug, producing the inactive metabolite 5,6&#xD;
      dihydroxy-5-FU. It is widely documented that a decreased DPYP activity is associated with&#xD;
      severe toxicity. Non-metabolised fraction of 5-FU (20%) is transformed by a series of enzymes&#xD;
      (e.g TP, TK), producing the active metabolites that will cause TYMS inhibition, thereby&#xD;
      promoting DNA/RNA damage. Variations in TYMS and MTHFR genes (related to reduced folate&#xD;
      synthesis, increased 5-FU effect), have been associated with toxicity by treatment with 5-FU.&#xD;
      The approach that was used to select the genetic variants consisted of a search in the&#xD;
      database, PharmGKB. A total of six non-synonymous SNPs will be analyzed: four of them&#xD;
      comprise the DPYD gene, one for TYMS and one for MTHFR. Analysis will be performed using&#xD;
      TaqMan™ SNP Genotyping Assay technology (Applied Biosystems™). SNPs will be assessed in DNA&#xD;
      isolated from paraffin embedded patient samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimum sample number will be calculated in order to ensure the goals of the project are&#xD;
      fully accomplished. Considering that approximately 90% of GC cases are indeed GAC, at 5%&#xD;
      error rate and at 95% confidence interval the investigators originally projected a sample&#xD;
      size of 200 patients. However the investigators have also considered a 15% rate of sample&#xD;
      loss (defective samples or patient drop-out), which gave a total of 230 patients to be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard descriptive statistics will be utilized to analyze qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
      variables, such as relative and absolute frequencies, frequency tables, average, median,&#xD;
      standard deviation, range and quartiles. A 95% confidence will be considered appropriate for&#xD;
      analysis. Descriptive statistics will also be used to characterize the most relevant clinical&#xD;
      parameters measured. The association of categorized variables will be performed by chi-square&#xD;
      or Fisher's exact tests. One arm Analysis of Variance will compare continuous variables among&#xD;
      groups. Survival outcome studies will be accomplished using the Kaplan-Meier method.&#xD;
      Prognostic factors will be evaluated according to the Cox proportional hazards regression&#xD;
      model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal component analysis (PCA) of the genes variants will be conducted and the&#xD;
      association of the first principal components with a small pre-defined set of genomic&#xD;
      alteration signatures will be assessed. To define molecular subgroups, the investigators will&#xD;
      utilize unsupervised clustering. The correlation of the molecular subtypes with clinical data&#xD;
      (e.g. age, gender, Lauren class) and clinical outcomes (e.g. overall survival, response rate)&#xD;
      will be assessed. Moreover, supervised classification will be performed based on clinical&#xD;
      outcomes and the resulting groups of both approaches will be compared with other reported&#xD;
      molecular subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient protection/written informed consent forms&#xD;
&#xD;
      All parties guarantee the protection of the patients' personal records. Patient names are not&#xD;
      included in any form in sheet-reports, publications, or in any type of publishable document&#xD;
      derived from the study with the exception of documents required by law. Informed consent&#xD;
      forms are elaborated strictly following legal and local regulations. The written informed&#xD;
      consent forms, including all changes made throughout the study must be prospectively approved&#xD;
      by the Internal Review Board/independent Ethics Committee, and CEMP prior to be incorporated&#xD;
      into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators, representatives or healthcare providers will obtain written informed&#xD;
      consent forms from every patient or a legal representative before any specific activity of&#xD;
      the study is performed.&#xD;
