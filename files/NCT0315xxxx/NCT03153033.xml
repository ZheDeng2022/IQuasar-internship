      What are the implications of wheelchair propulsion-induced fatigue for the development of&#xD;
      shoulder pain and how can this knowledge improve prevention programs?&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this project, the &quot;Shoulder Health and Mobility group&quot; of the Swiss Paraplegic Research&#xD;
      in Nottwil (Switzerland) wants to investigate how fatigue during wheelchair propulsion&#xD;
      affects risk factors for shoulder pain of persons with a spinal cord injury (SCI). The&#xD;
      investigators want to find out how the handrim wheelchair propulsion technique changes with&#xD;
      fatigue and want to define persons who are susceptible to fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Getting life back after a SCI will most likely occur with the help of a wheelchair, whether&#xD;
      it is at the beginning of rehabilitation or throughout further life. Gaining back mobility&#xD;
      and participation in social life is important, also because of the multiple positive effects&#xD;
      of physical activity on person's health and self-esteem, preventing several chronic diseases.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is needed to try to stay away from shoulder injuries. Since the shoulder is&#xD;
      very mobile and thus unstable, the joint is at increased risk for injuries. This is reflected&#xD;
      in the high amount of persons with a SCI having shoulder pain (between 30 to 70 %). Once pain&#xD;
      or an injury occurred, it is hard to recover, as so far no effective treatment is available.&#xD;
      Several factors as gender, weight, age, level and completeness of the SCI, movement patterns&#xD;
      and muscle strength were found to be related with injury and pain. However, it is currently&#xD;
      not well understood what exactly causes shoulder injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handrim wheelchair propulsion is an inefficient mode of propulsion and asks a lot of demands&#xD;
      to the upper body. Because of the inefficient movement and the shoulder being prone to&#xD;
      injuries, wheelchair propulsion has a high chance of inducing shoulder injuries and pain.&#xD;
      Propelling with a technique minimizing the loads on the shoulders and improving the capacity&#xD;
      to perform these movements (as increasing muscle strength) is of utmost importance as these&#xD;
      factors can be modified by training. Previous intervention programs have learned wheelchair&#xD;
      users to propel with long and smooth strokes aiming to reduce the loads. Although someone&#xD;
      might be aware of the recommended techniques and can apply them, propulsion technique might&#xD;
      change with fatigue and could become less optimal. A similar phenomena happens for example in&#xD;
      landing strategies from a jump. In a fresh state, persons will try to have a stable landing&#xD;
      reducing the impact on the lower limbs. With fatigue, however, there will be a tendency to&#xD;
      forget about the proper landing technique which on its turn can increase the risk of&#xD;
      injuries. This was suggested to be one of the reasons why there is an increased prevalence of&#xD;
      injuries towards the end of a game. So far, it is unclear how fatigue alters propulsion&#xD;
      technique and how these changes are related with an increased risk of shoulder pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tis project aims to achieve the goals by investigating how very strenuous wheelchair&#xD;
      propulsion (fatigue intervention) of 15 minutes alters the propulsion technique of 50 persons&#xD;
      with a SCI. All participants will perform the fatigue protocol in the movement analysis lab&#xD;
      at the Swiss Paraplegic Research. During the protocol, participants will be requested to&#xD;
      perform as many 8 loops as possible with their wheelchairs, including starts, stops, and&#xD;
      right and left turns. Before and after the protocol, movement patterns, muscle usage and&#xD;
      loads during wheelchair propulsion and the characteristics of the shoulder muscle tendons&#xD;
      during rest will be assessed. Furthermore, the person's characteristics, such as weight, age,&#xD;
      gender, time since injury, injury level, health conditions, use of medication, muscle&#xD;
      strength and activity levels will be assessed. All these factors might be associated with the&#xD;
      susceptibility to fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer our questions, we will first compare the propulsion technique (movement patterns,&#xD;
      loads, and muscle usage) before and after the protocol to investigate the direct effect of&#xD;
      fatigue. Secondly, we will investigate the association of negative changes in tendon&#xD;
      appearance (which has been related to injury) with the changes in the propulsion technique to&#xD;
      investigate the implications of acute changes that might increase the risk of injury. Finally&#xD;
      we will run a model including all variables to determine which person's characteristics are&#xD;
      associated with an increased susceptibility to fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be highly relevant as it will give answers about the content, the aims and&#xD;
      the target population of prevention programs for shoulder injury, aiming to improve mobility,&#xD;
      participation, and quality of life in persons with SCI.&#xD;

      Background and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wheelchairs are the most important assistive devices used by persons with a spinal cord&#xD;
      injury (SCI). A Danish study reported for example that 83.5% of 236 persons used a manual&#xD;
      wheelchair and 27% a powered wheelchair, some of which used both a manual and an electrical&#xD;
      wheelchair. The repetitive nature of wheelchair propulsion in combination with the shoulder&#xD;
      being prone to injuries results in a high prevalence of persons with a SCI having shoulder&#xD;
      pain. Several factors have been associated with shoulder pain but exact pathways remain&#xD;
      unclear. In order to improve injury prevention which would have a significant effect on&#xD;
      shoulder pain, it is important to focus on biomechanical and neuromuscular risk factors&#xD;
      modifiable by training. Fatigue could have a negative effect on propulsion mechanics further&#xD;
      increasing the risk of injury. Previous studies have induced fatigue by interventions on a&#xD;
      treadmill or with an ergometer. However, it is important to investigate functional fatigue,&#xD;
      as the effect of fatigue is task dependent. To date there is no clear understanding of the&#xD;
      effect of functional fatigue on biomechanical and neuromuscular risk factors in persons with&#xD;
      SCI during wheelchair propulsion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: What is the role of muscle fatigue in altering neuromusculoskeletal and&#xD;
      movement body functions and structures related to shoulder pain in persons with SCI? Aim1: To&#xD;
      define how muscle fatigue induced by wheelchair propulsion changes biomechanical and&#xD;
      neuromuscular risk factors of shoulder injuries, leading to shoulder pain, in persons with&#xD;
      SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To evaluate how changes in propulsion biomechanics due to propulsion-induced fatigue&#xD;
      are associated with changes in tendon appearance related to tendinopathy, in persons with&#xD;
      SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To identify predictor variables (e.g., activity levels and muscle strength) for&#xD;
      persons with SCI who are susceptible to wheelchair propulsion-induced fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Repeated measures within subject design&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, 50 participants will be recruited via the Swiss Spinal Cord Injury Cohort&#xD;
      study database. The number of 48 participants was calculated based on a sample-size&#xD;
      estimation from a study investigating a high-intensity wheelchair propulsion activity that&#xD;
      found that echogenicity ratio changed significantly from 1.97 ± 0.74 to 1.73 ± 0.56 (p=0.038)&#xD;
      (after the intense wheelchair propulsion activity. To observe this change of 0.24 difference&#xD;
      in echogenicity ratio of the biceps tendon at 80% statistical power and alpha=0.05, 48&#xD;
      participants are needed. In order to take into account drop-out and missing data 50&#xD;
      participants will be recruited. All participants will meet the defined inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      excluded when meeting the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be tested during one session of four hours after they have read and signed&#xD;
      the informed consent. During the testing session the following measurements will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's characteristics and activity levels: Socio-demographic variables, injury&#xD;
      characteristics, presence of contractures and spasticity will be defined with a general&#xD;
      questionnaire. Furthermore, activity levels will be defined with the Physical Activity Scale&#xD;
      for Individuals with Physical Disabilities (PASIPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants weight will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative ultrasound pre-fatigue: Ultrasound measurements of the biceps brachii and&#xD;
      supraspinatus tendon at rest will be collected with Quantitative Ultrasound Protocols (QUS).&#xD;
      This technique has been used previously and has proven strong reliability and validity for&#xD;
      measures of shoulder pain and tendinopathy. More specifically, for the biceps tendon&#xD;
      longitudinal image, participants will be positioned with their non-dominant arm flexed 90˚ at&#xD;
      the elbow and their wrist resting on the ipsilateral thigh. Images will be taken so that the&#xD;
      fibres are aligned perpendicular to the transducer which optimises the quantification of&#xD;
      fibre alignment and tendon thickness. In order to mark the skin location of the pre-fatigue&#xD;
      measurement, a steel reference marker will be taped to the skin at the distal end of the&#xD;
      transducer. The distinct interference pattern created by the marker at the top of the images&#xD;
      is used to define the region of interest (ROI) upon which the computations are performed. For&#xD;
      the supraspinatus transverse image, participants will be positioned with their non-dominant&#xD;
      palm placed on the lower back, shoulder extended, and elbow flexed posteriorly. The steel&#xD;
      marker is now taped to the skin at the proximal end of the transducer and the widest part of&#xD;
      the tendon is imaged. The specific positions optimize image quality and repeatability of the&#xD;
      imaging protocol. Furthermore, three consecutive measurements of the acromio-humeral distance&#xD;
      of the non-dominant hand will be collected under an unloaded and loaded conditions (during&#xD;
      push up in wheelchair, once without further instructions and once with the instruction of&#xD;
      retracting the shoulders) as has been done previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same trained investigator will perform all ultrasound measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum sprint and strength test: A 15m over ground sprint test will be performed to define&#xD;
      anaerobic work capacity. Furthermore a maximum isometric forward push against resistance on&#xD;
      the wheelchair will be performed to measure maximal strength.These tests have been used&#xD;
      previously. During both tests, external forces will be collected at 100 Hz with the&#xD;
      SmartWheel. The 15m sprint aims to define the anaerobic work capacity. The participants will&#xD;
      be required to propel as fast as possible from one cone to another standing 15 meters apart&#xD;
      which will result in an outcome of the maximum unilateral power output. For the isometric&#xD;
      maximum push, the wheelchair with SmartWheel will be connected via a rope to a force&#xD;
      transducer and a wall. The participant will be requested to push as hard as possible for 5&#xD;
      seconds with the hands on top of the handrim to measure the maximum applied force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wheelchair propulsion pre-fatigue: The participant will be requested to propel his/her&#xD;
      wheelchair on the treadmill for two trials of 90 seconds at two power output conditions&#xD;
      (intermediate and hard). During the trials, 3D kinematics of the upper extremity, 3D kinetics&#xD;
      applied to the handrim of the wheelchair and muscle activation of muscles active during&#xD;
      wheelchair propulsion will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue protocol: The figure 8 protocol (fatigue intervention) requires the participants to&#xD;
      propel three times as many laps as possible for four minutes each. Every bout of four minutes&#xD;
      is separated by 90 seconds of rest. Each lap consists of a right and left turn and two&#xD;
      complete stops after half a lap. Measurements during the protocol include the Rate of&#xD;
      Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale, heart rate, and propulsion kinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wheelchair propulsion and Quantitative ultrasound post-fatigue: The same measurements as in&#xD;
      the pre-fatigue tests will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To investigate the effect of muscle fatigue induced by wheelchair propulsion on&#xD;
      biomechanical and neuromuscular risk factors of shoulder injuries, leading to shoulder pain,&#xD;
      in persons with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Muscle fatigue induced by wheelchair propulsion will result in significant&#xD;
      changes in biomechanical and neuromuscular risk factors related to shoulder pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent variables of interest are stroke frequency, glenohumeral contact force, net joint&#xD;
      moments, kinematic and normalised muscle forces during wheelchair propulsion, tendon&#xD;
      appearance of the m. biceps brachii and m. supraspinatus, and acromio-humeral distance. A&#xD;
      statistical parametric mapping (SPM) one way repeated measures ANOVA will be used to assess&#xD;
      meaningful variations across time for each continuous variable during wheelchair propulsion&#xD;
      (alpha=0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine the relation between changes in propulsion biomechanics and changes in&#xD;
      tendon appearance related to tendinopathy post-fatigue, in persons with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: There will be a positive association between changes in propulsion biomechanics&#xD;
      and changes in tendon appearance of the m.biceps and m.supraspinatus when controlling for&#xD;
      sex, level and completeness of injury, health conditions, range of motion and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent variables will be changes in propulsion biomechanics that significantly changed&#xD;
      after the fatigue protocol and dependent variables will include changes in tendon appearance&#xD;
      of the m.biceps and m.supraspinatus. Covariates will be sex, level and completeness of&#xD;
      injury, health conditions (spasticity and contractures), range of motion and weight.&#xD;
      Multivariable linear regression analysis will be used to test the hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To investigate the relation of the susceptibility of fatigue and person's&#xD;
      characteristics (activity levels and muscle strength), in persons with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: There will be a negative association between changes in propulsion biomechanics&#xD;
      (including stroke frequency, scapular kinematics and glenohumeral contact force) and both&#xD;
      activity levels and muscle strength, when controlling for sex, level and completeness of&#xD;
      injury, health conditions (spasticity and contractures), range of motion and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent variables will be propulsion biomechanics that significantly changed after the&#xD;
      fatigue protocol and dependent variables will include physical activity levels and muscle&#xD;
      strength. Covariates will be sex, level and completeness of injury, health conditions&#xD;
      (spasticity and contractures), range of motion and weight. Multivariable linear regression&#xD;
      analysis will be used to test the hypothesis.&#xD;
