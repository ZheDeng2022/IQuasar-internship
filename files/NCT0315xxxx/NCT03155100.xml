      This Nordic Myeloma Study Group study is a phase 2 study for advanced multiple myeloma (MM)&#xD;
      patients below 75 years of age. The main aim of this study is to assess the overall response&#xD;
      rate (ORR) with a new drug combination, carfilzomib + elotuzumab + dexamethasone&#xD;
      (CAR-ELO-Dex). Even if this is not a randomized study rough comparisons can be done with&#xD;
      earlier reports of different regimens in the same clinical situation. In addition, safety&#xD;
      assessment is of critical importance for a new regimen. A modern concept is to study the&#xD;
      depth of complete responses (CR) with a sensitive multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) method&#xD;
      for minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment - an endpoint that is mostly lacking in&#xD;
      previous studies for this patient population. We assume that treatment with this new&#xD;
      combination of CAR + ELO + Dex will produce at least as good responses as the most efficient&#xD;
      regimens so far used in this clinical situation, and there will be a substantial proportion&#xD;
      of CR responses with MRD-negativity which can be regarded as an indicator of high-level&#xD;
      treatment efficacy and which gives a good basis for comparisons of treatment efficacy between&#xD;
      different study regimens in future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population of the study is the patients who have relapsed or progressed after 1 to&#xD;
      3 prior treatment lines in which PI (bortezomib and/or ixazomib) and/or lenalidomide have&#xD;
      been included. The primary endpoint is overall response rate while the secondary endpoints&#xD;
      include complete remission, duration of response, assessment of the depth (quality) of CR&#xD;
      with MRD measurement by flow cytometry, estimation of progression free survival (PFS) and&#xD;
      time to next treatment, and evaluation of adverse events and safety.&#xD;
