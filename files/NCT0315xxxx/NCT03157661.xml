    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a major medical and public health burden throughout the world. It is&#xD;
      estimated that 1 in 3 adult South Africans are diagnosed with hypertension, however detailed&#xD;
      statistics reflecting the burden of disease are somewhat lacking. The implications and&#xD;
      effects of poorly controlled hypertension and its associated co-morbidities are significant&#xD;
      and extensive. In South Africa, hypertension is the single most prevalent cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factor and predominant contributor to cardiovascular disease and mortality.&#xD;

      RESEARCH PROBLEM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the diagnosis of hypertension and initiation of treatment is most frequently made in&#xD;
      the primary health care setting, the perioperative period provides clinicians with a unique&#xD;
      opportunity to identify patients with hypertensive disease, educate patients about the&#xD;
      disease, and, if appropriate, initiate appropriate therapy. Furthermore it provides the&#xD;
      opportunity to refer patients for further investigation or follow up at peripheral health&#xD;
      care centres for ongoing management. The identification and diagnosis of hypertension as well&#xD;
      as the effective management thereof is a primary health care target and serves as an&#xD;
      efficient health care strategy in reducing long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      as well as the burden of disease associated complications. There are however, a multitude of&#xD;
      reasons to investigate and treat persistent hypertension in the perioperative period. The&#xD;
      long-term end organ effects are numerous and add significantly to patient morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Appropriate blood pressure control has an important long term impact on patient&#xD;
      outcome. In the acute peri-operative setting the significance of hypertension is however less&#xD;
      clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS &amp; OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to identify and categorise the prevalence of hypertensive&#xD;
      disease in adult patients presenting for non-cardiac, non-obstetric elective surgery in all&#xD;
      surgical disciplines at 1 tertiary level institution and 6 secondary hospitals over the&#xD;
      determined period of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims of the study will include the following 1) categorise the degree of&#xD;
      hypertensive disease in the study population 2) identify associated target organ damage and&#xD;
      associated risk factors 3) determine patient compliance to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a sub-study, the primary objective will be to explore the relationship between&#xD;
      pre-operative blood pressure measurement and intra-operative hypotension (mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure (MAP) &lt; 55mmHg for &gt; 1minute as defined by Walsh et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve the aims of the study the following objectives will be sought:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the Study related to the prevalence of hypertension:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prevalence and degree of hypertensive disease in adult patients presenting for&#xD;
           non-cardiac, non-obstetric, elective surgery in all surgical disciplines with elective&#xD;
           theatre lists over the period of the study will be determined by measuring and recording&#xD;
           preoperative blood pressure during the pre-assessment anaesthetic consultation and/or&#xD;
           immediate preoperative period, using an automated oscillometric blood pressure&#xD;
           measurement technique. If the blood pressure is noted to be elevated, two additional&#xD;
           readings at least 10 minutes apart will be performed. The lowest recorded blood pressure&#xD;
           will be used. The study will identify patients with preoperative in hospital blood&#xD;
           pressure measurements as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  SBP&lt;140 mmHg and DBP &lt;90 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  SBP&lt;160 mmHg and DBP&lt;100 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  SBP&lt;180 mmHg and DBP&lt;110 mmHg without end organ damage&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  SBP&lt;180 mmHg and DBP&lt;110 mmHg with end organ damage&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compliance to anti-hypertensive treatment will be assessed using the Morisky Medication&#xD;
           Adherence Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the sub-study related to the association of pre-operative blood pressure&#xD;
      measurement and intra-operative hypotension:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Any episodes of low blood pressure defined as a mean arterial pressure of less than 55mmHg&#xD;
      will be recorded as well as the cumulative time spend below this threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design &amp; Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective quantitative study at one tertiary and six secondary level institutions&#xD;
      involving data collected on adult, non-cardiac, non-obstetric patients presenting for&#xD;
      elective surgery for a period of one week (from Monday at 7am to Friday at 7pm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data is to be collected by the anaesthesiology registrars and consultants providing&#xD;
      anaesthetic services to elective patients, in all surgical disciplines, over the one-week&#xD;
      period of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data will be recorded on a clinical reporting form (CRF) evaluating:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General demographic information e.g. age, gender, ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General medical information e.g. co-morbid conditions, risk factors for hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of target organ damage which will be assessed by the presence of appropriate&#xD;
           electrocardiographic changes, presence of impaired renal function (elevated creatinine)&#xD;
           and/or the presence of retinopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General surgical information e.g. indication for surgery and type of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population &amp; Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will involve patients presenting for elective non-cardiac,&#xD;
      non-obstetric, surgery who are 18 years of age or older and are able to give consent. For the&#xD;
      prevalence of hypertension and compliance to treatment part of the study, all patients&#xD;
      regardless of the planned anaesthetic technique will be included. For the sub-study, looking&#xD;
      at the pre-operative blood pressure and its association with intraoperative hypotension only&#xD;
      patients who receive a general or neuraxial anaesthetic will be included. For the sub-study&#xD;
      only, this effectively excludes patients who undergo some form of sedation or local block to&#xD;
      facilitate their procedures e.g. cataract extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure measurements will be performed with an appropriately sized non-invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure cuff, using an automated oscillometric method of blood pressure measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment &amp; Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited by convenience sampling. All patients compliant with the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be included in the study. Data obtained will be collected by various&#xD;
      anaesthesiology registrars and consultants, and will not include any specific patient&#xD;
      information, thus ensuring patient anonymity. Demographic, medical and surgical information&#xD;
      is generally routinely available prior to anaesthetic and surgical intervention. Furthermore,&#xD;
      blood pressure measurements are routinely performed and documented. Obtained details will be&#xD;
      captured on a clinical reporting form and so patient records will not be altered or removed&#xD;
      for study purposes. Finally, no additional measurements, tests or investigations will be&#xD;
      performed which might place the patient at risk, or discomfort, or impose any additional cost&#xD;
      or burden on patient or institutional resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management &amp; Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data capture forms will be collected and collated. The information will be captured in Excel&#xD;
      for further statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be risk adjusted for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need for blood transfusion intra-operatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-operative anaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ASA status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of anaesthesia (Dependant on sample size)&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL &amp; LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure complete anonymity, no personal patient information or details will be recorded on&#xD;
      the data collection form. As this is an audit, and the researcher will not be involved in&#xD;
      delivery of anaesthetic care to the patients in the study, it will be the responsibility of&#xD;
      the anaesthesiology registrars and consultants providing the anaesthetic, to ensure patient&#xD;
      safety and well-being, at all times. This is routine, good practise and the study will not&#xD;
      influence or detract from these patient specific clinical decisions or patient management in&#xD;
      any way.&#xD;
