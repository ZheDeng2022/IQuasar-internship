  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C is an important health problem in Myanmar affecting around 3% of the population.&#xD;
      New drugs have been developed which have transformed the treatment of this disease around the&#xD;
      world with very high success rates. Two of these drugs are now registered for use in Myanmar.&#xD;
      In this study 200 patients with chronic hepatitis C(100 with HIV co-infection) will be&#xD;
      assessed and started on the new treatment. We will observe them and measure treatment&#xD;
      effectiveness and tolerability. In 24 patients extra blood samples will be taken for drug&#xD;
      measurements to describe the effect of the drugs on patients in Myanmar in more detail.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Data concerning Hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence in Myanmar is scarce. Preliminary results&#xD;
      of a survey, conducted in 2015 in different areas in Myanmar estimated a seroprevalence of&#xD;
      HCV of around 2.65 %, which represents 1.3 million infected patients. Genotype 6 was mostly&#xD;
      found in the northern cities and genotype 3 in the southern and western cities of Myanmar.&#xD;
      However, treatment options for HCV in Myanmar remain limited currently, including for&#xD;
      patients with HIV co-infection who are generally considered high priority given their&#xD;
      increased risk for liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New direct acting antiviral therapies which can achieve high rates of sustained virological&#xD;
      response (SVR) (&gt;90%), defined as complete suppression of the virus 12 weeks after completion&#xD;
      of antiviral therapy, are becoming increasingly available worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Myanmar, in mid-2015, the guideline for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection of&#xD;
      the Myanmar GI and Liver Society was revised in line with the recent development of Directly&#xD;
      Acting Antiviral (DAA) drugs. This observational study will follow the recommendations for&#xD;
      patient care presented in this guideline. Two hundred patients with chronic hepatitis C (100&#xD;
      with HIV co-infection) will be recruited in this observational study of routine care with two&#xD;
      newly available antiviral drugs (sofosbuvir+ daclatasvir) in two different groups of patients&#xD;
      (with and without HIV coinfection) at two centres in Yangon, Myanmar. Their response to&#xD;
      treatment will be monitored. In addition a pharmacokinetic study is planned in a subset of&#xD;
      patients to characterise any determinants of treatment response or tolerability in patients&#xD;
      in Myanmar. This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and the&#xD;
      applicable regulatory requirements&#xD;
