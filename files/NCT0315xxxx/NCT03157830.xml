  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of Ocrelizumab (OCR) in&#xD;
      Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis patients who have been previously treated with natalizumab (NTZ)&#xD;
      by evaluating relapse rate, progression on MRI and disability progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, open-label, Phase IV clinical trial. Patients with&#xD;
      relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), ages 18 to 65, who have received 12 or more&#xD;
      continuous infusions of NTZ, and have been free of relapses, disability worsening or Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) progression 6 months prior to the transition screening visit will be&#xD;
      eligible for the study. After informed consent to participate has been obtained, the patient&#xD;
      will have physical exam (PE), non-blinded Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), MRI,&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) and labs done for the screening visit to determine&#xD;
      eligibility. Brain MRI with and without contrast will be performed with the standard MS&#xD;
      protocol. MRIs will be performed with 3mm slice thickness with no gaps between slices.&#xD;
      Patients will receive their first dose of OCR 4 to 6 weeks after the last dose of NTZ. Other&#xD;
      baseline measures, including physical exam, EDSS, MSIS-29, and labs will be performed within&#xD;
      4 weeks of screening. Physical exam, non-blinded EDSS, and labs will be performed at month 3,&#xD;
      month 6, month 9, and month 12. MSIS-29 will be performed at months 6 and 12. In addition,&#xD;
      MRIs will be performed at months 3, 6, and 12.&#xD;
