    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab works when given alone and in combination with&#xD;
      ipilimumab or chemotherapy in treating patients with previously untreated stage I-IIIA&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin,&#xD;
      docetaxel, and pemetrexed, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either&#xD;
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;
      Giving nivolumab with ipilimumab or chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer compared to chemotherapy alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the major pathologic response rate (MPRR) in patients treated with induction&#xD;
      nivolumab, nivolumab plus ipilimumab, and nivolumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Toxicity (assessed by the National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
      Adverse Events [CTCAE] version 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Peri-operative morbidity and mortality. III. CD8 positive (+) tumor infiltrating&#xD;
      lymphocytes (TILs) in resected tumor tissues of patients treated with nivolumab alone and&#xD;
      nivolumab plus ipilimumab and nivolumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Quantification of CD8+ TILs will be assessed by counting the cells positive for staining&#xD;
      with an anti-CD8 antibody by immunohistochemistry in five random square areas (1 mm^2 each)&#xD;
      in both intratumoral and peritumoral compartments using the automated Aperio system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Response rates to induction treatment (by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      [RECIST] version 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Recurrence-free survival. VII. Overall survival. VIII. To correlate major pathologic&#xD;
      response with recurrence-free and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. Complete resection (R0) rate. X. Pathologic complete response (pCR) in resected tumor&#xD;
      specimens. XI. To correlate response assessed by imaging studies with outcomes (both major&#xD;
      pathologic response to treatment and long-term recurrence-free survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
      XII. To correlate blood, tissue, and stool-based biomarkers with efficacy and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify novel prognostic and predictive markers present at diagnosis. II. To determine&#xD;
      modulation of markers by induction immunotherapy and/or immunotherapy plus platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy in order to inform future translational studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to Arms A and B and enrolled in Arm C or D after completion&#xD;
      of enrollment to Arms A and B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive nivolumab as in Arm A and receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes and cisplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1,&#xD;
      22, and 43 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also&#xD;
      receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour or pemetrexed IV over 10 minutes on days 1, 22, and 43 in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM D: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1, nivolumab IV over 30 minutes&#xD;
      on days 1, 22, and 43, and cisplatin (or carboplatin) IV over 2 hours on days 1, 22, and 43&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive&#xD;
      docetaxel IV over 1 hour or pemetrexed IV over 10 minutes on days 1, 22, and 43 in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment and surgery, patients are followed up at 8 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Will be compared to historical controls. Simon's minimax two-stage design will be applied to test the major pathologic response rate for each one of the three treatment arms. The study will also apply the Bayesian framework to calculate the posterior probability of mPR rate. The 95% credible interval of the mPR rate will be constructed. In addition, we will calculate the probability that the mPR rate is at least 15% (i.e., defining that drug is efficacious) under the beta-binomial model.</description>

             nivolumab; Women of childbearing potential is defined as any female who has&#xD;
             experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically&#xD;
             as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or&#xD;
             physiological causes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures required in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with pre-existing sensorineural hearing impairment/loss or newly diagnosed as&#xD;
             documented by an audiology assessment performed prior to study enrollment may not be&#xD;
             eligible for cisplatin and may be dispositioned to carboplatin, as determined by the&#xD;
             treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to taxotere and or&#xD;
             polysorbate 80 must be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug&#xD;
             administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of study results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo,&#xD;
             type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only&#xD;
             requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or&#xD;
             conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted&#xD;
             to enroll&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;&#xD;
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14&#xD;
             days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement&#xD;
             doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active&#xD;
             autoimmune disease. Subjects are permitted to use topical, ocular, intra-articular,&#xD;
             intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption).&#xD;
             Physiologic replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted, even if &gt; 10&#xD;
             mg/day prednisone equivalents. A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (eg,&#xD;
             contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (eg, delayed-type&#xD;
             hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 or anti-CTLA-4 antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C&#xD;
             virus ribonucleic acid indicating acute or chronic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus or known acquired&#xD;
             immunodeficiency syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody and/or to study&#xD;
             drug components&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious illness or concomitant non-oncological disease such as neurologic,&#xD;
             psychiatric, infectious disease or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk&#xD;
             associated with study participation or study drug administration and in the judgment&#xD;
             of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are sexually active, with preserved reproductive capacity, and unwilling&#xD;
             to use a medically acceptable method of contraception (e.g. such as implants,&#xD;
             injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices or vasectomized&#xD;
             partner for participating females, condoms for participating males) during and after&#xD;
             the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) should use an adequate method to avoid&#xD;
             pregnancy for 23 weeks after the last dose of investigational drug(s); Men who are&#xD;
             sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of&#xD;
             less than 1% per year; Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP&#xD;
             will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last&#xD;
             dose of investigational product; Women who are not of childbearing potential as well&#xD;
             as azoospermic men do not require contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical factors potentially hampering&#xD;
             compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule&#xD;
