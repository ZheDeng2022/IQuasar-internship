  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase Ib/IIa&#xD;
      study is to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of eASCs (Cx611) administered&#xD;
      intravenously as adjunctive therapy, therefore in addition to standard of care (SoC) therapy,&#xD;
      to patients with severe community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (sCABP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The completion of this study will contribute to the basic knowledge on stem cells and their&#xD;
      mode-of-action, and has a large translational character, i.e. to document the safety and&#xD;
      explore the efficacy of Cx611 in patients with sCABP.&#xD;

      The purpose of this randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase Ib/IIa&#xD;
      study is to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of eASCs (Cx611) administered&#xD;
      intravenously as adjunctive therapy, therefore in addition to standard of care (SoC) therapy,&#xD;
      to patients with severe community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (sCABP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate the safety profile of two allogeneic Cx611 80 mL infusions administered through a&#xD;
      central line within 3 days (on days 1 and 3) at a dose of 160 million cells each (320 million&#xD;
      cells total) and to monitor any adverse event and potential immunological host responses&#xD;
      against the administered cells during 90 days of follow-up after the first infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explore the clinical efficacy of Cx611 in terms of a reduction of the duration of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation and/or need for vasopressors and/or improved survival, and/or clinical cure of&#xD;
      the sCABP, and other efficacy-related endpoints.&#xD;
