  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to assess the efficacy of afatinib in combination with pembrolizumab,&#xD;
      as measured by objective response (OR) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      squamous NSCLC who progressed during or after first line platinum-based treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to confirm the RP2D, assess the safety profile, and the&#xD;
      secondary measures of clinical efficacy including disease control (DC), duration of objective&#xD;
      response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and tumour shrinkage.&#xD;

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumour assessment performed at screening (-28 days), week 9 (day 56-63) after study treatment (afatinib or pembrolizumab) start and every 9th week thereafter, up to 556 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate is defined as percentage of participants with the best overall response of complete response (CR, disappearance of all target lesions) or confirmed partial response (PR, at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameter (SoD, longest diameter (LD) measured for all lesions except lymph nodes, where shortest diameter (ShD) was used) of target lesions, reference is baseline SoD). Tumour response was assessed based on local radiological image (Computerised tomography (CT) or Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) evaluation by the investigators according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D)</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days (1 treatment cycle) from study treatment (afatinib and pembrolizumab) administration.</time_frame>
    <description>Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) was to be calculated through a Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) with overdose control that was to be fitted to binary toxicity outcomes. After 12 patients had completed at least one cycle (one cycle equals 21 days and consists of one time infusion of pembrolizumab at Day 1 + daily intake of afatinib) of treatment, the prior distributions were to be updated through Gibbs sampling procedures with the accumulated dose limiting toxicity (DLT) data from the first treatment cycle. The estimate of parameters was to be updated as data were accumulated using the BLRM. At the end of the dose confirmation, the toxicity probability at each dose level was to be calculated to determine an estimate of the RP2D. Posterior probabilities for the rate of DLT were to be summarised from BLRM. Confirmation of the RP2D by the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) was to be based on these probabilities as well as on the review of other safety and laboratory data.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumour assessment performed at screening (-28 days), week 9 (day 56-63) after study treatment (afatinib or pembrolizumab) start and every 9th week thereafter, up to 556 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control rate was calculated as percentage of participants with CR, PR, or stable disease (SD, neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters (SoD), nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD, at least a 20% increase in the SoD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest SoD recorded on study (including baseline), together with an absolute increase in the SoD of at least 5 millimeter (mm ) or the appearance of one or more new lesions). Tumour response was assessed based on local radiological image (Computerised tomography (CT) or Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) evaluation by the investigators according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Objective Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumour assessment performed at screening (-28 days), week 9 (day 56-63) after study treatment (afatinib or pembrolizumab) start and every 9th week thereafter, up to 436 days.</time_frame>
    <description>For participants who showed objective response, duration of objective response (DoR), was defined as the time from first documented complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) until the earliest of disease progression (PD) or death. Tumour response was assessed based on local radiological image (CT or MRI) evaluation by the investigators according to RECIST version 1.1. The number of participants with objective response who experienced the event &quot;disease progression or death (whichever came first)&quot; is reported instead of a metric summarizing the time-to-event data with unit of time, as the number analyzed was too small to perform a Kaplan-Meier-analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumour assessment performed at screening (-28 days), week 9 (day 56-63) after study treatment (afatinib or pembrolizumab) start and every 9th week thereafter, up to 556 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival was defined as the time (weeks) from the date of the first afatinib or pembrolizumab administration to the date of disease progression (at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter (SoD, longest diameter (LD) measured for all lesions except lymph nodes, where shortest diameter (ShD) was used) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest SoD recorded on study (including baseline), together with an absolute increase in the SoD of at least 5 mm or the appearance of one or more new lesions) or death (if the patient died without progression). The date of progression for the primary analyses was determined based on investigator assessment. Tumour response was assessed based on local radiological image (Computerised tomography (CT) or Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) evaluation by the investigators according to RECIST version 1.1. Median and 95% Confidence Interval were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 of study treatment (afatinib or pembrolizumab) administration up to a total of 574 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of treatment start to the date of death from any cause. Participants without event were censored. Median and 95% Confidence Interval were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumour Shrinkage</measure>
    <time_frame>Tumour assessment performed at screening (-28 days), week 9 (day 56-63) after study treatment (afatinib or pembrolizumab) start and every 9th week thereafter, up to 556 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Tumour shrinkage (in millimeters) is defined as the difference between the minimum post-baseline sum of diameters of target lesions (SoD, longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) and the baseline sum of diameters of the same set of target lesions. Tumour shrinkage is reported as percentage change from baseline and represents the maximum decrease or the minimum increase from baseline in SoD in percentage of the baseline SoD. Negative values indicate a reduction in the SoD; positive values indicate an increase in the SoD. Tumour response was assessed based on local radiological image (CT or MRI) evaluation by the investigators according to RECIST 1.1.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This trial is an open-label, single arm phase II study assessing the tolerability and anti-tumour activity of afatinib when given in combination with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who progressed during or after first line platinum-based standard therapy and had no prior treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor or Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) targeted therapy.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects were screened for eligibility prior to participation in the trial. Subjects attended a specialist site which ensured that they (the subjects) strictly met all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. Subjects were not to be allocated to a treatment group, if any of the entry criteria were violated.&#xD;
The trial consisted of 2 parts: A safety run-in and the main part. After the safety run-in, a safety-monitoring committee (SMC) decided not to proceed with the main part.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D)</title>
        <description>Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) was to be calculated through a Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) with overdose control that was to be fitted to binary toxicity outcomes. After 12 patients had completed at least one cycle (one cycle equals 21 days and consists of one time infusion of pembrolizumab at Day 1 + daily intake of afatinib) of treatment, the prior distributions were to be updated through Gibbs sampling procedures with the accumulated dose limiting toxicity (DLT) data from the first treatment cycle. The estimate of parameters was to be updated as data were accumulated using the BLRM. At the end of the dose confirmation, the toxicity probability at each dose level was to be calculated to determine an estimate of the RP2D. Posterior probabilities for the rate of DLT were to be summarised from BLRM. Confirmation of the RP2D by the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) was to be based on these probabilities as well as on the review of other safety and laboratory data.</description>

        <title>Tumour Shrinkage</title>
        <description>Tumour shrinkage (in millimeters) is defined as the difference between the minimum post-baseline sum of diameters of target lesions (SoD, longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) and the baseline sum of diameters of the same set of target lesions. Tumour shrinkage is reported as percentage change from baseline and represents the maximum decrease or the minimum increase from baseline in SoD in percentage of the baseline SoD. Negative values indicate a reduction in the SoD; positive values indicate an increase in the SoD. Tumour response was assessed based on local radiological image (CT or MRI) evaluation by the investigators according to RECIST 1.1.</description>
        <time_frame>Tumour assessment performed at screening (-28 days), week 9 (day 56-63) after study treatment (afatinib or pembrolizumab) start and every 9th week thereafter, up to 556 days.</time_frame>

Both afatinib and pembrolizumab were to be given until documented disease progression, or unacceptable adverse events, or other reasons requiring treatment discontinuation, or for up to 35 cycles of 21 days (i.e. the approved pembrolizumab monotherapy duration).
