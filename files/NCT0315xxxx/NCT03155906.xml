    <textblock>
      INTRO-HCV is a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial that will compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of integrated treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) within&#xD;
      medically assisted rehabilitation (MAR) clinics providing opioid substitution therapy (OST)&#xD;
      compared to standard treatment. The trial will recruit approximately 250 HCV infected in&#xD;
      Bergen and Stavanger and about 1000 in a linked observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Integrating diagnostic and treatment follow-up for HCV treatment into MAR&#xD;
      outpatient clinics in Bergen and Stavanger including testing for HCV, counselling and&#xD;
      treatment evaluation and treatment delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives: Compare the effect of integrated HCV treatment assessed with sustained&#xD;
      virological response at 12 weeks between the MAR outpatient clinics in Bergen and Stavanger&#xD;
      (intervention arm) with standard treatment provided after referral to infectious disease&#xD;
      clinics among patients who receive OST having HCV Secondary objectives: Compare treatment&#xD;
      adherence between the intervention and control arms, and assess changes in quality of life,&#xD;
      fatigue and psychological well-being before and after HCV treatment, as well as changes in&#xD;
      drug use, infection related risk behavior, and risk of reinfection among those with sustained&#xD;
      virological response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main endpoint: Sustained virological response of HCV at 12 weeks (± 10 days) Study&#xD;
      population: The target group will be patients receiving care with MAR from involved&#xD;
      outpatient clinics in Bergen, Sandnes and Stavanger who are chronically infected with HCV and&#xD;
      eligible for treatment according to national guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: Participants will be included and followed up at least annually for the total&#xD;
      study duration between 2017 and 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome: This study will inform on the relative advantages and disadvantages of an&#xD;
      integrated treatment program for HCV into MAR compared to standard care aiming to increase&#xD;
      access to treatment and improved treatment adherence. If the integrated treatment structure&#xD;
      is found to be safe and efficacious, it can be considered for further scale-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale Globally, about 71 million people are chronically infected with chronic hepatitis C&#xD;
      virus infection (HCV) and approximately 700,000 are dying annually of related complications.&#xD;
      It has been estimated to be 10-20,000 people in Norway have chronic HCV. People who inject&#xD;
      drugs represent around 75% of these, most being infected with HCV through sharing of syringes&#xD;
      and other user equipment. HCV and hepatitis B are both among the leading causes to liver&#xD;
      disease and transplantation worldwide. Prevention and control has to date unfortunately shown&#xD;
      to be difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among people with opioid addiction and HCV, a third develops severe complications within&#xD;
      three decades. Within the same group and after 50 years of age, liver disease is as common as&#xD;
      risk of death as overdose. Reports from medically assisted rehabilitation (MAR) clinics&#xD;
      delivering opioid substitution therapy (OST) in Norway indicate that more than half of the&#xD;
      patients receiving OST have a HCV. Chronic HCV substantially increases the risk of severe&#xD;
      complications such as liver failure and death within two to three decades. The mean age of&#xD;
      OST patients in Norway is 42 years and is currently increasing, and a large group have had&#xD;
      HCV for more than twenty years. Reaching these patients with treatment is of critical&#xD;
      importance to avoid deaths and reduced quality of life, as well as preventing large costs&#xD;
      related to future treatment of end stage liver disease. Treatment for HCV has been available&#xD;
      for several decades, and weekly injections with interferon in combination with daily&#xD;
      ribavirin tablets for 16 to 48 weeks has until recently been the standard treatment. These&#xD;
      medications have been shown to give frequent and to some degree serious side effects, with&#xD;
      around 40% not achieving sustained virological response (SVR). These aspects combined with a&#xD;
      fear among many clinicians of reinfection among those being treated and an expectation of&#xD;
      poor treatment adherence in this group, has probably been the reasons for few patients having&#xD;
      been treated yet. However, studies assessing treatment adherence indicate good adherence&#xD;
      among patients receiving OST. Even if around 6% of those who are successfully treated among&#xD;
      people who inject drugs are reinfected annually, treatment is not only important for those&#xD;
      who are treated, but will also contribute to reduce the HCV infectious burden and the risk of&#xD;
      spread within the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last years, development of new highly effective tablet-based direct acting&#xD;
      antiretroviral medications, usually being curative within 8 to 16 weeks, has radically&#xD;
      changed the HCV treatment. These treatments have less side effects than those used earlier&#xD;
      and give opportunities to cure most of the HCV infected. Even if they are expensive, British&#xD;
      assessments indicate that they are cost effective as universal coverage with antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment could prevent large expenses related to future complications. Thus, the Norwegian&#xD;
      Medicines Agency approved many of these new antiretroviral treatments in 2014. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      a recent Norwegian study indicated that only 14% of OST patients with chronic HCV had&#xD;
      received HCV treatment. Currently, the high burden of HCV among people who inject drugs is&#xD;
      among the largest challenges within the MAR field, within a group that is also&#xD;
      underrepresented in clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with drug addiction have a high disease burden, generally have more difficulties in&#xD;
      obtaining adequate health care compared with the general population, on top of knowledge gaps&#xD;
      in terms of health status and how to deliver proper treatment and follow-up. This is&#xD;
      particularly the case among people who inject drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need for new approaches to reach more of those in need of treatment while ensuring&#xD;
      high-quality care. To reach patients with drug addiction, it seems to be necessary to use a&#xD;
      model of health care focusing on interdisciplinarity, accessibility, close and frequent&#xD;
      follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Department of Addiction Medicine at Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen and OST in&#xD;
      Stavanger have adopted an integrated treatment and care model for patients receiving OST with&#xD;
      follow-up by physicians, nurses, social workers and psychologists on nearly a daily basis&#xD;
      with observed intake of the OST medications. This model for treatment of OST patients is&#xD;
      unique for Bergen and Stavanger, also in an international perspective. This makes it an&#xD;
      excellent platform to test out integration of HCV treatment aiming to improve health and life&#xD;
      span of a vulnerable group, and at the same time gathering knowledge which traditionally has&#xD;
      been difficult to obtain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project designed as a randomised controlled trial done in parallel with an&#xD;
      observational study will test whether integrated treatment of HCV linked to the MAR&#xD;
      outpatient clinics to patients with chronic HCV will have better outcomes in terms of&#xD;
      reduction in HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Compare the effect of integrated HCV treatment between the OST outpatient clinics in&#xD;
      Bergen and Stavanger (intervention arm) with standard treatment provided after referral to&#xD;
      infectious disease clinics among patients who receive OST having HCV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the proportion with sustained virological response of HCV at 12 (10 - 14) weeks&#xD;
           between those randomised to intervention and control arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the proportion initiating treatment (taking at least one tablet or collecting&#xD;
           prescription from pharmacy) between the intervention and control arms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessing the incidence and prevalence of HCV at the OST outpatient clinics in Bergen,&#xD;
           Stavanger, Sandnes, and at municipal primary health care clinics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare treatment adherence between the intervention and control arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the risk of reinfection among those with sustained virological response and&#xD;
           compare between the arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess changes in quality of life, fatigue and psychological well-being before and after&#xD;
           HCV treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess changes in drug use and infection related risk behaviour before and after HCV&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate incidence and prevalence of HCV infection among people who inject drugs in&#xD;
           Bergen, Stavanger and Sandnes being followed up at OST outpatient clinics or people who&#xD;
           inject drugs followed up at primary health care clinics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate incidence and prevalence of HCV infection among people who inject drugs in&#xD;
           Bergen, Stavanger and Sandnes being followed up at OST outpatient clinics or people who&#xD;
           inject drugs followed up at primary health care clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and methodology Hypothesis Our hypothesis is that a model with integrated&#xD;
      treatment of HCV linked to the OST outpatient clinics to patients with chronic HCV will have&#xD;
      better outcomes in terms of reduction in HCV (sustained virological response) compared to the&#xD;
      current model where patients are referred to a hospital outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General outline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial without&#xD;
      pharmaceutical industry involvement assessing integrated HCV treatment within the MAR clinics&#xD;
      compared to standard treatment. The research project will be closely integrated with clinical&#xD;
      care, and the research activities are planned during a planned scale-up of HCV treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Department of Addiction Medicine at Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen and MAR in&#xD;
      Stavanger have adopted an integrated treatment and care model for patients receiving OST. In&#xD;
      Bergen, MAR outpatient clinics have been established in each district where the patients are&#xD;
      followed up by health and social workers on nearly a daily basis with observed intake of the&#xD;
      OST medications. Every month, the MAR clinics have a total of 6,000 patient visits among the&#xD;
      approximately 500 patients. This group of patients have a large morbidity burden and have to&#xD;
      limited degree been able to access other standard health care. Each of the MAR outpatient&#xD;
      clinics is staffed by a consultant and a physician specialising in addiction medicine in&#xD;
      addition to nurses, social workers, and several of the clinics also being staffed by a&#xD;
      psychologist. The remaining 550 OST patients in Bergen are followed up mainly in primary care&#xD;
      clinics. A close collaboration has been established between the Department of Addiction&#xD;
      Medicine and the Agency for addiction and mental health in Bergen municipality, who is&#xD;
      responsible for the care in several of the primary health clinics in Bergen. This model for&#xD;
      treatment of MAR patients is unique for Bergen, also in an international perspective. MAR&#xD;
      Stavanger has a relatively similar structure. MAR Stavanger is responsible for the MAR&#xD;
      treatment of approximately 460 patients within their area. Of these, 120 patients are linked&#xD;
      to the MAR outpatient clinic in the centre of Stavanger and 70 are linked to a similar clinic&#xD;
      in Sandnes. The treatment model in Bergen and Stavanger is an excellent platform to test out&#xD;
      integration of HCV treatment aiming to improve health and life span of a vulnerable group,&#xD;
      and at the same time gathering knowledge which traditionally have been very difficult to&#xD;
      obtain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be assessed for HCV including genotyping among those who test HCV RNA&#xD;
      positive. Those who are eligible to receiving treatment in line with national guidelines,&#xD;
      have no exclusion criteria and consent to study participation, will be randomised to either&#xD;
      standard or integrated treatment. In standard treatment, follow-up and treatment will be&#xD;
      given at hospital clinics. For the integrated treatment, treatment will be given at a MAR&#xD;
      outpatient clinic where they already receive care including MAR. Assessment of outcomes will&#xD;
      be done 12 weeks after completed treatment and adherence will be assessed at 4, 8 and 12&#xD;
      weeks after initiation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sustained virological response of HCV at 12 (10 - 14) weeks after completed treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment initiation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Milestones and duration of the study The duration of the study will be five years. Ethical&#xD;
      clearance and complete protocol will be completed within the first half of 2017. Planned&#xD;
      initiation of data collection is May 2017 with gradual scaling up of data collection&#xD;
      throughout 2017. Recruitment will continue throughout 2019 and further follow-up throughout&#xD;
      2021. Analyses and reporting will be initiated from mid of 2018 for some of the observational&#xD;
      studies while assessment of the trial will be conducted when at least 200 patients have&#xD;
      completed follow-up at 12 weeks after end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population and setting In Bergen, there are MAR policlinics in each district. Around&#xD;
      half of the patients have frequent contact with the outpatient clinic several times per week.&#xD;
      A substantial proportion receive OST-medications at a local pharmacy or through their general&#xD;
      practitioner. In addition a few receive OST-medications at the aftercare centre Albatrossen,&#xD;
      in schools or prisons. Most outpatient clinics are staffed with physicians (including both&#xD;
      non-specialists or linked consultants/specialists), psychologists, and nurses or social&#xD;
      workers/educators. In addition, a decentralised unit has 228 patients in 18 municipalities,&#xD;
      where most patients receive OST from a local pharmacy or through their general practitioner&#xD;
      (GP). For more information, see https://helse-bergen.no/avdelinger/rusmedisin/rusmedisin-lar&#xD;
      In addition, there are several patients receiving care without MAR at the municipal care&#xD;
      centres at Wergeland, Nesttun og Gyldenpris (Strax-huset). For further description of these,&#xD;
      see https://www.bergen.kommune.no/aktuelt/tema/tiltak-mot-rus/article-109220.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LAR Stavanger has one more centralised outpatient clinic in Stavanger and a smaller clinic in&#xD;
      the nearby city Sandnes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research project will improve understanding on how the structure of health care impacts&#xD;
      on patient outcomes.&#xD;
