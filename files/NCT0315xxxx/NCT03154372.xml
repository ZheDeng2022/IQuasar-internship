      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to compare the effects of deliberate vs. self-guided practices on&#xD;
      acquiring needling skills by novice learners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighteen medical students were randomized to deliberate or self-guided practices groups.&#xD;
      Following a learning phase, subjects attempted to perform a predefined task, which entitled&#xD;
      advancing a needle towards a target on a phantom gel under ultrasound guidance. Subsequently,&#xD;
      all subjects practiced performing the task using previously validated metrics. Subjects in&#xD;
      the deliberate practice group were coached by an expert anesthesiologist and practiced each&#xD;
      metric until it was satisfactorily performed based on the supervising anesthesiologist&#xD;
      assessment. Immediately after completing the practice, all subjects attempted to perform same&#xD;
      task, and on the following day, made two further attempts in succession. Two trained&#xD;
      consultant anesthesiologists will use the metrics to independently score the video-recorded&#xD;
      performances.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Safe performance of ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blocks (PNB) requires competence&#xD;
      across a range of technical and nontechnical skills. Correct placement of a needle close to a&#xD;
      nerve or plexus is critical to safe and successful procedure performance. Failure to maintain&#xD;
      needle visibility while in forward motion may cause iatrogenic injury to nerves and&#xD;
      surrounding structures, and is a &quot;quality compromising&quot; behavior in the early part of novice&#xD;
      learning curve. Skills related to needle guidance are difficult to learn, as they require&#xD;
      integration of multiple cognitive and psychomotor elements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study was to compare the effects of expert supervised deliberate&#xD;
      practice with validated metrics vs. self-guided practice on novice needling skill acquisition&#xD;
      as evaluated by the number of steps completed and errors made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having obtained informed written consent from each, eighteen 3rd and 4th year medical&#xD;
      students with no previous experience of ultrasound-guided procedures were recruited. Each&#xD;
      student provided demographic information on his or her age, gender and handedness. All&#xD;
      subjects will attend a didactic lecture (learning phase) delivered in standard fashion by one&#xD;
      investigator. This included outlines of ultrasound physics, scanning and practical&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, subjects will be randomly allocated using computer generated random numbers to&#xD;
      one of two groups; self-guided practice (SP) and deliberate practice (DP). Approximately 24&#xD;
      hours after completion of the learning phase each subject will attempt to perform the&#xD;
      following set of tasks (baseline assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task description (i) Perform ultrasonography of the phantom provided to identify embedded&#xD;
      objects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Identify verbally the structure at the 8 O'clock position (in reference to the&#xD;
      ultrasound training block model) and surrounding structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) Once the ultrasound image is deemed optimal, advance a 50 mm, 20 gauge block needle&#xD;
      provided under ultrasound guidance towards the object at the 8 O'clock position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iv) Once the needle tip is deemed close enough to the object, inject 0.5 ml of saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the first set of tasks (baseline assessment), all subjects were allowed to practice&#xD;
      the task using the list of metrics and according to their random group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of practice allowed SP Group: An investigator will provide subjects in this group a&#xD;
      list of metrics (steps and errors) extracted from a previously validated tool. They will be&#xD;
      allowed to practice the task using the metrics list. When the subject declares readiness to&#xD;
      progress to the assessment, training will be complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DP Group: A trained consultant anesthesiologist (expert in ultrasound-guided PNB and who&#xD;
      regularly undertakes training of novices in these procedures) will supervise deliberate&#xD;
      practice to each subject in this group using the metrics list. Subjects in this group will&#xD;
      practice each item of the metric list until it is satisfactorily performed as assessed by the&#xD;
      supervising anesthesiologist at which time training is deemed complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after completion of either self-guided practice or deliberate practice (training&#xD;
      phase), all subjects in both groups will attempt the same task above (assessment 1). All&#xD;
      subjects will also attempt the same task twice in succession on the following day (assessment&#xD;
      2 and 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All performances (baseline and 1- 3) will be videotaped using a head-mounted camera placed on&#xD;
      subject's head. The first person video and ultrasound images record concurrently (time&#xD;
      synchronized).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two consultant anesthesiologists (each expert in performing PNB and who regularly train&#xD;
      novices) will independently score the videos using the composite metrics list for number of&#xD;
      steps completed and number of errors made (primary outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and Statistical Analysis Differences in performances between the two groups for both&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes will be examined for significance with one-factor analyses of&#xD;
      variance (ANOVA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inter rater reliability (IRR) will be calculated according to proportionate agreement&#xD;
      between the two video assessors &quot;number of agreements/number of [agreements+disagreements]&quot;.&#xD;
      IRR is considered to be acceptable if it was â‰¥ 0.8. Scores from both video assessors will be&#xD;
      averaged to calculate the number of steps completed and number of errors made (primary&#xD;
      outcome).&#xD;
