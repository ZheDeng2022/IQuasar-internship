  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective biomarker-stratified, randomised phase II study of preoperative CRT&#xD;
      with temozolomide plus capecitabine in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is pathologic complete response rates defined as total regression of the&#xD;
      primary tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each cohort of MGMT hypermethylated versus MGMT unmethylated, patients will be randomised&#xD;
      (ratio 1:1 for each arm) into preoperative CRT with capecitabine or preoperative CRT with&#xD;
      temozolomide plus capecitabine arms. According to the prior phase I results, MGMT&#xD;
      hypermethylated arm is estimated as 70% of total patients and the target pathologic complete&#xD;
      response rate was assumed as 35% in this population when treated with preoperative CRT with&#xD;
      temozolomide and capecitabine (15% in the standard treatment arm or those with unmethylated&#xD;
      MGMT). Investigator would like to demonstrate the superiority in terms of pathologic complete&#xD;
      responses when treated with preoperative CRT with temozolomide plus capecitabine in patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced rectal cancer, and to validate the predictive role of MGMT status&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) with fluoropyrimidine (5-fluorouracil or capecitabine) is&#xD;
      now regarded as a standard treatment option in patients with locally advanced resectable&#xD;
      rectal cancer and pathologic response rates and tumor regression grades after preoperative&#xD;
      CRT have been proved to be important prognostic factors for survival outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies of preoperative CRT with fluoropyrimidines plus other agents, such as&#xD;
      oxaliplatin, irinotecan, cetuximab, and bevacizumab, have been performed to improve&#xD;
      pathologic response rates; however, they have failed to show improved results compared to&#xD;
      those with fluoropyrimidine alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus fluoropyrimidine alone is a standard chemotherapeutic strategy in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced resectable rectal cancer who will be treated with preoperative CRT at present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temozolomide is an oral alkylating agent, and has been proved to be effective in patients&#xD;
      with glioblastoma or high grade anaplastic glioma when administered with concurrent&#xD;
      radiotherapy either as adjuvant or recurrent settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temozolomide has been known to deplete O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which&#xD;
      is one of the DNA repair enzymes, and recent studies have shown that MGMT gene silencing&#xD;
      (lower expression by immunohistochemistry or hypermethylation by methylation-specific PCR)&#xD;
      played a predictive marker of better responses to CRT with temozolomide in patient with&#xD;
      glioblastoma and high grade anaplastic glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Silencing of MGMT by promoter hypermethylation has been known to involve colorectal&#xD;
      carcinogenesis pathway by the association with KRAS mutation and low-CIMP (CpG island&#xD;
      methylation phenotype), and microsatellite instability. There have been suggestions that MGMT&#xD;
      promoter hypermethylation played a role as a predictive factor of low recurrence in&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients with adjuvant oral fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy after curative&#xD;
      surgery, and also as a predictive factor for treatment response from temozolomide in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, combination chemotherapy of temozolomide plus capecitabine for rectal cancer&#xD;
      patients when treated with preoperative CRT is worthy of investigated especially in those&#xD;
      harbouring silenced MGMT gene as following reasons;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the role of temozolomide has been well established,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MGMT gene silencing is associated with colorectal carcinogenesis and might act as a&#xD;
           predictive biomarker; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the addition of temozolomide can be synergistic during preoperative CRT with&#xD;
           capecitabine for rectal cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator have performed a phase I study of preoperative CRT with temozolomide plus&#xD;
      capecitabine in patient with locally advanced rectal cancer, and the results of this study&#xD;
      has been published The recommended dose of temozolomide was determined as 75 mg/m2 once daily&#xD;
      when combined with standard preoperative CRT with capecitabine, there was no grade 4 adverse&#xD;
      events and the treatment was generally well tolerated. MGMT hypermethylation was found in 72%&#xD;
      of rectal cancer patients (16/22), and the pathologic complete responses rates were 37.5%&#xD;
      (6/16) in patient harbouring hypermethylated MGMT versus 16.7% in those with unmethylated&#xD;
      MGMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of prior trial results, Investigator concluded that preoperative CRT with&#xD;
      temozolomide plus capecitabine is well tolerated without any notable adverse event, and is&#xD;
      worthy of investigation especially in those harbouring MGMT gene silencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator planned a prospective, biomarker-stratified, randomised phase II study of&#xD;
      preoperative CRT with temozolomide plus capecitabine in patients with locally advanced rectal&#xD;
      cancer to demonstrate the addition of temozolomide in the conventional preoperative CRT might&#xD;
      enhance the pathologic responses in those harbouring hypermethylated MGMT.&#xD;
