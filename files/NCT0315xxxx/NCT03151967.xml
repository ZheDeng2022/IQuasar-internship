      The purpose of this research is to see whether LACTIN-V (Lactobacillus crispatus CTV-05) is&#xD;
      an effective method of preventing recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI's) and to learn the&#xD;
      side effects of LACTIN-V. LACTIN-V is a vaginal applicator that contains Lactobacillus&#xD;
      crispatus, an organism found naturally in the vaginas of healthy women. Lactobacillus&#xD;
      bacteria are thought to help prevent other bacteria such as E. coli from causing UTI's. This&#xD;
      is a double blind study comparing active product to a placebo (inactive vaginal applicator&#xD;
      without any medicine).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initial study visit will take about one hour. Participants will read, discuss and sign a&#xD;
      consent form. Investigators will have the patient collect a mid-stream urine sample which&#xD;
      will be sent to the research lab to confirm the participant has a urinary tract infection&#xD;
      (UTI). Participants will than be given Macrobid twice a day for five days for UTI treatment.&#xD;
      If the results of the screening show eligibility for this study, investigators will ask the&#xD;
      participant to return to the clinic within 3-10 day after completing UTI treatment for a&#xD;
      randomization visit (v1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (Randomization Visit):&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this visit, the participant will be asked about any urinary or vaginal symptoms. The&#xD;
      participant will be asked to provide a urine sample to see if the UTI has resolved and for a&#xD;
      pregnancy test. The participant will have a physical exam including a pelvic and speculum&#xD;
      exam. A study nurse practitioner will collect vaginal specimens to test for vaginal bacteria&#xD;
      and vaginal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, the participant will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to use LACTIN-V or&#xD;
      placebo vaginal applicators. The participant will not be told which product is being used,&#xD;
      and the researchers will not know until the end of the study. The participant will not be&#xD;
      able to tell which one is being used. Each LACTIN-V applicator contains Lactobacillus&#xD;
      crispatus CTV-O5 and other preservatives. Each placebo suppository contains other&#xD;
      preservatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed how to use the applicators. The participant will also be&#xD;
      given written instructions on how to use, store, and handle the applicators, and a diary to&#xD;
      record when the participant uses the applicators and any symptoms that may happen during the&#xD;
      study. (Participants will be given 15 applicators).The participant will insert 15 applicators&#xD;
      during this study. The applicators are to be used daily for five days during the first week&#xD;
      and then once per week for 10 weeks starting the second week. To insert an applicator, the&#xD;
      participant will hold one applicator between a thumb and finger (like a tampon),insert the&#xD;
      applicator into the opening of the vagina, and then push the applicator plunger. The&#xD;
      participant will insert the first applicator in the clinic during this visit. The participant&#xD;
      will be asked not to have sexual intercourse or use tampons for 24 hours after inserting an&#xD;
      applicator. The participant will also be asked not to use spermicidal vaginal products. The&#xD;
      participant will also be asked not to use other vaginal products such as creams, gels, foams,&#xD;
      sponges, lubricants, or douches or take antibiotics for a UTI during this study unless the&#xD;
      participants doctor prescribes it. The visit will take 30-60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 2-6 The participant will then be asked to return to the Hall Health clinic in 2 weeks&#xD;
      and then once a month for the next 4 months, after the randomization visit. During these&#xD;
      visits a study nurse practitioner will ask about any side-effects that may have occurred from&#xD;
      the study drug or placebo. The study nurse practitioner will also ask if the participant had&#xD;
      any UTI's since the last visit. The participant will be asked to give a urine sample for&#xD;
      culture. The participant will also have a physical exam, and vaginal tests for infection,&#xD;
      lactobacillus (including lactobacillus from LACTIN-V) and E. coli. A speculum exam will only&#xD;
      be done at v1 and the last visit unless the participant has symptoms of a vaginal infection.&#xD;
      The last visit will include a urine pregnancy test. These visits will take 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant has a UTI or vaginal infection during the study, the participant will be&#xD;
      seen at Hall Health for treatment. The participant will be treated with a standard medication&#xD;
      at no cost.. If a UTI occurs during the study the participant will continue to use the study&#xD;
      applicator on schedule.&#xD;
