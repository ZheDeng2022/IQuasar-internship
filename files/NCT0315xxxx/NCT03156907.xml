  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of analgesics opioids addiction in chronic pain patient is very difficult to&#xD;
      know. Many studies indicated that the prevalence of addiction varied from 0% up to 50% in&#xD;
      chronic non cancer pain patients, and from 0% up to 7.7% in cancer pain patients. Analgesics&#xD;
      opioids use have increasingly been increased in chronic pain for 20 years. However, a long&#xD;
      use, at least 3 months in this type of pain has not proved a large efficiency and we have&#xD;
      noticed a habituation, tolerance and withdrawal when treatment was decreased or stopped. In&#xD;
      current practice, patients with chronic pain, often keep their analgesics opioids despite the&#xD;
      absence of pain relief and benefits in quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, no withdrawal strategy is the reference in chronic non-cancer pain patients with&#xD;
      physical opioid dependence. The most common clinical strategy is progressive decrease of&#xD;
      analgesic opioid. But this strategy is often a failure in these patients (no data are&#xD;
      available in literature).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's necessary to make a prospective pilot study to assess benefits from this practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess a new ambulatory withdrawal strategy,&#xD;
      consisting of a temporary opioid rotation with buprenorphine in CNCP patients suffering from&#xD;
      physical withdrawal symptoms and who have failed a conventional strategy of progressive&#xD;
      withdrawal from their opioid analgesic treatment.&#xD;

      This study is designed as a type 2 multicenter clinical trial combining 3 Pain Clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were consecutively recruited from the active file of 3 Pain Clinics in France&#xD;
      (Clermont-Ferrand, Vichy and le Puy-en-Velay). Patients meeting all inclusion criteria were&#xD;
      enrolled after receiving oral and written information about the study and after obtaining&#xD;
      written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, they completed 5 questionnaires including: Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Hospital&#xD;
      Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD), Leeds sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ), Short&#xD;
      version of Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF 12), Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) and&#xD;
      underwent 2 tests with algometer and pupillometer. After inclusion, all patients started an&#xD;
      opioid tapering-off protocol (Figure 1, Step 1) according to a standardized scheme of opioid&#xD;
      gradual decrease defined by 3 medical experts in addictology, pain management and&#xD;
      pharmacology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1 (from inclusion to 3 months): Patients will start to taper off their opioid dose&#xD;
      according to a specific schedule. They will be seen by a physician on a monthly basis and&#xD;
      contacted by phone 48-72h after each decrease in opioid dosage to detect withdrawal symptoms&#xD;
      using the COWS specific scale. After 3 months, all patients who fail the opioid tapering-off&#xD;
      protocol will be included in a non-responder group, while the others who succeed the&#xD;
      withdrawal protocol will be included in a responder group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A responder will be defined by strict adherence to the schedule leading to a 50%&#xD;
           reduction in the initial daily dose of opioid after 3 months. In this case, patients&#xD;
           will continue with step 1 and decrease their opioid dose according to the same&#xD;
           withdrawal protocol. They will be seen by a physician on a monthly basis and contacted&#xD;
           by phone 48-72h after each stage of opioid dose reduction, until the opioid treatment is&#xD;
           completely discontinued after 6 months of the withdrawal protocol. At 6 months, patients&#xD;
           will fill out the same questionnaires and perform the same tests as at the baseline&#xD;
           visit. Finally, after 9 months, patients will be contacted by phone to check that&#xD;
           withdrawal is being maintained and to collect data on ongoing analgesic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A non-responder will be defined as a failure of the withdrawal protocol, by&#xD;
           non-compliance with the schedule, leading to a 50% reduction in the initial daily dose&#xD;
           of opioid treatment after 3 months or when tapering off fails, leading the patient to&#xD;
           re-increase the opioid dose. Thus, these patients will proceed to step 2 and start&#xD;
           temporary rotation with buprenorphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From D0 to D0+28 days - buprenorphine treatment/stabilization Buprenorphine will be&#xD;
           administered initially (D0) for 28 days at a dose of 4 mg/day (possible adjustment of&#xD;
           ±2mg/day with the possibility to increase the dose up to 8 mg/day during the first 24-48&#xD;
           hours, depending on the severity of withdrawal symptoms or patient tolerance).&#xD;
           Questionnaires (BPI, HADS, LSEQ, SF-12, COWS) and tests (algometer and pupillometer)&#xD;
           will be completed at D0, and the physician will assess the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
           buprenorphine by phone call at D0 + 24h/48 h and at D0 + 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From D0 + 28 days to D0 + 9th month after rotation by buprenorphine The buprenorphine&#xD;
           treatment will be tapered off in 1 mg steps every 28 days until the complete cessation&#xD;
           of buprenorphine after 9 months of withdrawal. Patients will be seen by a physician&#xD;
           every 28 days and will be contacted by phone 48-72h after each decrease in the&#xD;
           buprenorphine dose. The COWS questionnaires and a pain assessment (11-point NRS) will be&#xD;
           completed at each medical consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  D0 + 9th month A urine opioid test (primary outcome) will be performed to validate the&#xD;
           total opioid withdrawal (including buprenorphine). Patients will complete different&#xD;
           questionnaires (BPI, HADS, LSEQ, SF 12, COWS) and perform different tests (algometer and&#xD;
           pupillometer).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up phone call at 12 months The patients will be contacted by phone to check on&#xD;
           their continued withdrawal and ongoing analgesic treatment.&#xD;
