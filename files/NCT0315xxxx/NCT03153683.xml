  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective open enrollment registry to evaluate arterial blood and thrombus&#xD;
      removed during the standard thrombectomy procedure, which will then be used for the purposes&#xD;
      of identifying biological markers, inflammatory cell infiltrates, and biological states in&#xD;
      large vessel occlusive stroke in the human condition. The primary objectives are to evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility of obtaining distal clot blood during thrombectomy; develop a group of&#xD;
      biosamples (blood and clots) to evaluate novel proteins, cell types, and cytokines in acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke in the human condition, and evaluate specific biomarkers, proteins, and&#xD;
      leukocyte populations in stroke in the human condition. The study population will include up&#xD;
      to 250 subjects. Male and female participants 18 years of age and older will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Participants must have had a suspected acute ischemic stroke based on clinical and&#xD;
      radiographic evidence as determined and documented by the Stroke Neurology team at University&#xD;
      of Kentucky. There is no therapeutic intervention involved in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first study to our knowledge that will utilize thrombectomy technique to collect&#xD;
      focal blood samples and the clot related brain infarction. This proposal will provide&#xD;
      preliminary data needed to understand relationships between the local inflammatory cascade&#xD;
      and clinical variables such as age, gender, time from symptoms to thrombectomy, and stroke&#xD;
      imaging results. Characterizing these relationships is vital in the formulation of related&#xD;
      therapeutics. Issues of gender-differences, age-based variations, and co-morbidities all&#xD;
      engender heterogeneity, which plague translation of stroke research from animal to human. By&#xD;
      starting with the human condition, the investigators aim to minimize this loss in&#xD;
      translation. Overall, this study will have a great impact on our knowledge of stroke&#xD;
      pathology. In essence, this could fundamentally change not only how the investigators develop&#xD;
      treatment strategies for the stroke patient population but allow us to individualize the&#xD;
      treatment dependent on time after stroke, age, sex, and co-morbidities. Molecular techniques&#xD;
      that are impractical when delivered systemically could be delivered locally to impede the&#xD;
      early inflammation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study represents the first time that clot and blood will be evaluated for the markers,&#xD;
      proteins, and cytokines listed in the protocol in human subjects undergoing thrombectomy for&#xD;
      emergent large vessel occlusion stroke. The study is an open, unblinded, clinical and&#xD;
      biologic registry to evaluate specific questions that are novel to understanding stroke in&#xD;
      the human condition. There is no therapeutic intervention involved in this study. The study&#xD;
      population will include up to 250 subjects enrolled at the University of Kentucky. The&#xD;
      primary endpoints of the study will be evaluation of specific proteins and leukocyte&#xD;
      populations in the human stroke clot and blood. Secondary endpoints include: Acid/Base&#xD;
      Balance: Evaluate pH of blood as a marker of acid/base balance in distal blood and proximal&#xD;
      blood, and correlate to interval of time between Last Known Normal and vessel recanalization;&#xD;
      Inpatient Biomarker; Protein, RNA, expression with Clinical Correlation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from patients evaluated at University of Kentucky Chandler&#xD;
      Hospital for acute ischemic stroke. Participants with impaired capacity may be included as&#xD;
      the pathology to be studied (stroke) may impair their capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study events occur during the acute hospitalization for the subject's condition (acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline (Day 0):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Verify inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient or the Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) will be consented within 24&#xD;
           hours following the standard of care thrombectomy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history taken from medical record, participant and family to determine&#xD;
           eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion criteria (Standard of Care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication history (Standard of Care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline physical examination to include vital signs (Standard of Care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Premorbid Modified Ranking Score (mRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NIH Stroke Scale (Standard of Care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI (Body Mass Index) (Standard of Care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain consent from the patient or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cerebral angiogram with Endovascular Thrombectomy (Standard of Care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Specimen Collection as detailed below&#xD;
&#xD;
      Datapoints recorded will include the vessel location of the thrombus and time from Last Known&#xD;
      Normal to vessel recanalization, along with TICI (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Specimen Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Once a subject is determined by clinical staff to require thrombectomy, the thrombectomy&#xD;
           pager will be activated. Since potential subjects arrive at any time of day,&#xD;
           approximately 10 researchers will share call responsibilities. Once paged, the on-call&#xD;
           researcher will attend the thrombectomy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During the procedure, the neurointerventionalist will retain three samples, which are&#xD;
           removed during the thrombectomy procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. 1 cc of blood obtained from the microcatheter distal to the clot prior to thrombectomy&#xD;
      (see Figure 1) 2. The thrombus itself (normally discarded) 3. 5 cc of whole blood from&#xD;
      arterial guide catheter placed for the thrombectomy procedure. This represents a small amount&#xD;
      of the blood typically removed/lost during the suction aspiration performed at the guide&#xD;
      catheter. No separate venipuncture or arterial puncture will be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. The on-call researcher will retrieve the blood samples and thrombus. The samples will be&#xD;
      collected, processed, and aliquoted by the researcher in a manner that will not delay or slow&#xD;
      the thrombectomy procedure. In addition to the samples, a separate researcher will enter&#xD;
      clinical data points on each subject into a REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture)&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All endpoints listed below are standard of care for followup after thrombectomy.&#xD;

&#xD;
        3. Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Race/ethnicity&#xD;

        5. Height&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Body Mass Index (BMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Premorbid Modified Rankin Score (mRS)&#xD;

           thrombus (cardioembolic, intracranial stenosis, dissection, carotid occlusion,&#xD;
           infection, unknown).&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Presence of tandem occlusion of the cervical artery proximal to the thrombus&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Time from last known normal to thrombectomy completion (reopening of the vessel)&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Thrombectomy success as rated by TICI score&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. NIH Stroke Scale prior to discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Modified Rankin Score (mRS): premorbid, discharge, 90 days (Standard of Care)&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. Mini-Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Mini-MoCA) or similar cognitive scale prior to&#xD;
           discharge (Standard of Care)&#xD;

&#xD;
       19. Petechial hemorrhages.&#xD;
&#xD;
       20. Proximal (systemic) blood (pH - potential of hydrogen/acidity or basicity, pCO2 - carbon&#xD;
           dioxide partial pressure, pO2 - oxygen partial pressure, pHCO3 - bicarbonate partial&#xD;
           pressure, Na - sodium, K - potassium, Ca - Calcium)&#xD;
&#xD;
       21. Distal blood (pH, pCO2, pO2, pHCO3, Na, K, Ca)&#xD;
&#xD;
       22. Concomitant medications&#xD;

      Visit 1 (Within 48 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI or CT is performed typically within 48 hours after thrombectomy as standard of care.&#xD;
      Radiographic endpoints that will be captured include:&#xD;

&#xD;
      For the purposes of this study, the central clinical endpoint will be time from Last Known&#xD;
      Normal to thrombectomy completion. The other data points will be captured for exploratory&#xD;
      purposes as correlations and associations with immune cell and cytokine levels may lead to&#xD;
      future studies beyond the scope of this grant.&#xD;
