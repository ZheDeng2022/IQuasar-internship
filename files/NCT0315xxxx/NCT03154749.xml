  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both DCb (docetaxel/carboplatin) and EC followed by D (epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed&#xD;
      by docetaxe) regimens as Neoadjuvant Treatment for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer have been&#xD;
      recommended by NCCN guideline. It is unknown which regimen is better. This study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of DCb (docetaxel/carboplatin) and EC followed by&#xD;
      D(epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxe) regimens as Neoadjuvant Treatment in&#xD;
      Triple-Negative breast cancer. The endpoint of pathologic complete response is used as a&#xD;
      surrogate marker for survival. Safety and tolerability assessed by number of grade 4&#xD;
      toxicities and hospitalizations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype lacking estrogen receptor (ER),&#xD;
      progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)&#xD;
      amplification. TNBC accounts for 15-20% of all invasive breast cancer. Although PARP&#xD;
      inhibitors and immunotherapy may play a role in the treatment of early TNBC, the mainstay of&#xD;
      treatment for TNBC is cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, despite its sensitivity to&#xD;
      chemotherapy, TNBC is still associated with a poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TNBC is usually recommended for neoadjuvant therapy. The benefits of neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
      include reducing the size of the tumor to suit breast conserving surgery, avoiding axillary&#xD;
      lymph node dissection, making inoperable tumors operable, and obtaining an in vivo evaluation&#xD;
      of the tumor's chemosensitivity. Taxane- and anthracycline-based neoadjuvant regimens have&#xD;
      become a standard treatment for TNBC, and patients have been proved to have better event-free&#xD;
      survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) who achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR)&#xD;
      after neoadjuvant chemotherapy1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carboplatin attack cancer cells by inducing double-stranded DNA breaks, and TNBC may be&#xD;
      sensitive to carboplatin2. Previous studies have shown that adding carboplatin to neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens significantly improved pCR rate in TNBC patients3, 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the long-term cardiotoxicity caused by anthracycline, several studies have explored&#xD;
      the efficacy of neoadjuvant paclitaxel plus carboplatin regimens in TNBC and have achieved&#xD;
      satisfactory pCR rates, but there are still controversies5. However, there is no study making&#xD;
      comparisons between the combination of taxanes and carboplatin without anthracycline and the&#xD;
      standard neoadjuvant regimens. Whether the combination of taxanes and carboplatin without&#xD;
      anthracycline can achieve better efficacy while reducing adverse reactions still needs to be&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NeoCART study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of docetaxel plus&#xD;
      carboplatin with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC.&#xD;
