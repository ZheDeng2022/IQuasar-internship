  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, case-control clinical trial using inhaled Aztreonam (AZLI) in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with a tracheostomy tube colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The aim of&#xD;
      the study is to see if AZLI being taken in a one month on / one month off cycle over the&#xD;
      course of a year can decrease the need for systemic antibiotics and/or hospitalizations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inhalation aztreonam (AZLI) is an aerosolized formulation of the monobactam antibiotic&#xD;
      aztreonam with lysine as a synthetic substance in place of arginine. This substitution was&#xD;
      made as arginine, which is in the intravenous (IV) formulation of aztreonam, can cause airway&#xD;
      inflammation as seen in patients with cystic fibrosis when aerosolized. There have been&#xD;
      several published studies on the efficacy and adverse effects of aerosolized aztreonam in CF&#xD;
      patients. Two placebo-controlled studies of AZLI revealed a benefit in patients with CF and&#xD;
      colonization with PsA. AIR-CF1 revealed that a 28-day course of AZLI given three times daily&#xD;
      (TID) resulted in improved respiratory symptoms. They measured this improvement by using a&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis questionnaire (CFQ-R), measuring forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV&#xD;
      1), and measuring bacterial density in sputum. AIR-CF2 demonstrated that a 28-day course of&#xD;
      AZLI followed by a 28-day course of Tobramycin Inhaled Solution (TIS) delayed the time to the&#xD;
      need for additional inhaled or systemic anti-pseudomonal antibiotics. They also used the&#xD;
      CFQ-R and measured FEV1 and found improvement in both when compared to placebo. In AIR-CF3,&#xD;
      an open-label 18-month study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of AZLI using a month&#xD;
      on/month off cycle, and to observe long-term effects of the drug. This protocol found that&#xD;
      AZLI did have a long-term suppressive effect on PsA as there was a persistent reduction in&#xD;
      Pseudomonas CFUs from baseline each month of the study. As expected, the decreases in&#xD;
      bacterial density were consistently occurring during on months; and during off months, the&#xD;
      density increased toward baseline. Thrice-daily dosing appeared more efficacious than&#xD;
      twice-daily dosing. This was attributed to the mode of action of aztreonam, as bacterial&#xD;
      killing is dependent on time above the MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration). Adverse events&#xD;
      include: cough, respiratory tract congestion, pharyngolaryngeal pain, nasal congestion,&#xD;
      dyspnea, hemoptysis, rhinorrhea, wheezing, chest discomfort, crackles lung, pulmonary&#xD;
      function testing decreased, non-cardiac chest pain, sinus congestion, sinus headache, dyspnea&#xD;
      exacerbated, exertional dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics currently on the market as inhaled antibiotics include tobramycin (TOBI),&#xD;
      polymyxin E (Colistin), and aztreonam (Cayston). Studies of all of these have shown clinical&#xD;
      benefits in those with Cystic Fibrosis. Given these findings, there is a growing interest in&#xD;
      the use of inhaled antibiotics in other disease processes in which subjects become colonized&#xD;
      with bacteria in the lower respiratory tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a two-center, prospective, case control clinical trial on the use&#xD;
      of inhaled aztreonam (AZLI) in pediatric patients ages 7-21 years with a tracheostomy who&#xD;
      have had one of their previous 3 tracheostomy aspirate cultures positive for PsA. Their past&#xD;
      history in the previous year of requirement for systemic antibiotics will be used for each&#xD;
      subject as the historical control. A tracheostomy aspirate culture will be collected upon&#xD;
      initiation of the study. The investigators will subsequently start the participants on AZLI&#xD;
      on a one month on/one month off schedule. Tracheal aspirate cultures will continue to be&#xD;
      collected quarterly (every 3 months), and the bacterial density will be used for analysis.&#xD;
      Goal is to see if there is a decrease need for systemic antibiotics for PsA infection.&#xD;
