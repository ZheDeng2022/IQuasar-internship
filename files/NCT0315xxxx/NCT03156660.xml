  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to randomize 400 participants to 1 of 3 arms: a) a weight stability&#xD;
      intervention prior to smoking cessation (Group 1); b) a weight loss intervention prior to&#xD;
      smoking cessation (Group 2); or c) a self-guided weight management prior to cessation (Group&#xD;
      3) and to determine the efficacy of the interventions on preventing weight gain at 12 month&#xD;
      follow-up. All 3 conditions receive a highly efficacious behavioral smoking cessation program&#xD;
      and 6 months of varenicline pharmacotherapy (ChantixTM), the most efficacious medication for&#xD;
      smoking cessation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While smoking cessation leads to significant improvements in mortality and morbidity, weight&#xD;
      gain post-cessation partially attenuates this benefit. Furthermore, concerns about&#xD;
      postcessation weight gain are common and are often cited as a reason to delay cessation&#xD;
      attempts. In addition, postcessation weight gain is associated with smoking relapse. Thus,&#xD;
      although the health benefits of smoking cessation outweigh the negative impact of weight&#xD;
      gain, ideally there would be intervention &quot;packages&quot; that would not require that people&#xD;
      choose between smoking cessation and nontrivial weight gain. Thus, in the proposed study, the&#xD;
      investigators will determine whether two very promising methods of reducing postcessation&#xD;
      weight gain, namely a weight stability intervention (based on the evidence-based Small&#xD;
      Changes intervention) versus a weight loss intervention (based on the evidence-based Look&#xD;
      AHEAD intensive lifestyle intervention) followed by a smoking cessation intervention are&#xD;
      efficacious for reducing postcessation weight gain. The investigators will randomize 400&#xD;
      smokers to one of three arms: a) a weight stability intervention prior to cessation (Group&#xD;
      1); b) a weight loss intervention prior to cessation (Group 2), or c) a self-guided&#xD;
      intervention prior to cessation (Group 3) and to determine the efficacy of the interventions&#xD;
      on preventing weight gain at 12 month follow-up. All three conditions receive a highly&#xD;
      efficacious in-person smoking cessation behavioral intervention and six months of Varenicline&#xD;
      (ChantixTM) pharmacotherapy. Those participants randomized to the Group 1 and Group 2&#xD;
      conditions will receive monthly booster weight management sessions, after completing the&#xD;
      behavioral smoking cessation intervention. The primary outcomes will be weight change and&#xD;
      smoking cessation at 12 month follow-up. In addition, the investigators will gather process&#xD;
      data on mediators of treatment outcome via measures of treatment engagement (e.g., session&#xD;
      attendance, varenicline utilization). The investigators will be able to determine whether a&#xD;
      weight stability intervention or a weight loss intervention is efficacious in reducing&#xD;
      post-cessation weight gain. The intervention results, if successful, could be disseminated&#xD;
      and make a significant contribution towards curtailing obesity in this vulnerable population.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>It is anticipated that a cleaned data set of study-specific data will be provided within two years following the termination of the study for the data archive and this data set would be made public. Confidentiality of individual participants would be maintained with all releases of data. The final study analytical database would be processed according to HIPAA definitions for public data sharing. Documentation would be provided along with the data sharing file that includes but is not limited to: data dictionary, data code book, valid variable ranges (where provided), the protocol, procedure and operational manuals, intervention manual or programs and any electronic versions of any paper forms that were used in data collection.</ipd_description>
