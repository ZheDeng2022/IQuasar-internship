      This study is to evaluate the objective response rate to pralatrexate in Asian PTCL patients&#xD;
      after prior treatment failure, as determined by independent imaging reviewer(s) using&#xD;
      international workshop lymphoma response criteria (IWC)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are a group of aggressive and diverse lymphoproliferative&#xD;
      disorders. It is characterized by the presence of malignant mature T-cells or NK cells. There&#xD;
      is as yet no consensus regarding standard frontline or relapsed/refractory therapy for PTCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous phase II study conducted in US showed durable responses of pralatrexate treatment&#xD;
      in relapsed or refractory PTCL, irrespective of age, histological subtypes, amount of prior&#xD;
      therapy, prior methotrexate, and prior autologous stem-cell transplant. This single-arm,&#xD;
      multi-center study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pralatrexate monotherapy in&#xD;
      prior treatment failure PTCL patients who may undergo HSCT in case of CR or PR, or continue&#xD;
      pralatrexate in case of CR, PR or SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the objective response rate to pralatrexate in Asian PTCL patients after&#xD;
           prior treatment failure, as determined by independent imaging reviewer(s) using&#xD;
           international workshop lymphoma response criteria (IWC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety of pralatrexate in Asian PTCL patients by,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) emergent from&#xD;
                the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of pralatrexate in Asian PTCL patients after prior treatment&#xD;
           failure by,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Overall survival (OS), progression-free-survival (PFS), complete response (CR) and&#xD;
                partial response (PR) rate, and duration of CR and PR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment duration with pralatrexate in the patients without hematopoietic stem&#xD;
                cell transplant (HSCT) who achieve CR or PR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Percentage of patients who undergo HSCT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1-year OS, 1-year PFS, and 1-year relapse rate after HSCT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2-year OS, 2-year PFS, and 2-year relapse rate after HSCT&#xD;
