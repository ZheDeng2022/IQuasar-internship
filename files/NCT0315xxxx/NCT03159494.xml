  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      10 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a training-intervention consisting of 8&#xD;
      times of High-Intensity Training (HIT). Before and after the intervention the patients were&#xD;
      tested regarding Oral Glucose Tolerance Test, blood pressure, weight and fat% and VO2max. A&#xD;
      pilot study was conducted with 6 patients with type 2 diabetes using the same protocol but&#xD;
      only 6 times of training.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate to which extent a short period of HIT can improve&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic status measured by simple methods such as OGTT (fasting glucose and&#xD;
      2h-glucose), blood pressure, weight and fat percent in patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At day -2 a VO2max test was performed in order to get familiarized to the test before the&#xD;
      actual test at day 0. The pretest at day 0 was carried out at least two days before the first&#xD;
      training session in order to allow patients to recover after the Vo2max test before training.&#xD;
      After 8 times of training the posttest was accomplished at day 21 two days after the last&#xD;
      training session in order to avoid the acute effect of training. Both pre- and posttest were&#xD;
      carried out on Fridays and training days were Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre- and posttest contained the following: Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), blood&#xD;
      pressure measurement, weight and fat% measurements and VO2maxtest. Pretesting also contained&#xD;
      a questionnaire about physical activity and their medical history in addition to the&#xD;
      physiological tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT): Participants were instructed to continue a normal diet in&#xD;
      the days leading up to the test. At the day of testing they should meet fasting (for at least&#xD;
      10 hours) and they were asked not to take any medications that could influence blood glucose&#xD;
      levels in the fasting hours (two forgot and they were instructed also to take medications&#xD;
      prior to the posttest). At baseline a small blood sample was collected by the use of a finger&#xD;
      prick to determine fasting capillary blood glucose level (producent). The fingertip was&#xD;
      disinfected before the finger prick and the first drop of blood was removed before applying a&#xD;
      drop of blood in the glucose meter. The participants were then instructed to drink 75 mg of&#xD;
      glucose dissolved in 300 ml of water. Blood samples were collected after 30, 60, 90 and 120&#xD;
      minutes with the use of finger prick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure: Blood pressure was measured after 10 min of rest in a sitting position. An&#xD;
      automatic blood pressure monitor was used (producent) and three measures were made. The&#xD;
      lowest of the three values were used in calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight and fat%: Weight and fat% were measured on a Tanita digital scale with bioelectrical&#xD;
      impedance. The participants were instructed to step on the scale barefooted and to keep the&#xD;
      hands with the handgrips slightly elevated from the torso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VO2max: Bicycle test on a Lode ergometer bike to exhaustion with direct measurement of oxygen&#xD;
      consumption by Breath-by-breath on Masterscreen CPX. The participants were instructed about&#xD;
      the protocol before applying the equipment used for the test. Then there was a warm-up for 5&#xD;
      min. on 50-75 watt followed by incremental increase in intensity by 25 watt each minute until&#xD;
      exhaustion. The test was considered a VO2max if the RER-value exceeded 1,10. Otherwise, is&#xD;
      was categorized as a VO2peak test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity: Physical activity was assessed by using the Physical Activity Scale (PAS)&#xD;
      questionnaire (19). PAS1 was used instead of the PAS2 as not all the participants were&#xD;
      working in the daytime. The participants were asked to report time spend on different&#xD;
      activities on an average weekday before the intervention. These activities are categorized&#xD;
      into nine different categories with a corresponding metabolic equivalent (1 MET ~1 kcal/kg/h)&#xD;
      ranging from low to high intensity. A total MET-score was calculated as time spend on each&#xD;
      category multiplied by the corresponding MET and then all nine categories were added&#xD;
      together. The categories are sleep (0.9 MET), TV-viewing/reading (1.0 MET), sitting/working&#xD;
      (1.5 METs), standing up (2.0 METs), light work (3.0 METs), light to moderate activity (4.0&#xD;
      METs) moderate activity (5.0 METs), moderate to high activity (6.0 METs) and high intensity&#xD;
      activity (&gt;6 METs). As for the high intensity 7 METs was chosen in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training: The training consisted of 10 x 60 sec work on an indoor exercise bike at an&#xD;
      intensity of ~90% of max HR interspersed by 60 sec of recovery 3 times per week (Mon-Wed-Fri)&#xD;
      with a total amount of eight training sessions. This protocol was the same as used by Little&#xD;
      et al (2011). The pedal cadence was individually set in the area of 80 -110 rpm. In the&#xD;
      recovery the participants pedalled slowly at a lower intensity (~ 50 watt). The HR used for&#xD;
      training was calculated based on the max HR found by VO2max test at pretest. Each interval&#xD;
      was scored on Borg Scale (rate of perceived exhaustion, RPE) which is a subjective scale&#xD;
      where the participants experience of exhaustion is expressed in a number from 6 to 20. 14-15&#xD;
      is determined as where speaking in sentences is interrupted by breath and at 16-17 there is a&#xD;
      clear hyperventilation. Perceived enjoyment of low-volume HIT was assessed by asking&#xD;
      participants how enjoyable they would find engaging in 1) a single bout of HIT (10 x 1 min)&#xD;
      and 2) HIT at least 3 times/wk for the next 4 wk using a 9-point Likert scale ranging from 1&#xD;
      (not enjoyable at all) to 9 (very enjoyable).&#xD;
