  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that increase level of BAFF could promote the settlement of&#xD;
      long-lived plasma cells in the spleen of ITP patients treated with anti-CD20. This&#xD;
      single-center prospective pilot study, currently in phase IIa, will evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      a rituximab and belimumab sequential combination treatment. Investigators plan to include 15&#xD;
      patients with persistent ITP over a 24-month inclusion period. Each patient will be followed&#xD;
      for 1 year&#xD;

      This single-center prospective pilot study, currently in phase IIa, evaluates the efficacy of&#xD;
      a rituximab and belimumab sequential combination treatment. Based on the Fleming method, this&#xD;
      study scheme includes a single step method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients, having given consent and having been verified for inclusion criteria, will&#xD;
      receive two intravenous perfusions of 1 g of Rituximab (Mabthera ®) at W0 and W2 coupled with&#xD;
      100 mg intravenous methylprednisone to avoid potential allergic reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five belimumab (Benlysta ®) injections will be administered (W0 + 2days, W2 + 2 days, W4, W8,&#xD;
      W12) at 10mg/kg doses. The first two injections are administered 2 days after Rituximab&#xD;
      perfusions. The adopted experimental scheme was once used to show use of belimumab in&#xD;
      systemic lupus erythematosus in accordance with AMM regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase II prospective single-center open-trial will be conducted at the National Referral&#xD;
      Center for Adult Immune Cytopenia located in the Henri Mondor University Hospital.&#xD;
      Investigators plan to include 15 patients with persistent ITP over an 24-month inclusion&#xD;
      period. Each patient will be followed for 1 year&#xD;
