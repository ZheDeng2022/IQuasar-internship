  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to deliver and test a life skills intervention targeting the key&#xD;
      domains that fuel HIV disparities among adolescent (ages 13-18) same-sex attracted men in the&#xD;
      United States. This RCT will yield important information regarding the delivery of a&#xD;
      developmentally-appropriate HIV prevention program that reaches racial/ethnic and&#xD;
      socioeconomically diverse sample of adolescent men across four regions in the United States.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From 2000-2010, the annual number of new HIV diagnoses among MSM aged 13-24 years old more&#xD;
      than doubled. There are stark racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of new HIV&#xD;
      infections among YMSM; 13- 24 year old racial and ethnic minority MSM now represent a rapidly&#xD;
      growing share of all new HIV infections. Although the likelihood of HIV acquisition is&#xD;
      greater at older ages, many of the cognitive and behavioral risk factors that contribute to&#xD;
      the risk of HIV infection rates develop in adolescence. As adolescent MSM (AMSM; 13-18 years&#xD;
      old) begin to develop and express gender and sexual identities, to experiment and begin&#xD;
      sexual behaviors, and to begin to establish a sense of self, there is the opportunity to&#xD;
      parallel this period of growth with targeted, tailored interventions that equip AMSM with the&#xD;
      life skills they need to reduce their vulnerability to HIV risk and to establish the life&#xD;
      skills necessary to manage risk. The investigators developed a mobile-friendly WebApp&#xD;
      intervention focused on life skills training with links to local resources. In the proposed&#xD;
      activities, the investigators will adapt the life skills intervention for four U.S regions&#xD;
      heavily impacted by HIV, and revise the content to include materials that are age-appropriate&#xD;
      for 13 to 18 year-olds. Given the role that stigma and social isolation plays in the lives of&#xD;
      many AMSM, the investigators also propose to embed a peer-to-peer motivational interviewing&#xD;
      component, allowing participants to access motivational interviewing counseling via VSee&#xD;
      video-chat. With a large and diverse sample (n=500), the investigators will test the efficacy&#xD;
      of the intervention, now referred to as iCON+, on cognitive and behavioral HIV-related&#xD;
      outcomes using a two-arm randomized control design. In addition, the investigators examine&#xD;
      whether structural characteristics in a region (e.g., race/ethnicity segregation, HIV&#xD;
      prevalence) influence the efficacy of the proposed intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following Specific Aims are proposed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adapt a multilevel, online life skills intervention to address HIV vulnerability among&#xD;
           AMSM living in four heavily impacted regions constituting diverse racial/ethnic and&#xD;
           geographic areas (Chicago-Detroit; Atlanta-Washington, DC; Memphis- New Orleans; San&#xD;
           Francisco-San Diego) in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test the efficacy of our intervention, as compared to a delayed intervention condition,&#xD;
           to improve cognitive (e.g., comfort discussing sexuality; HIV prevention attitudes,&#xD;
           norms, self-efficacy, behavioral intentions) and behavioral (e.g., condom use, HIV&#xD;
           testing, PrEP use) factors using a prospective RCT design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine the differential efficacy of our intervention in improving psychosocial&#xD;
           mediators (e.g., personal competency) associated with our outcomes; and,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examine how socio-ecological determinants at the individual (e.g., race/ethnicity,&#xD;
           urbanity) and regional (e.g., socioeconomic disadvantage, HIV prevalence) level are&#xD;
           associated with intervention efficacy.&#xD;
