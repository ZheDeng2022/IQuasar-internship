    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is the major cardiovascular disease that continues to grow in prevalence,&#xD;
      largely due to aging of the population. HF is described as the inability of the heart to keep&#xD;
      up with the demands on it and, specifically, failure of the heart to pump blood with normal&#xD;
      efficiency. Cognitive impairment (CI) is common in HF patients, resulting in a person having&#xD;
      trouble remembering, learning new things, concentrating, or making decisions that affect&#xD;
      their everyday life. Patients with HF have been show repeatedly to have trouble remembering&#xD;
      and learning new things when compared to the general population. Patients with demonstrated&#xD;
      CI have a significantly increased risk of developing dementia (memory loss). It is believed&#xD;
      that the reason HF patients have a higher risk of CI is possibly due to less blood reaching&#xD;
      the brain and an overall inflammatory process occurring in the body including the brain. To&#xD;
      date there are no known therapies that can help treat CI caused by HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substance, Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], is known to decrease inflammation in the brain.&#xD;
      Early studies in humans have shown it to be safe. This substance is naturally produced in the&#xD;
      body and works by activating areas in the brain involved in memory. Investigators believe&#xD;
      that Ang-(1-7) may be able to help lower the risk of loss of cognitive function in patients&#xD;
      with heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will try to determine whether Ang-(1-7) is a safe and effective treatment&#xD;
      for cognitive impairment in HF patients.&#xD;

      In this non-randomized pilot study 16 heart failure patients will be enrolled. Adults (ages&#xD;
      55-75) with chronic HF will be recruited who do not have neurologic or psychiatric disorders&#xD;
      expected to interfere with memory function. Patients must have been diagnosed with HF ≥ 90&#xD;
      days prior to enrollment, be clinically stable, and on stable medications. Participants have&#xD;
      a medical history and examination, with documentation of evidence of HF, and screening to&#xD;
      rule out dementia (Mini-Mental State Exam score less than 25), and depression (Geriatric&#xD;
      Depression Scale score greater than 10. Participants will be treated for 12 weeks with a&#xD;
      daily dose of subcutaneous Ang-(1-7) (100 mcg/kg/day). Half of the group will be given memory&#xD;
      training in 2-hr sessions twice weekly for two weeks beginning at 6 weeks of drug treatment.&#xD;
      Prior to drug treatment, baseline measures will include memory and neuropsychological tests&#xD;
      and inflammatory markers. Memory and neuropsychological tests will be repeated at 3 weeks, 6&#xD;
      weeks and 12 weeks. Inflammatory biomarkers will be reassessed at 6 weeks and 12 weeks. Blood&#xD;
      draws for pharmacokinetic (PK) measurements will be obtained at baseline and Day 7. MRI scans&#xD;
      will be obtained from all participants who do not have an ICD, pacemaker or other&#xD;
      contraindication to MRI at baseline with repeat scans at 12 weeks. Lastly Self-Care Efficacy&#xD;
      testing will be obtained at 12 weeks from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 Primary Outcome: Changes in performance on the Memory Intentions Test (MIST, a test of&#xD;
      PM) between baseline and 12 weeks27 will be the primary endpoint to test effectiveness of PMT&#xD;
      in the presence or absence of Ang-(1-7) treatment.MIST scores have been shown to predict&#xD;
      medication adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 Secondary Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safety of the treatment will be assessed by careful collection of standard serious&#xD;
           adverse events, and comparison of events across treatment arms. In addition, patients&#xD;
           will be asked about difficulties associated with the therapy, and medication vials&#xD;
           collected to assess compliance with therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Self-care efficacy at 12 weeks will be measured using the SCHFI, a validated tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Other neuropsychological measures of memory, executive functions, and psychomotor speed&#xD;
           will be assessed at baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and at the 12 week follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. HF quality of life will be assessed using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire&#xD;
           (KCCQ) at baseline and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Adjudicated HF hospitalizations, all-cause hospitalizations and death will be assessed&#xD;
           by treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Systemic Inflammation Assay: At baseline, and after 6 and 12 weeks of Ang-(1-7)&#xD;
      treatment, blood will be collected for assessment of systemic inflammation. Blood will be&#xD;
      placed in lavender-top EDTA tubes, centrifuged to obtain plasma, and rapidly frozen in liquid&#xD;
      nitrogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokines, chemokines, and additional circulating inflammatory analytes will be detected and&#xD;
      quantified by multiplex immunoassay using a MAGPIX®. Each sample will be measured in&#xD;
      duplicate. Data will be analyzed by ANOVA across all groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 Primary Outcome: Immunosuppressive cytokines TGFα and IL-1 will be measured as they&#xD;
      play an important role in the anti-inflammatory actions of Ang-(1-7) and are widely used as&#xD;
      functional indicators of systemic inflammation. The more common clinical inflammatory marker&#xD;
      of systemic inflammation C-reactive protein, will also be measured.&#xD;
