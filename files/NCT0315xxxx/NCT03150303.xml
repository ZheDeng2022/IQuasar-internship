  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant (defined as duration of treatment of at least&#xD;
      1 month of Direct Oral Anticoagulant (DAOC) or Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA)) and referred for&#xD;
      an invasive procedure (oral surgery, implantology or periodontology) to an oral surgeon&#xD;
      taking part to the study will be included in this prospective observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main composite outcome is the occurrence rate of hemorrhagic and/or thromboembolic events&#xD;
      during the peri-procedural period (between 5 days before surgery plus 30 days after the&#xD;
      invasive procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      0. The secondary end-points will consist of identifying risk factors for bleeding during the&#xD;
      peri-procedural period, risk factors for thromboembolic events during the peri-procedural&#xD;
      period, the peri-procedural management of each treatment (VKA or DOAC), the prescribers&#xD;
      involved in the possible change of anticoagulant prescription prior the oral surgery All&#xD;
      outcome events will be blindly adjudicated by a central independent adjudication committee.&#xD;

      duration: 13 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant (defined as duration of treatment of at least&#xD;
      1 month) and referred for an invasive procedure (oral surgery, implantology or&#xD;
      periodontology) to an oral surgeon member of the SFCO (Société Française de Chirurgie Orale)&#xD;
      or a periodontologist member of the SFPIO (Société Française de Parodontologie et&#xD;
      d'Implantologie Orale) taking part to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each investigator will include 10 patients treated with long-term DOAC, and 10 consecutive&#xD;
      patients treated with long-term VKA. For the DOAC group, inclusion will be continued until&#xD;
      the inclusion of 333 patients for each molecule (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-inclusion criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving both VKA and antiplatelet agents Patients receiving both direct oral&#xD;
      anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the composite rate of thromboembolic and bleeding events occurring within the&#xD;
      peri-procedural period, in patients on long-term DOAC and VKA and undergoing an oral surgery,&#xD;
      implantology or periodontology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify risk factors for bleeding during the peri-procedural period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify risk factors for thromboembolic events during the peri-procedural period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the peri-procedural management of each treatment (VKA or DOAC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify prescribers involved in the possible change of anticoagulant prescription&#xD;
           prior the oral surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the risk of bleeding on DOAC and on VKA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the risk of thromboembolic complications on DOAC and on VKA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the net clinical benefit of DOAC compared to VKA treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint :&#xD;
&#xD;
      A composite outcome: the occurrence rate of hemorrhagic and/or thromboembolic events during&#xD;
      the peri-procedural period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of bleeding events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence of thromboembolic events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  net clinical benefit of DOAC compared to VKA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Prospective observational non interventional multicentric cohort study in adult&#xD;
      population under long-term anticoagulant treatment (DOAC or VKA) and undergoing an oral,&#xD;
      periodontal or implant surgery, by liberal practitioners or oral specialists at hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The occurrence rate of hemorrhagic or thromboembolic events during&#xD;
      peri-procedural period will be calculated globally and in each group (VKA or DOAC) as a&#xD;
      percentage with 95% CI.&#xD;
