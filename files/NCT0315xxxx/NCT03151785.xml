  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      60,000 people suffer an out of hospital cardiac arrest in the United Kingdom (UK) every year.&#xD;
      Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) rates are dismal (30%) compared with places&#xD;
      where CPR education is mandatory for all school children (&gt;50%). Strategies are needed to&#xD;
      increase these rates through innovative approaches. Lifesaver (www.life-saver.org.uk) is an&#xD;
      immersive interactive programme/application that presents such an opportunity. This study&#xD;
      aims to assess the effectiveness of Lifesaver on CPR attitudes, knowledge, skills acquisition&#xD;
      and retention in school children. Additionally, it aims to examine whether Lifesaver provides&#xD;
      additional benefits in terms of CPR attitudes, knowledge, skills acquisitions and retention&#xD;
      in school children when combined with face-to-face BLS training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The UK has one of the highest rates of cardiovascular disease in the world and approximately&#xD;
      60,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur every year, half of which are attended to by the&#xD;
      emergency services. The public health implications of this are significant as the number of&#xD;
      out of hospital cardiac arrests will increase with the rising incidence of obesity and other&#xD;
      co-morbidities in the UK's ageing population. Basic Life Support (BLS) can improve the&#xD;
      outcomes of these people if it is swiftly performed at the scene of the cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BLS is defined as a set of skills that can be used to 'help keep someone alive in an&#xD;
      emergency...before professional help arrives'. One of the main elements of BLS is cardio-&#xD;
      pulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Bystander CPR is important because it slows down the rapid&#xD;
      decline in a patient's chances of survival while waiting for professional help. If a patient&#xD;
      is found to be in a 'shockable rhythm' such as ventricular fibrillation (VF) or ventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia (VT) then receiving bystander CPR could treble the chances of survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the average bystander CPR rate in the UK is 30%. This figure is very poor when&#xD;
      compared to Seattle where the bystander CPR rates are 61% after routinely training school&#xD;
      children for the past 32 years. Similar results have also been achieved in Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While educating the lay public in BLS is key to increasing survival from cardiac arrests, it&#xD;
      is difficult to reach the entire population. One potential strategy is to educate school&#xD;
      children as young as 12 years old. The American Heart Association advocated compulsory&#xD;
      resuscitation training in American schools in 2011, and countries in which resuscitation has&#xD;
      been integrated into educational programs in schools report significantly higher&#xD;
      resuscitation rates. In Denmark, successful training of school children has led to the rate&#xD;
      of bystander CPR doubling after 5 years with a threefold improvement in survival following&#xD;
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest over 10 years. A threefold improvement in survival cannot be&#xD;
      achieved solely by improvements in professional medical care in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPR training in school children has many potential benefits. School children at a young age&#xD;
      have a less inhibited approach to resuscitation training and both medical professionals and&#xD;
      teachers achieve success after appropriate training themselves. The response to instruction&#xD;
      is easier and better at a younger age. Research has shown that the strongest factor&#xD;
      preventing laypeople to help in real-life cardiac arrest is a fear of making mistakes. This&#xD;
      fear can hopefully be prevented when taught during a young age at school. A more favourable&#xD;
      attitude to learning is also reflected by the fact that practical training can be&#xD;
      communicated in a more positive way. Embedding resuscitation in related school subjects such&#xD;
      as biology, sports or health education is possible and it can make it meaningful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If school children receive such training, they are also likely to teach this to their family&#xD;
      at home. Not only will there be an increase in the number of cardiac arrest survivors&#xD;
      worldwide, but also the social benefits of enthusiastic and positive young people. They learn&#xD;
      to help others and a sense of responsibility can be instilled in children from a young age.&#xD;
      School children and teachers are important &quot;multipliers&quot; in both private and public settings&#xD;
      and thus, in the longer term, the proportion of trained individuals in society will markedly&#xD;
      increase, leading to an increase in the overall rate of lay resuscitation. By teaching school&#xD;
      children, CPR training can reach all groups of society including those in lower social&#xD;
      groups. To achieve a statistically significant increase in the resuscitation results, it has&#xD;
      been estimated that at least 15% of a population need to be trained and such numbers cannot&#xD;
      be achieved by offering voluntary courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In their systematic review Plant and Taylor found that training school children in CPR from&#xD;
      the age of 10 years old is effective. Young children can learn about certain elements of&#xD;
      first aid such as the recovery position and making a 999 call which they are able to retain.&#xD;
      It has also been shown that early training helps reduces anxieties about making mistakes in&#xD;
      an emergency situation and also markedly increases participants willingness to help.&#xD;
      Individuals who have received CPR training are more likely to perform bystander CPR than&#xD;
      people without training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In March 2013, the Department of Health published a Cardiovascular Disease Outcomes Strategy.&#xD;
      One of their targeted outcomes is &quot;to consider ways of increasing the numbers trained in CPR&#xD;
      and using automated external defibrillators (AED)&quot;. Delivering BLS training to every school&#xD;
      child would achieve this outcome. Using secondary schools to teach first aid would capture a&#xD;
      large proportion of the population as it is compulsory to attend secondary education up until&#xD;
      16 years of age. There is a growing level of support for this approach from Health Care&#xD;
      Professionals such as Cardiologists. A joint statement was released by the European Patient&#xD;
      Safety Foundation (EuPSF), the European Resuscitation Council (ERC), the International&#xD;
      Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) and the World Federation of Societies of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists (WFSA) to call for all children across the world to be trained in the&#xD;
      performance of CPR. This initiative supports the training of children at the age of 12 for 2&#xD;
      hours per year in emergency life support and has received strong backing from the World&#xD;
      Health Organisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators literature review revealed learning technology such as computer or&#xD;
      multi-media based resuscitation training programs has been previously evaluated. Studies have&#xD;
      found that computer- based simulation provided a learning environment with realistic&#xD;
      scenarios when compared to traditional classroom-based teaching. Students who participated in&#xD;
      computer or multi-media CPR training had equivalent or superior knowledge and skill&#xD;
      acquisition when compared with traditional training. Studies that examined the use of new&#xD;
      learning technology merely as a vehicle of delivering the same learning content have failed&#xD;
      to improve learning. The systematic review by Plant and Taylor concluded that CPR training in&#xD;
      school children could be successful using a variety of approaches. In order to engage and&#xD;
      capture the attention the current generation of school children, innovative interactive games&#xD;
      could be used in CPR training. To date there has been no studies that investigated the use of&#xD;
      immersive interactive scenario training as a standalone education tool or in combination with&#xD;
      face-to-face instructor-led training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that Lifesaver Programme can provide age-appropriate training to&#xD;
      schoolchildren. The novel 'game-in-film' format of Lifesaver is an immersive interactive&#xD;
      website or application which provides an engaging learning experience and real life scenarios&#xD;
      whereby the user helps a victim of cardiac arrest of choking. It is free to use and has&#xD;
      currently been downloaded over 46,800 times and the website has been visited over 423,000&#xD;
      times. There is already anecdotal evidence of two lives saved as a result. Furthermore,&#xD;
      Lifesaver has won a Webby award, five e-Learning Age awards, and was shortlisted for a&#xD;
      British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the effectiveness of Lifesaver on CPR attitudes, knowledge, skills&#xD;
      acquisition and retention in school children. Additionally, it aims to examine whether&#xD;
      Lifesaver provides additional benefits in terms of CPR attitudes, knowledge, skills&#xD;
      acquisitions and retention in school children when combined with face-to-face BLS training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three secondary schools in the West Midlands will participate. Parents of the participating&#xD;
      school pupils will be provided with detailed and sufficient information to allow them to&#xD;
      consent on behalf of their child for participation in the study. After the initial&#xD;
      intervention, 2 and 4 month follow up visits will be conducted to assess the retention of the&#xD;
      pupils CPR knowledge, skills and attitudes.&#xD;
