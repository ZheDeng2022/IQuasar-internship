  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease,&#xD;
      medically refractory tremor, dystonia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Several hypotheses&#xD;
      driven DBS trials are underway to study modulation of circuit dysfunction in other&#xD;
      neurological and psychiatric disorders like epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease and depression.&#xD;
      Recent reports suggest profound effects of DBS on the anatomy and function of downstream&#xD;
      areas in the brain. For example electrical stimulation of limbic circuits is associated with&#xD;
      increase in hippocampal neurogenesis. Similarly, stimulation of subthalamic nucleus (STN) or&#xD;
      globus pallidus (GPi) results in activation of cortical motor circuits. Non-invasive imaging&#xD;
      modalities are increasingly being employed in these investigations to better understand the&#xD;
      effects of DBS on the structure and function of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been important advances in MRI and we now have MRI which provides higher&#xD;
      resolution and higher quality brain images. More specifically, the investigators propose to&#xD;
      use MRI to perform functional magnetic resonance imaging (i.e. fMRI) to assess the effects of&#xD;
      deep brain stimulation on brain function.&#xD;

      This is a prospective cohort study that will enroll patients who have already undergone DBS&#xD;
      electrode placement for a variety of disorders including, but not limited to Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease, essential tremor, dystonia, depression, epilepsy, neuropathic pain and Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease. This eligible patient population is broad but unified by the fact that they will all&#xD;
      undergo DBS to treat specific circuit dysfunctions. Patients with externalized leads or&#xD;
      internalized IPG may be included. Besides the structural 1.5T or 3T scans, subjects may&#xD;
      undergo a resting state fMRI exam.&#xD;
