  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib in patients&#xD;
      with operable Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who are planned for definitive&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will take ruxolitinib twice daily during the pre-operative window for 14-21 days, or&#xD;
      up to 28 days for delays in planned surgery. Ruxolitinib will be dispensed in 5 mg tablets.&#xD;
      Participants will either take three tablets (15 mg) in the morning and evening, or four&#xD;
      tablets in the morning and evening (20 mg). Participants will be asked to fill out a drug&#xD;
      diary indicating when doses of study drug are taken and any side effects they experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose will be assigned based on participant platelet count at baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with a platelet count of 200,000 or greater will take 20 mg twice daily (four&#xD;
           5mg tablets in the morning and four 5mg tablets in the evening);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with a platelet count between150,000 and 200,000 will take 15 mg twice daily&#xD;
           (three 5 mg tablets in the morning and three 5 mg tablets in the evening).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             squamous cell carcinoma, including variants. Patients must have at least one&#xD;
             measureable lesion in accordance with RECIST 1.1 (tumor diameter ≥ 1 cm; short-axis&#xD;
             lymph node diameter ≥ 1.5 cm) OR by caliper measurement (tumor diameter ≥ 1 cm). Any&#xD;
             diagnostic pretreatment biopsy sample is acceptable including fine needle aspiration&#xD;
             (FNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Primary tumors of any head and neck (oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx)&#xD;
             site will be included.&#xD;
