            <groups_desc>After data lock and initial analysis run, a medical inconsistency in baseline PASI data was identified (PASI=0 but BSA≥3%). The scenario was not anticipated or described in protocol or SAP. The inconsistency was resolved using medical judgment. The impacted participants had met baseline criteria for active psoriasis. Therefore, in the primary analysis, participants with baseline PASI=0 &amp; BSA≥3% were considered PASI100 responders if, and only if, PASI=0 &amp; BSA=0 achieved at week 24.</groups_desc>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Tender Joint Count (TJC)</title>
        <description>TJC is the number of tender and painful joints determined for each participant by examination of 68 joints. Joints were assessed by pressure and joint manipulation on physical examination. Participants were asked for pain sensations on these manipulations and watched for spontaneous pain reactions. Any positive response on pressure, movement, or both was translated into a single tender-versus-nontender dichotomy. Least Square(LS) Mean was calculated using Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) model that included treatment group, concomitant conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARD) use at baseline, moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis involvement, visit as fixed factors, baseline value as covariate and baseline-by-visit and treatment-by-visit interactions terms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI is a participant reported questionnaire that measures disease-associated disability (physical function). It consists of 24 questions with 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other daily activities. The disability section scores the participant's self-perception on the degree of difficulty (0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do), covering the 8 domains. The reported use of special aids or devices and/or the need for assistance of another person to perform these activities is assessed. The HAQ-DI is a composite ranging from 0-3 with lower scores indicating less functional disability. LS mean was calculated using MMRM model that included treatment group, concomitant csDMARD use at baseline, moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis involvement, visit as fixed factors, baseline value as covariate and baseline-by-visit and treatment-by-visit interactions terms.</description>

            <groups_desc>After data lock and initial analysis run, a medical inconsistency in baseline PASI data was identified (PASI=0 but BSA≥3%). The scenario was not anticipated or described in protocol or SAP. The inconsistency was resolved using medical judgment. The impacted participants had met baseline criteria for active psoriasis. Therefore, in the primary analysis, participants with baseline PASI=0 &amp; BSA≥3% were considered PASI100 responders if, and only if, PASI=0 &amp; BSA=0 achieved at week 52.</groups_desc>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score-CRP (DAS28-CRP)</title>
        <description>The DAS28-CRP is a measure of disease activity in 28 joints that consists of a composite numerical score with the following variables: TJC28, SJC28, hs-CRP (measured in milligrams per liter), and Participant's Global Assessment of Disease Activity recorded by participants on a 0 to 100 VAS. For DAS28-CRP, the Tender Joint Count 28 (TJC28) and Swollen Joint Count (SJC28) are a subset of TJC and SJC, and include 14 joints on each side of the body: 2 shoulders, 2 elbows, 2 wrists, 10 metacarpophalangeal joints, the 2 interphalangeal joints of the thumb, the 8 proximal interphalangeal joints, and the 2 knees. DAS28 values range from 0 to 9.4. Higher values indicate more severe symptoms and greater functional impairment. LS mean was calculated using MMRM model that included treatment group, concomitant csDMARD use at baseline, moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis involvement, visit as fixed factors, baseline value as covariate and baseline-by-visit and treatment-by-visit interactions terms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Modified Composite Psoriatic Disease Activity Index (mCPDAI) Score</title>
        <description>The CPDAI is a validated instrument intended to assess composite psoriatic disease activity and response to therapy. Domains include peripheral arthritis as assessed by the number of tender and swollen joints and the HAQ-DI, skin as assessed by the PASI and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), enthesitis as assessed by the number of sites with enthesitis and the HAQ-DI, and dactylitis as assessed by the number of digits affected. Each domain with the exception of spinal disease is scored from 0-3. Individual domain scores are summed to give an overall composite score (range 0-12) with a higher score indicating higher disease activity. LS mean was calculated using MMRM model that included treatment group, concomitant csDMARD use at baseline, moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis involvement, visit as fixed factors, baseline value as covariate and baseline-by-visit and treatment-by-visit interactions terms.</description>

Domains include peripheral arthritis as assessed by the number of tender and swollen joints and the HAQ-DI, skin as assessed by the PASI and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), enthesitis as assessed by the number of sites with enthesitis and the HAQ-DI, and dactylitis as assessed by the number of digits affected. Each domain with the exception of spinal disease is scored from 0-3. Individual domain scores are summed to give an overall composite score (range 0-12) with a higher score indicating higher disease activity. LS mean was calculated using MMRM model that included treatment group, concomitant csDMARD use at baseline, moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis involvement, visit as fixed factors, baseline value as covariate and baseline-by-visit and treatment-by-visit interactions terms.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who had a baseline and at least one post-baseline CPDAI value. Per protocol and statistical analysis plan, the primary and secondary analysis were performed to compare all ixekizumab participants together versus all adalimumab participants together.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) Enthesitis Index in Participants With Enthesitis at Baseline</title>
        <description>The SPARCC enthesitis index evaluates tenderness in a total of 16 entheseal sites: the greater trochanter (right/left [R/L]), quadriceps tendon insertion into the patella (R/L), patellar ligament insertion into the patella and tibial tuberosity (R/L), Achilles tendon insertion (R/L), plantar fascia insertion (R/L), medial epicondyles of humerus (R/L),Lateral epicondyle humerus (R/L) and the supraspinatus insertion (R/L). Tenderness at each site is quantified on a dichotomous basis: 0 = nontender and 1 = tender. The results from each site are then added to produce a total score (range 0 to 16) with the Higher scores indicating more severe enthesitis. LS mean was calculated using MMRM model that included treatment group, concomitant csDMARD use at baseline, moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis involvement, visit as fixed factors, baseline value as covariate and baseline-by-visit and treatment-by-visit interactions terms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) Fingernails Score in the Subgroup of Participants With Fingernail Involvement at Baseline</title>
        <description>The NAPSI scale is used to evaluate the severity of fingernail bed Ps and fingernail matrix Ps by area of involvement. The fingernail is divided into quadrants. Each fingernail is given a score for fingernail bed Ps 0 (none) to 4 (Ps in 4 quadrants of the fingernail) and fingernail matrix Ps 0 (none) to 4 (Ps in 4 quadrants of the matrix), depending on the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of any of the features of fingernail bed or matrix Ps in each quadrant. The sum of all fingernails equals the total NAPSI score range is from 0 (no effect) to 80 (more severe psoriasis). LS mean was calculated using MMRM model that included treatment group, concomitant csDMARD use at baseline, moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis involvement, visit as fixed factors, baseline value as covariate and baseline-by-visit and treatment-by-visit interactions terms.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 is a participant-reported outcome measure evaluating participant's health status. It comprises 36 items covering 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, role emotional, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, mental health, and general health. Items are answered on Likert scales of varying lengths. The 8 domains are regrouped into the PCS and MCS scores. The summary scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better levels of function and/or better health.

        <description>The EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 components: a descriptive system of the respondent's health and a rating of his/her current health state. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The descriptive part is comprised of the following 5 participant-reported dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.The EQ-5D-5L health states were converted into a single summary index by applying a crosswalk using a UK Population value set to each of the levels in each dimension.This produced participant-level index scores between -0.594 and 1.0 (worse to better health). LS mean was calculated using MMRM model that included treatment group,concomitant csDMARD use at baseline,moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis involvement, visit as fixed factors, baseline value as covariate and baseline-by-visit and treatment-by-visit interactions terms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a simple, participant-administered, 10 question, validated, quality-of-life questionnaire that covers 6 domains: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. The recall period of this scale is over the last &quot;week.&quot; Response categories include &quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;a lot,&quot; and &quot;very much,&quot; with corresponding scores of 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and unanswered (&quot;not relevant&quot;) responses scored as &quot;0.&quot; Scores range from 0 to 30 (less to more impairment), and a 4-point change from baseline is considered as the minimal clinically important difference threshold. LS mean was calculated using MMRM model that included treatment group, concomitant csDMARD use at baseline, moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis involvement, visit as fixed factors, baseline value as covariate and baseline-by-visit and treatment-by-visit interactions terms.</description>
