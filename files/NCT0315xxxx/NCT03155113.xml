    <textblock>
      Anti-viral, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific immune T cell responses are functionally&#xD;
      defective in patients with chronic hepatitis C and this functional impairment is believed to&#xD;
      contribute to virus persistence. Persistent exposure to high virus loads is likely involved&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis of T cell dysfunction. The underlying hypothesis of the project is that&#xD;
      the level of anti-viral immune dysfunction in chronic HCV infection is a causal factor which&#xD;
      can influence non-response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the rate of response to direct anti-viral agent (DAA) therapy, in untreated,&#xD;
      non-cirrhotic, patients is between 95% and 100%, however, the response rate is lower in&#xD;
      specific subgroups of patients, including genotype 3 cirrhotics and patients with&#xD;
      decompensated cirrhosis, irrespective of the infecting genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the present study will be thus to understand whether non-response to therapy is&#xD;
      associated with a wider and deeper anti-viral immune dysfunction, by comparing individual&#xD;
      HCV-specific T cell responses in two groups of responder and non-responder patients.&#xD;
      Characterization of protective immunity in non-responder patients could allow to identify&#xD;
      baseline predictors of non-response to therapy to be used in the daily clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study will be to compare the features (intensity and quality) of the overall&#xD;
      HCV-specific immune T cell response in patients non-responder and responder to DAA therapy.&#xD;
      To achieve this goal, T lymphocytes (either CD4 or CD8) isolated from the peripheral blood of&#xD;
      the patients, before starting DAA therapy, will be stimulated with HCV proteins to evaluate&#xD;
      the capacity of those cells to expand, produce cytokines and express cytotoxic capacity.&#xD;

      Study objective and Hypothesis The underlying hypothesis of the project is that the level of&#xD;
      anti-viral immune dysfunction in chronic HCV infection is a causal factor which can influence&#xD;
      non-response to therapy. However, information about the features of individual anti-viral T&#xD;
      cell responses expressed by naïve chronic HCV patients before starting DAA therapy in&#xD;
      relation to the subsequent outcome of treatment and their possible impact on the failure to&#xD;
      control infection is not available. The few available results on anti-HCV immune responses in&#xD;
      chronic HCV infection have been generated in patients treated with DAA regimens which are not&#xD;
      included in the present guidelines without evaluation according to the outcome. Aim of the&#xD;
      present study will be thus to understand whether non-response to therapy is associated with a&#xD;
      wider and deeper anti-viral immune dysfunction, by comparing individual HCV-specific T cell&#xD;
      responses in two groups of responder and non-responder patients. The assumption made is that&#xD;
      possible defects of T cell responses associated with the failure to respond to DAA therapy&#xD;
      should not be substantially modified by an ineffective treatment allowing to characterize the&#xD;
      immunological background of non responder patients after the end of an ineffective cycle of&#xD;
      therapy and to compare results with baseline pretreatment responses of naïve, viremic&#xD;
      patients who subsequently clear the virus. A pre-treatment analysis also for non responder&#xD;
      patients would require to enroll a huge number of naive patients in order to identify a&#xD;
      sufficient number of non responder patients, making the study unfeasible and exceedingly&#xD;
      long. By this strategy, recruitment will be instead very rapid because most patients enrolled&#xD;
      at baseline are expected to be responder, while non responder patients who will be studied&#xD;
      after the end of therapy and after an adequate wash-out period of 6 to 12 months and before&#xD;
      starting re-treatment have already been identified in the collaborating Centers and will be&#xD;
      readily available for the study as soon as the protocol is approved. Based on the results,&#xD;
      possible objective of future analyses could be to characterize further at a molecular level&#xD;
      the T cell functional defects of non-responder patients to define whether and by which&#xD;
      strategies their correction can represent a feasible approach to induce/restore an efficient&#xD;
      anti-viral response to complement and strengthen the effect of last generation DAA. Finally,&#xD;
      characterization of protective immunity in non-responder patients could allow to identify&#xD;
      baseline predictors of non-response to therapy to be used in the daily clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study background The rate of sustained viral response (SVR) in naïve non-cirrhotic patients&#xD;
      treated with IFN-free DAAs is between 95% and 100%, but the response rate is lower in&#xD;
      specific subgroups of patients, including genotype 3 cirrhotics and patients with&#xD;
      decompensated cirrhosis, irrespective of the infecting genotype. The high efficacy of&#xD;
      DAA-based therapies is confirmed in real-world cohorts, which show a rate of SVR only&#xD;
      slightly lower than registration studies. Although the rate of failure to DAA therapy is&#xD;
      quite limited (around 5%), the overall number of non-responder patients is expected to be&#xD;
      high because of the high number of chronically HCV infected patients who need treatment.&#xD;
      Treatment failure most frequently results in relapse and less often in on-treatment viral&#xD;
      breakthrough. Different factors are believed to be implicated in non-response to therapy,&#xD;
      including emergence of resistance mutations, suboptimal treatment due to incorrect genotype&#xD;
      definition and advanced liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of baseline RAVs in determining treatment failure is still debated and baseline&#xD;
      resistance testing appears to have limited clinical utility. Instead, emergence of RAVs&#xD;
      during DAA-based regimens and its role in determining virological failure is well documented.&#xD;
      Even if drug-resistant variants are detected in a large proportion of non-responder patients,&#xD;
      their role in impairing treatment efficacy is however not totally clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of currently available second-generation commercial assays for HCV genotyping has&#xD;
      reduced the risk of genotype misclassification, but the possibility of mixed infections with&#xD;
      a percentage of different genotypes/subtypes below the sensitivity of the methods applied in&#xD;
      the clinical practice is still a possible cause of non response to therapy due to suboptimal&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergence of resistant strains and suboptimal treatment due to incorrect genotype detection&#xD;
      can however explain only part of treatment failure cases and host-related factors may play a&#xD;
      role, in particular the anti-viral immune response. Indeed, innate and adaptive immune&#xD;
      responses are known to be deeply impaired in chronic HCV infection but very limited&#xD;
      information is available about the possible contribution that background immune responses can&#xD;
      give to the final outcome of DAA treatment. In contrast to PegIFN-based therapies, recent&#xD;
      studies in DAA treated patients indicate that frequency and function of HCV-specific CD8&#xD;
      cells can increase under IFN-free therapies with partial reversal of their exhausted&#xD;
      phenotype. Moreover, DAA therapy can modulate the NK cell compartment correcting the NK cell&#xD;
      activated phenotype which is typical of chronic HCV patients. Thus, the level of baseline&#xD;
      impairment of anti-viral immunity might influence the subsequent likelihood of immune&#xD;
      restoration upon therapy with more chances of resistance to DAA treatment when baseline&#xD;
      immune inhibition is deeper and wider. This hypothesis requires to be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints Objective of the study will be to compare intensity (total levels of&#xD;
      anti-viral functions) and quality (multi-specificity and multi-functionality) of the overall&#xD;
      HCV-specific T cell response in patients non-responder (with and without detectable&#xD;
      resistance associated variants - RAVs) and responder to DAA therapy. To achieve this goal,&#xD;
      CD4- and CD8-mediated responses will be assessed by using overlapping synthetic peptides&#xD;
      covering the overall HCV proteome of genotype 1 in order to characterize T cell reactivity to&#xD;
      all HCV proteins, in terms of cytokine production (IL2, IFN-g and TNF-a) and cytotoxic&#xD;
      potential (CD107 degranulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As a primary endpoint, the overall intensity of T cell responses will be assessed in&#xD;
           responder and non responder patients; the total intensity of individual T cell&#xD;
           reactivity will be defined by summing the different analyzed T cell parameters (cytokine&#xD;
           production and cytotoxicity, as detected in total CD3 cells and CD4/CD8 subsets) for&#xD;
           each individual responder and non-responder patient; the resulting values will be then&#xD;
           compared in the two groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At a second level of analysis, qualitative differences in T cell reactivity between&#xD;
           responder and non-responder patients will be assessed in terms of multi-functionality&#xD;
           and multi-specificity of HCV-specific T cell responses, by comparing the expression of&#xD;
           each individual function separately (IL2, IFN-g, TNF-a) and the capacity of each&#xD;
           individual HCV protein to induce T cell responses in the two groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterization of HCV-specific T cell responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To analyze global CD4+ and CD8+ reactivity against structural and non-structural HCV&#xD;
           proteins, a comprehensive panel of overlapping 15-mer peptides covering the entire HCV&#xD;
           (genotypes 1) sequence will be used; T cell responses will be analyzed by&#xD;
           flow-cytometric intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) for IFN-g, IL-2 and TNF-a and for&#xD;
           degranulation (up-regulation of CD107) in vitro (after 10 days of peptide stimulation)&#xD;
           and by Elispot for IFN-g ex-vivo (after short-term peptide stimulation); synthetic&#xD;
           peptide epitopes with HLA class I- and class II-restricted specificities and known to be&#xD;
           the targets of CD8+ and CD4+ responses against different HCV-unrelated viruses and&#xD;
           pathogens (CMV, EBV, FLU) will be used as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To further analyze CD8+ T cell reactivity, HLA-A2/peptide dextramers containing some of&#xD;
           the most widely recognized HLA-A2 restricted epitopes of HCV will be used in HLA-A2+&#xD;
           patients to quantify circulating virus-specific CD8+ cells and to measure expansion&#xD;
           capacity by comparing dextramer-positive CD8+ cell frequencies ex-vivo and after 10 days&#xD;
           of peptide stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In non-responder patients showing the emergence of resistance mutations, specific&#xD;
           peptides corresponding to the variant sequences will be synthesized and used to analyze&#xD;
           whether emerging mutations can influence HCV-specific T cell activation and function.&#xD;
           For this purpose, the stimulatory effect on different T cell functions of prototype and&#xD;
           variant peptides (cytokine production, cytotoxicity, capacity of expansion) will be&#xD;
           compared&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analysis of additional immune populations and serum factors known to be relevant with&#xD;
           respect to control of virus infection and modulation of T cell responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Natural Killer (NK) cell analysis: NK cell phenotype will be studied by assessing&#xD;
                the expression of specific markers, such as CD16, NKG2A/D, TRAIL, NKP46/NKP30,&#xD;
                Ki67, CD38/HLA-DR by flow cytometry; NK cell function will be studied by testing&#xD;
                IFN-g/TNF-a production and CD107 degranulation upon overnight PBMC incubation with&#xD;
                appropriate stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Analysis of T regulatory cell (Treg): frequency, phenotype and function will be&#xD;
                studied on whole PBMCs co-stained with CD3, CD4, CD25, FoxP3 and CD45RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum concentration of cytokines, chemokines and ISG, including IL15, IL6, CXCL9,&#xD;
                CXCL10, IFN-g and IL28, will be analyzed in patients' sera by the Luminex&#xD;
                technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identification of baseline predictors of non-response to DAA therapy Elucidation of the&#xD;
           impact that the anti-viral immune response can have in non-response to therapies with or&#xD;
           without protease inhibitors&#xD;
