  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motor neurone disease is a progressive incurable disease causing weakness and paralysis of&#xD;
      muscles. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in motor neurone disease.&#xD;
      Patients with respiratory failure use a machine that supports breathing using a mask and&#xD;
      ventilator (non-invasive ventilation: NIV) and using it for more than five hours per night&#xD;
      has been shown to prolong life and improve symptoms such as poor sleep and breathlessness.&#xD;
      NIV is however, challenging to use and some patients are unable to adhere to the required&#xD;
      regime meaning they fail to gain benefit. Timely support is important to help individuals&#xD;
      overcome early hurdles and barriers to using becoming regular NIV users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Philips EncoreAnywhere is a system that allows continuous monitoring of the use and&#xD;
      effectiveness of ventilation and allows instant adjustment of ventilator settings. The aim of&#xD;
      this project is to explore if &quot;real time&quot; feedback and support, as well as remote changes to&#xD;
      NIV settings using the EncoreAnywhere system could increase the number of individuals&#xD;
      successfully using NIV. This project also aims to explore the impact of using EncoreAnywhere&#xD;
      on the process of initiation of NIV, on both patients and staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients starting NIV at the Sheffield MND care centre will be provided with the standard&#xD;
      ventilator plus a Philips modem for the first three months of use. In half the patients&#xD;
      clinicians will be able to use the EncoreAnywhere system to review patients' use of NIV, make&#xD;
      adjustments and give feedback. In the other half, the data will be collected but not&#xD;
      available to the clinical team. Clinical data will be collected as part of usual care:&#xD;
      adherence, clinical encounters and resource use and patients will be asked to complete&#xD;
      questionnaires at baseline, one month and three months. This will allow the care team to&#xD;
      predict the potential impact on the service and on clinical care. This is a small pilot,&#xD;
      feasibility study, and if the study is deemed feasible, a further larger randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial is planned. The study will last for a maximum of 12 months, recruiting up to&#xD;
      40 patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) use in patients with motor neurone disease (MND) who develop&#xD;
      respiratory failure can improve symptoms and survival. Initiation of NIV can be difficult for&#xD;
      patients and those who do not adequately adhere to the regime fail to gain benefit. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate the use of EncoreAnywhere: a system which collects data on NIV use and&#xD;
      effectiveness from the NIV machines and transmits it to the MND care team for review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pilot, feasibility study. It is a randomised controlled trial comparing the&#xD;
      use of EncoreAnywhere with usual care. Up to 40 patients with MND about to start NIV will be&#xD;
      recruited. All patients will have the EncoreAnywhere system installed on their NIV machine&#xD;
      for the first three months of NIV use. Half the patients will be randomised to the&#xD;
      intervention arm which will allow the MND care team to review the information sent from the&#xD;
      device regularly during the study. Data will be collected from the other patients but not&#xD;
      reviewed by the clinical team. All patients will receive usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected by three methods. Data collected from the EncoreAnywhere system will&#xD;
      examine adherence and effectiveness of ventilation. The main outcome of interest is adherence&#xD;
      to NIV at three months. Data will be collected from patients (patient symptoms and quality of&#xD;
      life) using questionnaires (at baseline, one and three months) and collected from information&#xD;
      recorded in the patients' notes as part of usual care. Data will also be collected to examine&#xD;
      feasibility e.g. recruitment and retention rates. A subset of patients will be invited to&#xD;
      undergo overnight oximetry at 1 and 3 months to examine NIV effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the research are to establish the level of adherence and effectiveness of NIV&#xD;
      during initiation and factors that may impact on adherence and effectiveness and also&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility and impact using EncoreAnywhere on the Sheffield MND team working&#xD;
      pattern, the clinical and cost implications for a full service.&#xD;
