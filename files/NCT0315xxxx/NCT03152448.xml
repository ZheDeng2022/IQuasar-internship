      This is a prospective study to measure the impact on first-line therapy of genomic testing of&#xD;
      biopsy tissue from recently diagnosed treatment-naïve patients with early stage localized&#xD;
      prostate cancer. Multiple individual VAMC sites will participate in PART 1 of the study.&#xD;
      During PART 1 of the study, a three-part questionnaire will be completed to evaluate the&#xD;
      PRE-Prolaris test treatment plan, the POST-Prolaris test treatment plan, and the ACTUAL&#xD;
      treatment option. Using PRE-Prolaris Test Questionnaire #1 the physician will record the&#xD;
      recommendation for first-line therapy based on standard clinical-pathological parameters&#xD;
      (PSA, Gleason score, clinical stage and percent positive cores). The likelihood of&#xD;
      recommending a non-interventional therapy approach will also be recorded using a 10-point&#xD;
      ordinal scale. A sample of the biopsy tissue will then be tested using the Prolaris® genomic&#xD;
      test and a relative cancer aggressiveness score will be shared with the physician. After&#xD;
      reviewing and considering the results of the genomic testing and after patient consultation,&#xD;
      the physician will complete POST-Prolaris Questionnaire #2 documenting the planned treatment&#xD;
      ( interventional treatment or non-interventional). Approximately 6 months from the date of&#xD;
      the test results, ACTUAL Treatment Questionnaire #3 will be completed to document the actual&#xD;
      treatment administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 2 of this study is a prospective evaluation of the prognostic utility of Prolaris®&#xD;
      testing of prostate biopsy samples obtained from men who participate in PART 1of the study&#xD;
      and who undergo radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy or who are managed with WW or AS.&#xD;
      The central VAMC site will be responsible for PART 2; individual VAMC sites will not&#xD;
      participate in this part of the study. Patients will be followed using medical record review&#xD;
      every 6 months for objective progression (BCR, radiographic or radionuclide evidence of&#xD;
      metastases or disease specific mortality) through 5 years.&#xD;
