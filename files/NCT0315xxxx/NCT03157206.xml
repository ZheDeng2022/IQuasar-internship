      Patients with diabetic macular edema treated with aflibercept injections for visual&#xD;
      impairment will be observed in standard care during 12 months. They will undergo visual&#xD;
      assessments by Ultrawide Field angiography at baseline and at 12 months&#xD;

      Diabetic retinopathy imaged by ultra wide field angiography (200°): the California (Optos,&#xD;
      Scotland) allows ultrawide field pictures of 200° of the retina. This new imaging allows&#xD;
      seeing beyond what was seen by the classic 7 ETDRS fields angiography:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In pivotal studies assessing the effect of antiVEGFs on diabetic retinopathy (DR) in&#xD;
           patients treated for diabetic macular edema (DME), ETDRS DR classification was used&#xD;
           based on the 7 classical ETDRS field fundus photographs. However, it has been identify&#xD;
           that antiVEGF may modified the semiology (hemorrhages, micro-aneurisms) and&#xD;
           consecutively modify the stage of DR. There is no assessment of the regression of&#xD;
           peripheral ischemia of the retina (non perfused retina) by angiography during an&#xD;
           antiVEGF treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DR severity score (1) based on ETDRS classification assess the number of retinal lesions&#xD;
           within the 7 classic retinal fields corresponding to around 30% of the total retina. It&#xD;
           has been recently shown that peripheral lesions non visible on the classic 7 fields&#xD;
           angiography could be predictive of progression of DR (2,3) at 4 years of follow-up&#xD;
           independently of the initial stage of DR, HbA1C level, and could be new arguments for&#xD;
           Laser treatment. This UWF imaging could help to understand some cases of patients with&#xD;
           worst progression than expected, and to identify new therapeutic indications (4). These&#xD;
           UWF pictures need to be explored in order to better characterize the severity of DR&#xD;
           forms and probably find new therapeutics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact of anti VEGF treatments on DR: pivotal studies assessing the efficacy of ranibizumab&#xD;
      on DME explored also the effect of antiVEGFs on DR. One of the secondary endpoints of RISE&#xD;
      and RIDE (5) studies, comparing the effect of ranibizumab 0.3mg versus 0.5mg versus sham&#xD;
      injections, was the rate of new proliferative DR (PDR). This rate was of 33.8% in the sham&#xD;
      group versus 11% in the treated group at 2 years of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Protocole I (6), the DRCRnet, found a 2 times lower risk to evolve toward PDR in case of&#xD;
      ranibizumab treatment versus sham (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIVID and VISTA showed at least 2 ETDRS steps improvement of DR for 30% of patients treated&#xD;
      by aflibercept versus 8.2% to 15.6% at 2 years in the sham group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It would be very interesting to have complementary data on improvement and worsening of DR&#xD;
      under antiVEGF treatment with an angiographic analysis of the retinal periphery perfusion on&#xD;
      larger field of the fundus than we usually have, and instead of color fundus photographs&#xD;
      usually available in pivotal study to assess DR severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to characterize at one year the effect of aflibercept used for&#xD;
      DME treatment on retinal periphery assessed by UWF angiography instead of the classic 7 ETDRS&#xD;
      fields in order to quantify ischemia.&#xD;
