      To assess the efficacy and safety of high concentration capsaicin patches in pain due to&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee in patients with obesity&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is one of the leading causes of pain and disability. In France osteoarthritis&#xD;
      of the knee, the most common form of osteoarthritis has been recently estimated to affect 4.7&#xD;
      % of men and 2.5 % of women .&#xD;
&#xD;
      One particularly exposed population to osteoarthritis is represented by obese patients.&#xD;
      Obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) above 30 kg/m², is considered to be one of the&#xD;
      most important risk factors for osteoarthritis (OA) in knees. Numerous longitudinal studies&#xD;
      show a strong association between obesity, and radiographic knee OA, e.g. in the Framingham&#xD;
      Study, the Chingford Study, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, the John Hopkins&#xD;
      Precursors Study, and in longitudinal studies in UK and the Netherlands. Thus, the WHO&#xD;
      initiative on counteracting obesity also accepts OA as a consequence of obesity . Each BMI&#xD;
      increase by 1 kg/m² is associated with a 15% increased risk of OA. A number of recent studies&#xD;
      involving the association between obesity and knee osteoarthritis have since been published.&#xD;
      A large, population-based prospective study (n = 823) conducted by Toivanen et al. with a&#xD;
      follow-up of 22 years found that the risk for knee osteoarthritis was 7 times greater for&#xD;
      people with BMI ≥30 compared to the control of people with BMI &lt;25. A prospective cohort&#xD;
      study of the Norwegian population by Grotle et al. (10) that followed 1,675 patients reported&#xD;
      that BMI &gt;30 was significantly associated with osteoarthritis of the knee, with odds ratio of&#xD;
      2.81, and 95% CI of 1.32-5.96. Lohmander et al. found that in a large cohort study of 27,960&#xD;
      patients from the Swedish population, the relative risk for knee osteoarthritis (fourth&#xD;
      quartile compared to first quartile) was 8.1, with a 95% CI of 5.3-12.4. Finally, a&#xD;
      case-control study from Holliday et al. with 1,042 knee osteoarthritis patients and 1,121&#xD;
      matched controls reported that the adjusted odds ratio for knee osteoarthritis in patients&#xD;
      with BMI &gt;30 was 7.48 with 95% CI of 5.45-10.27.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain is one of the major comorbid conditions that may preclude effective weight management in&#xD;
      these patients, particularly with regards to physical activity, since pain increases with&#xD;
      effort and movement. Obese patients generally receive oral analgesics, such as weak opioids&#xD;
      or tramadol, but due to a number of associated comorbidities, they generally do not tolerate,&#xD;
      or have contraindications to, centrally acting analgesics. Furthermore an increasing number&#xD;
      of obese patients are managed by malabsorbtive bariatric surgical procedures, exposing them&#xD;
      at risk for inefficacity by oral analgesics, in regards to the malabsorptive effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore alternative therapies, and in particular topical treatments, may be indicated in&#xD;
      these patients as these drugs have less systemic side effects. The use of such treatments in&#xD;
      patients with obesity should contribute to facilitate rehabilitation and hence contribute to&#xD;
      weight loss, which may further help to reduce pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One promising topical treatment is represented by capsaicin. Capsaicin is an agonist of the&#xD;
      transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), a non-selective cation channel. It is well&#xD;
      established that capsaicin applied in high concentration to the skin can cause initial&#xD;
      nociceptor sensitization through its agonistic effects on TRPV1 receptors then subsequently&#xD;
      acts in the skin to attenuate cutaneous hypersensitivity and reduce pain by a process best&#xD;
      described as &quot;defunctionalisation&quot; of nociceptor fibres (e.g. temporary loss of membrane&#xD;
      potential, inability to transport neurotrophic factors leading to altered phenotype, and&#xD;
      reversible retraction of epidermal and dermal nerve fibre terminals). Evidence suggests that&#xD;
      the utility of topical capsaicin may extend beyond painful peripheral neuropathies, and that&#xD;
      this treatment may be particularly relevant in patients with osteoarthritis pain. Thus TRPV1&#xD;
      is mainly expressed by nociceptive neurons in dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia. However,&#xD;
      there is increasing evidence that TRPV1 is also expressed in various cell types including&#xD;
      synovial fibroblasts (SF) from patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) and thus may&#xD;
      play a role in non-neuronal mechanisms that might modulate nociception in symptomatic&#xD;
      osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional effect of high concentration of capsaicin, which does not involve TRPV1, is a&#xD;
      direct inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, by using the approach of&#xD;
      patch-clamp, capsaicinoids (capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin) have been shown to reversibly&#xD;
      inhibit the currents of T-type voltage-dependent Ca2+channels, suggesting the effect of&#xD;
      capsaicinoids on pain relief may also be related to the inhibition of T-type Ca2+ channels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capsaicin is metabolized rapidly by several cytochrome enzymes present in human liver, but in&#xD;
      vitro studies shows that its metabolism in human skin is quite low. Capsaicin reside at the&#xD;
      site of action (i.e. skin) relatively unchanged, whereas capsaicin which is transdermally&#xD;
      absorbed is rapidly eliminated and does not have any systemic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, repeated applications of low dose capsaicin cream at different concentrations&#xD;
      (0.0125 to 0.25 %) have been found moderately effective in OA of the knee or hand, based on&#xD;
      the basis of six double or single blind trials with sample sizes ranging from 14 to 200&#xD;
      patients. However repeated applications of capsaicin cream are difficult on the long term&#xD;
      particularly because of the burning sensation induced by the cream and the necessity to&#xD;
      repeat applications several times per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently high concentration capsaicin patches (8%) (Qutenza) have been developed for the&#xD;
      treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. These treatments induce long lasting analgesic&#xD;
      effects in these conditions lasting up to an average of 3 months after a 30 to 60 minutes&#xD;
      application. The burning side effect related to the application of the patch is rapidly&#xD;
      reversible and very few severe side effects have been reported with this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the primary cause of chronic musculoskeletal pain lies deep within joints and topical&#xD;
      capsaicin does not provide substantial transdermal delivery, then the apparent efficacy of&#xD;
      topical capsaicin in lower back pain and OA could be postulated to be by CNS modulatory&#xD;
      mechanisms. Another possibility is that alterations in, or sensitization of, cutaneous&#xD;
      nociceptors could be a contributing factor. Such alterations might be driven by unusually&#xD;
      high concentrations of cytokines or growth factors in joints which could either diffuse some&#xD;
      distance away from the primary site of inflammation or promote excitatory phenotypes in&#xD;
      nearby collateral axons. Furthermore there is increasing evidence that TRPV1 expression is&#xD;
      not limited to primary afferent neurons but that the receptor is expressed in various cell&#xD;
      types throughout the body. TRPV1 is present in synovial fibroblasts from symptomatic OA and&#xD;
      RA (rheumatoid arthritis) patients and the receptor can be activated by stimulation with the&#xD;
      vanilloid capsaicin. It is very likely that capsaicin stimulation does not only induce IL-6&#xD;
      production but also results in the release of other signalling molecules that may transfer&#xD;
      the information to other non-neuronal or neuronal cells and thereby contribute to a&#xD;
      modulation of nociception in the inflamed joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the mechanisms described above, there are reasons to believe that Qutenza may also&#xD;
      be effective in osteoarthritis pain. To date, there are strictly no data regarding potential&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of this treatment in osteoarthritis pain in obese patients&#xD;
