      Subclinical infection of the intervertebral disc after lumbar disc herniation surgery has&#xD;
      been correlated to chronic low back pain and vertebral endplate changes. The most commonly&#xD;
      reported agent is Propionibacterium acnes. However, the real incidence is unclear, as it has&#xD;
      been reported in some series ranging from 3.7% to 46%. Recently, a systematic review&#xD;
      concluded that there is a relationship between P. acnes and endplate changes, but, there are&#xD;
      so far no studies to verify whether the reported presence of that pathogen in the&#xD;
      intervertebral discs is due to local infection or whether intraoperative contamination&#xD;
      occurred during the collection of samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the main objective of this study is to estimate the incidence of subclinical infection&#xD;
      in patients surgically treated for lumbar disc herniation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, a prospective cohort study will be conducted with a minimum of 95 patients&#xD;
      between 18 and 65 years of age who have been submitted to surgery after failure of&#xD;
      conservative treatment. The extruded disc will be removed and cultured for bacterial&#xD;
      identification. As controls, the ligamentum flavum and the multifidus muscle, taken&#xD;
      respectively before and after removal of the herniated fragment will also be cultured.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed-up for a year and MRI will be done at the end of this period.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Low back pain is a frequent condition in the population, as well as vertebral&#xD;
      endplates abnormalities, described by Modic et al.(1,2), that affect up to 6% of the general&#xD;
      population, and, up to 46% of patients with low back pain(3). Modic type I changes are&#xD;
      described as vertebral bone marrow edema related to acute low back pain(4). When Modic&#xD;
      changes are detected, chances of one presenting unspecific low back pain are 4.5 times&#xD;
      higher(1,2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subclinical infection caused by low-virulence pathogen can possibly lead to vertebral&#xD;
      endplate abnormalities, detected in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, and&#xD;
      differentiation between infection and Modic changes may be difficult(5,6). Subclinical&#xD;
      infection can also be associated with increasing low back pain(7). Albert et al(8) reported&#xD;
      61 patients who had undergone surgical treatment for lumbar disc herniation where 46% of&#xD;
      cases had a positive culture. The same authors also reported that 80% of patients with a&#xD;
      positive culture for anaerobic pathogens presented Modic type I changes at the adjacent&#xD;
      vertebra after a two-year follow-up, against 44% of patients with negative culture. Some&#xD;
      studies demonstrated the presence of low-virulence pathogens in intervertebral disc tissue&#xD;
      cultures(6-10), most commonly reported to Propionibacterium acnes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic low back pain and Modic type I changes have been treated with antibiotics for up to&#xD;
      100 days with superior outcomes compared to sham treatment(7). Patients were treated with&#xD;
      amoxicillin/clavulanate (500mg/125mg)(7) based on the study where sciatica is associated with&#xD;
      Propionibacterium acnes(8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, Carricajo et al(11) suggest that the presence of P. acnes in the intervertebral&#xD;
      discs is due to either external surgical or laboratory contamination. These authors detected&#xD;
      positive disc culture in only 3.7% of cases out of 54 patients. Furthermore, same authors&#xD;
      demonstrated that samples of spinal muscle and ligamentum flavum collected intraoperatively&#xD;
      at the end of procedure had positive cultures in 14.8% of cases with a negative disc culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic review performed by Urquhart et al(12) concluded, that there is moderate&#xD;
      evidence that a relationship between positive culture with Modic type I changes and low back&#xD;
      pain exists, although there was low evidence for relationship of cause. For that, authors&#xD;
      concluded that new studies should be made to determine whether pathogens in the disc are&#xD;
      originated from external contamination or if they are truly involved in the development of&#xD;
      chronic back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS Lumbar disc herniation is related to subclinical infection of the intervertebral&#xD;
      disc Null hypothesis: incidence of subclinical infection is the same as incidence of cases&#xD;
      without infection in patients with lumbar disc herniation treated with surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES Main purpose of this study is to identify if the presence of a infection pathogen&#xD;
      in the intervertebral disc is real or if it is intraoperative contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to analyze clinical prognostic factors in patients and diagnosis of&#xD;
      infection.The study also proposes to analyze the relationship between radiological changes&#xD;
      (Modic I and II) and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An open prospective cohort study will be performed at a single center, (Hospital Israelita&#xD;
      Albert Einstein - HIAE) taking 1 year for recruiting, and ending 1 year after inclusion of&#xD;
      last patient. Patients' data will be collected with a specific form created for this study.&#xD;
      Patients will be summoned for a new magnetic resonance image of the lumbar spine one year&#xD;
      after their surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All included patients will go through further treatment of ten sessions of postoperative&#xD;
      physical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have failed conservative treatment for lumbar disc herniation undergoing lumbar&#xD;
      decompression open surgery (microdiscectomy) will be consecutively included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient enrollment in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients accepting their participation will date and sign the Informed Consent Form (ICF).&#xD;
      After ICF is properly signed, patient will undergo an interview to complete initial&#xD;
      demographic data and pretreatment forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment will be carried out for 24 months, when 95 patients shall be included&#xD;
      (details of estimated n reported at sample size determination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient allocation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo surgery according to surgeons' preference. Attending surgeons will&#xD;
      determine chosen operative technique according to their experience and preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not have access to the results of tissue cultures for pathogens, as well as the&#xD;
      attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiologist that will analyze imaging studies of performed magnetic resonance will also&#xD;
      be blinded to patients' data or laboratory culture results. A blinded investigator will&#xD;
      analyze pain and function scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early stopping of participation in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be excluded from the study when:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawn of ICF&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diseased&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient selection flaw - incompatible eligibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lost to follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If patient presents clinical symptoms of infection such as severe lumbar or radicular&#xD;
           pain, fever with no other detected foci, abnormal ESR, CRP, leucogram, and, altered&#xD;
           imaging studies that leads to interruption of blinding of the results of culture exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study stages&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients will undergo standard fashion general anesthesia and prepped with&#xD;
      clorhexidine solution. Intravenous antibiotics prophylaxis will be administered within first&#xD;
      hour before skin incision, according to standard protocol of HIAE Infection Control Committee&#xD;
      published at the hospital Pharmaceutics Manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative blood sample will be collected for leucogram, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate&#xD;
      (ESR), and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). Same laboratory will be repeated at 1, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      time-point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The excised herniated disc fragment will be immediately sent to microbiology laboratory&#xD;
      analysis in a universal sterile container (screw cap tube) in no more than 30 minutes to be&#xD;
      processed as follows. Same process will be applied to samples of deep muscle and ligamentum&#xD;
      flavum at the end of the surgical procedure. Three cultures of the intervertebral disc will&#xD;
      be done, as well as three of the ligamentum flavum and three of the multifidus muscle for&#xD;
      each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Search for pathogens:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herniated intervertebral disc will be split in three equally sized fragments of over 2x2x5 mm&#xD;
      and squashed in a laminar flow cabinet until homogeneous material is achieved. Same process&#xD;
      will be carried out for the ligamentum flavum and multifidus muscle samples, although split&#xD;
      in three fragments. Tissues will be cultured in specific growth medium and incubated&#xD;
      according to the respective culture:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar criteria used by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) to detect joint&#xD;
      replacement infection will be adopted, which is the recommendation on at least two positive&#xD;
      tissue cultures by the same pathogen to confirm diagnosis of infection(13).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A - Aerobic culture For aerobic cultures, samples will be cultured in 5% sheep blood&#xD;
           agar, chocolate agar and MacConkey agar plate, and will be placed in a 35°C incubator&#xD;
           (CO2 atmosphere) for 5 days. If a positive bacteria culture is detected in the plate,&#xD;
           the colony will be identified by MALDI TOF (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption&#xD;
           Ionization-Time of Flight) Microflex LT (Bruker Daltonics/BD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B - Anaerobic culture For anaerobic culture, tissue will be cultured in a Thioglycolate&#xD;
           tube and incubated in a 35°C incubator for up to 21 days. If turbidity occurs at the&#xD;
           Thioglycolate medium, material will be cultured in anaerobic blood agar and incubation&#xD;
           at 35°C will be done in an anaerobic atmosphere. After growing of colonies,&#xD;
           identification will be done by MALDI TOF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C - Histological analysis Anatomic pathology analysis of the other fragment of the&#xD;
           herniated disc (2x2x5 mm) will be done. Sample will be transported in a universal&#xD;
           container with tamponaded formalin (10%), followed by dehydration in alcohol diafanized&#xD;
           in xylol and inclusion in paraffin (60-65°C), which will be stained in hematoxylin-eosin&#xD;
           (HE) and GRAM staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  HE: Histological cuts of 4μm will be performed, followed by clearing with xylol for&#xD;
                10 minutes twice, embedding with alcohol under increasing concentrations and&#xD;
                stained with hematoxylin for 5 minutes, running water for 5 minutes, eosin for 1&#xD;
                minute and running water for 2 minutes followed by assembly of glass microscope&#xD;
                slide with Entellan®.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  GRAM: Another slide will be embedded with crystal violet for 1 minute, running&#xD;
                water for 1 minute followed by lugol for another 1 minute and additional wash with&#xD;
                running water. Unstaining of the slide will be done with alcohol 95% for 10 seconds&#xD;
                followed by running water and then, stain with fuchsine for 30 seconds, running&#xD;
                water wash again, drying and slide assembly with Entellan®.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  D - Molecular analysis of pathogens Positive cultures that present aerobic or anaerobic&#xD;
           pathogens culturing, will be isolated and stowed refrigerated in -80°C freezer for&#xD;
           posterior molecular analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular typing will be performed through Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis technique of&#xD;
      isolated samples according to the protocol described by Oprica et al.(14) using Spe-I&#xD;
      restriction enzyme and Bionumerics software for analysis of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires See outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging studies Magnetic resonance imaging studies will be performed in Siemens or General&#xD;
      Electric 1.5T devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar disc herniation will be diagnosed through MRI in eligible patients. Included patients&#xD;
      will be submitted to new MRI 12 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two radiologists with expertise in musculoskeletal MRI will independently classify and&#xD;
      perform measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confounding variables Data on the following confounding variables will be collected: age,&#xD;
      gender, alcohol intake, smoking, body mass index (BMI), spinal injections with corticoid&#xD;
      within 6 months before surgery, usage of oral corticoids up to 3 months before surgery,&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this information may change over time, data will be considered at time of last&#xD;
      assessment before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical planning Rate of subclinical infection (or Modic change) will be obtained by the&#xD;
      ratio between number of positive cultures from surgical samples and total number of patients,&#xD;
      and estimates will follow 95% confidence intervals. After infection cases are identified, we&#xD;
      will investigate if there is an association between detected infection and patient outcomes&#xD;
      by logistic regression models for Modic changes, ordinal logistic regression for Modic volume&#xD;
      and size, and linear regression or general linear models for numeric outcomes, such as: low&#xD;
      back pain, quality of life and function. All models will consider confounding variables such&#xD;
      as: smoking and alcohol intake, diabetes, corticosteroids injection, BMI, gender, and age.&#xD;
      Results will be presented as effects estimates such as odds ratio or mean ratio, 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals and p values. Study dropout cases, for any reason, will be considered&#xD;
      for final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation Sample size was calculated to estimate of incidence of subclinical&#xD;
      infection in patients with lumbar disc herniation. Considering that the rate of infection&#xD;
      lies around 46%(3), we need to observe a minimum of 95 patients to achieve a 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval with 10% absolute accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The necessary sample size to analyze secondary endpoints will depend on the observed rate of&#xD;
      cases with subclinical infection in our study sample. If the observed rate is too small, an&#xD;
      increase in the number of included patients will be needed. To better evaluate this, the&#xD;
      sample size calculation will be revisited by the time we have reached half of initially&#xD;
      planned sample size (48 patients).&#xD;
