      INTRODUCTION Laparoscopy and robotic techniques are widespread procedures for pelvic&#xD;
      gynecologic, urologic and abdominal surgery often performed in Trendelenburg position.&#xD;
      Furthermore, in order to ameliorate surgical procedures, pneumoperitoneum is applied by&#xD;
      inflating carbon dioxide. However, the rise in abdominal pressure following pneumoperitoneum&#xD;
      and the head down body position have been shown to impair the respiratory function during the&#xD;
      procedure, mainly inducing atelectasis formation in the declive lung regions. Consequently,&#xD;
      functional residual capacity decreases and the risk of perioperative complications, such as&#xD;
      hypoxaemia, rises up, particularly if patients are obese. Formation of atelectasis may worsen&#xD;
      stress and strain of the alveolar structure. Stress, strain and atelectrauma give rise to&#xD;
      ventilator-induced lung injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the role of ventilator-induced lung injury during general anesthesia is unclear,&#xD;
      several investigations have been conducted with the purpose of improving arterial oxygenation&#xD;
      and respiratory mechanics during laparoscopy. A ventilator strategy providing positive&#xD;
      end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been shown to reduce the diaphragm cranial shift,&#xD;
      increasing functional residual capacity and decreasing respiratory system elastance,&#xD;
      principally in the obese subjects. Furthermore, the application of recruiting maneuver&#xD;
      followed by the subsequent application of PEEP improved oxygenation during laparoscopy.&#xD;
      Cinnella et al. demonstrated that an open lung strategy, i.e. a ventilation supported by&#xD;
      recruiting maneuvers followed by the subsequent application of PEEP applied after&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum induction, increased transpulmonary pressure and led to alveolar recruitment&#xD;
      and improvement of elastance of chest wall and gas exchange. These results are in accordance&#xD;
      with finding by Talmor et al, evaluating the effect of a mechanical ventilation guided by&#xD;
      esophageal pressure in acute lung injury patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However a comparison between an esophageal pressure piloted mechanical ventilation and a&#xD;
      conventional low tidal ventilator strategy with adjunct of PEEP and recruitment maneuvers&#xD;
      according to clinical judgment has never been investigated in patients undergoing robotic&#xD;
      gynecologic, abdominal or urologic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The investigators aim to compare the conventional ventilation strategy (i.e., with&#xD;
      application of PEEP and recruitment manoeuvre) with a ventilation driven by transpulmonary&#xD;
      pressure assessed through an esophageal catheter, in patients undergoing to robotic surgery,&#xD;
      with respect to oxygenation, expressed in terms of arterial oxygen tension - inspired oxygen&#xD;
      fraction ratio (PaO2/FiO2) (primary endpoint), intraoperative respiratory mechanics indexes,&#xD;
      number of lung recruitment maneuvers, rate and type of perioperative complications until&#xD;
      hospital discharge (additional endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Patients For this protocol, after informed consent has been obtained, 26 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the pilot randomized interventional study, eligible for robotic&#xD;
      gynecological, urological and abdominal surgery at Maggiore Hospital Novara Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The inclusion criteria will be: minimum age 18 years old, ASA I-II.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The exclusion criteria are: pre-existing lung and cardiac conditions that may lead to&#xD;
           asa&gt; II, contraindications to the positioning of a naso-gastric tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention After the induction of general anesthesia, a naso-gastric tube equipped with&#xD;
      gastric and esophageal balloon will be inserted (NutriventÂ® - Seda). The nasogastric tube&#xD;
      will be positioned and the esophageal balloon will be calibrated according to the findings by&#xD;
      Mojoli et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase, all patients will be ventilated a tidal volume (VT) of 6-8 ml / kg, in a&#xD;
      volume controlled mode; PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) equal to zero and FiO2 set to&#xD;
      obtain peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) &gt; or = to 94% . The respiratory rate will be set&#xD;
      to obtain arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) values between 35 and 45 mmHg and to ensure&#xD;
      a physiological pH. At most, both a mild hypercapnia and a mild acidosis will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all the patients radial artery will be cannulated to monitor continuous intra-arterial&#xD;
      blood pressure as usual practice, after Allen test results positive. The invasive hemodynamic&#xD;
      monitoring will be performed through MOSTCARETM technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, pneumoperitoneum will be applied to the patients, and the final position on the&#xD;
      surgical table will be guaranteed. At this point, a recruitment maneuver will be applied,&#xD;
      i.e., the ventilator is switched to pressure control ventilation, inspiratory time is&#xD;
      increased to 50%, the peak inspiratory pressure gradient (above PEEP) is set at 20 cm H2O,&#xD;
      and PEEP is progressively increased to obtain a stepwise increase of peak inspiratory to 30,&#xD;
      35, and 40 cm H2O every three breaths. The final recruiting pressure of 40 cm H2O is applied&#xD;
      for six breaths. after recruiting maneuver ventilator is switched to previous ventilation&#xD;
      mode. This maneuver is normally used to distend the lungs and prevent atelectasis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, patients will be randomized into two groups according to a randomization list generated&#xD;
      by a dedicated software. Clinician, at the surgical table, will open a sequentially numbered,&#xD;
      opaque, sealed envelope to allocate the patient according to the randomization group. A&#xD;
      researcher, not involved in the clinical care of the patient, will keep the randomization&#xD;
      list. Patients will be randomized into:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group: 13 ventilated patients in Volume controlled VT 6-8 ml / kg; PEEP, and&#xD;
           Fio2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) set for SpO2&gt; or = to 94%, Plateau pressure &lt;28 cm&#xD;
           H2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Case group: 13 ventilated patients with current volume VT 6-8 ml / kg and in any case&#xD;
           with a transpulmonary inspiratory pressure (PLinsp) of less than 20 cmH2O and&#xD;
           transpulmonary expiratory pressure (PLexp) - FiO2, according to predefined criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups the respiratory rate will be set to obtain PaCO2 values between 35 and 45 mmHg&#xD;
      and in any case to ensure a physiological pH. In addition, whenever the clinician will deem&#xD;
      it appropriate, an alveolar recruitment maneuver will be applied, as previously described, in&#xD;
      order to improve the PaO2 / FiO2 relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety criteria In the intervention group in case of SpO2&lt; to 94%, alveolar recruitment&#xD;
      maneuvers will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements During the study the following parameters will be recorded: arterial blood gas,&#xD;
      respiratory mechanics parameters (airway pressure, tidal volume, transpulmonary pressure,&#xD;
      flow, esophageal pressure),peritoneal insufflation pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These measurement will be will be performed at:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) 15 min after induction of anesthesia (STEP 1) 2) immediately after the positioning of the&#xD;
      patient and / or the pneumoperitoneum induction (STEP 2) 3) immediately after the recruitment&#xD;
      maneuver (STEP 3) 4) 20 minutes after the application of the ventilatory strategy select with&#xD;
      the randomization (STEP 4) 5) after 60 minutes from the application of the ventilatory&#xD;
      strategy select with the randomization (STEP 5) 7) every 60 minutes from the last step (STEP&#xD;
      6) 8) at the end of surgery after the elimination of the pneumo-peritoneum and / or in the&#xD;
      supine position (STEP 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      9) 1h after recovery from anesthesia (STEP 8). With the patient awake (i.e.before and after&#xD;
      surgery), a lung ultrasound will be carried out to evaluate the degree of ventilation /&#xD;
      atelectasis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis For this pilot randomized study, was calculated a sample size of 26&#xD;
      patients in total i.e., 13 patients per arm . To determine sample size, the investigators&#xD;
      expected a difference of 80 mmHg between the mean value of PaO2/FiO2 of the two groups and a&#xD;
      standard deviation of 60 mmHg, with a power of 80% and an alpha of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The continuous variables will be presented as the median and interquartile and will be&#xD;
      compared using the Mann Whitney test. Categorical variables, whether dichotomous or nominal,&#xD;
      will be evaluated with a Fisher test. A trend analysis will be carried out within each group&#xD;
      over the course of each step.&#xD;
