  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of two different doses of umbilical cord&#xD;
      derived, ex-vivo cultured and expanded Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (MSCTC-0010) in&#xD;
      the treatment of acute Graft versus Host Disease (aGVHD). The first 5 participants enrolled&#xD;
      in the study will receive a lower dose of MSCTC-0010. If none of the first 5 participants&#xD;
      have treatment-related serious adverse events (TRSAEs) for 42 days, then the next 5&#xD;
      participants will receive a slightly higher dose of MSCTC-0010.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The curative potential of Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT), when&#xD;
      applied as a therapy in the management of hematologic malignancies, specifically, derives&#xD;
      from an immunologically driven, graft-versus-tumor effect mediated principally by donor&#xD;
      T-cells, and is associated with a lesser risk for relapse when compared to high dose&#xD;
      chemo-radio therapy and autologous HCT. Donor derived T-cells are also responsible for&#xD;
      mediating the occurrence of GVHD, a common transplant-related complication, affecting a&#xD;
      significant percentage of patients undergoing allo-HCT leading to the destruction of host&#xD;
      tissues. The standard initial treatment for both acute and chronic GVHD is steroid-based&#xD;
      therapy. Unfortunately, many of these patients will become resistant to steroid therapy and&#xD;
      will subsequently be treated with second-line immunosuppressive agents. De novo high-risk&#xD;
      aGVHD and steroid-refractory aGVHD portends a very poor prognosis; second-line agents&#xD;
      frequently prove ineffective, and as a result, survival is &lt; 10% at 5 years. Therefore,&#xD;
      alternative therapies are needed to treat aGVHD following allo-HCT, particularly in the&#xD;
      setting of de novo high-risk acute or steroid-resistant disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the large numbers of Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that can be obtained from the&#xD;
      umbilical cord, the availability of this tissue, their higher growth rates and expansion&#xD;
      capacity, and their immune properties, including: (1) low immunogenicity and lack of&#xD;
      stimulation of allogeneic T-lymphocyte proliferation, (2) suppression of the proliferation of&#xD;
      activated T-lymphocytes, (3) increased production of regulatory T-cells, and (4) a shift in&#xD;
      the immune response towards tolerance, Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (WJMSC) may be&#xD;
      a preferred option for MSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for cell dosing in this protocol is based on published data from Kebriaei, et&#xD;
      al. Dosing at 2 × 10^6 MSC/kg body weight produced a complete response in 87.5% of the&#xD;
      treated patients. Dosing at a level 4 times higher (8 × 10^6 MSC/kg body weight) produced no&#xD;
      improvement in complete response results. However, the higher dose produced some partial&#xD;
      response and no patient failed to respond to therapy. Therefore, the Phase I study for&#xD;
      MSCTC-0010 is designed to increase the dose of WJMSC from 2 × 10^6 MSC to 10 × 10^6 MSC/kg&#xD;
      body weight, assuming no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed at the lower dose.&#xD;
