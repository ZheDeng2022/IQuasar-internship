    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      TAEST16001（TCR Affinity Enhancing Specific T cell Therapy）in the multi-line treatment failed&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors except non small cell lung cancer,including liver cancer,gastric&#xD;
      cancer,esophageal cancer,bone and soft tissue tumors,breast cancer, bladder&#xD;
      carcinoma,prostate carcinoma,thyroid cancer, ovarian cancer and so on. The patients must meet&#xD;
      the two criteria: human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-A*0201+ and NY-ESO-1 positive cells≥25% by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TCR-T cell therapy has made a breakthrough for tumors in recent years. Phase I/II trial of&#xD;
      NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-T treatment for synovial sarcoma and melanoma, conducted by the&#xD;
      Rosenberg team at the National Cancer Institute, showed that 61% Synovial cell sarcoma and&#xD;
      55% melanoma had benefits, without severe side effects found in T cell receptor (TCR)&#xD;
      transduced T-Cell Immunotherapy. The US FDA has granted breakthrough TCR-T cell therapy for&#xD;
      patients with inoperable or metastatic synovial sarcoma. The European Medicines Agency has&#xD;
      also approved the same therapy to Priority Medicines(PRIME).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is mainly focused on cancer-testis antigen, because it is not expressed&#xD;
      in normal cells. NY-ESO-1 antigen as one member of cancer-testis antigen, is commonly&#xD;
      expressed in 10-50% of melanoma, lung, liver, esophageal, breast, prostate, bladder, thyroid&#xD;
      and ovarian cancer cases, 60% of multiple myeloma cases, and 70-80% of synovial sarcoma. The&#xD;
      NY-ESO-1 TCR cell therapy for synovial sarcoma and melanoma has benefited many patients, but&#xD;
      its effect on other solid tumors is still unknown. So we plan to explore its efficacy in many&#xD;
      types of solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of TAEST16001 cell therapy in&#xD;
      multi-line treatment failed advanced solid tumors except non small cell lung cancer,including&#xD;
      liver cancer,gastric cancer,esophageal cancer,bone and soft tissue tumors,breast cancer,&#xD;
      bladder carcinoma,prostate carcinoma,thyroid cancer, ovarian cancer and so on. The patients&#xD;
      must meet the two criteria: HLA-A*0201+ and NY-ESO-1 positive cells≥25% by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
