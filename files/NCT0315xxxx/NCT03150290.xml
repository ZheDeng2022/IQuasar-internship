    <textblock>
      Weight loss is a common phenomenon in ALS. During the course of the disease, difficulty in&#xD;
      swallowing and mastication can be responsible for a decrease in caloric intake and thus for&#xD;
      weight loss. However, significant weight loss can also be observed in patients with no&#xD;
      feeding difficulties. About half of ALS patients have an increase in their resting energy&#xD;
      consumption, but the origin of this &quot;hypermetabolism&quot; remains unknown. &quot;Brown&quot; fat is&#xD;
      specialized in the production of heat. Unlike &quot;white&quot; fat that stores excess caloric intakes,&#xD;
      brown fat consumes energy. In humans, brown fat has long been considered as absent in adults.&#xD;
      However, recent imaging techniques have been able to detect brown fat deposits in some adult&#xD;
      subjects. The aim of this study is thus to determine the role of brown fat on energy&#xD;
      consumption in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder involving&#xD;
      motor neurons of the cerebral cortex, brain stem and spinal cord. Motor neuron loss results&#xD;
      in rapidly progressive muscle paralysis, usually leading to death from respiratory failure in&#xD;
      3-5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight loss is a frequent phenomenon and an independent negative prognostic factor for&#xD;
      survival in ALS. Involvement of bulbar muscles with dysphagia is likely to lead to decrease&#xD;
      in energy intake resulting in negative energy balance. However, weight loss also occurs in&#xD;
      non-dysphagic patients, and is not restricted to reduction in skeletal muscle mass but also&#xD;
      involves fat mass reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypermetabolism (i.e. elevation of resting energy expenditure, REE) have been reported in ALS&#xD;
      in about 50% of ALS patients but the origin of this hypermetabolism remains unknown. Increase&#xD;
      of REE seems paradoxical in the context of ALS because skeletal muscle mass, which accounts&#xD;
      for a large proportion of energy consumption and heat production, is decreased in ALS&#xD;
      patients. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is another important organ for basal and inducible&#xD;
      energy expenditure and thermogenesis. In humans, BAT is primarily found in infants and young&#xD;
      children, and healthy adults has long been considered as almost devoid of functional BAT.&#xD;
      However, a recent study using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron-emission tomographic&#xD;
      (PET) scan showed that depots of functional BAT were present in about 5% of adult humans,&#xD;
      most commonly localized in the cervical-supraclavicular region. In an autopsy series, depots&#xD;
      of BAT in the periadrenal region were found in 19/20 ALS patients. It has been estimated&#xD;
      that, if present, 50 g of maximally stimulated brown tissue could represent up to 20% of REE&#xD;
      expenditure in an adult human. The presence of substantial, functional, depots of BAT could&#xD;
      thus participate in the increase of REE observed in ALS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to identify and quantify potential depots of&#xD;
      functional BAT in ALS patients. Secondary objectives will be to correlate amount of&#xD;
      detectable BAT with measured REE, clinical parameters evaluating ALS progression and&#xD;
      biological parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 5 patients referred to the Paris ALS center with a diagnosis of ALS&#xD;
      and &quot;unexplained&quot; (i.e. not explained by severe dysphagia) loss of 5 percent or more of&#xD;
      normal body weight in the last 6 months. 5 ALS patients without significant weight loss will&#xD;
      also be included in the study as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, measurement of REE will be performed by indirect calorimetry. The volume&#xD;
      and activity of BAT will be determined using 18F-FDG PET whole body scans. Data on&#xD;
      concomitant and past disorders (including cancer and diabete mellitus), smoking history,&#xD;
      medication use, height, current and normal body weight, age and site of onset of ALS symptoms&#xD;
      will be recorded. Functional motor impairment will be assessed using manual muscle testing&#xD;
      and the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale as in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first to investigate, using non-invasive procedures, the role of&#xD;
      depots of functional BAT in ALS patients' metabolic dysfunction. The results will provide new&#xD;
      insights on the origin and consequences of the dysregulation of metabolic homeostasis in ALS.&#xD;
