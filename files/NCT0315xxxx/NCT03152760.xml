      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects about 10 percent of people in the U.S. Studies show a&#xD;
      relationship between the bacteria (microbiota) in the gut and the brain. Researchers think&#xD;
      this may influence AUD. They want to learn more about changes in gut bacteria that may occur&#xD;
      in people with AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study gut microbiota differences in current drinking versus abstinent people with AUD.&#xD;
      Also to test if gut microbiota are related to alcohol cue-induced craving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 21-70 who have AUD (both abstinent and current heavy drinkers) or are healthy,&#xD;
      moderate drinkers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened in Protocol 14-AA-0181.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a first visit. They will have 4 more visits within about 10 days.&#xD;
      Visits include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal sample collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of diet and alcohol use&#xD;
&#xD;
      X-rays to test body composition,&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will sit under a ventilation hood to measure metabolism. They must fast 12 hours before&#xD;
      this test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will drink a solution. Their urine is collected over 5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound of the liver area. They must fast overnight before this test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 2 visits, they will be in a bar-like setting. They will be exposed to stimuli associated&#xD;
      with eating and drinking. They will rate their urge to drink alcohol and their food cravings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will collect their stool throughout the study. They will also record information&#xD;
      about their diet and daily activities like sleep and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, participants will discuss their drinking. They will receive&#xD;
      counseling if needed.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increasing body of preclinical literature suggests a role of the gut microbiota in a wide&#xD;
      range of medical disorders, including neuropsychiatric diseases like autism, anxiety, and&#xD;
      depression. Preliminary studies have reported alterations in microbiota composition,&#xD;
      inflammation, and intestinal permeability in alcohol-dependent patients. However, there is&#xD;
      little research on the association between these alterations and behavioral outcomes&#xD;
      associated with alcohol use disorder (AUD), such as alcohol craving and drinking. The main&#xD;
      goal is to investigate gut microbiota differences in current drinking versus abstinent&#xD;
      individuals with AUD, and whether microbial profiles are correlated with alcohol cue-induced&#xD;
      craving. Finally, another goal of this project will be to conduct preliminary translational&#xD;
      bed-to-bench work using rodent models of excessive alcohol use via collaborations with basic&#xD;
      science laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alcohol use disorder participants (current drinkers and abstinent) and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between subject, observational study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will compare the gut microbiota of AUD participants who have been abstinent to that of&#xD;
      current drinkers. In addition, we will further compare the gut microbiota of these two groups&#xD;
      to a third group of healthy controls with no prior or current diagnosis of AUD. The secondary&#xD;
      aim of this study is to examine whether the overall microbial community composition, function&#xD;
      and individual taxa correlate with alcohol cue-induced craving.&#xD;
