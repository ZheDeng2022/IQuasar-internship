  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a European study which is part of a larger research project (TackSHS project) funded&#xD;
      by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (Grant Agreement&#xD;
      681040) and led by the Catalan Institute of Oncology. The main goal of the study is to assess&#xD;
      the environmental levels of secondhand smoke (SHS) in non-regulated settings such as private&#xD;
      and outdoor settings of 12 European countries (Bulgaria, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland,&#xD;
      Italy, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and the United Kingdom) representing&#xD;
      geographical, legislative (country-specific smoke-free policies) and cultural variations&#xD;
      across Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-country cross-sectional study based on objective environmental measurements&#xD;
      of SHS levels. Private settings studied are homes and cars and outdoors settings are terraces&#xD;
      of hospitality venues, children playgrounds and entrances of primary school buildings. A&#xD;
      total of 1,080 environmental measures of airborne nicotine will be collected. 20&#xD;
      environmental measures will be collected from homes and each of the outdoor settings for the&#xD;
      12 countries involved in the study (960 samples). Regarding cars, 60 environmental&#xD;
      measurements will be collected in two countries (Spain and the UK) (120 samples), which have&#xD;
      been selected taking into account differences in smoke-free legislation. Further information&#xD;
      about SHS exposure will be collected for each setting through brief questionnaires or forms.&#xD;
      Medians and interquartile ranges of nicotine concentrations will be calculated by country for&#xD;
      each setting studied. Nicotine concentrations will be compared using non-parametric tests&#xD;
      according to country, socioeconomic status and other determinants of exposure for each&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: to assess the levels of SHS in a range of private settings and outdoor&#xD;
      settings in different European countries according to the type of setting, the smoke-free&#xD;
      legislation and socioeconomic characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess levels of SHS in homes and cars according to socioeconomic status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess levels of SHS in outdoor settings (children playgrounds, terraces of&#xD;
           hospitality venues and entrances of school buildings) according to socioeconomic status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze associations between air nicotine concentrations and self-reported&#xD;
           information related to tobacco smoking and exposure to SHS in homes and cars&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze associations between air nicotine concentrations and observational variables&#xD;
           related to exposure to SHS in outdoor settings (children playgrounds, terraces of&#xD;
           hospitality venues and entrances of school buildings)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess relationships between levels of SHS and type of smoking legislation and&#xD;
           socio-demographic characteristics across Europe according to different types of settings&#xD;
           measured&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop evidence-based policy recommendations for policy makers and health&#xD;
           authorities&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-country cross-sectional study based on objective environmental measurements&#xD;
      of SHS levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SETTINGS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in private and outdoor settings in the following 12 European&#xD;
      countries: Bulgaria, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Portugal,&#xD;
      Romania, Spain and the United Kingdom. Private settings studied will be homes and cars and&#xD;
      outdoor settings will be terraces of hospitality venues, children playgrounds and entrances&#xD;
      of primary school buildings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLING&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 1,080 environmental measures will be collected. 20 environmental measures will be&#xD;
      collected from homes and each of the outdoor settings for the 12 countries involved in the&#xD;
      study (20 samples × 4 settings × 12countries = 960 samples). Regarding cars, 60 environmental&#xD;
      measurements will be collected in two countries (Spain and UK) (120 samples), which have been&#xD;
      selected taking into account differences in smoking legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convenience sampling will be performed considering feasibility and trying to include&#xD;
      participants from different socioeconomic status (SES). Neighborhood SES will be measured&#xD;
      using ecological synthetic SES indexes available in each country. Measures will be taken in&#xD;
      private and outdoor settings located in the most deprived neighborhoods (those below the 20th&#xD;
      percentile of the SES distribution) and the least deprived neighborhoods (those above the&#xD;
      80th percentile of the SES distribution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      FIELDWORK&#xD;
&#xD;
      Private settings: homes and cars&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each country, the investigators will measure levels of nicotine in 20 homes. We will&#xD;
      recruit 20 non-smoking volunteers living in different homes with at least one smoker: 10&#xD;
      participants living in more deprived neighborhoods and 10 participants living in wealthier&#xD;
      neighborhoods. Nicotine vapor phase will be measured during one week using passive SHS&#xD;
      samplers. At the end of the week, the investigators will administer a specific questionnaire&#xD;
      about SHS exposure to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure levels of nicotine in 30 cars (two samples per car) in two&#xD;
      European countries with different smoke-free legislation (Spain and UK). A convenience&#xD;
      sampling will be performed considering feasibility and trying to include participants with&#xD;
      different smoking habits. The investigators will recruit 30 drivers: 10 daily-smoking&#xD;
      volunteers that usually smoke within their car; 10 daily-smoking volunteers that do not smoke&#xD;
      within their car; and 10 non-smoking volunteers. To be eligible, participants have to spend a&#xD;
      minimum of 30 minutes per day within the car. Nicotine vapor phase will be measured using&#xD;
      passive SHS samplers. Two samplers will be hung up in each car during a period of 24 hours.&#xD;
      One sampler will be open during the 24-hour sampling period. The other sampler will be only&#xD;
      open during travelling time. Outdoor settings: nicotine vapor phase will be measured using&#xD;
      active SHS samplers. For each country, a convenience sampling of 60 outdoor settings (20&#xD;
      children playgrounds, 20 terraces of hospitality venues, and 20 entrances of primary school&#xD;
      buildings) will be performed considering feasibility and trying to include the outdoor&#xD;
      settings from different SES neighborhoods. Data collection will be conducted from March to&#xD;
      October. The measurements will be able to be taken at any time of day providing that there&#xD;
      are at least five adults. The investigators will collect nicotine samples using samplers&#xD;
      attached to an air pump. Measurements will last 30 minutes. While measures are being taken,&#xD;
      data collectors will also conduct observations in accordance with the protocol of active&#xD;
      sampling collection. In each country, the investigators will measure levels of nicotine in 30&#xD;
      outdoor settings (10 playgrounds, 10 terraces of hospitality venues, and 10 entrances of&#xD;
      primary school buildings) located in more deprived neighborhoods and 30 outdoor settings (as&#xD;
      above) located in wealthier neighborhoods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN OUTCOMES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vapour-phase nicotine (μg/m3) is the main objective outcome. The investigators will also&#xD;
      register sample's code, location sampled, date and time when the monitor was installed and&#xD;
      removed, time of tobacco exposure, volume of the area, smoke-free rules of the setting, and&#xD;
      further relevant information related to the SHS exposure according to the different settings&#xD;
      studied (e.g., for private settings: socio-demographic variables, intensity of tobacco&#xD;
      exposure (number of smokers), minutes of exposure per day, number of cigarettes smoked per&#xD;
      day, ventilation, use of air-conditioning or heating (only in cars), etc.; for outdoor&#xD;
      settings: no smoking signs, presence of ashtrays and butts, smoke smell, number of people&#xD;
      smoking, total number of adults and children, kind of venue, age group allowed to play (only&#xD;
      in playgrounds), number of walls or roof (only in terraces), etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA SOURCES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental samples: Nicotine vapor phase will be measured using SHS samplers, which&#xD;
      consist of a 37-mm diameter plastic cassette containing a filter treated with sodium&#xD;
      bisulphate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive samplers will be placed in private homes and cars. The samplers will be placed for a&#xD;
      period of seven days in homes and of 24 hours in cars. In homes, samplers will be hung freely&#xD;
      in the air approximately 2 meters high. They will not be placed where air does not circulate&#xD;
      such as a corner, under a shelf or buried in curtains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active samplers will be used in outdoors settings. The samplers will be attached to an air&#xD;
      pump with a flow rate ranging from 2 to 3 L/min, and 30-min measurements will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire/Form: Questionnaires or forms will be fulfilled by trained personnel at the&#xD;
      same time the samples are taken. There is a specific questionnaire or form to be filled for&#xD;
      each setting. All questionnaires/forms gather some common questions and other specific&#xD;
      questions according to the setting studied. Questionnaires/forms gather information on&#xD;
      sampling area, date and time the samplers are placed and removed, the presence of tobacco&#xD;
      smoking, specific characteristics of the setting studied, attitudes and behaviors towards&#xD;
      tobacco, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study data will be kept in different databases according to the setting studied.&#xD;
      Information obtained through forms and questionnaires will be entered on a computer by&#xD;
      collaborators from each country. Then, all data bases will be encrypted and later on sent by&#xD;
      e-mail to the ASPB. Individual forms and questionnaires will be scanned and sent&#xD;
      electronically to the ASPB. Original versions will also be sent by post. All forms and&#xD;
      questionnaires will be stored by the ASPB in agreement with the current law. Nicotine samples&#xD;
      will be sent properly stored and identified to the ASPB during the fieldwork.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LAB ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the nicotine samples will be analyzed by the laboratory of the Public Health Agency of&#xD;
      Barcelona (Spain) using the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method. Nicotine analysis&#xD;
      will be conducted by the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method, which has been&#xD;
      officially accredited by the Spanish National Accreditation Entity (ENAC) according to ISO&#xD;
      17025 guidelines. This method allows quantifying the total amount of nicotine in the sample,&#xD;
      with a lower limit of detection of 5 ng. Subsequently, the time weighted average nicotine&#xD;
      concentration (μg/m3) can be estimated by dividing the amount of extracted nicotine by the&#xD;
      volume of air sampled multiplied by the total number of minutes the filter has been exposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blank samples will be analyzed for quality assurance and to assess potential contamination of&#xD;
      the filters during manipulation of monitors, storage, shipment or shipment. A blank sample&#xD;
      for each 20 samples will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first descriptive analysis will be conducted for all outcomes included in the study.&#xD;
      Categorical variables will be described by raw frequencies and percentages and continuous&#xD;
      variables will be described by means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile&#xD;
      range (IQR). Medians and IQR of nicotine concentrations will be calculated by country for&#xD;
      each setting studied. Box-plots will be used to visualize the distribution of nicotine&#xD;
      concentrations. Nicotine concentrations obtained will be compared according to country, SES&#xD;
      and other determinants of exposure for each setting, using non-parametric tests (the Mann&#xD;
      Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test as appropriate). Finally, correlations between nicotine&#xD;
      concentration and variables related to the SHS recorded in the questionnaires or forms will&#xD;
      be also assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants taking part in environmental measurements collected in private settings&#xD;
      (homes and cars) will be properly informed verbally and in writing, providing all pertinent&#xD;
      information about the aims, methods, procedures, ethical issues and measures taken. Enrolling&#xD;
      in the study will be voluntary and signing a written informed consent will be mandatory to&#xD;
      take part in the study as agreement to participate. Informed consent will not be obtained to&#xD;
      collect environmental measurements in outdoor settings. All written informed consents will be&#xD;
      firstly stored in locked filing cabinets and principal investigators will be responsible for&#xD;
      the informed consent of participants of their country. Later, written informed consent will&#xD;
      be scanned, copied and sent electronically to the ASPB. All original informed consent will be&#xD;
      post to the ASPB using a traceable mail courier. All original informed consent will be stored&#xD;
      in accordance with Spanish legislation. All personal information will be treated as&#xD;
      confidential and will be stored in agreement with the current laws. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines of the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki and the current legal regulation about confidentiality of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFORMED CONSENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      All informed consent will be written in English and in official language, according to the&#xD;
      country involved in the project, to ensure potential participant's comprehension. The&#xD;
      informed consent gathers information about the aims, methods and procedures of the study and&#xD;
      properly informs about involvement of the participants and their rights as participants of&#xD;
      the study. Two different specific informed consents have been designed according to the&#xD;
      private setting (homes or cars) where the measurements are taken.&#xD;
