      This trial will be a phase 2, open-label, study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      efficacy of VIR007 when administered topically for up to 60 days to adults between the ages&#xD;
      of 18 to 65 years with a clinical diagnosis of external condylomata acuminata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will enter the Screening Period once the informed consent process has been&#xD;
      completed. Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of external condylomata acuminata and who meet&#xD;
      all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once subject eligibility is confirmed and the screening procedures completed, the subject&#xD;
      will start the Treatment Period of the study. All enrolled subjects will receive VIR007&#xD;
      (cream containing 10% EISO) with the first dose applied topically during Visit 1 (Day 1).&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed on how to apply the study medication twice daily for up to 60&#xD;
      days or until the Investigator determines the lesions have cleared. Subjects will return to&#xD;
      the clinic for study-related assessments on Study Days 7, 14, 28, 42 and a Final Study Visit&#xD;
      on Day 60. 30 days following complete resolution, as determined by the study investigator,&#xD;
      or, on Study Day 90, subjects will receive a follow-up telephone call and be queried&#xD;
      regarding condition status since study completion.&#xD;
