  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (nf/avPPA) is a fatal&#xD;
      neurodegenerative disease that begins with isolated language deficits. There is currently no&#xD;
      cure or treatment for this disease. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), a&#xD;
      noninvasive neuromodulatory technique, is effective in major depression, and studied in many&#xD;
      other conditions including nf/avPPA. Here the investigators propose to study the feasibility&#xD;
      and change in language and brain function of a newer rTMS protocol (intermittent theta-burst&#xD;
      stimulation, iTBS) using a randomized, blinded crossover design: participants will receive&#xD;
      active or sham iTBS for two weeks and then switch groups without them or clinicians knowing&#xD;
      their group. The investigators hypothesize that brain function and performance with language&#xD;
      tasks will change after active iTBS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled blinded cross-over treatment trial that involves 20&#xD;
      iTBS treatment sessions (10 active treatment sessions; 10 sham treatment sessions) and the&#xD;
      study will last between 6 weeks. There will be 20 treatment visits (Monday-Friday) each&#xD;
      lasting 10-40 minutes. Whether the participant is randomly assigned to active or sham&#xD;
      treatment, the participant will receive daily 10 minute session of iTBS treatment. Some&#xD;
      sessions will include behavioral and neurophysiological measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, participants will complete cognitive testing, and neuro-imaging, including&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance (fMRI), functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) prior to the commencement of iTBS/sham treatment and at&#xD;
      post-treatment. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated during daily iTBS treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 10 iTBS treatment visits over 2 weeks, a clinical assessment will be done to see if the&#xD;
      participants are responding to the iTBS treatment with a targeted language assessment and&#xD;
      neuro-imaging as described above. After 2 weeks of &quot;wash-out&quot;, where the subjects do not&#xD;
      receive any treatments, the participants will undergo another 2 weeks of iTBS treatment. On&#xD;
      the first iTBS session after the 2-week washout period, participants will undergo a targeted&#xD;
      language assessment and EEG/fNIRS. At the final iTBS session at 6 weeks, subjects will again&#xD;
      undergo a targeted language assessment, EEG/fNIRS, and fMRI. At that point, after 6 weeks,&#xD;
      the cross-over study is finished.&#xD;

    <description>Tolerability will be measured by daily Comfort Rating Questionnaire (CRQ) between sham and active interventions and compared using Chi-square. A mean score across all treatment sessions above 6 on more than 2 items on the CRQ will be considered as severe. A mean score across all treatment sessions between 4 and 6 on more than 2 items on the CRQ will be considered as moderate tolerability. A mean score across all treatment sessions below 4 on the majority of items will be considered as mild tolerability.</description>
