  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of an&#xD;
      obinutuzumab containing conditioning regimen for poor risk CLL patients and patients with&#xD;
      Richter's transformation requiring an allogeneic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CLL is the most common haematological malignancy in the western world. Though in the majority&#xD;
      it behaves like a chronic disease with minimal impact on life expectancy, in around 15-20% of&#xD;
      the patients it takes a very aggressive course. Patients who experience a high grade&#xD;
      transformation, i.e., Richter's transformation also have a poor prognosis. Despite the advent&#xD;
      of new therapeutic agents like Bcl-2 and BTK inhibitors which are revolutionising the outlook&#xD;
      for this particular patient cohort, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only&#xD;
      currently available therapy with the potential to cure. The non relapse mortality associated&#xD;
      with this treatment is a major deterrent for physicians and patients alike to opt this&#xD;
      intervention. We propose a trial to study the use of a B-cell depleting agent, obinutuzumab&#xD;
      to simultaneously reduce tumour bulk control and offer GvHD prophylaxis in the&#xD;
      peri-transplant setting and thereby analyse its impact on non relapse morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      as well as maximum minimum residual disease (MRD) eradication. All patients with poor risk&#xD;
      CLL (current EBMT criteria) and Richter's transformation with the best possible response to&#xD;
      available therapies will be considered for the trial. Due to the poor disease control&#xD;
      associated with peri-transplant T-cell depletion, obinutuzumab will be used instead of T-cell&#xD;
      depleting agents as GvHD prophylaxis.&#xD;
