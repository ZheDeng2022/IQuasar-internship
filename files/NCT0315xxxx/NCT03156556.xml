  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety and depression represent the most common mental health problems. Unfortunately, only&#xD;
      a minority of people in need will seek or access traditional mental health services. Access&#xD;
      to traditional psychological care is even more challenging for linguistic minorities as well&#xD;
      as for people living in rural areas and for young adults - a group that has the highest rate&#xD;
      of anxiety and depression but the lowest rate of consulting traditional&#xD;
      services.Telepsychotherapy can facilitate access to effective psychological care as done in&#xD;
      Australia where the government has been offering an evidence-based 8-week online therapy&#xD;
      program called the Wellbeing Course. This online course helps people manage worry, stress,&#xD;
      anxiety and depression. It has been evaluated in several clinical trials and successfully&#xD;
      implemented as an Australian national treatment service. Its transdiagnostic nature, and the&#xD;
      fact that the guidance of a clinician is not required for an efficient and safe&#xD;
      administration and maintenance of therapeutic gains make it not only a viable option, but&#xD;
      also an easily accessible fist line intervention. More recently, findings from a feasibility&#xD;
      study conducted by our research laboratory have supported the efficacy of a French-Canadian&#xD;
      translation among French-speaking minorities in New-Brunswick. A version of the Wellbeing&#xD;
      Course for young adults has been developed called the Mood Mechanic Course. Empirical support&#xD;
      has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a feasibility open trial, the first phase of a 3-phase research program&#xD;
      designed to implement a French-Canadian translation of the Mood Mechanic Course in New&#xD;
      Brunswick targeting groups for which access to traditional services has been most&#xD;
      problematic: youth (18 to 25 years old), people living in rural areas and linguistic&#xD;
      minorities. The course is an 8-week week program based on principles of cognitive behaviour&#xD;
      therapy. It includes five online lessons, do-it-yourself exercises, case stories, and&#xD;
      additional resources on different topic such as sleep hygiene. Twenty young adults will be&#xD;
      recruited across New Brunswick among French-Canadian minority communities. Self-report&#xD;
      measures assessing anxiety and depression will be administered pre/post treatment and at a&#xD;
      3-month follow-up. It is expected that the course will help overcome barriers in help seeking&#xD;
      to improve the mental health of our communities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND. Anxiety and depression are highly prevalent mental health problems and chronic&#xD;
      conditions accounting for the highest proportion of mental disorders in Canada. Young adults&#xD;
      aged 15 to 24 are particularly vulnerable, this age group having the highest prevalence rates&#xD;
      reported during a 12-month period of anxiety (11.6%) and depression (7%) in Canada. Access to&#xD;
      evidence-based psychological treatments for anxiety and depression has been limited and&#xD;
      particularly problematic for linguistic minorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE STUDY. Self-administered internet-based cognitive-behavioural&#xD;
      therapy (iCBT) is a first-line therapy that could better meet the needs of young adults. Not&#xD;
      only could its delivery format provide increased access to French services in both urban and&#xD;
      rural areas, but it could also help young adults to overcome many of the barriers reported by&#xD;
      Canadians with unmet or partially met needs for counselling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An established iCBT shown to be effective for the treatment of anxiety and depression is the&#xD;
      Wellbeing program developed by Titov and colleagues. The Wellbeing Course presents a number&#xD;
      of advantages. It is a transdiagnostic program that allows the treatment of both anxiety and&#xD;
      depression, which makes it a cost-efficient treatment. More recent evidence suggests that no&#xD;
      direct clinical contact is required for gains to be significant and maintained over a&#xD;
      12-month follow-up. A version of the Wellbeing Course for young adults has been developed&#xD;
      called the Mood Mechanic Course. Data gathered so far support its efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of iCBT programs are only available in English, despite the fact that their&#xD;
      translation can be a highly cost-effective strategy. More recently, findings from a&#xD;
      feasibility study have supported the efficacy of a French-Canadian translation of the&#xD;
      Wellbeing Course among French-speaking minorities in New-Brunswick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES. To examine the feasibility and acceptability of a French-Canadian and&#xD;
      self-guided version of the Mood Mechanic Course on anxiety and depression among young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES. To assess the impact of the course on more specific symptoms of&#xD;
      anxiety, resilience and life satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES. It is expected that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will demonstrate a significant improvement from pre- to post-treatment on&#xD;
           primary outcome measures of anxiety and depression and secondary outcome measures of&#xD;
           life satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These improvements will be maintained during a three-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will report a high level of satisfaction with the course. No specific&#xD;
           hypothesis is formulated regarding the impact of the Mood Mechanic Course on resilience&#xD;
           as this component of the study is exploratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE: A sample of 20 young adults will be recruited in among the general population New&#xD;
      Brunswick using advertisements in various media as well as through a secure study website&#xD;
      administered by Accra Solutions Inc (www.etherapies.ca). A sample of 20 to 25 participants&#xD;
      has been recommended for feasibility or pilot studies when the aim is to demonstrate the&#xD;
      efficacy in a single group and when the effect sizes will probably be moderate or large.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION. The Mood Mechanic Course is comprised of 5 online lessons completed over an&#xD;
      8-week period. For each lesson, a &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; guide is included containing homework as&#xD;
      well as case stories and additional material on different topics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INVESTIGATION PLAN. Young adults interested in the project will apply online through the&#xD;
      website after reading a description of the project and filling out online questionnaires&#xD;
      evaluating the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. A consent form will be sent&#xD;
      electronically to applicants meeting the eligibility criteria. Entering their email address&#xD;
      and clicking &quot;I accept&quot; will be considered as informed consent. A copy of the consent form&#xD;
      will be sent to the participants through an encrypted email account created for the purpose&#xD;
      of the study. Additional measures will be completed online as part of the pretest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applicants not meeting the study criteria will be sent an email to thank them for their&#xD;
      interest in the study and will be provided a list of mental health resources. Applicants&#xD;
      showing severe depression or suicidal thoughts will be encouraged to contact their family&#xD;
      physician and will be sent a list of mental health resources as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within one statutory day, candidates meeting the study criteria will receive an email&#xD;
      informing them of their eligibility. Within five statutory days, participants will be&#xD;
      contacted by phone to review the study procedures and to answer any questions that they may&#xD;
      have. They will then be asked to provide contact information (i.e., name and phone number)&#xD;
      and an emergency contact (either their family physician or a family member or friend) to be&#xD;
      used only in the event that their state would significantly deteriorate. The outcome measures&#xD;
      will be administered online through the secure study website using the software Ninja&#xD;
      Forms.The lessons will be accessible through the secure study website using the Moodle&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STANDARDIZED EMAILS. No contact with a clinician will be provided, but weekly contact will be&#xD;
      maintained with the participants through standardized emails offering instructions, reminders&#xD;
      and support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY STUDY PROCEDURES. We are committed to the participants' safety. Safety measures will&#xD;
      be included at all stages of this study based on Titov's procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Selection: Just before applying to the study, it will be mentioned on the study&#xD;
      website that this research project does not offer crisis or emergency services. Emergency&#xD;
      contacts will be provided on the website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study: All applicants will be informed (verbally and in writing) about the steps&#xD;
      to take if they were to feel more distressed during the study, including contact details of&#xD;
      the researchers, the importance of contacting their family physician, and contact details of&#xD;
      emergency services. Applicants must also provide an emergency contact, be it their family&#xD;
      physician or a family or friend who we will contact if we are concerned about the immediate&#xD;
      state and safety of the participant (this is explained to the participants verbally, and in&#xD;
      the Consent Form).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants' mood and symptoms will be monitored at the beginning of each new lesson&#xD;
      using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 item-scale (GAD-7) and Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire-9 items (PHQ-9). If participants' scores increase by more than 5 points from&#xD;
      the pre-test and if the total score is ≥ 15 on the PHQ-9, they will receive an email&#xD;
      including resources that can be used in case of an emergency. If participants' scores at the&#xD;
      PHQ-9 is ≥ 23 or if they answer &quot;3&quot; on question 9 (suicidal ideation), the research director&#xD;
      will contact them on the same day that the score is received to assess their situation and&#xD;
      provide management. All adverse events will be promptly reported to the ethics committee of&#xD;
      the Université de Moncton.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A list of mental health resources will be offered to all participants who will chose to end&#xD;
      their participation during the study as well as at the end of the study. If participants&#xD;
      withdrawing from the study present, based on their questionnaires, a deterioration of their&#xD;
      state as described above, the same procedure will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 3-month follow-up, participants whose scores on the questionnaires indicate a clinical&#xD;
      level of depression (&gt;15 on the PHQ-9) or anxiety (&gt; 10 on the GAD-7), will receive an email&#xD;
      mentioning that if they wish to discuss their symptoms or other treatment options, we invite&#xD;
      them to communicate with the research coordinator, or to indicate when it would be a good&#xD;
      time for her to contact them. Otherwise we will encourage participants to communicate with&#xD;
      their family physician or the closest mental health center to receive the necessary help, if&#xD;
      it has not already been done. A mental health resource list will also be provided. If the&#xD;
      scores indicate a severe level of depression (≥ 23 on the PHQ-9 or if they answer &quot;3&quot; on&#xD;
      question 9), the same procedure as the one described above if such a situation were to happen&#xD;
      during treatment, will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RESULTS. Changes in outcomes and&#xD;
      maintenance of therapy gains will be evaluated using one-way repeated measures ANOVAs.&#xD;
      Missing data will be handled using the last observation carried forward (LOCF). Two indices&#xD;
      of clinical improvement will be estimated: remission and recovery rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA SAFETY. All data collected as part of this research will remain confidential except in&#xD;
      the case of a breach of confidentiality if a participant presented, for example, an immediate&#xD;
      risk of harm. Participants must create a username and password that will be used to complete&#xD;
      the online questionnaires. Standardized emails will be sent to participants from a encrypted&#xD;
      email account created by Accra Solutions Inc. for the purposes of the study. Only the name of&#xD;
      the participants will be included in these emails, to which they will have consented. To&#xD;
      maintain participants' privacy and confidentiality, they will not be able to use a username&#xD;
      that contains identifiable information (e.g., real name, address, city you live in). They&#xD;
      will be asked to create a username of four letter (four first letters of their mother or&#xD;
      father's name) and four numbers (day and month of their birthday). The participants will&#xD;
      generate a password. It will be specified to use a secure one made of 8 characters including&#xD;
      letters, numbers and a special character.Only researchers of the study, the system&#xD;
      administrator and Macquarie University will have access to the data as specified in the&#xD;
      consent form and as specified in the memorandum of understanding with Macquarie University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STORAGE AND ARCHIVING OF STUDY DOCUMENTS. The consent form and the identification form&#xD;
      including the contact information and password will be printed and kept in a locked filing&#xD;
      cabinet in the office of Professor France Talbot, research director. All electronic data will&#xD;
      be stored in a secure database within https://www.etherapies.ca. A data file will be created&#xD;
      in SPSS for all data and will be stored on a computer in the research director's research&#xD;
      laboratory, the Telepsychotherapy Unit. The names of the participants will not appear in this&#xD;
      file, only their password. As well, a password is required to access the files on this&#xD;
      computer. The data file will be saved on a USB key kept in a locked filing cabinet in the&#xD;
      Telepsychotherapy Unit. The information gathered during the study will be destroyed after 5&#xD;
      years. The data file will be kept seven years following the publication of the results, and&#xD;
      then destroyed.&#xD;
