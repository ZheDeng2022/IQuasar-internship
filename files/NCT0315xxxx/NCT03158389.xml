      The objective of N²M² is the improvement of overall survival of patients with glioblastoma&#xD;
      with an unmethylated MGMT promoter based on molecular characterization and use of targeted&#xD;
      compounds in a modern trial design. The progression-free survival rate at six months (PFS-6)&#xD;
      will be used to make decisions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advances in the understanding of glioblastoma at a molecular level along with technological&#xD;
      progress have led to the identification of key genetic alterations, not only in scientific&#xD;
      projects but also in every-day clinical practice. These alterations increasingly refine the&#xD;
      sub-classification of glioblastoma and the introduction of molecular markers in this&#xD;
      classification, which ultimately may allow defining subset specific treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present umbrella concept for multiple biomarker-driven subtrials anchors at the&#xD;
      Heidelberg-based INFORM registry trial in recurrent pediatric malignancies, where in analogy&#xD;
      to NCT Neuro Master Match (N²M²) whole-exome, low-coverage whole-genome and transcriptome&#xD;
      sequencing is used to identify targeted agents, single or in combinations according to a&#xD;
      dedicated algorithm. It also shares conceptual similarities with international projects&#xD;
      currently developed for lung and breast cancer. Finally, approaches to use molecular&#xD;
      information in glioblastoma for the definition of a therapy at progression are also planned&#xD;
      by the &quot;Defeat Glioma&quot; Consortium in the US and a group of excellence centers also in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The N²M² concept excels the aforementioned initiatives in the strict focus on newly diagnosed&#xD;
      patients, the option to cross-validate molecular biomarkers in an already analyzed&#xD;
      contemporary cohort of glioblastoma patients analyzed in the German Consortium for&#xD;
      Translational Cancer Research (DKTK) and the use of a parallel group treated with&#xD;
      standard-of-care (SOC). Further restriction is made by the inclusion of patients only with a&#xD;
      low likelihood to benefit from the SOC, temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy on the basis of&#xD;
      O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation, allowing to replace TMZ&#xD;
      with a molecularly targeted agent in combination with radiotherapy (RT) in each of the&#xD;
      experimental subtrials. Replacing TMZ by an experimental agent in the primary&#xD;
      chemo-radiotherapy has been done in at least four completed trials, albeit without&#xD;
      pre-selection of a targeted therapy but the more opportunistic use of an available drug with&#xD;
      no known MGMT interaction. Focusing on newly diagnosed patients not only harbors the greater&#xD;
      likelihood of impact on the disease, but also allows addressing questions on acquired&#xD;
      resistance in the more likely obtained tumor tissue at recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N²M² is formally divided into a DISCOVERY and a TREATMENT aspect. DISCOVERY starts with an&#xD;
      (epigenomewide) Illumina methylation array and a panel sequencing followed by an appropriate&#xD;
      and accepted standard method (Sanger Sequencing or Immunohistochemistry) within the scope of&#xD;
      these methods for target validation prior to any suggestion for patient allocation into one&#xD;
      of the subtrials. Suggestions for patients' allocation to one of the subtrials will be based&#xD;
      on results of accepted standard methods. These data will be generated from formaline-fixed&#xD;
      paraffine embedded (FFPE) tissue within in 2-3 weeks after surgery. The Heidelberg site has&#xD;
      already established the next generation gene panel sequencing (used for target discovery in&#xD;
      case of N²M²) and genome wide DNA methylation analyses for aiding daily routine. To meet the&#xD;
      criteria for a safe use of these data for decision-making the orthogonal, standard methods&#xD;
      performed in the Institute of Pathology are supplemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISCOVERY also includes the use of whole exome, low-coverage whole-genome, and transcriptome&#xD;
      sequencing, the methylome analysis, and gene expression arrays to find new, unexpected&#xD;
      targets and get a more comprehensive view on affected pathways. Discovery is also the driving&#xD;
      force behind the work on resistant tumors. The latter may result in individual treatment&#xD;
      decisions at recurrence, knowing there are no relevantly active treatments in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT is driven by a match/no match decision rendered in an algorithm that will be&#xD;
      subject to refinement in the process of the project, both by data generated in N²M², but also&#xD;
      external evidence; i.e. there may be some linear relations between an alteration, e.g. BRAF&#xD;
      V600E mutation and a distinct treatment or some others, but it is expected that these linear&#xD;
      relations will be replaced in a learning system by relations that take upstream and&#xD;
      downstream target alterations and also parallel signaling pathways into account and may&#xD;
      therefore already predict a certain likelihood of resistance development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In detail, FFPE tissue (and blood) from patients diagnosed with a glioblastoma harboring an&#xD;
      unmethylated MGMT promoter after informed consent will be subjected to a (epigenomewide)&#xD;
      methylation array and panel sequencing as well as the appropriate methods to validate any of&#xD;
      the trial immanent targets, if they are present, with results available within a maximum of 3&#xD;
      weeks postoperatively. This allows for a timely decision at the molecular Neurooncology Tumor&#xD;
      Board and a timely initiation (within 4 to 6 weeks) of the postoperative treatment. Further&#xD;
      examinations on fresh tumor tissue (and blood) such as whole exome, low-coverage whole genome&#xD;
      and transcriptome sequencing as well as expression arrays will be done to enhance the&#xD;
      scientific background on the tumor tissue. These data will not be used for decision-making,&#xD;
      Runs already done within the INFORM project with glioblastoma samples and also dry runs&#xD;
      (n=43) for the N²M² project support the feasibility of the timelines and principal options&#xD;
      for discovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Matching will be defined as a molecular situation, which makes treatment with RT and a&#xD;
      matching targeted drug from a prespecified warehouse separated in subtrials meaningful.&#xD;
      Patients will be informed about the identified treatment option within the &quot;matching&quot;&#xD;
      open-label, parallel group Phase I/IIa trial. As for 2 of the experimental compounds (APG101&#xD;
      and Atezolizumab) no specific biomarker is validated at the moment, the nonmatching patients&#xD;
      will be equally allocated to receive either APG101, Atezolizumab or the current SOC&#xD;
      (radiochemotherapy with TMZ, TMZ-group). Patients allocated to the TMZ-group will serve as a&#xD;
      meaningful control group with basic efficacy parameters documented, if consent has been&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of N²M² is the improvement of overall survival of patients with glioblastoma&#xD;
      with an unmethylated MGMT promoter based on molecular characterization and use of targeted&#xD;
      compounds in a modern trial design. The progression-free survival rate at six months (PFS-6)&#xD;
      will be used to make decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parallel and ongoing translational projects within the DKTK will examine prognostic&#xD;
      properties of the biomarkers identified to drive therapy decisions in this trial. Trial&#xD;
      accrual will be asymmetric into the different subtrials. It is expected that 75-100 patients&#xD;
      will be accrued into this trial per year at about 14 sites in Germany (mainly Deutsches&#xD;
      Konsortium für Translationale Krebsforschung, DKTK and Neuroonkologische Arbeitsgemeinschaft,&#xD;
      NOA). Importantly, the parallel SPECTAbrain initiative of the European Organization for the&#xD;
      Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) is synergistic and not competitive to our study&#xD;
      proposal since it is focused on the treatment at recurrence, using paraffin-embedded tissues,&#xD;
      panels/arrays only and it would be desirable that data from these initiatives are looked at&#xD;
      in a joined manner.&#xD;
