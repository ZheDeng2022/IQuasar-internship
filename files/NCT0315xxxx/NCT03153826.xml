  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent airway&#xD;
      obstruction and inflammatory response of the lungs and bronchi. Episodes of exacerbations&#xD;
      contribute to increase the severity and prognosis of the disease. Muscle dysfunction (loss of&#xD;
      strength and muscle mass) is one of comorbidities affecting 30% to 60% of patients and&#xD;
      playing a key role in their prognosis. Indeed, several studies have shown muscle weakness&#xD;
      during hospitalization for exacerbation of COPD by measure of maximal voluntary contraction&#xD;
      of quadriceps (MVCQ), but the results are variable from one patient to another. Moreover, no&#xD;
      study was interested in the change of muscle mass in patients hospitalized for an&#xD;
      exacerbation of COPD. Several mechanisms have been mentioned but not demonstrated: systemics&#xD;
      factors (initial amyotrophy, inflammation, oxidative stress, corticotherapy, hypoxia…) but&#xD;
      also physical inactivity. In this context, identifying factors associated with the onset of&#xD;
      muscle weakness during hospitalization for exacerbation of COPD is a necessary step to better&#xD;
      understand the mechanisms and consider a personalized therapeutic approach that can improve&#xD;
      the functional and clinical prognosis of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is to identify the clinical and biological determinants associated with&#xD;
      the onset of amyotrophy (Measure by ultrasound of sectional area of the Rectus Femoris,&#xD;
      CSARF), during hospitalization for exacerbation of COPD. The secondary outcome is to identify&#xD;
      the clinical and biological determinants associated with the onset of MVCQ decrease, during&#xD;
      hospitalization for exacerbation of COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      120 patients hospitalized for exacerbation of COPD will be recruited in two hospitals (CHU&#xD;
      Montpellier - CHU Grenoble, FRANCE). The measures of CSARF and MVCQ are carried out on the&#xD;
      second, fifth, eighth day of hospitalization, on discharge and on the sixtieth day after&#xD;
      hospitalization. A blood test will be performed on the second day of hospitalization to&#xD;
      explore different markers of inflammation and oxydative stress. Moreover, to quantify the&#xD;
      level of physical activity (number of steps), each patient will carry a pedometer throughout&#xD;
      the duration of hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of protocol, two groups will be made from the median of CSARF : patients with a&#xD;
      small reduction in CSARF compared to patients with a greater reduction in SSRF between the&#xD;
      second and eighth days of hospitalization (or between the second day of hospitalization and&#xD;
      discharge). Then clinical (comorbidities, severity disease, initial weakness, initial&#xD;
      amyotrophy, usual physical activity before hospitalization, treatment, exacerbation number in&#xD;
      the previous year…) and biological (markers of inflammation and oxydative stress)&#xD;
      determinants were compared between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the identification of the determinants associated with the onset of amyotrophy induced&#xD;
      during exacerbation of COPD will guide research for exploration of physiopathological&#xD;
      mechanisms of this muscular dysfunction in the exacerbation of COPD as well as to identify a&#xD;
      personalized support.&#xD;
