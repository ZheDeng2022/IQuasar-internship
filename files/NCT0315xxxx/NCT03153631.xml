      In Egypt, cancer breast is one of the commonest cancers among females representing&#xD;
      38.8%.cancer breast among females ranked the top with a high frequency in lower, middle,&#xD;
      upper Egypt (33.8%,26.8%,38.7% resp.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who developed breast cancer were more amenable than women who remained free of breast&#xD;
      carcinoma to experience reduced physical function, vitality, social function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Difficulties related to sexuality and sexual functioning were common and occurred soon after&#xD;
      surgical and adjuvant treatment. addressing these problems is essential to improve the&#xD;
      quality of life of young women with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sexuality is a basic and important domain of human experience that can be damaged during and&#xD;
      following cancer treatment. The risk of sexual dysfunction is even of greater importance&#xD;
      among young cancer patients and survivors, with young breast cancer patients at particularly&#xD;
      high risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cancer breast patients, various factors can induce sexual dysfunction. Some of these&#xD;
      factors; hormonal alterations induced by chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or physiological and&#xD;
      functional disturbances are related to the deterioration of physical condition. These factors&#xD;
      are strictly clinical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other factors which induce disturbances in sexual behavior, such as anxious\ depressive&#xD;
      reactions in adapting to illness and treatment and cancerophobic reactions and loss of self&#xD;
      esteem that accompany any illness are more psychological\ psychiatric in nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having sexual problems (or dysfunction) includes experiencing disturbances in sexual desire&#xD;
      and physiological changes associated with loss of sexual desire and arousal, reduction in&#xD;
      sexual pleasure, difficulty achieving orgasm, anxiety about sexual performance and pain&#xD;
      during intercourse.&#xD;
