  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This survey intends to collect information on key aspects of life with epidermolysis bullosa&#xD;
      (EB), including diagnostic journey, treatment, management, daily living challenges, and&#xD;
      overall psycho-social, socio-economic, academic and family impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand the unmet needs for people living with EB in the US&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the differences/similarities in the management/treatment of EB patients&#xD;
           (including wound care, symptom management and other issues)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the EB patients' and caregivers' perceptions of current management/treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the challenges and the burden of daily living with EB&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand EB diagnostic journey (the time to diagnosis and by what type of&#xD;
           healthcare provider)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify professional disciplines involved in the diagnosis and management of EB&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand the psycho-social, socio-economic, academic, and family impact of EB&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a rare, often severe genetic disorder characterized by&#xD;
      mechanical fragility and blistering or erosion of the skin, mucosa, or epithelial lining of&#xD;
      other organs, in response to little or no apparent trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EB is chronic, potentially disfiguring, and in some cases fatal. Patients with EB have&#xD;
      painful wounds and blisters that can lead to infection and scarring. There are many genetic&#xD;
      and symptomatic variations of EB, but all forms share the common symptom of fragile skin that&#xD;
      blisters and tears, sometimes from the slightest friction or trauma. There is currently no&#xD;
      approved treatment for EB. Current standard of care consists of pain management and the&#xD;
      bandaging and cleaning of open wounds to prevent infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there are a number of publications/guidance/consensus statements related to the&#xD;
      diagnosis and management of EB from the point of view of the health-care provider/disease&#xD;
      expert, there is a need for more research to define the key aspects of life with EB (i.e.&#xD;
      diagnostic journey, treatment, management, daily living challenges, and overall disease&#xD;
      burden) from the perspective of the patient.&#xD;
