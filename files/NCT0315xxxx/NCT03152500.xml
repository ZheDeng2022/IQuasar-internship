      In this study the investigators will investigate the stability of lens position and the&#xD;
      visual outcome after implantation of the new FEMTIS-IOL using FLACS capsulotomy compared to&#xD;
      conventional placement of the IOL in the capsular bag. So far, there are no published studies&#xD;
      using the FEMTIS-IOL. Therefore, the investigators will perform this randomized control&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

      Cataract is a clouding of the crystalline lens which causes vision loss and blindness if&#xD;
      untreated. Cataract surgery is the most frequently performed surgical intervention in&#xD;
      medicine with an incidence of 880 surgeries per 100.000 population in 2010 amounting to a&#xD;
      total number of over 160.000 surgeries per year in the Netherlands.1,3 The number of&#xD;
      individuals with cataracts is predicted to reach 30 million by the year 2020.2 Due to aging&#xD;
      of the general population this number of cataracts will only grow in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the last decade conventional phacoemulsification cataract surgery (CPCS) is the dominant&#xD;
      form of cataract surgery in developed countries, accounting for over 90 percent of these&#xD;
      procedures.4 The basic phacoemulsification procedure has remained largely unchanged over the&#xD;
      past 20 years, including a series of steps: creating corneal incision, capsulorhexis and&#xD;
      lensfragmentation.4 Although highly successful, each of the steps mentioned above are created&#xD;
      manually which affects the safety and effectiveness of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the first human eye was treated by femtosecond laser cataract surgery in 2008, the&#xD;
      femtosecond-laser assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) became an innovative growing new&#xD;
      technology in the world of cataract surgery.4-7 Femtosecond-lasers are capable of performing&#xD;
      some of the most delicate and essential key steps during cataract surgery: capsulotomy, lens&#xD;
      fragmentation, and corneal incisions. 'Automating' these steps and performing them with&#xD;
      increased precision could lead to an improved quality of capsulotomy, easier lens&#xD;
      fragmentation, and more precisely positioned corneal incisions, which in turn, lead to&#xD;
      improved visual and refractive outcomes, a decrease in intra- and postoperative complication&#xD;
      rates, and increased quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to remove the crystallized human lens, a circular opening in the capsular lens bag,&#xD;
      capsulotomy, needs to be created. After removing the lens an intraocular lens (IOL) can be&#xD;
      inserted in the empty capsule bag. However, one of the factors affecting postoperative&#xD;
      achieved visual acuity and refraction, is the behaviour of this IOL in the capsular bag.&#xD;
      Preoperative measurements need to be obtained in order to calculate the required IOL. One of&#xD;
      the challenges of these IOL calculations is determining exactly where in the eye the IOL will&#xD;
      end up, the effective lens position (ELP). The position of the IOL is crucial for the IOL's&#xD;
      general performance because it influences the postoperative IOL tilt, decentration, and&#xD;
      posterior capsule opacification (PCO). Considering the anatomical variety between patients,&#xD;
      the predictability of an individual's ELP remains an educated guess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ELP, and therefore the amount of IOL tilt, decentration and PCO, of an IOL is mainly&#xD;
      influenced by the interaction between the IOL and the lens capsule, especially during the&#xD;
      time of capsule shrinkage. Theoretically, the positive optical effect of an IOL is lost when&#xD;
      there is more than 7 degrees of tilt or more than 0.4 mm of decentration.8 Furthermore,&#xD;
      studies have shown the effect of axial displacement of an IOL on refractive error. There is&#xD;
      approximately 1.25 D change per millimetre of the IOL's longitudinal displacement.9 This&#xD;
      reflects the importance of a stable and predictable ELP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned above, the anatomy of an individual's eye is unique and therefore, each ELP will&#xD;
      be different when placing the IOL in the capsular bag. Therefore, a new lens type has been&#xD;
      developed: the FEMTIS® FB-313 laser lens (FEMTIS-IOL, Oculentis). This IOL has a special&#xD;
      haptic system and is designed to be clasped in the capsular bag opening and therefore, the&#xD;
      ELP of this IOL is theoretically more stable and predictable, resulting in a higher&#xD;
      predictability of refractive and visual outcomes. However, in order to provide as much&#xD;
      stability as possible a (nearly) perfect capsulotomy is needed. Several comparative studies&#xD;
      have shown that femtosecond-lasers produce a more precise, circular, reproducible, and better&#xD;
      centered capsulotomy compared to conventional manual capsulorhexis.6-7 The combination&#xD;
      between the femtosecond-assisted capsulotomy and the implantation of a FEMTIS-IOL in the&#xD;
      capsular opening, could definitely contribute to the search of perfection in cataract&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will investigate the stability of lens position and the&#xD;
      visual outcome after implantation of the new FEMTIS-IOL using FLACS capsulotomy compared to&#xD;
      conventional placement of the IOL in the capsular bag. So far, there are no published studies&#xD;
      using the FEMTIS-IOL. Therefore, the investigators will perform this randomized control&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
