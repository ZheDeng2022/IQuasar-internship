    <textblock>
      This study will compare examine autonomic and cardiovascular responses to peak exercise&#xD;
      testing in Parkinson's disease patients in varying stages of the disease, and healthy,&#xD;
      age-matched participants. Participants will be asked to complete a peak exercise test on a&#xD;
      motorized treadmill. Heart rate, blood pressure, norepinephrine, and other markers for&#xD;
      cardiovascular function will be assessed at rest, during exercise, and post-exercise. The&#xD;
      hypothesis to be tested is that Parkinson's disease patients will exhibit a decreased&#xD;
      autonomic and cardiovascular response to exercise when compared to patients' healthy&#xD;
      age-matched counterparts. The investigators secondary hypothesis is that Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      patients in more advanced stages will exhibit a greater decrease in response when compared to&#xD;
      these patients' Stage 1 counterparts, or healthy age-matched counterparts.&#xD;

      This study will require the PD subjects to attend three testing days, lasting approximately 1&#xD;
      hour. PD subjects will report for two exercise testing sessions, with each session separated&#xD;
      by 7 days. The age-matched, healthy subjects will only be required to attend two testing days&#xD;
      consisting of one day for paperwork and anthropometric measurements, and one day for exercise&#xD;
      testing, each lasting approximately 1 hour. PD subjects will be randomly assigned, in a&#xD;
      counterbalanced manner, to either an &quot;on-medication&quot; or &quot;off-medication&quot; group for days two&#xD;
      and three of testing. All subjects with PD will complete both exercise testing days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1: The subject will read and sign the informed and audio-visual consent forms and&#xD;
      complete a health questionnaire, PAR-Q, and mini-mental survey. The subject will also&#xD;
      complete the ACSM risk stratification screening questionnaire. Anthropometric measures will&#xD;
      be taken to include, waist circumference, height, and weight. The subject will then be&#xD;
      introduced to various test procedures which will be utilized throughout the experiment. Each&#xD;
      subject will be familiarized with the treadmill and harness support system. The harness&#xD;
      support system will be emplaced to ensure the safety of the PD patients due to the inherent&#xD;
      fall risk associated with a progressive decline in motor control often seen in this&#xD;
      population. The subject will walk on the treadmill at gradually increasing speeds until he or&#xD;
      she indicates, by a prearranged signal, that a comfortable walking speed has been attained.&#xD;
      Then the treadmill grade will be raised 2% every 30 seconds so the subject can feel what it&#xD;
      is like to walk during a progressive test. This will last no longer than five minutes. PD&#xD;
      subjects will also be given instruction as to which group (on, or off-medication) they have&#xD;
      been assigned to, and how to prepare for the follow-on tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Off-Medication Testing Day: Subjects will complete a blood draw and a motorized treadmill&#xD;
      VO2peak¬ test. Subjects are expected to arrive fasted (no food or drink for the past 12&#xD;
      hours) and having refrained from antiparkinsonian medication(s) for the past 24 hours. The&#xD;
      subject will first be seated and given a 5 minute rest period. Following this rest period the&#xD;
      phlebotomist will insert a catheter into the median cephalic vein in the antecubital (bend in&#xD;
      the arm) region on the subject's arm. One vial (3 cc) of venous blood will be drawn prior to&#xD;
      exercise testing and an identical draw will take place immediately following exercise&#xD;
      testing. All blood specimens will be tested and analyzed at the University of Miami Miller&#xD;
      School of Medicine. Then subject will then be allowed to eat a predetermined meal at the lab&#xD;
      before returning to exercise. Following the meal, the subject will be asked to return to a&#xD;
      seated resting position for an additional 5 minute period. During this time, gel electrodes&#xD;
      will be applied on the subject for the purposes of ECG and heart/blood flow monitoring and&#xD;
      measurements. Following this rest period, blood flow will be measured for an additional 5&#xD;
      minutes while the subject remains quietly seated. Next, the subject will be attached to the&#xD;
      harness support system for the treadmill exercise test. For the metabolic assessment portion&#xD;
      of the test, the subject will be fitted with a mask covering the nose and mouth, in which an&#xD;
      airflow sensor will be attached to measure gas content during respirations. The test will&#xD;
      start with a 4 minute warm-up at a speed dictated by the subject. By the end of the warm up,&#xD;
      the subject will have reached a speed that both they and instructor agree upon which meets&#xD;
      the requirements for moderate-intensity exercise. The speed will no longer be adjusted at&#xD;
      this point. Percent grade will start at 2.5 percent and will be increased by 2.5 percent&#xD;
      every 3 minutes until the subject has met the criterion for a peak exercise test, or has&#xD;
      requested to stop. BP and HR will be monitored every minute of testing using an automatic&#xD;
      electronic BP assessment machine (BPTRU, Coquitlam, BC), manual sphygmomanometer and&#xD;
      stethoscope, and electronic ECG software (Cardiosoft, GE Healthcare), respectively.&#xD;
      Successful completion of the test will be determined using the following criteria from the&#xD;
      American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM): (1) plateau in VO2, (2) maximal HR within 10&#xD;
      beats per minute of an age predicted maximum, (3) a respiratory exchange ratio of &gt;1.15, (4)&#xD;
      respirations &gt; 50 breaths per minute, (5) a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) ≥ 18. In&#xD;
      addition to these criteria we will use ACSM indications for termination of an exercise test&#xD;
      which include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absolute Indications&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Suspicion of a myocardial infarction or acute myocardial infarction (heart attack)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Onset of moderate-to-severe angina (chest pain)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Signs of poor perfusion (circulation or blood flow), including pallor (pale appearance&#xD;
           to the skin), cyanosis (bluish discoloration), or cold and clammy skin&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Severe or unusual shortness of breath&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Central Nervous System (CNS) symptoms e.g., ataxia (failure of muscular coordination),&#xD;
           vertigo (an illusion of dizzying movement), visual or gait (pattern of walking or&#xD;
           running) problems, confusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Technical inability to monitor the ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patient's request (to stop) Relative Indications&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Any chest pain that is increasing 2. Physical or verbal manifestations of shortness of&#xD;
      breath or severe fatigue 3. Wheezing 4. Leg cramps or intermittent claudication (grade 3 on a&#xD;
      4-point scale) 5. Hypertensive response (SBP &gt;260 mm Hg; DBP&gt;115 mm Hg) 6. Pronounced ECG&#xD;
      changes from baseline (&gt;2 mm of horizontal or down sloping ST- segment depression, or &gt;2 mm&#xD;
      of ST-segment elevation (except in aVR) 7. Exercise-induced bundle branch block that cannot&#xD;
      be distinguished from ventricular tachycardia 8. Less serious arrhythmias (abnormal heart&#xD;
      rhythms) such as supraventricular tachycardia On-Medication Testing Day: Procedures for the&#xD;
      on-medication day will be identical to those used for the off-medication day testing. Each&#xD;
      day, following the completion of exercise testing, subjects will be required to remain under&#xD;
      lab personnel supervision until HR returns to within 10 beats of resting, and systolic BP&#xD;
      returns to within 20 mmHg of resting. HR recovery will be measured continuously following&#xD;
      exercise to determine how quickly it returns to baseline. This is a useful measure in&#xD;
      determining autonomic function and the progression of PD symptoms.&#xD;
