    <textblock>
      Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) have reduced functional capacity due to clinical&#xD;
      symptoms of the disease, resulting in decreased participation in daily living activities and&#xD;
      reduced quality of life. Evaluation of functional capacity and activities of daily living is&#xD;
      very important in order to determine appropriate rehabilitation programs and increase the&#xD;
      participation of patients in daily life activities. However, although there are many scales&#xD;
      evaluating functional capacity and activities of daily living in people with disabilities,&#xD;
      there is no specific assessment scale specific to MS patients. Therefore, this study was&#xD;
      planned to investigate whether the Glittre Daily Living Activities (ADL) Test, which was&#xD;
      developed to measure functional capacity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a valid&#xD;
      and reliable measurement tool in MS patients. For this purpose, a total of 51 participants&#xD;
      (25 MS patients and 26 healthy participants) evaluated with Glittre ADL Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between Glittre ADL Test and 6-minute walk test, Notthingham Extended Daily&#xD;
      Living Activities Index, Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale,&#xD;
      Balance Assessment Systems Test (MiniBEST Test), Extended Disability Status Scale and&#xD;
      5-repetition sit-to-stand test evaluated with Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient.&#xD;
      For the known group validity, the difference between the patient and control groups compared&#xD;
      with the test of the difference between the two means. For reliability, test retest&#xD;
      performed. Reliability evaluated with the intraclass correlation coefficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Glittre ADL Test results in MS patients and healthy subjects are different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Glittre ADL Test is reliable in MS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Glittre ADL Test is valid for evaluating functional exercise capacity in MS&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory disease characterized by demyelination,&#xD;
      myelin damage, axonal loss and gliosis in the Central Nervous System (CNS). MS symptoms vary&#xD;
      according to the size of the lesion and its location in the CNS. Clinical symptoms are&#xD;
      generally: spasticity, fatigue, muscle weakness, tremor, pain, sensory disturbances, bladder&#xD;
      bowel problems, cognitive disorders, depression and sleep disorders. With the progression of&#xD;
      the disease, the performance in daily living activities gradually decreases, affecting the&#xD;
      quality of life negatively. Maintaining aerobic capacity in chronic diseases such as MS is&#xD;
      very important for independence in daily living activities. Functional exercise capacity of&#xD;
      MS patients decreases with the effect of symptoms and sedentary lifestyle. The decrease in&#xD;
      aerobic capacity can manifest itself with a decrease in walking distance or speed, or a&#xD;
      limitation in daily living activities. Decline in aerobic capacity is also associated with&#xD;
      many factors such as increased risk of cardiovascular disease, decreased cognitive functions&#xD;
      and health-related quality of life. Therefore, aerobic capacity measurement is one of the&#xD;
      important physiological measurements in terms of evaluating the existing functional status of&#xD;
      individuals and preparing rehabilitation programs appropriately for individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPET) are accepted as the gold standard in the evaluation of&#xD;
      aerobic capacity. These measurements have some limitations that limit their use, such as the&#xD;
      high cost of equipment and the need for a well trained team. Today, submaximal tests,&#xD;
      questionnaires or scales are widely used as an alternative to CPET in evaluating functional&#xD;
      exercise capacity. Since most daily life activities are at the submaximal level, submaximal&#xD;
      tests can better determine the functional levels of individuals in daily living activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate functional capacity in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),&#xD;
      activities similar to daily life activities were selected and the Glittre Daily Living&#xD;
      Activities (ADL) Test was developed. It has been shown that the Glittre ADL Test is reliable&#xD;
      and valid in evaluating functional exercise capacity in COPD, as well as reflecting the&#xD;
      performance in daily living activities for this disease group. The activities in the Glittre&#xD;
      ADL Test are those that require the use of both the lower and upper extremities. An important&#xD;
      advantage of the test is that the test can reflect functional capacity as well as providing&#xD;
      information about performance in daily life activities and that the use of all extremities&#xD;
      can be observed during the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the reliability and validity of the Glittre ADL Test in MS patients was&#xD;
      investigated. For the criterion validity of the Glittre ADL Test, the correlation with the&#xD;
      6-minute walk test (6MWT) was examined. Patient and control groups were compared for known&#xD;
      group validity. Test-retest method was used to determine the reliability of Glittre ADL Test.&#xD;
      Intra-observer reliability was evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The&#xD;
      relationship between Glittre ADL Test scores and lower extremity muscle strength, limitation&#xD;
      of daily living activities, balance, quality of life, fatigue and disease severity was&#xD;
      investigated. Correlations between the time to complete the Glittre ADL Test and the 5&#xD;
      Repetition Sit To Stand Test completion time, Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living&#xD;
      Scale, Mini Balance Evulation Systems Test, Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 scale,&#xD;
      Fatigue Severity Scale and Expanded Disability Status Scale scores were examined.&#xD;
