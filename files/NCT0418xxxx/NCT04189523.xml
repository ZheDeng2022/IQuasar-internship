  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Administration of ultrasound guided peripheral nerve blocks is a procedural skill set that&#xD;
      falls within the scope of Emergency Medicine practice. Extrapolating evidence from Anesthesia&#xD;
      and Orthopedic literature (which shows decreased post-operative opioid use by surgical&#xD;
      patients who receive regional anesthesia as part of their pre and perioperative pain&#xD;
      management strategy) the investigators believe that early administration of regional&#xD;
      anesthesia for long bone fractures by providers in the ED may have an as of yet unidentified&#xD;
      positive impact on long term opioid use. If this is indeed found to be the case, early&#xD;
      administration of regional anesthesia for extremity fractures would represent an area of&#xD;
      focus for ED providers in the national effort by the medical community to combat opioid&#xD;
      abuse.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a small prospective non-randomized interventional pilot study&#xD;
      to assess feasibility of a future full scale RCT to test the hypotheses. Interventional study&#xD;
      subjects will be compared to controls enrolled simultaneously during the study period who&#xD;
      meet the inclusion criteria and do not have documentation of one of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll subjects 2 controls to 1 intervention to ensure the ability to&#xD;
      select controls as similar to the intervention population as possible. The study is powered&#xD;
      for an alpha of 0.9 and an effect size (standardized difference) of 0.2. The total subjects&#xD;
      needed to enroll is 36 with 18 subjects in each arm of the study. However, in an attempt to&#xD;
      obtain controls as closely matched to our intervention group as possible 36 controls will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Subject Selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention subjects will be enrolled as a convenience sample when physicians participating&#xD;
      in the study are available in the ED. Controls will be enrolled when no study participating&#xD;
      physicians are available in the ED. Potential subjects will be selected for enrollment by&#xD;
      research team members directly from the trauma bay or from the tracking board when they are&#xD;
      identified as having a qualifying fracture. They will be screened for exclusion and inclusion&#xD;
      criteria by the research assistants. The goal will be to enroll patients within 2 hours of&#xD;
      arrival in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  presentation to the emergency department with isolated fractures of the hip or proximal&#xD;
           femur, mid or distal humerus, radius, or ulna&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  poly-trauma patients with one of the previously listed fractures who do not meet&#xD;
           exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergy to upivacaine/ropivicaine or other amide anesthetics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evidence of compartment syndrome on exam by physician&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  infection over injection site&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  previously documented opioid abuse or dependence in the last year as documented in the&#xD;
           EMR or self-reported by the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  current documented opioid prescription in the EMR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient is intubated or unable to provide consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  poly-trauma patients with abdominal, thoracic or neurologic injury requiring operative&#xD;
           intervention at the time of presentation to the ED&#xD;
&#xD;
           3a. Consent: If the patient qualifies for study inclusion a research assistant will&#xD;
           obtain patient written consent to: receive a nerve block placed by a trained physician&#xD;
           participating in the study, allow for access of their medical record for purposes of&#xD;
           data collection for the study and collect patient contact information for follow up&#xD;
           communication related to the study after discharge. The patient will be informed that&#xD;
           should they complete all the follow up information as part of this study they will&#xD;
           receive a monetary incentive for participation in person at their final follow up, 30&#xD;
           days after the nerve block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After patients are consented either a supraclavicular brachial plexus block or fascia iliaca&#xD;
      nerve block (determined by site of injury) will be performed by an ultrasound trained faculty&#xD;
      member, ultrasound fellow or resident who has undergone specific training to perform the&#xD;
      blocks included in this study. The research team will be given a list of physicians qualified&#xD;
      to perform the selected blocks for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to administering a nerve block to an enrolled patient a complete neurovascular exam&#xD;
      will be performed and documented on a paper form that will be kept in the patient's chart for&#xD;
      review by orthopedic surgery and/or trauma surgery if needed while the patient is admitted.&#xD;
      Any questionable exam findings will be discussed in conjunction with orthopedic surgery&#xD;
      and/or trauma surgery prior to block administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. b. Supraclavicular block Investigators will follow the techniques outlined by Gamo et al&#xD;
           and NYSORA (New York School of Regional Anesthesia) for placement of supraclavicular&#xD;
           blocks [9,21]. Patients will be placed in the supine position on a stretcher, with their&#xD;
           arms by their sides and head rotated to the side opposite to that of their injury, at an&#xD;
           angle of 45Â° from the midline. There will be continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry&#xD;
           monitoring throughout the procedure. Towels may be placed under the shoulder on the side&#xD;
           of the injection to improve neck exposure for block placement. The neck will be prepped&#xD;
           with Chlorhexidine antiseptic and sterile technique will be utilized during block&#xD;
           placement. Blocks will be performed under ultrasound guidance using a high frequency&#xD;
           linear probe on a Zonare machine with a sterile probe cover. The ultrasound probe will&#xD;
           be positioned behind the clavicle in the supraclavicular fossa and pointed&#xD;
           inferior-medially. The subclavian artery will be identified in the short axis by its&#xD;
           rounded shape and pulsatility. The brachial plexus in this location will be identified&#xD;
           by its proximity to the subclavian artery as it typically lies superficial and&#xD;
           posterior-lateral to this vessel. Once the plexus is identified a clip of the plexus&#xD;
           will be saved and uploaded to QPath for documentation. A local skin wheal of 0.5%&#xD;
           bupivacaine will be made with a 27-guage needle 2 cm lateral to the US probe at the site&#xD;
           of entry for the nerve block. An 'in-plane' technique will be used for visualizing the&#xD;
           needle for block placement. A 20 or 22-gauge non-cutting needle will be introduced from&#xD;
           lateral to medial and placed in-line with and parallel to the probe. The needle will&#xD;
           inserted deep between the subclavian artery and the first rib, inferior to the brachial&#xD;
           plexus; subsequently, 2 ml to 3 ml of 0.5% Bupivacaine will be injected very carefully&#xD;
           to avoid accidental intravascular injection. The needle will be redirected from deep to&#xD;
           intermediate and superficial levels in order to allow maximum spread of local anesthetic&#xD;
           around the nerve bundle. By the end of the procedure, a total of 20 ml to 25 ml of 0.5%&#xD;
           bupivacaine local anesthetic will be injected. A second clip will be saved on the Zonare&#xD;
           and uploaded to QPath after completing the block to demonstrate the area of anesthetic&#xD;
           introduced. Following block application patient will receive care for their injury as&#xD;
           determined by their EM physician while in the ED and/or their admitting physician if&#xD;
           admitted to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. b. Fascia Iliaca block Investigators will follow the techniques outlined by Beaudoin et&#xD;
           al and NYSORA for placement of Fascia Iliaca blocks [13, 22]. There will be continuous&#xD;
           cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring throughout the procedure. Patient will be&#xD;
           positioned supine on a stretcher in slight trendelenberg. Blocks will be performed under&#xD;
           ultrasound guidance using a high frequency linear probe on a Zonare machine with a&#xD;
           sterile probe cover. The inguinal region on the corresponding side of injury will be&#xD;
           prepped with Chlorhexidine antiseptic and sterile technique will be utilized during&#xD;
           block placement. The US probe will be placed 1 cm distal to the inguinal ligament on the&#xD;
           side of the injured lower extremity to identify the femoral vessels and the nerve in&#xD;
           cross section. The nerve will be identified as an isolated hyperechoic structure&#xD;
           approximately 1 cm lateral to the pulsatile femoral artery. A clip of the identified&#xD;
           nerve will be saved and uploaded to QPath for documentation. A local skin wheal of 0.5%&#xD;
           bupivacaine will be made with a 27-guage needle 2 cm lateral to the US probe at the site&#xD;
           of entry for the nerve block. At the skin wheal site, a 20 or 22-gauge noncutting spinal&#xD;
           needle will be introduced at a 45Â° angle in-plane to the US probe and 20-25 mL of 0.5%&#xD;
           bupivacaine will injected along the nerve sheath. The needle will be directly visualized&#xD;
           throughout the procedure to ensure there is no vascular puncture and that spread of 0.5%&#xD;
           Bupivacaine is administered in the correct fascial plane. A second clip will be saved on&#xD;
           the Zonare and uploaded to QPath after completing the block to demonstrate the area of&#xD;
           anesthetic introduced. Following block application patient will receive care for their&#xD;
           injury as determined by their EM physician while in the ED and/or their admitting&#xD;
           physician if admitted to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. b. Procedure Risks The possible risks associated with placement of nerve blocks while&#xD;
           low in incidence, include possible risk of injury to vascular or nerve structures or&#xD;
           accidental intravascular deposition of anesthetic [8,9,13,21,22]. Additional risk with&#xD;
           the supraclavicular block includes a slight chance for pneumothorax. By placing these&#xD;
           nerve blocks with ultrasound guidance it significantly reduces the risk of the&#xD;
           aforementioned complications as the needle tip location is constantly visualized on&#xD;
           screen [8,21,22]. This including decreasing the risk for pneumothorax with the&#xD;
           supraclavicular block as the lung pleura and needle tip can be continuously visualized&#xD;
           by ultrasound and thus help avoid accidental puncture [8,9,21]. Additionally,&#xD;
           investigators will utilize non-cutting spinal needles for this study as this measure has&#xD;
           been noted in previous nerve block studies to reduce the risk of accidental venous or&#xD;
           arterial puncture and lessens the chance of injury to the epineurium of nerve bundles&#xD;
           [9,13,21,22]. There is always the risk of allergy to bupivacaine though this is rare.&#xD;
           Investigators will attempt to avoid allergic reactions by patients undergoing blocks by&#xD;
           screening for allergy to amide anesthetics (the family of drugs that Bupivacaine belongs&#xD;
           to) at time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Subject Follow Up&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. c. First 24hrs All study patients will have a reported pain score assessed using a&#xD;
           validated pain score tool (VAS) by the research team once prior to leaving the ED. A&#xD;
           research assistant will obtain a patient reported pain score at 24hrs after block&#xD;
           application. While patient is admitted their utilized opioid pain medications will be&#xD;
           tracked in the EMR and their daily MME usage will be calculated and recorded. The&#xD;
           investigators will evaluate patient opioid usage by calculating Morphine Milligram&#xD;
           Equivalents using CMS guidelines for conversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. c. Follow up at 1 week At 7 days after block placement patients will be contacted by&#xD;
           phone by the research team or in person if they are still hospitalized. Assistants will&#xD;
           ask patients to report a pain score for their injury, any new injuries requiring opioid&#xD;
           pain medication since discharge, and current opioid usage via prescribed narcotics or&#xD;
           illicit drug use. The patient will be asked to report a pill count of their current&#xD;
           opioid prescription (if any). Pharmacy reported prescriptions will be pulled for each&#xD;
           patient at 7 days after initial block placement using the &quot;External Rx History&quot; tab&#xD;
           under power orders in the EMR. The investigators will evaluate patient opioid usage by&#xD;
           calculating Morphine Milligram Equivalents using CMS guidelines for conversion. At that&#xD;
           time subjects who received a nerve will also be asked questions regarding their&#xD;
           satisfaction with their pain control and care after receiving the nerve blocks. Subjects&#xD;
           who did not receive a nerve block will be asked the same questions about satisfaction&#xD;
           with pain control and will be asked about satisfaction with their care. All subjects&#xD;
           will be asked if they have scheduled any doctor's appointments or presented to an urgent&#xD;
           care or emergency department for the sole purpose of obtaining care for pain control for&#xD;
           their injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. c. Final follow up at 30 days At 30 days after block placement patients will be&#xD;
           contacted by phone for a final survey by the research team. If subjects are still&#xD;
           hospitalized they will be assessed by a research assistant in the hospital. Assistants&#xD;
           will ask patients to report a pain score for their injury, any new injuries requiring&#xD;
           opioid pain medication since discharge, and current opioid usage via prescribed&#xD;
           narcotics or illicit drug use. The patient will be asked to report a pill count of their&#xD;
           current opioid prescription (if any). Pharmacy reported prescriptions will be pulled for&#xD;
           each patient at 30 days after initial block placement using the &quot;External Rx History&quot;&#xD;
           tab under power orders in the EMR. Investigators will evaluate patient opioid usage by&#xD;
           calculating Morphine Milligram Equivalents using CMS guidelines for conversion. At that&#xD;
           time subjects who received a nerve will also be asked questions regarding their&#xD;
           satisfaction with their pain control and care after receiving the nerve blocks. Subjects&#xD;
           who did not receive a nerve block will be asked the same questions about satisfaction&#xD;
           with pain control and will be asked about satisfaction with their care. All subjects&#xD;
           will be asked if they have scheduled any doctor's appointments or presented to an urgent&#xD;
           care or emergency department for the sole purpose of obtaining care for pain control for&#xD;
           their injury. At the time of this final follow up participating patients will receive an&#xD;
           incentive gift card for participation. Transportation to this final follow up visit will&#xD;
           be arranged and paid for by the research department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Data Collection and Interpretation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on each subject will be collected by research assistants and stored in a secure,&#xD;
      de-identified REDCap database/spreadsheet. Data points collected will include: age, sex,&#xD;
      fracture type, history of opioid abuse or opioid prescription, history if IV drug use, type&#xD;
      of nerve block administered, and location of block placement. At follow up points data will&#xD;
      be collected on patient reported pain scores using the VAS scoring system. Self reported&#xD;
      opioid use, pill counts and reported healthcare visits for pain from initial injury will be&#xD;
      recorded and stored. Data will be collected at follow ups on patient satisfaction using&#xD;
      surveys that have Likert scaled questions. Data will be collected directly from the EMR at&#xD;
      previously outlined points documenting each subjects opioid prescriptions and opioid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistician from the Wayne State Research Department will be utilized for data&#xD;
      interpretation after collection of data from subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Study Timeline&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will be conducted over a span of 12 months. The initial 6 weeks will be&#xD;
      utilized providing study training to the participating research assistants. This time will&#xD;
      also be spent providing block training, skills assessments and teaching to participating&#xD;
      physicians. The following 8 months will be spent enrolling subjects and collecting data. The&#xD;
      remaining 2 months and 2 weeks will be used for data interpretation and creation of a&#xD;
      manuscript for submission detailing findings from this study.&#xD;
