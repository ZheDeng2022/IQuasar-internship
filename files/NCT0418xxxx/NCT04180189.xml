    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate a sleep intervention with weighted blankets for children&#xD;
      with ADHD and sleep problem regarding health-related outcomes, sleep, and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an RCT with cross-over design. The participants will be randomized to start with&#xD;
      an active or placebo blanket, and then change blankets during the 16 week study period.&#xD;

      There is limited evidence about health outcomes or health-economic benefits of sleep&#xD;
      interventions with weighted blankets for children with neuropsychiatric syndromes (NPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate a sleep intervention with weighted blankets for children&#xD;
      with ADHD and sleep problem regarding health-related outcomes, sleep, and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants, n=100 children between 6 and 13 years old, will be recruited from the ADHD&#xD;
      unit in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) and randomly assigned into two&#xD;
      groups: Fiber Weighted Blankets (intervention 1) and Control Blankets (controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children will use each blanket respectively for 4 weeks, then change blankets. A long&#xD;
      term follow-up will be conducted 16 weeks from baseline.&#xD;

    <description>Subjectively measured sleep problems in smaller children, assessed by Child's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), assessed by the parents, referring to last week. consists of 33 items related to eight subscales; 1) Bedtime resistance, 2) Sleep onset delay, 3) Sleep duration, 4) Sleep anxiety, 5) Night wakings, 6) Parasomnias, 7) Sleep-disordered breathing, and 8) Daytime sleepiness. Each item is rated on a three-point scale: &quot;usually&quot; if the sleep behavior occurred five to seven times/week; &quot;sometimes&quot; for two to four times/week; and &quot;rarely&quot; for zero to one time/week. A higher score indicates more sleep problems</description>

    <description>Subjectively measured sleep problems in children, assessed by Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), children responding, referring to last week, comprises seven items for the children to respond to: 1) Severity of sleep-onset, 2) Sleep maintenance, 3) Early morning awakening, 4) Satisfaction with current sleep pattern, 5) Interference with daily functioning, 6) Noticeability of impairment attributed to the sleep problem, and 7) Level of distress caused by the sleep problem. Each item is rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; (scored at 0) to &quot;extremely&quot; (scored at 4). Total score ranges from 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating greater severity.</description>

    <measure>Parents' Health related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by EQ5D (among the parents), referring to this day. measuring the parents' health comprising five dimensions; 1) Mobility, 2) Self-care, 3) Usual activities, 4) Pain/discomfort, and 5) Anxiety/Depression. Each dimension is divided into three levels; No problems, Some or moderate problems, and extreme problems. In addition to the five dimensions, a 100-millimeter vertical Visual Analog Scale with endpoints of 100 means &quot;best imaginable health state&quot; and 0 means &quot;worst imaginable health state is included. The total score ranges from 0 to 1 where a higher score indicates a better health-related quality of life.</description>

    <description>Assessed by EQ5D-y (among the children), referring to this day, comprises five items; 1) Walking about (mobility), 2) Looking after myself (self-care), 3) Doing usual activities (usual activities), 4) Having pain or discomfort (pain and discomfort), and 5) Feeling worried, sad or unhappy (anxiety and depression). Each item is divided into three levels; No problems, Some problems, and A lot of problems. The EQ-5D-Y also includes an easily understandable modified vertical Visual Analogue Scale of EQ-5D, where the respondent rates the overall health status with the endpoints from 0 (the worst health state the child can imagine and 100 (the best health state the child can imagine)</description>
