      This study is a prospective, single arm, single center exploratory clinical research, to&#xD;
      evaluate KN035 late treatment in patients with Multiple Primary tumors (MPC, Multiple Primary&#xD;
      working) clinical benefit.In the study, all subjects meeting the criteria for inclusion will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the KN035 treatment group, and patients cannot receive any other anti-tumor&#xD;
      treatment during the study period.The primary endpoint of the study was defined as patients&#xD;
      who could be assessed by imaging, and the optimal Objective Response Rate (ORR) based on&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 standard, while the secondary endpoint was safety (nci-ctcae 4.0), DCR (Disease&#xD;
      Control Rate), DoR (Duration of Response), progression-free survival (PFS),1) Overall&#xD;
      Survival and Overall Survival;The end point of the exploratory study was the correlation&#xD;
      between different molecular types and the efficacy of immunotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with advanced MPC in the study should be enrolled as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histopathological diagnosis of multiple primary tumors, and is currently suffering from&#xD;
      advanced colorectal cancer;Except for bowel cancer, no anti-tumor treatment is needed for&#xD;
      other tumors during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum time interval between screening and treatment was 2 weeks (±7 days).Efficacy and&#xD;
      safety were evaluated at 4 weeks (±7 days), 8 weeks (±7 days) after treatment, and every 8&#xD;
      weeks (±7 days) thereafter.Once a subject develops disease progression (based on investigator&#xD;
      evaluation or imaging evidence), the subject should discontinue the study.Cessation of&#xD;
      treatment for any reason should be followed by a study end visit within 4 weeks (±7) days&#xD;
      after the last study administration to collect information on all possible adverse events and&#xD;
      drug combinations.Drug - related or possibly related adverse events should be followed up&#xD;
      until they are stable or resolved.SAE should be documented within 30 days of study&#xD;
      cessation.KN035 can be used for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When desease progression is suspected, researchers are allowed to reconfirm disease&#xD;
      progression after 4 weeks using irRECIST criteria.During the confirmation of disease&#xD;
      progression, if the investigator decides that the subject should continue to receive KN035&#xD;
      treatment, the following criteria must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers assessed whether the subjects had benefited or were likely to continue to&#xD;
      benefit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ①Subjects can tolerate study drug therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
      ②There were no medical events (e.g., central nervous system metastases) in which tumor&#xD;
      progression was rapid or urgent intervention was required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoint analysis will be performed when the last patient is followed for 24 weeks or&#xD;
      disease progression or death is observed.If there is still no disease progression or&#xD;
      intolerable adverse reactions, the patient will continue to receive KN035 treatment until the&#xD;
      disease progression, death, occurrence of intolerable adverse reactions or treatment for 1&#xD;
      year (the researcher will give follow-up treatment recommendations according to the specific&#xD;
      situation, if the original treatment is continued, the patient can still receive KN035&#xD;
      treatment for free).Treatment options after disease progression will be implemented at the&#xD;
      discretion of the investigator.After the end of the study visit, subjects will enter the&#xD;
      post-study follow-up period to collect survival data OS.&#xD;
