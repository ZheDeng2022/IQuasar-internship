  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Hearts in Rhythm Organization (HiRO) is a national network of Canadian&#xD;
      researchers/clinicians, working towards a better understanding of the rare genetic causes of&#xD;
      sudden cardiac death (SCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Canadian adult and pediatric electrophysiology centres across Canada work together to gather&#xD;
      data and bio sample in a national data registry and bio bank hoping to improve the detection&#xD;
      and treatment of inherited heart rhythm disorders to prevent sudden death.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Led by clinical researchers, HiRO is focused on identifying phenotype-genotype correlations.&#xD;
      HiRO has defined the investigation pathway for patients with possible genetically mediated&#xD;
      cardiac arrest, and has had major impact on our understanding of familial sudden death.&#xD;
      However, because many of the Canadian clinics lack a system of care or embedded research, it&#xD;
      is difficult to translate novel discoveries to improved care. This current protocol provides&#xD;
      a system wide mechanism to allow the national investigator group to work together more&#xD;
      efficiently to ensure the inclusion of all Canadians affected by the inherited causes of SCD&#xD;
      to help ensure standardized quality care for this population in all provinces with embedded&#xD;
      opportunity for all individuals to participate in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inherited Heart rhythm disorders include arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      (ARVC), Brugada Syndrome, Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) and&#xD;
      Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). They affect one in 200 Canadians and can result in tragic sudden&#xD;
      cardiac death (SCD), reduced quality of life and productivity, and high health care&#xD;
      expenditure. SCD kills 30,000 Canadians/year. Importantly, clinical screening for at-risk&#xD;
      individuals has tremendous potential for timely monitoring and treatment. Treatment typically&#xD;
      involves lifestyle modifications, such as avoidance of strenuous exercise, drugs that may&#xD;
      worsen the phenotype or medical therapy with beta-blockers or quinidine which can provide&#xD;
      substantial protection from SCD. Patients who have cardiac events while on medical therapy,&#xD;
      have suffered an unexplained cardiac arrest (UCA), or are deemed sufficiently high risk are&#xD;
      offered an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). ICD therapy provides protection&#xD;
      however, it is commonly associated with life-long device related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients reviewed in partnering HiRO, Inherited Heart Rhythm Clinics will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional bio bank participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to provide a blood sample for storage for future&#xD;
      research.Central bio banking for all national bio banks will be available at the lead centre&#xD;
      in Vancouver in the James Hogg lab at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver BC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected from willing/consented registry participants. Their&#xD;
      healthcare information will be coded in compliance with Tri Council Policy Statement&#xD;
      criteria: direct identifiers will be removed and replaced with a unique study code that does&#xD;
      not use personal information such as the participant's birth day (month and year will be&#xD;
      included), health number, social insurance number or name/initials. The coded data will be&#xD;
      transferred into the research database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The master list of registry participants with their study identifiers will be kept separately&#xD;
      from the research database. This master list will be stored in an encrypted file within the&#xD;
      research office of each site investigators under their supervision. Only the site&#xD;
      investigators and their local research staff will have access to this list. The inherited&#xD;
      nature of these conditions makes the master list an important and very sensitive document. It&#xD;
      will be very important that this list is maintained so that participants may be contacted and&#xD;
      informed of any new findings the research may reveal that may affect themselves and their&#xD;
      family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All medical information pertaining to the cardiac history of inherited arrhythmia patients&#xD;
      will be collected. This may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All diagnostic test results Genetic screening results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pedigree&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Race Participants will continue to have their data collected for the research database&#xD;
           throughout the entirety of the study. Participants will be able to decline further&#xD;
           participation in the registry at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are reassessed as part of clinical care every 3 years in person, collecting the&#xD;
      same data as at baseline; this is a repeat phenotyping cycle and reflects standard clinical&#xD;
      practice in Canada in the adult IHR population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Data system:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data base will be maintained by the HiRO research coordinating centre in Vancouver BC.&#xD;

      Page 8 of 15 Version 1, May 2, 2019 UBCrebapproval#H19-01358, Aug27,2019 The database will be&#xD;
      hosted on the Amazon Virtual Private Network. This network is in compliance with National&#xD;
      Canadian/Provincial PIPEDA privacy guidelines. Data will be entered directly into the e-CRFs&#xD;
      for electronic submission to a password protected internet-based server located in Montreal&#xD;
      Quebec Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual participant medical information obtained as a result of this registry is&#xD;
      considered confidential and disclosure to third parties is prohibited except for the&#xD;
      following reason: relevant medical information may be given to the participant's personal&#xD;
      physician or to other appropriate medical personnel responsible for the participant's&#xD;
      welfare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bio Bank:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological (blood) samples will be coded in compliance with Tri Council Policy Statement&#xD;
      criteria: direct identifiers will be removed and replaced with a unique study code that does&#xD;
      not use personal information such as the participant's birth date, health care number, social&#xD;
      insurance number or name/initials. The coded samples will be linked to the master list kept&#xD;
      securely in the research office of the individual investigators. Each sub site investigator&#xD;
      and their local research staff will have access to the master list of their local patients&#xD;
      only. These master lists will not be shared amongst the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Samples drawn:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 X 9 ml EDTA&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 X 10 ml redtop serum tube Samples for bio banking will be managed by the coordinating&#xD;
      centre in Vancouver British Columbia stored long-term in the James Hogg Research Centre&#xD;
      (JHRC) Bio Bank at St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oversight&#xD;
&#xD;
      HiRO Research Steering Committee (HRSC) for the National HiRO research registry and bio bank:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HRSC will be responsible for the design, execution, analysis, and reporting of the study,&#xD;
      and will assign appropriate responsibilities to the other study committees. The HRSC will&#xD;
      monitor study progress, execution and management. This committee will be responsible for the&#xD;
      integrity of the study data and samples. They will also be responsible for reviewing and&#xD;
      approving sub study proposals, for use of the registry data and bio samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The committee members are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Jason Roberts (London Health Sciences) Dr. Andrew Krahn (University of BC/Vancouver) Dr.&#xD;
      Rafik Tadros (Montreal Heart Institute) Julia Cadrin -Tourginy (Montreal Heart Institute) Dr.&#xD;
      Ciorsti MacIntyre (Dalhousie/Halifax) Dr. Christian Steinberg (Laval/Quebec) Dr. Martin&#xD;
      Gardner (Dalhousie/Halifax) Dr. Martin Green (Ottawa Heart Centre)&#xD;
&#xD;
      National HiRO Patient/Public Partners when appropriate will review and advise on projects to&#xD;
      provide the patient perspective of the research questions and will propose patient oriented&#xD;
      research projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Database/bio bank access and Oversight:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HRSC will have ultimate responsibility for the database. All Investigators on the HRSC&#xD;
      listed in this protocol will have equal access to the de-identified data once they have&#xD;
      signed the HRSC charter (* see attachment #3*). The HRC investigators will be responsible for&#xD;
      annual reviews of data collection, to ensure completeness and accuracy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed sub- studies involve an established proposal submission form, discussion, formal&#xD;
      presentation to the HRSC for approval, and a robust lab manual that defines sample access,&#xD;
      handling, analysis and reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only aggregate coded data would be released for these purposes. These data/specimens may be&#xD;
      used by a variety of sources. It is anticipated that there may be requests to pool&#xD;
      de-identified data/specimens with data/specimens from other international registries/banks in&#xD;
      order to answer investigator initiated questions about patient selection, rare events, and&#xD;
      long term outcomes.&#xD;
