    <textblock>
      Prostate specific membrane antigen(PSMA) targeted therapy brings new hope to the patients&#xD;
      with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Here, we reported the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of 177 Lu -labeled PSMA ligand(PSMA-I＆T) in the treatment of mCRPC in&#xD;
      Asianethics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in older men with recent data .PSMA is a&#xD;
      type II transmembrane glycoprotein，overexpressed up to 100 to 1000 times higher than normal&#xD;
      prostate cells in prostate cancer cells and is correlated with higher-grade cancers,&#xD;
      metastatic disease and hormone refractory disease. Lutetium-177 (177Lu)-PSMA (LuPSMA) is a&#xD;
      novel and highly targeted systemic RLT for progressive mCRPC. Upon binding of LuPSMA to the&#xD;
      cell membrane, endocytosis is triggered, concentrating the tumouricidal effects of the&#xD;
      radioisotope activity internally within malignant cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-institution, single-arm phase 2 clinical trial. Patients will receive PRLT&#xD;
      Treatment. The follow-up period was followed up to assess safety and effectiveness.&#xD;
