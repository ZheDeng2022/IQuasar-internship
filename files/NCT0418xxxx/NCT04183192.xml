    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mepolizumab and&#xD;
      reslizumab across an appropriate dose range to inform clinical trial operating&#xD;
      characteristics for future clinical pharmacology pharmacodynamics similarity studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose, parallel arm study in 72 healthy&#xD;
      subjects assigned to one of four dose groups (low, intermediate low, intermediate high, and&#xD;
      high) of each drug (mepolizumab or reslizumab) or placebo.&#xD;

      This study is designed to assess pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mepolizumab and&#xD;
      reslizumab across an appropriate dose range to inform clinical trial operating&#xD;
      characteristics for future clinical pharmacology pharmacodynamics similarity studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose, parallel arm study in 72 healthy&#xD;
      subjects assigned to one of four dose groups (low, intermediate low, intermediate high, and&#xD;
      high) of each drug (mepolizumab or reslizumab) or placebo. Mepolizumab doses are 3, 6, 12, or&#xD;
      24 mg. Reslizumab doses are 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8 mg/kg. Each arm will include 8 subjects (4&#xD;
      male and 4 female).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted for treatment on day -1 and receive a single dose of study drug or&#xD;
      placebo on day 1. Depending on the treatment arm, subjects will remain in confinement for two&#xD;
      weeks and continue follow-up through either day 63 or day 123.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples (approximately 5 mL per sample) will be collected for determination of plasma&#xD;
      concentrations for study drug. Additional blood samples will be collected for determination&#xD;
      of eosinophil counts (5 mL per sample; pharmacodynamic measure) and exploratory proteomics&#xD;
      analyses (5 mL per sample).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluations will include adverse event (AE) monitoring, vital sign measurements, and&#xD;
      physical examinations. All AEs reported by the subject or observed by the investigator or&#xD;
      clinical research unit (CRU) staff will be recorded. Any AE reported after the informed&#xD;
      consent is signed and before study drug application will be recorded as medical history.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The pharmacist (and designated staff member responsible for confirmation of study drug dose) will be unblinded to subject treatment assignment; however, the pharmacist will not perform any study procedures other than study drug preparation and dispensing.&#xD;
Subjects and staff will be blinded to treatment assignment during confinement, but route of administration will not be blinded. The blind will be maintained through a randomization schedule held by the dispensing pharmacist. Subjects and staff will be informed of a subject's end of study day when discharged from confinement. Subjects and staff will not be informed of the specific treatment arm assignment. The clinical research nurse will administer the study drugs in unit dose containers that are not transparent.</masking_description>

             repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat or new loss of&#xD;
             taste/smell. In addition, the subject has any other findings suggestive of COVID-19&#xD;

             and considered clinically significant by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Subject has a positive test result at Screening for HIV 1 or 2 antibody, hepatitis C&#xD;
             virus antibodies, or hepatitis B surface antigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Subject is unable or unwilling to undergo multiple venipunctures for blood sample&#xD;
             collection because of poor tolerability or poor venous access.&#xD;
