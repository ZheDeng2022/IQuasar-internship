    <textblock>
      This study in healthy men and women looks at the injection site experience of semaglutide and&#xD;
      dulaglutide given subcutaneously (s.c., under the skin). Participants will receive 1 dose of&#xD;
      semaglutide 0.25 mg and 1 dose of dulaglutide 0.75 mg on the same day. The 2 injections will&#xD;
      be given at least 30 minutes apart, one in each side of the stomach. Participants will be in&#xD;
      the clinic research center for 1 day. A follow-up phone call will take place between 4 and 5&#xD;
      weeks after the injections were given.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 minute after each injection (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The intensity of injection site pain was measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS). The VAS consists of a horizontal 100 millimeters (mm) line where 0 mm corresponded to no pain and 100 mm corresponded to unbearable pain. After each injection, the participants rated their pain perception at the VAS by marking a vertical line across the 100 mm horizontal line. The distance (mm) between the endpoint &quot;no pain&quot; and the vertical line on the VAS was recorded and analysed.</description>

        <title>Intensity of Injection Site Pain</title>
        <description>The intensity of injection site pain was measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS). The VAS consists of a horizontal 100 millimeters (mm) line where 0 mm corresponded to no pain and 100 mm corresponded to unbearable pain. After each injection, the participants rated their pain perception at the VAS by marking a vertical line across the 100 mm horizontal line. The distance (mm) between the endpoint &quot;no pain&quot; and the vertical line on the VAS was recorded and analysed.</description>

      <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 28. Results are based on the safety analysis set which included all participants who had received at least 1 injection of semaglutide or dulaglutide (included any skin contact with trial product whether the injection was completed or not).</time_frame>
      <desc>All presented adverse events are treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). TEAE was defined as an event that had onset date on or after the day of first injection and no later than 28 days after the day of last injection. The trial was crossover and injections were given only 30 minutes apart. Therefore it was not possible to say which product the AE was related to. Hence, AE data are presented for the overall study.</desc>
