  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second commonest cause of cancer death worldwide. It is&#xD;
      the third leading cause of cancer death in Hong Kong. Liver transplantation (LT) is the&#xD;
      curative treatment of choice for HCC as it has the advantage of removing the tumour and also&#xD;
      the premalignant cirrhotic liver. Milan (solitary tumour &lt;5cm, or up to 3 tumours, each &lt;3cm)&#xD;
      and University of California San Francisco (UCSF) criteria (solitary tumour ≤6.5cm, up to 3&#xD;
      tumours with none &gt;4.5cm, and total tumour diameter ≤8cm) provide the benchmark requirements&#xD;
      for LT, at which a 5-year survival of &gt;70% and recurrence rate ranging from 5-15% can be&#xD;
      achieved. However, organ shortage and waiting time for liver grafts remain the greatest&#xD;
      obstacles for deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT). It has been reported that the&#xD;
      waiting list dropout rate is 7 to 11% at 6 months and 38% at 12 months. Several therapeutic&#xD;
      procedures including transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) and stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy (SBRT) have been studied as bridging therapy before DDLT, aiming at reducing waiting&#xD;
      list dropout rate and recurrence after LT, and improving post-transplant survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have carried out a prospective study on HCC patients treated with bridging&#xD;
      SBRT before LT. The investigators used dual tracer (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG] and&#xD;
      11carbon-acetate [ACC]) positron-emission tomography with integrated computed tomography&#xD;
      (PET-CT) and magnetic resonance imaging with gadoxetate disodium as baseline and subsequent&#xD;
      imaging assessment before and after SBRT, hoping the PET-CT can help better identify those&#xD;
      who benefit from SBRT and to prioritise those with poor response so that they can be better&#xD;
      channeled to LT.&#xD;

      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second commonest cause of cancer death worldwide. It is&#xD;
      the third leading cause of cancer death in Hong Kong. Liver transplantation (LT) is the&#xD;
      curative treatment of choice for HCC as it has the advantage of removing the tumour and also&#xD;
      the premalignant cirrhotic liver. Milan (solitary tumour &lt;5cm, or up to 3 tumours, each &lt;3cm)&#xD;
      and University of California San Francisco (UCSF) criteria (solitary tumour ≤6.5cm, up to 3&#xD;
      tumours with none &gt;4.5cm, and total tumour diameter ≤8cm) provide the benchmark requirements&#xD;
      for LT, at which a 5-year survival of &gt;70% and recurrence rate ranging from 5-15% can be&#xD;
      achieved. However, organ shortage and waiting time for liver grafts remain the greatest&#xD;
      obstacles for deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT). It has been reported that the&#xD;
      waiting list dropout rate is 7 to 11% at 6 months and 38% at 12 months. Several therapeutic&#xD;
      procedures including transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) and stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy (SBRT) have been studied as bridging therapy before DDLT, aiming at reducing waiting&#xD;
      list dropout rate and recurrence after LT, and improving post-transplant survival. TACE is&#xD;
      the most widely used bridging therapy with tumour necrosis rate of 25-57% on explant&#xD;
      pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However it is largely only feasible in patients with Child-Pugh Class A status. SBRT, through&#xD;
      the delivery of extremely conformal tumouricidal radiation in a few fractions (usually ≤5)&#xD;
      under real-time liver and tumour motion monitoring, is more fashionable. Prospective studies&#xD;
      have shown a higher local control rate of 87-100% at 1 year, an overall survival of 60-69% at&#xD;
      2 years after SBRT for unresectable HCC with minimal radiation-induced liver disease (RILD)&#xD;
      compared to TACE. Studies have also been made on the use of SBRT as bridging therapy.&#xD;
      Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have traditionally been used to&#xD;
      diagnose and monitor treatment response for HCC. Their sensitivity and specificity are&#xD;
      comparable for lesions &gt;2cm. MR imaging provides higher soft tissue contrast and addition of&#xD;
      liver-specific contrast agent (gadoxetate disodium, Primovist) further improves detection of&#xD;
      1-2cm tumours, demonstrating 92.1% accuracy based on the Milan and UCSF guidelines. However&#xD;
      MRI is subject to significant motion artefacts during scanning. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)&#xD;
      PET-CT has been extensively studied in HCC staging and treatment response monitoring.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, FDG PET-CT is only capable of detecting the more poorly-differentiated&#xD;
      component of HCC. It was first found in Hong Kong in 2003 that 11carbon-acetate (ACC) can&#xD;
      detect the more well-differentiated component and both FDG and ACC as dual tracers have an&#xD;
      incremental value of diagnosing extra-hepatic metastases in comparison to FDG alone. It was&#xD;
      further proven by our hepatobiliary surgical team that ACC improved overall sensitivity of&#xD;
      diagnosis in the pre-transplant cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have looked at PET-CT for treatment response evaluation. A previous study has&#xD;
      shown that cohorts with higher standardised uptake value (SUV) ratios have higher responses&#xD;
      to external radiotherapy than lower SUV ratios cohort. However, the population was small and&#xD;
      the treatment regimens were inhomogeneous. Use of FDG PET-CT has been promising in assessing&#xD;
      treatment response after TACE and Y-90 microspheres selective internal radiation therapy&#xD;
      (SIRT). However, there are very few publications on dual tracer PET-CT scan to evaluate&#xD;
      tumour response after SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the above, the investigators have carried out a prospective study on HCC patients&#xD;
      treated with bridging SBRT before LT. The investigators used dual tracer (FDG and ACC)&#xD;
      positron-emission tomography with integrated computed tomography (PET-CT) and MRI with&#xD;
      gadoxetate disodium as baseline and subsequent imaging assessment before and after SBRT,&#xD;
      hoping the dual tracer PET-CT and MRI with gadoxetate disodium can help better identify those&#xD;
      who benefit from SBRT and to prioritise those with poor response so that they can be better&#xD;
      channeled to LT.&#xD;
