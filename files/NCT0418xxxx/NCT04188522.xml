    <textblock>
      This is a study using magnetoencephalography (MEG) to look at recovery in those with minor&#xD;
      stroke. The investigators know that these individuals report difficulties in attention,&#xD;
      concentration, multi-tasking, energy level, and processing speed that appear to be&#xD;
      independent of lesion size or location. The underlying pathophysiology is unclear; however,&#xD;
      anecdotally, many individuals are significantly improved by 6 months post-stroke. One&#xD;
      hypothesis is that a single lesion, regardless of size, may disrupt the classic neural&#xD;
      networks required for cognitive function. The investigators are currently collecting data to&#xD;
      better characterize these difficulties and stroke patients' recovery as part of a previously&#xD;
      approved recovery study. In this sub-study, the investigators propose to add MEG at 1 and 6&#xD;
      months in a subset of individuals with small: 1) subcortical, and 2) cortical lesions. The&#xD;
      investigators will partner with colleagues at the University of Maryland (College Park), who&#xD;
      are well experienced with MEG to conduct this research. In addition a control population of&#xD;
      age-similar individuals will be recruited for comparison. Cerebral activation patterns of&#xD;
      individuals with stroke versus controls will be compared, both across patients with stroke at&#xD;
      a given time point, and within subjects from 1 to 6 months to determine the association of&#xD;
      abnormal activation with cognitive dysfunction and recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      **The investigators have recently extended follow-up by adding an additional assessment at 12&#xD;
      months and will enroll additional participants (up to 40 patients with minor stroke, 15&#xD;
      age-similar controls).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective longitudinal study of patients with minor stroke versus age-similar&#xD;
      controls that will make use of the following protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are admitted to the hospital for acute stroke and undergo work-up including&#xD;
           MRI; they are entered into a clinical outcomes database (routine clinical care)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients are scheduled for an appointment in the Bayview Stroke Intervention Clinic&#xD;
           approximately 4-6 weeks +/- 4 weeks post-stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seen at 4-6 weeks (routine care)- consented and tested if enrolled (per research&#xD;
           protocol, as part of a prior approved study on stroke recovery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those meeting inclusion criteria for MEG testing will be consented and undergo the&#xD;
           following additional procedures: 1 month MEG visit at the University of Maryland- brain&#xD;
           activity will be measured at rest and during cognitive tasks evaluating domains such as:&#xD;
           executive function, attention, and multi-tasking including a visual naming test Repeat&#xD;
           MEG at approximately 6 months +/- 4 weeks post-stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
      University of Maryland's MEG Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The head shape will be measured using a 3D tracking system. This involves using a plastic&#xD;
      stylus to mark a series of points around the head that will map the entire surface of the&#xD;
      head. In addition, each of three &quot;fiducial&quot; points; one in front of each ear and one above&#xD;
      and between the eyes will be marked. The purpose of the head shape measurement is to be able&#xD;
      to co-localize brain activity recorded with the MEG with the subject's MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic fields will be recorded using a 275-channel whole-head MEG system. A third-order&#xD;
      gradient will be used for noise cancellation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MEG system non- invasively measures the magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals (and,&#xD;
      optionally, electroencephalographic EEG signals) produced by electrically active tissue of&#xD;
      the brain. These signals are recorded by a computerized data acquisition system, displayed,&#xD;
      and may then be interpreted by trained physicians to help localize these active areas. The&#xD;
      location may then be correlated with anatomical information of the brain. MEG is routinely&#xD;
      used to identify the locations of visual, auditory, somatosensory, and motor cortex in the&#xD;
      brain. MEG is also used to non-invasively locate regions of epileptic activity within the&#xD;
      brain. The localization information provided by MEG may be used, in conjunction with other&#xD;
      diagnostic data, in neurosurgical planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total length of the MEG recordings will depend on the length of the tasks (an estimate of&#xD;
      30-45 min has been used). There will be a 2-5 -minute break between each run. For all runs&#xD;
      magnetic fields will be recorded in 42 consecutive 10-second trials. In this way if there are&#xD;
      artifacts during the session, such as the subject moving his or her head, the 10-second trial&#xD;
      during which this occurs can be eliminated from analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return for their 6 month and 12 month post-stroke follow-up appointments&#xD;
      (routine care) and testing (if part of the recovery study).&#xD;
