  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 450 subjects were enrolled, divided into four age groups, including 18-59 years,&#xD;
      6-17 years, 3-5 years, and 6-35 months. There are three types of the test vaccine component&#xD;
      in each age group. A total of 30 people in each dose group were vaccinated with the test&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo 1 or placebo 2, respectively, in a ratio of 3: 1: 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 18-59-year-old, 6-17-year-old, and 3-5-year-old age groups were vaccinated 2 times at a&#xD;
      time interval of 28 days. The 6-35 month age group is divided into two groups, Group 1 is&#xD;
      inoculated with 2 doses interval of 28 days each, and Group 2 is inoculated with 3 doses&#xD;
      interval of 28 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From January to April 2020, this study was affected by the COVID-19 epidemic, which caused&#xD;
      the two groups（6-17-year-old，3-5-year-old） of subjects to vaccinate beyond the window and&#xD;
      deviate from the experimental plan. After communication between the researcher, the sponsor&#xD;
      and the statistician, it was decided to restart the Phase I clinical trials of these two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
