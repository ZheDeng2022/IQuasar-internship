  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-authorisation, multicentric, observational, retrospective and prospective study to&#xD;
      assess quality of care of sarcoma patients in expert and non-expert centers by analysing&#xD;
      correlation of quality items and outcomes such as relapse free survival, overall survival,&#xD;
      percentage of amputation, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expert pathology peer review will be performed to detect differences between expert and&#xD;
      non-expert centers as well as differences in treatment and patient prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor samples of 4 types of sarcoma would also be included in translational research to&#xD;
      detect biomarkers and produce preclinical models.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with an histological diagnosis of soft-tissue sarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal&#xD;
      tumor (GIST) or bone sarcoma (all subtypes) with ≥ 18 years old are able to be included in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data registration period includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective part: from January 2012 until June 2019 Prospective part: from July 2019 until&#xD;
      January 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all clinical practice guidelines, it is recommended to refer patients with suspected&#xD;
      sarcomas to an Expert Center (EC). The pioneers in implementing EC in sarcomas have been the&#xD;
      Scandinavian countries, where referral is mandatory. In Spain, through the Audit of the&#xD;
      Ministry of Health, Social Affairs and Equality, 5 CSURs (Centers, Services or Reference&#xD;
      Units). Taken together the previous information, and since the European experience in sarcoma&#xD;
      EC and sarcoma referral policies have shown to be positive, as numerous outcome indicators&#xD;
      favoring patients managed in EC have been reported, a European and Latin-American consortium&#xD;
      of sarcoma centers has emerged, supported by Horizon 2020 program (Horizon 2020 Call:&#xD;
      H2020-SC1-BHC-2018-2020) with the aim of implementing a process to facilitate the&#xD;
      accreditation of expert centers in sarcoma as well as a network of Latin-American sarcoma&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A SELNET database is available for all participating countries. to register patient's&#xD;
      clinical data: Demographic information, Type of sarcoma (Soft-tissue/Bone/GIST), Clinical&#xD;
      presentation, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Survival and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of care will be assessed based on the analysis of different diagnostic/therapeutic&#xD;
      items, specified in the ESMO-EURACAN clinical practice guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of cases &gt; 5 cm with tru-cut biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of biopsies carried out by sarcoma teams vs not sarcoma team (in all the&#xD;
           series and in cases &gt; 5 cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients with image studies at diagnosis and before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients discussed in multidisciplinary teams (MDT) before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients with specified histopathological grade in pathologic report.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of affected surgical margins in first surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of re-resections in patients with affected surgical margins in first surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Co-adjuvant therapies: percentage of patients with &gt;5 cm, G2-3 sarcoma receiving&#xD;
           neo/adjuvant radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients with localized GIST with adequate risk assessment (specified&#xD;
           mitotic count (50HPF), site and size of primary tumor).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients with advanced GIST with available molecular status of KIT/PDGFR&#xD;
           before initiating systemic therapy for advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients with regular follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the localised disease quality assessment, we'll focus on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical margins will be correlated with: Type of biopsy, team performing diagnostic&#xD;
           biopsy, preoperative image studies and discussion in MDT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relapse-free survival will be correlated with type of biopsy, team performing diagnostic&#xD;
           biopsy, discussion in MDT, surgical margins status, re-resection performance,&#xD;
           co-adjuvant therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival will be correlated with team performing diagnostic biopsy, discussion&#xD;
           in MDT, surgical margins status, re-resection performance, coadjuvant therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of amputation will be correlated with type of biopsy, team performing&#xD;
           diagnostic biopsy, discussion in MDT, surgical margins status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long-term side effects will be correlated with type of surgery, team performing&#xD;
           diagnostic biopsy, discussion in MDT, surgical margins status, co-adjuvant therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For advance disease quality assessment, we'll focus on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression-free survival will be correlated with discussion in MDT, type of center&#xD;
           (expert/not)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival will be correlated with discussion in MDT, access to clinical trials,&#xD;
           access to second lines, surgery of metastatic disease, type of center (expert/not)&#xD;
&#xD;
      An expert pathology review will take place to diagnose sarcoma cases and evaluate the&#xD;
      differences in diagnosis and it outcome and consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four sarcoma subtypes have been selected to analyse further with biological tissue samples.:&#xD;
      Angiosarcoma, Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor, Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma and&#xD;
      Solitary fibrous tumors. The aims of the translational research program are: to describe&#xD;
      prognostic factors and/ or cell signaling pathways of relevance in AS, DSRCT, EMC and SFT; to&#xD;
      describe predictive biomarkers of first and second line agents; to study the potential&#xD;
      mechanisms of action of first and second line agents and their role in the activation of&#xD;
      antitumor tumor microenvironment (e.g. immune response) and to establish preclinical models&#xD;
      on these rare subtypes of sarcoma to validate OMICs data. This will open new doors for novel&#xD;
      hypothesis for clinical trials based on the analysis of differential gene expression, cell&#xD;
      signaling pathways and/ or predictive biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression Free Survival (PFS), objective tumor response, Overall survival (OS), and&#xD;
      histopathological features will be correlated with OMICs data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples to collect:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor blocks will be used to analyze protein fusion (by NGS), RNA expression (by&#xD;
           RNA-Seq) and protein expression (by IHC). The tumors samples will be collected from the&#xD;
           diagnostic time. If available, paired tumor samples will be shipped to determine the&#xD;
           differential gene expression of post-treatment specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prospective fresh tumor samples will be used for whole genome sequencing and to&#xD;
           establish PDX and 3D tumor organoid-like models, at translational central laboratories&#xD;
           (SFT: Seville; EMC: Milan; AS: Lyon; DSRCT; Sao Paulo).Moreover, fresh tumor samples&#xD;
           could also be collected, from national associated centers, and shipped frozen to&#xD;
           national central laboratory. Frozen tumors will be shipped in 10% DMSO - 90% FBS, which&#xD;
           preserves quite well tumor cell viability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients should sign and date the Informed Consent Form after reading the patient&#xD;
      Information Sheet to accept participating in this study. Participating in the study is&#xD;
      voluntary and the patient can withdraw his/her consent at any time, without giving any reason&#xD;
      and without reducing his/her right to health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      He/she can also withdraw the consent to use the tumor sample donated to the study without&#xD;
      withdrawing the participation in the study (the patient's clinical data will be registered&#xD;
      and analysed). If this happens, the tumor sample left in the central laboratory can be&#xD;
      returned to the origin site. Any withdraw should be confirmed by signing a Revocation Form.&#xD;
      However, the investigator should try to know the reason to withdraw consent in order to&#xD;
      improve the study conditions.&#xD;
