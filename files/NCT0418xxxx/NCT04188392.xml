      This preliminary, open-label study assesses the feasibility of 34mg at bedtime for 6 weeks in&#xD;
      Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and insomnia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More treatments are needed to target insomnia in Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.&#xD;
      There is evidence to suggest that pimavanserin, a medication approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration for the treatment of psychosis in Parkinson's disease, may improve deep sleep&#xD;
      and insomnia. This study preliminary assesses the feasibility of pimavanserin 34mg at bedtime&#xD;
      for 6 weeks for the treatment of chronic insomnia in Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress&#xD;
      Disorder.&#xD;

             time awake after sleep onset ≥30 minutes), and/or awakening earlier in the morning&#xD;
             (≥30 minutes before scheduled wake time and before a total sleep time of 6.5 hours)&#xD;
             than desired. b. Insomnia frequency of ≥3 times per week c. The duration of the&#xD;
             insomnia complaint is ≥3 months d. Associated with complaint of daytime impairment.&#xD;
