  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Vascular Accidents (stroke) and Myocardial Infarction (MI), which share the same&#xD;
      risk factors, treatments and pathophysiological mechanisms, have become two major public&#xD;
      health problems due to the increase in their prevalence rate and the longer survival after&#xD;
      such an event in developed countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International data, including French data and data from our own registries, illustrate that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  risk factors that are common, mainly hypertension, smoking, high cholesterol or&#xD;
           diabetes, remain insufficiently controlled, although they are easily detectable and&#xD;
           treatable;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the incidence rate of stroke has doubled in 20 years in people under 55 years of age,&#xD;
           increasing the number of people with chronic disabilities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1-month and 1-year mortality rates for stroke and MIs have decreased by 17% in 5 years,&#xD;
           increasing the number of survivors but with chronic disabilities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the aging of the population and the arrival of the baby boomers of the 1950s in the&#xD;
           at-risk age groups has increased the at-risk population;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stroke and MI recurrence rates reached a threshold of 6% / year, in contrast to the very&#xD;
           high rates of re-hospitalization at 1 year: 30% post-stroke and 20% post-MI, due to&#xD;
           poorly anticipated and controlled complications. These reasons explain the lack of&#xD;
           significant progress in preventing recurrences, preventable complications (heart failure&#xD;
           and arrhythmias after MI; falls, sphincter and swallowing disorders, dementia and&#xD;
           arrhythmias after stroke) and re-admission. This observation is aggravated by problems&#xD;
           of medical demography and therefore the availability of neurologists, cardiologists and&#xD;
           general practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local and foreign experiments have demonstrated the value of intensive, coordinated and&#xD;
      multi-professional stroke and MI monitoring, including nurses, in terms of: better control of&#xD;
      risk factors and reduction of the rate of re-hospitalization by recurrence in stroke&#xD;
      follow-up; improvement of the patient's general condition, control of risk factors, reduction&#xD;
      in the number of events, decrease in the number of re-hospitalizations and their duration in&#xD;
      MI follow-up. The value of pharmacists' additional intervention in intensive post-MI&#xD;
      follow-up compared to routine follow-up has also been demonstrated, particularly in terms of&#xD;
      significant improvement in patient compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that 2 years of intensive follow-up for both post-stroke or post-MI&#xD;
      patients, by trained hospital and liberal nurses, in conjunction with doctors and&#xD;
      pharmacists, is of medico-economic interest compared to usual follow-up. Therefore a&#xD;
      medico-economic evaluation was designed to evaluate the efficiency of this model, which&#xD;
      combines community-based and recourse care, prevention and coordination of care compared to&#xD;
      usual follow-up.&#xD;
