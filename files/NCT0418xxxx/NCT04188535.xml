    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study to determine the feasibility and utility of using serial magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) to assess treatment response during and after radiation therapy&#xD;
      (standard of care cancer treatment) for participants with advanced esophageal cancer,&#xD;
      glioblastoma, prostate cancer, vulvar cancer or pediatric glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include three MRI scans (one pre treatment, during and post&#xD;
      standard care cancer radiation therapy) for participants with advanced esophageal cancer,&#xD;
      glioblastoma, prostate cancer, vulvar cancer or pediatric glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening for eligibility&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This phase 1, non randomized open label study, evaluating feasibility of serial MRI, with an&#xD;
      option for an expansion cohort. The optional expansion cohort is a prospective imaging&#xD;
      registry evaluating imaging biomarkers as predictors of disease control with standard of care&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a feasibility study, which means it is the first-time investigators at&#xD;
      this institution are examining the process of getting multiple MRIs during radiation&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared this MRI scanner for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial.&#xD;
