  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, single center, randomized controlled parallel group&#xD;
      open-label trial. Participants with insulin requiring diabetes mellitus who have been offered&#xD;
      an organ for living or deceased donor kidney transplantation will be recruited prior to&#xD;
      transplantation surgery. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to AP (6 patients) and&#xD;
      conventional treatment groups (3 patients). At the end of the subject's post-operative&#xD;
      in-patient stay, participants will have the option of wearing a blinded CGM at home for 4&#xD;
      weeks while treating themselves with multiple daily injections (MDI).&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to conduct a hypothesis-generating pilot study to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of the closed loop control in kidney transplant recipients with history&#xD;
      of insulin requiring diabetes mellitus in the early postoperative period.&#xD;

      This study will be a prospective, single center, randomized controlled parallel group&#xD;
      open-label trial. Participants with insulin requiring diabetes mellitus who have been offered&#xD;
      an organ for living or deceased donor kidney transplantation will be recruited prior to&#xD;
      transplantation surgery. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to AP (6 patients) and&#xD;
      conventional treatment groups (3 patients). At the end of the subject's post-operative&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age â‰¥18.0 years old at time of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of insulin requiring diabetes mellitus, type 1 or type 2, who have end stage&#xD;
             renal disease (ESRD)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Expected to undergo deceased or living donor kidney transplant surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of insulin prescription (past or current use)&#xD;

             and to use no other insulin besides lispro (Humalog) or aspart (Novolog) during the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;

             clinical trial (as a study investigator, coordinator, etc.); or having a first-degree&#xD;
             relative who is directly involved in conducting the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
