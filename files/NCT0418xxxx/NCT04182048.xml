  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A remote study to find out if a mobile phone application (HealthMode Stool) can serve as a&#xD;
      useful tool to track and characterize daily bowel movements. The application provides&#xD;
      participants with a single place to record their bowel movements either as a part of their&#xD;
      general health self-monitoring, or because they may be dealing with a bowel movement&#xD;
      condition. The minimal study duration is 1 month, and participants can continue using the&#xD;
      application up to 2 years.&#xD;
