  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Combination of anti-angiogenic molecular targeted therapy and anti- programmed cell death -1&#xD;
      immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has shown promising antitumor activity in multiple&#xD;
      cancer types, including patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The safety&#xD;
      profile and optimal dosage of targeted therapy should be carefully evaluated by clinical&#xD;
      trials. Regorafenib is one of the standard second-line systemic therapy for advanced HCC. The&#xD;
      present study will test the safety and efficacy of combination of regorafenib and&#xD;
      tislelizumab, an anti-programmed cell death-1 ICI. The investigator(s) thus hypothesized that&#xD;
      combination of tislelizumab and regorafenib is a tolerable regimen and may improve treatment&#xD;
      efficacy for patients with advanced HCC. The present study will explore safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of the combination of tislelizumab plus regorafenib as first-line therapy for advanced HCC.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combination of ICI with anti-angiogenic therapy has been most extensively studies in patients&#xD;
      with renal cell carcinoma, for whom both ICI and anti-angiogenic therapy have proven&#xD;
      anticancer activity as single-agent therapy. Objective response rate of 30-60% was observed,&#xD;
      far exceeding the response rate of single-agent therapy (around 20%). Results from several&#xD;
      early-phase trials of this type of combination also support the potential anti-tumor synergy&#xD;
      between ICI and anti-angiogenic therapy (multi-kinase inhibitors or monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway) in advanced HCC. Further&#xD;
      studies should focus on identifying the optimal targeted agent and its biologically effective&#xD;
      dosage to achieve the best therapeutic window for the treatment of HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current evidence indicated the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Combination of ICI and anti-angiogenic therapy in advanced HCC may have better&#xD;
           anti-tumor efficacy compared with single-agent therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The immune modulatory effects of the multi-kinase inhibitors may be achieved at dosage&#xD;
           lower than recommended for single-agent therapy in the clinic; using this lower dosage&#xD;
           when combined with ICI may lower the treatment-related adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objective response of 40% to 50% was recently reported in a phase 1 study of regorafenib&#xD;
           plus nivolumab for patients with advanced gastric or colorectal cancer was reported&#xD;
           recently (Fukuoka S, et al. American Society Of Clinical Oncology 2019, abstract#2522).&#xD;
           Grade 3 or greater treatment-related adverse events were found in 27% of subjects who&#xD;
           received regorafenib 80 mg per day and in 44% of patients who received regorafenib 120&#xD;
           mg per day. Therefore, regorafenib 80 mg/day was defined as the optimal dosage in&#xD;
           combination with nivolumab.&#xD;

During study drug treatment, dose delay/ interruption of regorafenib will be done depending on the occurrence and severity of regorafenib-related adverse events. After dose reduction of regorafenib, if the subjects tolerate the reduced dose of regorafenib well, the investigators may consider re-escalation of regorafenib to the previous dose level, depending on the types and severity of adverse events that led to dose reduction.</description>
