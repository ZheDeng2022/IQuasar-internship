  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, non-randomized combined basket- and umbrella trial divided&#xD;
      in two parts; a limited feasibility-oriented part 1 including 154 patients and 3 treatment&#xD;
      cohorts and part 2 that will include an expanded cohort of patients and treatment cohorts.&#xD;
      The overall aims of the study are to test the feasibility, safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      comprehensive genomic profiling on fresh tumor biopsies as a basis for treatment decision&#xD;
      making and to compare two different sequencing, bioinformatics and decision-making platforms&#xD;
      (part 1). Also to evaluate the efficacy and safety of off-label treatment with cancer drugs&#xD;
      in patients selected based on genomic biomarker matching.&#xD;

             patients must be progressive while on trial defined treatment or off-protocol&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Fresh tumor sampling by biopsy must be possible, except for patients with CNS&#xD;
             malignancy who can be included based on molecular analysis of archived tumor material.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ECOG performance status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have acceptable organ function as defined below:&#xD;

                  mL/min/1.73 m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have objectively measurable disease (by physical or radiographic&#xD;
             examination).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;

             bilateral tubal occlusion, or vasectomized partner, or sexual abstinence for the&#xD;
             duration of participation in the study, and four months following completion of study&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Selected tumor types might have disease-specific inclusion criteria, defined by&#xD;
             disease-specific study appendix.&#xD;

             hormonal other than for replacement) except for medications that are prescribed for&#xD;
             supportive care but may potentially have an anti-cancer effect (e.g., megestrol&#xD;
             acetate, bisphosphonates, somatostatin analogues and prednisone, or equivalent, &gt;5&#xD;
             mg/d). These medications must have been started ≥ 1 week prior to the screening visit&#xD;
             on this study. Radiotherapy to non-target lesions is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients of childbearing potential and sexually active and not willing to use highly&#xD;
             effective contraceptive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with known active progressive CNS metastases. Patients with previously&#xD;
             treated CNS metastases are eligible, provided that the patient has not experienced a&#xD;
             seizure or had a clinically significant change in neurological status within the 3&#xD;
             months prior to inclusion. All patients with previously treated CNS metastases must be&#xD;
             stable for at least 1 month after completion of treatment and off steroid treatment&#xD;
             prior to inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Some concomitant diseases qualified for exclusion as detailed in main protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Other serious underlying medical conditions, which, in the Investigator's judgment,&#xD;
             could impair the ability of the patient to participate in the trial.&#xD;
