  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immediate goal of this study is to collect biological samples (i.e., tissue and/or&#xD;
      fluid), clinical information, and laboratory data from disease and non-disease subjects seen&#xD;
      at Intermountain Healthcare affiliated facilities. The long-term goal is to annotate tissue&#xD;
      and/or fluid biomarker data to clinical information and laboratory data for the purpose of&#xD;
      improving health care delivery and prognostic potential.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of an observational, non-randomized, open, long-term study in diseased&#xD;
      and non-diseased subjects. There are no investigational treatments, drugs, or procedures&#xD;
      associated with subject participation. This study will consist of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group #1: Diseased subjects (including COVID-19 known positive subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group #2: Non-diseased subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
           The biological samples collected may be tested numerous times for genes/biomarkers, and&#xD;
           not yet-discovered genes/biomarkers, and other genetic and biological materials&#xD;
           associated with healthcare-related conditions. In some cases, cells or tissues may be&#xD;
           maintained in culture in order to study functions of living cells in both a healthy and&#xD;
           diseased state.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Disease subjects who qualify for this project (see inclusion and exclusion criteria)&#xD;
           will continue with their usual or specialized care for their underlying health-care&#xD;
           related condition(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Disease subjects (Group #1)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Other than the visit(s) for obtaining informed consent, the collection of biological&#xD;
           samples, and the hand dynamometer test, subjects will have no other responsibilities to&#xD;
           this project with regard to additional or follow-up visits, however sample collection&#xD;
           may continue at routine standard of care visits. The collection and storage of tissue&#xD;
           and/or fluid will be as the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The storage of tissue or fluid that is collected during a routine, standard of care&#xD;
                procedure(s) or treatment(s) that is leftover following clinical testing or is&#xD;
                otherwise discarded,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The storage of blood collected as a stand-alone blood draw procedure or during a&#xD;
                routine, standard of care blood draw procedure,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The storage of tissue or fluid that is collected separate from standard of care&#xD;
                procedures, such as a blood draw and/or buccal swab, and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The storage of additional tissue or fluid that is collected during a routine,&#xD;
                standard of care image guided biopsy (for example, collection of additional tumor&#xD;
                samples during a computed tomography guided biopsy) under the direction and&#xD;
                discretion of the interventional physician. Additional biopsies will be limited up&#xD;
                to 4 cores with the size of each core biopsy being equivalent to a grain of rice.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Biological samples will be collected as appropriate, based on the subject's underlying&#xD;
           healthcare related condition, either during a routine or specialized care procedure,&#xD;
           when other ordered lab work is done, or as a stand-alone sample collection.&#xD;
           Participating subjects may be asked to provide consent to one or more collections of&#xD;
           biological samples. Biological sample collection from the general population subjects&#xD;
           may be a separate blood draw and/or buccal swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Examples of the biological samples that may be collected are as follows (but not limited&#xD;
           to):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood/Plasma (up to 40 ml of blood)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ascites&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bone Marrow&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Buccal smear (cheek)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cartilage&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mucus&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Saliva&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sputum&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stool&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sweat&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Synovial fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tears&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tissue samples (e.g. muscle, skin, nails, tumor, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urine&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Seminal fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Genetic material extracted from any biological sample&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Other biological samples as identified by the Principal Investigator or&#xD;
                Co-Investigators and agreed by the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
           Buccal swab will be an alternative source of DNA when blood or other biological samples&#xD;
           cannot be obtained. In some instances, the remaining portion of specimens obtained for&#xD;
           diagnostic purposes will be used. The use of these residual clinical specimens may&#xD;
           sometimes (but not always) make the collection of a blood specimen by venipuncture&#xD;
           unnecessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prior to each blood draw (i.e., at stand alone or part of standard of care if the&#xD;
           investigators are performing the blood draw), or other biological sample collection,&#xD;
           subjects will perform 3 maximal effort handgrip strength tests. In a seated position&#xD;
           with the elbow bent to 90 degrees of flexion, each contraction will be 3 seconds in&#xD;
           duration. Contractions will be separated by 60 seconds of rests. All contractions will&#xD;
           be performed by the patients-reported dominant hand. The investigators will record the&#xD;
           peak force from each contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients that have been previously tested for COVID-19 will be uniquely handled.&#xD;
           Specifically, Intermountain Healthcare patients previously tested and with a known&#xD;
           positive or negative COVID-19 result available in the Intermountain Healthcare&#xD;
           electronic medical records will be recruited for study participation. Subjects will&#xD;
           undergo a remote phone script electronic consent procedures for the purpose of&#xD;
           collecting saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Saliva samples will be collected once in each subject at the Intermountain Healthcare&#xD;
           locations identified below. It is possible, however, that a second sample may be needed.&#xD;
           Reason for the collection of a second saliva sample may include, but is not limited to:&#xD;
           confirmational testing of the first sample, the first sample was inadvertently&#xD;
           compromised or destroyed, or for other unforeseeable reasons, such as virus exposure&#xD;
           after the initial sample was collected. Subjects that consented to this study may&#xD;
           provide an additional sample(s) for up to 1-year after enrollment if they feel like they&#xD;
           have been in contact or exposed to COVID-19. Approximately 2.0 mL of saliva will be&#xD;
           collected with each saliva kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Saliva collection kits (see below for description) for Intermountain Healthcare&#xD;
           providers will be available for pick-up at the following sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  COVID-19 screening location on the Dixie Regional Medical Center campus,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primary Outpatient Laboratory at Dixie Regional Medical Center,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dixie Regional Cancer Center Laboratory, and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Eccles Outpatient Laboratory Intermountain Medical Center (Murray, UT)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Saliva samples will be dropped-off at the location where the kits are available. Kits&#xD;
           are not required to be dropped-off at the same location as pick-up. When necessary,&#xD;
           saliva kits will be mailed to subjects with the appropriate material for an expedited&#xD;
           return to Precision Genomics at the Intermountain Healthcare - Cancer Center (St.&#xD;
           George, UT). Saliva samples may be obtained during the caregivers' routine shift&#xD;
           (preferably at the end of their shift).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Saliva will be collected using a self-collection kit (Zymo Research, Irvin, CA USA,&#xD;
           catalog #: R1210) that provides the materials and instructions for collecting and&#xD;
           stabilizing the specimens. We anticipate sample collection to take 2 to 5 minutes. After&#xD;
           collection, saliva samples will be sent or delivered to the Intermountain Healthcare&#xD;
           Cancer Center (St. George, UT). Samples will be immediately de-identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Saliva samples will be tested for the presence of COVID-19 using a previously published&#xD;
           rtPCR-based protocol to specifically detect COVID-19 RNA at Precision Genomics&#xD;
           (Intermountain Healthcare, Cancer Center, St. George, UT USA). Saliva samples may also&#xD;
           undergo various genotyping, whole genome sequencing, transcriptomic interrogation, and&#xD;
           proteomic analyses, and may be tested numerous times for genomic and/or genetic&#xD;
           biomarkers, and not-yet-discovered genes/biomarkers, and other genetic and biological&#xD;
           materials associated with healthcare-related conditions in other follow-up studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although we anticipate utilizing the procedures described above, the challenges&#xD;
           associated with this novel virus may require the necessity of implementing a variety of&#xD;
           different assays and procedures to develop a robust and valid testing procedure.&#xD;
           Therefore, it is plausible that DNA will be analyzed by downstream molecular&#xD;
           technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, digital drop polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
           (ddPCR), and other proteomic and molecular analyses. With that said, all data analyses&#xD;
           and analytical procedures will be performed at Intermountain Healthcare's - Precision&#xD;
           Genomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Negative results will not be returned to subjects. In the case of a positive&#xD;
           research-based test result, a clinical research coordinator will contact and direct the&#xD;
           participant to obtain another COVID-19 test at participating Intermountain Healthcare&#xD;
           COVID-19 testing sites. We expect results from the research-based screening test to be&#xD;
           returned within 24-hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although not likely, there is a possibility that an Intermountain Healthcare patient&#xD;
           with a previously known negative test could test positive with the COVID-19 testing&#xD;
           performed with participation in this study. In this situation, the subject will be&#xD;
           informed of the new positive test result and immediately advised to seek conformational&#xD;
           testing at a nearby COVID-19 screening location.&#xD;
&#xD;
           DNA extraction from the biological samples will be performed and stored at the&#xD;
           Translational Science Center in St. George, UT USA. For novel disease-causing gene&#xD;
           searches that may be done, biological samples will be sent to collaborating laboratories&#xD;
           and/or organizations, depending on the needed specialty and the likelihood of finding a&#xD;
           novel gene. If researchers or the consulting laboratory require additional information&#xD;
           in order to perform phenotype/genotype correlation studies, results from tests such as&#xD;
           standard physical examinations may be requested. These tests will be requested and/or&#xD;
           conducted through the subject's primary care physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Non-disease subjects (Group #2)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Other than the visit for obtaining informed consent, the collection of biological&#xD;
           samples, and the hand dynamometer test, subjects will have no other responsibilities to&#xD;
           this project with regard to additional or follow-up visits, however sample collection&#xD;
           may continue at routine standard of care visits. The collection and storage of tissue&#xD;
           and/or fluid will be as the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The storage of tissue or fluid that is collected during an elective-surgical&#xD;
                procedure (such as anterior cruciate ligament surgery) that is otherwise discarded,&#xD;
                and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The storage of tissue or fluid that is collected separate from standard of care&#xD;
                procedures, such as an elective and consented blood draw and/or buccal swab&#xD;
                procedure for the storage and use of the subject's blood for various analytical&#xD;
                procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study duration&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is no planned end-date for this project; therefore, the study duration is&#xD;
           indefinite for the recruitment of subjects, collection of biological samples, and/or for&#xD;
           completion of the project. All biological samples collected and patient information&#xD;
           obtained will be archived in long-term storage at an Intermountain Healthcare facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects may be screened at all participating facilities within Intermountain&#xD;
           Healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Following screening and recruitment into the project, and after samples are obtained,&#xD;
           participating subjects will not have any other follow up or non-standard of care visits&#xD;
           required by this project, however sample collection may continue at routine standard of&#xD;
           care visits. For this project, subjects give consent for unrestricted use of his/her&#xD;
           sample(s), i.e. the sample(s) will be used indefinitely, until it is gone or until the&#xD;
           patient withdraws consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Enrollment is open-ended in this study, and therefore, there is no planned targeted&#xD;
           enrollment accrual.&#xD;
