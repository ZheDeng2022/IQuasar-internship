      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the intensive care of patients with life-threatening brain illnesses has advanced&#xD;
      tremendously, a large number of therapies are still without proper scientific support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This can be partly explained by the fact that mechanisms of initial brain injury are still&#xD;
      not well understood. Why additional neurological injury occurs during a patient's stay in the&#xD;
      NeuroCritical Care Unit (NCCU) despite current best, evidence-based clinical practices, is&#xD;
      also not well understood. However, over the past decade, better tools have become available&#xD;
      to measure and monitor the impact of our clinical care on the rapidly changing physiology and&#xD;
      chemistry of the injured brain. Some of these tools are CT, MRI, ultrasound, and&#xD;
      catheter-based technology measuring blood flow and metabolism. These tools have enabled&#xD;
      earlier detection of injury and complications and newer therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examine disease pathways common to all brain injuries seen in the University of Maryland's&#xD;
      22-bed NCCU. Life-threatening neurological illnesses cared for in the NCCU include massive&#xD;
      stroke, bleeding in and around the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage,&#xD;
      subdural hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage), brain tumors, difficult to control&#xD;
      seizures, neurologic infections, nerve and muscle diseases (such as myasthenia gravis or&#xD;
      Guillain-Barre Syndrome), and spinal cord disorders among others. Many NCCU patients are&#xD;
      comatose or paralyzed and may suffer injuries in other parts of the body as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This effort will require the creation of a robust clinical database for the capture of data&#xD;
      including patient characteristics (age, sex), clinical characteristics, medical treatments,&#xD;
      surgical interventions, physiological data (such as vital signs, cerebral blood flow,&#xD;
      intracranial pressure, cerebral oximetry, etc), laboratory data, and standard-of-care&#xD;
      diagnostic studies such as electroencephalography (EEG), ultrasound, CT, MRI, and angiograms.&#xD;
      Similar databases exist at other major centers for neurocritical care and have been&#xD;
      instrumental to the identification of characteristics both predictive of and associated with&#xD;
      outcomes of patients long after their stay in the NCCU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the samples collected will be included in the University of Maryland Medicine&#xD;
      (UMM) Biorepository which is a shared resource to enable biomedical research by University of&#xD;
      Maryland faculty.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed minimal-risk, non-interventional retrospective (January 2012&#xD;
      onwards) as well as prospective, cross-sectional observational study (i.e., NCCU Research&#xD;
      Repository) is to better understand the common pathophysiological pathways of&#xD;
      life-threatening neurological illnesses, examine how systemic complications (e.g., fever,&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, undernutrition, and infections) and our standard-of care management of them&#xD;
      may exacerbate brain injury, and determine the impact of injury and intervention on&#xD;
      functionally-relevant outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematically collected cohort may have an especially important role in the NCCU where&#xD;
      RCTs are difficult to implement or may lack generalizability, and wherein there are pitfalls&#xD;
      in research derived solely from administrative databases. This relational database will&#xD;
      capture all patients admitted to University of Maryland's dedicated 22-bed adult NCCU. The&#xD;
      investigators will not initially collect all potentially relevant fields unique to specific&#xD;
      diagnoses. However, future disease-specific studies will allow the addition of data fields in&#xD;
      this flexible database environment. This approach will include the tiered acquisition of&#xD;
      patient characteristics (age, sex), clinical characteristics, standard-of-care medical&#xD;
      treatments and surgical interventions, physiological data (such as vital signs, cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow, intracranial pressure, cerebral oximetry etc), laboratory data, and diagnostic&#xD;
      studies--particularly neurophysiology, neuropathology, and neuroimaging. Some data elements&#xD;
      are inherently less reliable when abstracted from the electronic medical record (e.g., a more&#xD;
      detailed social history, establishing premorbid functional status, and independent&#xD;
      confirmation of past medical history), and will require an informed consent process to allow&#xD;
      the research team to approach subjects or their surrogates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar databases exist at other centers for neurocritical care and have been central to the&#xD;
      identification of characteristics, both predictive and associative, of patient outcomes. Done&#xD;
      properly, this repository can facilitate many NCCU priorities including hypothesis&#xD;
      generating, determining feasibility of single-site trials or involvement in multi-center&#xD;
      trials, multimodal monitoring, biomarker research, quality improvement, and resident&#xD;
      education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be collected from the patient medical record, patient bedside monitors,&#xD;
      radiology PACS, and laboratory systems. The collection of data will not affect nor delay&#xD;
      patient treatment at any instance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will include patients admitted to University of Maryland's 22-bed NCCU for&#xD;
      treatment of a life-threatening neurological illness. All patients 18 years of age and older&#xD;
      will be eligible for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time study personnel approach the patient or the patient's surrogate to discuss the&#xD;
      study, they will be provided with three options: (a) Full Consent, (b) Partial Refusal, or&#xD;
      (c) Complete Refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject's medical treatment will conform to existing clinical management protocols including&#xD;
      routine ICU care. Standard ICU protocols call for assessments of mental status several times&#xD;
      a day. The investigators would like to prospectively record the results of these exams in a&#xD;
      rigorous, standardized manner. The investigators will attempt to correlate these assessments&#xD;
      with clinical events and outcome. In addition to standard clinical treatment, details of each&#xD;
      subject's hospitalization, demographic profile, past medical history, family history will be&#xD;
      obtained by questionnaire and chart review. At discharge or 2 weeks after admission, a brief&#xD;
      examination and mental status test will be performed. The subject and a family member or&#xD;
      caregiver may also be asked to return for follow up evaluations 3 and 12 months after initial&#xD;
      brain or spinal cord injury, in order to evaluate their longterm neurological status,&#xD;
      disability, emotional status, cognitive functioning, and overall quality of life. These&#xD;
      interviews may be conducted in person and will take approximately one hour each. For those&#xD;
      patients unable to return in person, a shorter telephone interview will be conducted. Outcome&#xD;
      measures may include the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale&#xD;
      (eGOS), Modified Rankin Scale, Lawton Activities of Daily Living Index, Barthel Index,&#xD;
      Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), NIH Stroke Scale, psychosocial assessments, memory and&#xD;
      cognitive neuropsychometric tests (e.g. the Montreal Cognitive Assessment-MoCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables recorded during hospitalization will be examined for statistical correlation with&#xD;
      neuropsychometric test results. Candidate pathophysiologic variables with independent&#xD;
      predictive value for cognitive dysfunction, (e.g., including severity of illness upon&#xD;
      admission, hydrocephalus, ischemia from vasospasm, and laboratory test results) will be&#xD;
      identified using Pearson correlation and forward stepwise logistic regression. Relationships&#xD;
      between acute pathology (e.g., lesions on neuroimaging or malignant electrical patterns on&#xD;
      electroencephalography) and dysfunction within various cognitive domains (memory, attention,&#xD;
      visuospatial ability, language) will be examined using contingency tables, Pearson&#xD;
      correlation, linear regression, and the Wilcoxon signed rank test. If necessary, multivariate&#xD;
      models will be used to confirm that significant independent relationships exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be analyzed to identify the factors causing secondary brain injury (e.g.,&#xD;
      the narrowing of the blood vessels (vasospasm) after initial hemorrhage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients requiring an External Ventricular Drain (EVD) as part of their medical&#xD;
      treatment, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is drained into a collection bag, the amount of&#xD;
      drainage recorded and the CSF discarded. The investigators may collect a 1 cc sample of the&#xD;
      CSF daily prior to discard until it is medically warranted to remove the EVD or 14 days&#xD;
      whichever comes first. NO EVD will be placed for the purposes of clinical research.&#xD;
