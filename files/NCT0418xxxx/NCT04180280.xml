  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retention in care and persistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy is necessary for the&#xD;
      successful treatment of HIV infection. Alcohol use is known to impede the health care and&#xD;
      health outcomes of people living with HIV. The proposed comparative effectiveness study will&#xD;
      evaluate the outcomes as well as the facilitators and barriers to implementing a theory-based&#xD;
      alcohol counseling intervention that objectively monitors HIV treatment adherence with&#xD;
      corrective feedback and increases care engagement delivered by cell phone in resource limited&#xD;
      clinical settings.&#xD;

      This application proposes to evaluate the implementation of a theory-based HIV care&#xD;
      enhancement and alcohol treatment intervention delivered by cell phone to patients in urban&#xD;
      and rural areas. Engagement, retention, and adherence to care are necessary to achieve HIV&#xD;
      suppression and antiretroviral therapy (ART) non-adherence can lead to treatment resistant&#xD;
      genetic variants of HIV. People living with HIV often experience difficulty sustaining&#xD;
      high-levels of treatment adherence and alcohol use is known to impede HIV care. Most factors&#xD;
      that interfere with adherence to care are unanticipated and occur between clinical visits,&#xD;
      including depression, ART side effects, and substance use. We will conduct a comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness study to evaluate the implementation of a cell phone-delivered theory-based&#xD;
      alcohol treatment and HIV care adherence counseling intervention. The intervention is&#xD;
      grounded in the Behavioral Self-Regulation Model and utilizes brief cell phone counseling&#xD;
      that includes monitoring adherence, provider support, and guided corrective feedback as well&#xD;
      as interactive text message check-ins. This proactive approach with patients who drink is&#xD;
      intended to increase engagement in care and facilitate reductions in drinking thereby&#xD;
      improving retention to care and health outcomes. Brief counseling conducted via cell phones&#xD;
      allows providers to detect and correct patient slippage from their care plan within a&#xD;
      timeframe that can head-off missed appointments, ART non-adherence, and viral resistance. The&#xD;
      intervention also includes interactive text (SMS) messaging that begins weekly and tappers&#xD;
      off to further enhance engagement in care. Participants are 200 men and 200 women living in&#xD;
      high-HIV prevalence remote communities who actively use alcohol and are receiving HIV&#xD;
      treatment. Following screening, informed consent, and baseline assessments, participants will&#xD;
      be allocated to either (a) the mobile alcohol behavioral self-regulation counseling&#xD;
      enhancement to their usual care or (b) routine services provided in their usual care.&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for 12-months post-intervention. The primary endpoints are&#xD;
      retention to care, medication adherence assessed by unannounced pill counts and HIV RNA&#xD;
      (viral load). The study will also evaluate the implementation processes including&#xD;
      facilitators and barriers to engagement in care and a cost accounting of resources expended&#xD;
      to achieve optimal outcomes. A team of internationally recognized experts in HIV treatment&#xD;
      and behavioral research will form a working group to guide an in-depth implementation and&#xD;
      cost evaluation. This study will inform the implementation of low-cost evidence-based care&#xD;
      retention and adherence interventions in resource limited settings.&#xD;
