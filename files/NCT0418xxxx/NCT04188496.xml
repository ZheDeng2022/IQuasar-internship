      Stroke a neurological disorder leads to long term disability and decline in overall quality&#xD;
      of life. Pulmonary Functions are usually impaired in individuals with stroke. The common&#xD;
      findings associated with pulmonary functions in Stroke patients are Decreased lung volumes,&#xD;
      decreased pulmonary perfusion and vital capacity and altered chest wall excursion. For stroke&#xD;
      patients, general rehabilitation programs, only aims towards their functional recovery of the&#xD;
      body. The main focus of this study was to integrate intervention and implement them in&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs that are related to respiration are more effective for improving&#xD;
      functional activities.in stroke patients. The study was carried out to determine the effects&#xD;
      of thoracic Joint Mobilization on Pulmonary Functions of patients with stroke.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Stroke is defined as sudden neurological deficit due to an abnormality in&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow, with sign and symptoms lasting for more than 24 hours. Strokes can be&#xD;
      grouped into two fundamental classification according to the American Stroke Association&#xD;
      (ASA), first is ischemic (87%) and the second is Hemorrhagic (13%). In epidemiological and&#xD;
      genetic studies a stroke subtype classification is useful indicator in our clinical practice.&#xD;
      Many serious physical and cognitive deficits results due to injury to the brain tissue.&#xD;
      Depending upon the region of the brain that is involved and amount of damage, a person can&#xD;
      recovers from stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke is associated with many primary and secondary complications. Here mentioned some&#xD;
      primary complications. Sensation, Pain, Visual changes, Motor Function, Weakness, Alternation&#xD;
      in Tone, Abnormal Reflexes, Altered Coordination, Altered Postural control and Balance. The&#xD;
      main Indirect or secondary complications are Musculoskeletal Complications, Neurological&#xD;
      Complications, Cardiovascular Complications, Pulmonary Complications, and Integumentary&#xD;
      Complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary Functions are usually impaired in individuals with stroke. The common findings&#xD;
      associated with pulmonary functions in Stroke patients are Decreased lung volumes, decreased&#xD;
      pulmonary perfusion and vital capacity and altered chest wall excursion. Individuals with&#xD;
      stroke are, associated with dysphagia which leads to dehydration and compromised nutrition.&#xD;
      Dysphagia has been related with enlarged risk of pulmonary difficulties and also death.&#xD;
      According to research evidence primary findings of dysphagia in patients having acute stroke&#xD;
      significantly decreases complications. It also decreases the length of hospital stay and&#xD;
      overall health expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysphagia further leads to Aspiration. Aspiration, is penetration of food, liquid, saliva or&#xD;
      gastric reflux into the airways. It usually occurs in acute phase of recovery or during&#xD;
      swallowing. Aspiration is an important complication and can leads to aspiration pneumonia if&#xD;
      left untreated, death can occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impaired Pulmonary functions limits physical activities as well. Because the decreased&#xD;
      respiratory output is accompanied by increased oxygen demands required during altered&#xD;
      movement patterns in stroke. Furthermore people with stroke usually undergo irregular&#xD;
      breathing because of damage to the respiratory muscles (such as Diaphragm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to paralyzed respiratory muscles lungs and thorax cannot be sufficiently dilated. If this&#xD;
      condition persists the thoracic tissues may become shortened and thoracic muscles undergo&#xD;
      fibrosis to reduce the compliance of thorax. This leads to various complications like&#xD;
      atelectasis, changes in muscles forces, which directly or indirectly obstruct the performance&#xD;
      of daily living activities, and asymmetrical postures or movement foam, which may hamper the&#xD;
      stability of motion there by.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In stroke patients the respiratory functions are affected both directly and indirectly by the&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary performance because they experience a deterioration in cardiovascular&#xD;
      functioning and pulse rate. This disturbs the oxygen delivery and decline in the activity of&#xD;
      the chest wall on the paralyzed side and its electrical activities. The changes in breathing&#xD;
      mechanism and respiratory efficiency reflects about the extent of loss in the activity of&#xD;
      chest wall, loss of symmetry and the extent of muscular paralysis of stroke patients. To&#xD;
      correct above mentioned difficulties it is significant to have expansion of chest wall, to&#xD;
      improve lung ventilation and to have suitable volume and capacities of lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned above stroke is accompanied by many secondary complications due to nervous&#xD;
      system and musculoskeletal system insufficiencies related through brain impairments. Amongst&#xD;
      many problems pulmonary disorders are further, strictly associated to life, difficulties with&#xD;
      respiration and swallowing as well as language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct restrictive impairments accompanied due to non-utilization of paralyzed muscles and&#xD;
      their trouble with movement elicits a secondarily decrease in cardiopulmonary functioning.&#xD;
      Due to this, non-symmetric trunk encourages insufficient energy use related to gait, causing&#xD;
      reduction in exercise endurance. Patients having hemiplegia due to stroke experiences&#xD;
      deviated movement in posture, abnormal movement of trunk and motor control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Now a day's people preserve static posture for long periods due to which occurrence of&#xD;
      cervical lordosis along with thoracic and lumbar kyphosis is growing day by day. Due to an&#xD;
      inclination in thoracic kyphosis, restriction in expansion of chest and respiratory weakness&#xD;
      of muscles occurs, thus decreasing lungs capacity and size of the thoracic cavity and&#xD;
      distorting vertebral column arrangement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study focuses on the effects of thoracic joints mobilization and its effects on enhancing&#xD;
      the pulmonary functions in stroke patients. Generally Rehabilitation programs target towards&#xD;
      functional recovery of body. They neglect enhancement of cardiopulmonary system functioning.&#xD;
      If investigator incorporate interventions related to respiration along with functional&#xD;
      recovery, it possibly be additionally effective in stroke patients for enhancing functional&#xD;
      doings such as gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies shows the effects of mobilization and its effects on pulmonary function. A study&#xD;
      on The Immediate Effect of Chest Mobilization Technique on Chest Expansion in Patients of&#xD;
      COPD with Restrictive Impairment. This study concluded that mobilization of rib cage joints&#xD;
      improve ribcage mobility and reduced obstructive lung disease. Chest wall mobilization also&#xD;
      improves the mobility of chest wall, reduces respiratory rate, increases tidal volume,&#xD;
      improves ventilation, reduces dyspnea, decreases work of breathing and facilitate relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study focuses on, the effect of thoracic region self-mobilization on chest expansion&#xD;
      and pulmonary function. The purpose of this study was to find out the effects of thoracic&#xD;
      region self-mobilization on chest expansion and pulmonary function in healthy adults. The&#xD;
      outcome measures included in this study were to measure chest expansion during breathing,&#xD;
      pulmonary functions, and expected pulmonary functions. There was no noteworthy change in&#xD;
      pulmonary functions among intervention and control group. There was a noteworthy change in&#xD;
      chest expansion between intervention and control group. Hence concluded that thoracic region&#xD;
      self-mobilization is helpful for improving chest expansion in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study focuses on the effects of thoracic joints mobilization and its effects on pulmonary&#xD;
      functions in stroke patients. Generally Rehabilitation programs target towards functional&#xD;
      recovery of body. They neglect enhancement of cardiopulmonary system functioning. If&#xD;
      investigator incorporate interventions related to respiration along with functional recovery,&#xD;
      it possibly be additionally effective in stroke patients for enhancing functional doings such&#xD;
      as gait.&#xD;
