  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Pressure Recording Analytical Method, invasive hemodynamic monitoring, is an uncalibrated&#xD;
      pulse contour analysis, installed in the Mostcare® system that allows a continuous estimation&#xD;
      of the stroke volume and thus the cardiac output, by the relationship between the area under&#xD;
      the curve of the systolic portion of the arterial blood pressure curve and the dynamic&#xD;
      impedance of the cardiovascular system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are to determine if the parameters measured by Mostcare® make it&#xD;
      possible to predict the response to volume expansion in pediatric surgical critical care&#xD;
      patients, sedated, intubated and ventilated, by comparing the changes in stroke volume,&#xD;
      induced by a volume expansion, measured by trans-thoracic echocardiography.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children undergoing major surgery or severe trauma with bleeding require regular hemodynamic&#xD;
      evaluation, including cardiac output measurement, to maintain adequate organ perfusion. In&#xD;
      fact, administration of fluid to improve cardiac output is the mainstay of hemodynamic&#xD;
      resuscitation. However, not all patients respond to fluid therapy, and excessive fluid&#xD;
      administration is harmful. Therefore, the vascular filling strategy requires a thorough&#xD;
      hemodynamic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many predictive tools for fluid responsiveness have been validated in adults, and are based&#xD;
      on heart-lung interaction in ventilated patients. Up to now, respiratory variation in aortic&#xD;
      blood flow peak velocity, measured by transthoracic or transoesophageal cardiac&#xD;
      echocardiography, is the only variable shown to effectively predict fluid responsiveness in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the use of these methods does not allow continuous monitoring (trans-thoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography) or is not easily achievable in current practice (trans-esophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography). In addition, these monitoring tools require learning and inter- and&#xD;
      intra-individual variability is not negligible, ranging from 1% to 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pressure Recording Analytical Method, invasive hemodynamic monitoring, is an uncalibrated&#xD;
      pulse contour analysis, installed in the Mostcare® system, that allows a continuous&#xD;
      estimation of the stroke volume and thus of the cardiac output, by the relationship between&#xD;
      the area under the curve of the systolic portion of the arterial blood pressure curve and the&#xD;
      dynamic impedance of the cardiovascular system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to assess the ability of dynamic cardiovascular variables measured&#xD;
      using Mostcare® to predict fluid responsiveness in pediatric surgical critical care patients,&#xD;
      sedated, intubated and ventilated, in prone position, by comparing the changes in stroke&#xD;
      volume (SV), induced by a volume expansion (VE), measured by trans-thoracic echocardiography.&#xD;
      For the purpose of the study, responders (Rs) to VE are patients showing an increase in SV&#xD;
      measured using transthoracic echocardiography of at least 15% after VE.&#xD;
