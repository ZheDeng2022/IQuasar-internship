  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biomedical and Engineering approaches form a key element to neurological rehabilitation of&#xD;
      upper limbs. Brain Computer Interface (BCI) using Motor execution and Motor Imagery are known&#xD;
      to aid motor recovery in stroke. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that Noninvasive&#xD;
      Sensorimotor Rhythm (SMR) based EEG based BCI using motor execution and Motor Imagery tasks&#xD;
      can aid in rehabilitation of upper limb movements in chronic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project aims to explore an SMR-based BCI system that can exploit the sensorimotor rhythm&#xD;
      voluntary modulation to play a virtual game as neurofeedback using motor executory tasks and&#xD;
      imagined hand movements by stroke patients, who suffer from upper limb disability.&#xD;

      Brain Computer Interface (BCI) using Motor execution and Motor Imagery are known to aid motor&#xD;
      recovery in stroke. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that Noninvasive Sensorimotor&#xD;
      Rhythm (SMR) based EEG based BCI using motor execution and Motor Imagery tasks can aid in&#xD;
      rehabilitation of upper limb movements in chronic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project aims to explore an SMR-based BCI system that can exploit the sensorimotor rhythm&#xD;
      voluntary modulation to play a virtual game as neurofeedback using motor executory tasks and&#xD;
      imagined hand movements by stroke patients, who suffer from upper limb disability. Studies&#xD;
      have shown that movement and motor imagery (MI) (i.e., the mental rehearsal of a movement&#xD;
      without any activation of the muscles) induce similar EEG patterns over the motor cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Movement execution, preparation and even observation are usually accompanied by a decrease in&#xD;
      µ- and β-rhythm in the cortical area representing the involved body segment. Such a reduction&#xD;
      is called event-related desynchronization (ERD).The increase in µ-rhythm, i.e. event-related&#xD;
      synchronization (ERS), is observed in the regions of the brain representing body segments,&#xD;
      which are not involved in the task.This study is a pilot study to examine the feasibility of&#xD;
      a SMR based EEG BCI using motor task and motor imagery and involve a gaming feedback for&#xD;
      same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first two days will be used for calibrating the BMI using commands in computer screen&#xD;
      followed by further two days for testing the BMI and feedback control during gaming in&#xD;
      computer to move the ball in the computer screen.&#xD;
