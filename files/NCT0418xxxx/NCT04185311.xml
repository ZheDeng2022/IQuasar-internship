    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies talimogene laherparepvec given together with ipilimumab and&#xD;
      nivolumab before surgery in patients with triple-negative or estrogen receptor positive, HER2&#xD;
      negative localized breast cancer. Ipilimumab and Nivolumab are immune checkpoint inhibitors&#xD;
      that enhance immune response towards cancer cells. Talimogene laherparepvec is a modifies&#xD;
      human herpes virus 1 that is an oncolytic virus targeting cancer cells and makes tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment more immunogenic to promote immune response against cancer. This study will&#xD;
      assess the safety and efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec, ipilimumab, and nivolumab, and&#xD;
      provide an insight for further improvement of immunotherapy in breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore the safety of talimogene laherparepvec in combination with nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab in this population assessed by the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
      using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)4.0 toxicity&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess tumor response of talimogene laherparepvec in combination with nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab comparing to no treatment, in subjects with localized estrogen receptor (ER)&#xD;
      positive and triple negative infiltrating ductal breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Descriptively analyze the evidence of tumor necrosis and inflammatory infiltration on&#xD;
      histopathological examination and immuno-oncological findings in tumor and peripheral blood&#xD;
      of patients treated with talimogene laherparepvec in combination with nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Descriptively compare tumor response in patients whose tumors are PD-L1 positive (+) and&#xD;
      PD-L1 negative (-) at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the baseline mutational load of patients at the start of treatment and relate&#xD;
      it to the response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine if hormone receptor status correlates with tumor responses. IV. Determine the&#xD;
      number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in patient samples at the start and at the end of&#xD;
      treatment and relate them to tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Analyze T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and peripheral&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive talimogene laherparepvec intratumorally on days 1, 22, and 36, nivolumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 15, 29, and 43, and ipilimumab IV over 90&#xD;
      minutes on days 1 and 43 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;
