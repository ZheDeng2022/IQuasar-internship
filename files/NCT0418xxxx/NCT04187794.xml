  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A medication non-adherence is reported in chronic rheumatic diseases, in a context of complex&#xD;
      and long-term treatments (injectable/per os targeted therapies, biosimilar...). Understanding&#xD;
      and integrating the patient into a shared medical decision are key factors for adherence.&#xD;
      From this perspective, the level of literacy (an individual's ability to find, understand and&#xD;
      use health information) must be explored in order to adapt the communication of information.&#xD;
      These are currently insufficiently adapted to the individual understanding of patients. In&#xD;
      practice, literacy assessment is very poorly integrated into routine care, while several&#xD;
      tools are validated in French. In rheumatology, foreign studies have shown that literacy is&#xD;
      positively related to knowledge level. The results remain contradictory regarding its&#xD;
      association with medication adherence. Today, the literacy level of patients with rheumatic&#xD;
      diseases and its impact on adherence has not been studied in France, although these&#xD;
      evaluations would be useful to adapt interventions individually. The acceptance of patients&#xD;
      to complete a literacy assessment questionnaire during their care should also be analysed as&#xD;
      a condition of its deployment.&#xD;
