  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well the combination of decitabine, venetoclax, and ponatinib&#xD;
      work for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute myeloid leukemia or myeloid&#xD;
      blast phase or accelerated phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy&#xD;
      such as decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;
      Venetoclax may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer&#xD;
      cell survival. Ponatinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Giving decitabine, venetoclax, and ponatinib may help to control&#xD;
      Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute myeloid leukemia or myeloid blast phase or accelerated&#xD;
      phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of the regimen, as defined by the rate of complete remission&#xD;
      (CR) or CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine efficacy outcomes, including rate of minimal residual disease negativity by&#xD;
      flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for BCR-ABL1 transcripts, median&#xD;
      relapse-free survival, and median overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the proportion of patients proceeding to allogeneic stem cell transplant&#xD;
      (ASCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To preliminarily determine the safety of the combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of single-agent ponatinib on apoptotic proteins and Bcl-2&#xD;
      dependency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate apoptotic protein expression and Bcl-2 dependency on response and resistance&#xD;
      to the combination regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients recently (within 2 weeks of anticipated start date) treated with ponatinib receive&#xD;
      ponatinib orally (PO) daily on days 1-21 of cycle 1 and days 1-28 of subsequent cycles,&#xD;
      venetoclax PO daily on days 1-21, and decitabine intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days&#xD;
      1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who have not been recently (within 2 weeks of&#xD;
      anticipated start date) treated with ponatinib may receive ponatinib monotherapy PO daily on&#xD;
      days 1-7 before starting combination therapy with venetoclax in cycle 1. After completion of&#xD;
      ponatinib lead-in, patients will receive ponatinib PO daily on days 1-21 of cycle 1 and on&#xD;
      days 1-28 of subsequent cycles, venetoclax PO daily on days 8-28 of cycle 1 and days 1-21 of&#xD;
      subsequent cycles, and decitabine IV over 60 minutes on days 8-12 of cycle 1 and days 1-5 of&#xD;
      subsequent cycles. For these patients, cycle 1 is 35 days in duration and cycles 2-24 repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days then every 6 months&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
