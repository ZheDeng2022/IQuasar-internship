      I. MEASURES ASSESSED IN THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection of measures to be evaluated in the study was based on the scientific literature&#xD;
      review and personal interest of the researchers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measures related to dietary supplements:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. knowledge about dietary supplements (KaDS) - assessed with a 17-item KaDS&#xD;
                questionnaire, which was developed as a Polish version by Karbownik et al. (2019).&#xD;
                A respondent will be asked to rate each of the 17 statements concerning dietary&#xD;
                supplements as &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. KaDS will be primarily coded as a sum of both&#xD;
                General and Specific questionnaire subscales. KaDS will be operationalized as an&#xD;
                18-level ordinal variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. self-rated sources of KaDS - assessed separately for 5 categories: &quot;medical&#xD;
                doctors&quot;, &quot;pharmacists&quot;, &quot;dietitians&quot;, &quot;friends (with no medical education)&quot;,&#xD;
                &quot;media (magazines, TV, radio, Internet)&quot;. A single-item question will be asked for&#xD;
                each category: &quot;to what extent do you get knowledge about dietary supplements&#xD;
                from...?&quot;. Each category will be operationalized as a 4-level ordinal variable&#xD;
                (from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;to a large extent&quot;). TV - television.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. use of dietary supplements (UoDS) - assessed with a single-item question: &quot;have you&#xD;
                used any dietary supplements within the past 30 days?&quot;. UoDS will be&#xD;
                operationalized as a 2-level categorical variable (&quot;no&quot; and &quot;yes&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. positive personal experience with dietary supplements - assessed with a single-item&#xD;
                question: &quot;if you take dietary supplement, do you feel it helps you?&quot;. The measure&#xD;
                will be operationalized as a 3-level categorical variable (&quot;no&quot;, &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;not&#xD;
                applicable, I don't use dietary supplements&quot;). Cases presenting &quot;not applicable...&quot;&#xD;
                response, will be coded in the analyses as &quot;no&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. negative personal experience with dietary supplements - assessed with a single-item&#xD;
                question: &quot;if you take dietary supplement, do you feel it hurts you?&quot;. The measure&#xD;
                will be operationalized as a 3-level categorical variable (&quot;no&quot;, &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;not&#xD;
                applicable, I don't use dietary supplements&quot;). Cases presenting &quot;not applicable...&quot;&#xD;
                response, will be coded in the analyses as &quot;no&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. interest in dietary supplements - assessed with a single-item 5-point semantic&#xD;
                differential: from &quot;No. This is completely indifferent to me.&quot; to &quot;Yes! Every day I&#xD;
                look for information on this topic.&quot;. The measure will be operationalized as a&#xD;
                5-level ordinal variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. trust in advertising dietary supplements (TiADS) - assessed with an 8-item TiADS&#xD;
                questionnaire, which was developed as a Polish version by Karbownik et al. (2019).&#xD;
                A respondent will be asked to express her/his opinion about the information&#xD;
                conveyed by the advertisements of dietary supplements using a 5-point semantic&#xD;
                differential scale. TiADS will be primarily considered as a sum of Reliability,&#xD;
                Intelligibility and Affect questionnaire subscales. TiADS will be operationalized&#xD;
                as a 33-level ordinal variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. having contact with dietary supplement advertisements - assessed with a single-item&#xD;
                question: &quot;have you had any contact with dietary supplement advertisements within&#xD;
                the past week?&quot;. The measure will be operationalized as a 2-level ordinal variable&#xD;
                (&quot;no&quot; and &quot;yes&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measures related to other health issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. general beliefs about medicines (BMQ-General) - assessed with an 8-item General&#xD;
                part of the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire, which was developed by Horne et&#xD;
                al. (1999), and adapted to Polish language and validated by Karbownik et al. (2019)&#xD;
                (paper currently under peer-review). A respondent will be asked to express her/his&#xD;
                agreement with 8 statements concerning medicines using a 5-point Likert scale: from&#xD;
                &quot;completely disagree&quot; to &quot;completely agree&quot;. BMQ-General will be coded as 2&#xD;
                separate variables: BMQ-General-Overuse subscale and BMQ-General-Harm subscale.&#xD;
                Both the subscales will be operationalized as 17-level ordinal variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. self-rated health - assessed with a single-item question: &quot;how do you assess your&#xD;
                health?&quot;. The measure will be operationalized as a 4-level ordinal variable&#xD;
                (&quot;poor&quot;, &quot;fair&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;excellent&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. self-rated diet - assessed with a single-item 5-point semantic differential: from&#xD;
                &quot;I eat a lot of fast food, chips, sweets, etc.&quot; to &quot;I only eat healthy, balanced&#xD;
                meals&quot;. The measure will be operationalized as a 5-level ordinal variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. self-rated physical activity - assessed with a single-item 5-point semantic&#xD;
                differential: from &quot;I have no physical activity at all&quot; to &quot;I play sport&#xD;
                intensively 5 times a week&quot;. The measure will be operationalized as a 5-level&#xD;
                ordinal variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. conventional cigarette smoking - assessed with a single-item question: &quot;do you&#xD;
                smoke conventional cigarettes?&quot;. The measure will be operationalized as a 3-level&#xD;
                categorical variable (&quot;never&quot;, &quot;no, but I smoked in the past&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. electronic cigarette use - assessed with a single-item question: &quot;do you use&#xD;
                electronic cigarettes?&quot;. The measure will be operationalized as a 3-level&#xD;
                categorical variable (&quot;never&quot;, &quot;no, but I used in the past&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measures of sociodemographic data:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. age - operationalized as a continuous variable rounded to whole years. The allowed&#xD;
                values to be reported will be: &quot;below 18&quot;, &quot;18&quot;, &quot;19&quot;, &quot;20&quot;, ..., &quot;113&quot;. The oldest&#xD;
                Pole currently (October 23, 2019) living is 113-year-old.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. sex - operationalized as a 2-level categorical variable (&quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. education level - operationalized as a 5-level ordinal variable (&quot;primary&quot;,&#xD;
                &quot;secondary or vocational&quot;, &quot;higher-bachelor&quot;, &quot;higher-master&quot;, &quot;higher-doctorate&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. medical education - operationalized as a 2-level categorical variable (&quot;no medical&#xD;
                education&quot; and &quot;medical education&quot;). This measure will be used as auxiliary to&#xD;
                check whether a respondent meets exclusion criteria. Missing values in this&#xD;
                variable will be coded as &quot;medical education&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. number of inhabitants in a place of residence - operationalized as a 4-level&#xD;
                ordinal variable (&quot;below 5,000&quot;, &quot;5,000-50,000&quot;, &quot;50,000-500,000&quot;, &quot;over 500,000&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. monthly net household earnings per family member - operationalized as a 4-level&#xD;
                ordinal variable (&quot;below 1,000 PLN&quot;, &quot;1,000-2,000 PLN&quot;, &quot;2,000-3,000 PLN&quot;, &quot;over&#xD;
                3,000 PLN&quot;). PLN - Polish currency (zloty).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. DATA ANALYSIS PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A study participant will be asked to fill the online survey (https://www.survio.com/pl/)&#xD;
           assessing all the above measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Any cases of respondents, who declared having less than 18 years of age or being&#xD;
           medically educated will be deleted from further analyses (as stated in the inclusion and&#xD;
           exclusion criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All the variables measured with semantic differential scale will have no missing values,&#xD;
           because the online survey software attributes a central value (&quot;3&quot;) to a response as a&#xD;
           default. Missing values are possible in the other variables within the survey, as there&#xD;
           will be no forced answering option and no default responses. The missing values will be&#xD;
           managed in the following way:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The cases with no data, apart from the default values in semantic differential&#xD;
                variables, will be deleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The fraction of missing values for each variable will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The fraction of cases with at least one missing value will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Variables with more than 50% of missing values and cases with more than 50% of&#xD;
                missing values will be deleted from the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. The pattern of data missingness will be assessed with Little's test for data&#xD;
                missing completely at random (MCAR). In case of significant violation of MCAR&#xD;
                assumption, for each variable, the association of missingness with all the other&#xD;
                variables will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. If the fraction of cases with at least one missing value (see point &quot;c&quot;) is less&#xD;
                than 5% and the result of Little's MCAR test (see point &quot;e&quot;) is non-significant,&#xD;
                the cases with at least one missing value will be deleted and the analysis will be&#xD;
                performed with complete cases only.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Otherwise (to point &quot;f&quot;), the missing values will be imputed with multivariate&#xD;
                imputation by chained equations (MICE) before any further data analysis is&#xD;
                performed. The summation of the items constructing KaDS, TiADS and BMQ will be done&#xD;
                after imputation of missing values in each single item.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. KaDS will be treated as a continuous variable and modeled with multivariate linear&#xD;
           regression, whereas UoDS, being a 2-level categorical variable, will be modeled with&#xD;
           logistic regression. Ordinal independent variables will be considered as continuous,&#xD;
           while included into regression models. Categorical independent variables with more than&#xD;
           2 levels will be converted to dummy variables before being included into regression&#xD;
           models. The dependent variables (DVs), KaDS and UoDS, will be modeled in the following&#xD;
           steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Univariate (unadjusted) associations of DVs with all the remaining measures will be&#xD;
                assessed (KaDS will be additionally split into General and Specific subscales for&#xD;
                the presentation of the results). In addition, the two-way interaction&#xD;
                &quot;TiADS&quot;×&quot;having contact with dietary supplement advertisements&quot; will be included.&#xD;
                The associations will be reported as both unadjusted and adjusted for all the&#xD;
                tested sociodemographic measures (see point &quot;I. 3&quot;). If the data is imputed (see&#xD;
                point &quot;3. g&quot;), sensitivity analysis of univariate (unadjusted) associations between&#xD;
                DVs and the remaining measures will be performed in the dataset of complete cases&#xD;
                only to test the accuracy of missing data imputation. The further multivariate&#xD;
                models will be built with the measures statistically significantly (according to&#xD;
                the raw p-values in unadjusted analyses) associated with a DV in these analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Predictors to be retained in the final model will be selected according to the&#xD;
                following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Multicollinearity. Multicollinearity of the variables will be assessed with&#xD;
                     the Pearson's correlation matrix and exploratory factor analysis. In case of&#xD;
                     detection of multicollinearity, two solutions will be considered: (1)&#xD;
                     substantially collinear variables may be linearly combined if they may&#xD;
                     represent the same construct (e.g. &quot;self-rated diet&quot; plus &quot;self-rated physical&#xD;
                     activity&quot; plus &quot;no cigarette smoking&quot; may represent the construct of &quot;health&#xD;
                     self-care&quot; or &quot;conventional cigarette smoking&quot; plus &quot;electronic cigarette use&quot;&#xD;
                     may represent the construct of &quot;nicotine dependence&quot;, etc.) or (2) only one&#xD;
                     variable from a set of substantially collinear variables may be retained and&#xD;
                     the other may be deleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  &quot;Objectivity&quot; of the retained measure. Highly &quot;objective&quot; measures will be&#xD;
                     favored. They include the one with more convincing proof of validity: KaDS,&#xD;
                     TiADS and BMQ, followed by the &quot;objective&quot; measures assessed with a single&#xD;
                     item question: age and sex, followed by more &quot;subjective&quot;, not easily&#xD;
                     verifiable and possibly biased measures: the rest of the measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Information criteria. The models with lower values of Akaike or Bayesian&#xD;
                     information criterion will be preferred (best subset selection algorithm).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Residual analysis of the obtained models will be performed to check for assumptions&#xD;
                of general linear modeling. In case of substantially violated assumptions, the&#xD;
                processes of model construction may be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Internal validation will be performed with a k-fold cross validation to test for&#xD;
           accuracy and stability of the obtained models.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Subgroup analyses may be performed in the samples of respondents critical to public&#xD;
           health:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. elderly people (60 or more years of age),&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. rural areas residents (below 5,000 inhabitants),&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. low income people (below 1,000 PLN of monthly net household earnings per family&#xD;
                member), etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. P-values throughout the analyses below 0.05 will considered statistically significant.To&#xD;
           account for multiple hypothesis testing, if applicable, significance level correction&#xD;
           with Benjamini and Hochberg procedure will be applied (false discovery rate 0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The analyses will be performed using STATISTICA Software (Statsoft) or R Software (R&#xD;
           Core Team).&#xD;
