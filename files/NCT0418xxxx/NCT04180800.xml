  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social isolation among elderly people is a frequent and major determinant for health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of premature death is 2 to 5 time higher for socially isolated people, similarly for&#xD;
      morbidity, duration of healing and complications rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Denutrition is also frequent for elderly people with potentially serious consequences.&#xD;
      Vitamin deficiency, especially in B9 and B12 vitamins, are often associated with denutrition&#xD;
      among elderly people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Folic acid (vitamin B9) is not influenced by inflammation and folic acid income are&#xD;
      necessarily exogene. Vitamin B9 is provided by fresh fruits and vegetables, and giblets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators observed a high prevalence in folic acid deficiency for socially isolated&#xD;
      elderly patients. The investigators made the hypothesis that a folic acid defiency is&#xD;
      associated with social isolation for elderly people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose is the study of the association between folic acid deficiency (measured&#xD;
      by dosing of plasma concentration of vitamin B9) and social isolation evaluated by Lubben&#xD;
      Social Network Scale in 6 questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary purposes are the study of the correlation between folic acid deficiency and&#xD;
      social conditions, nutritional status, biological data, poly pharmacy, cognitive functions,&#xD;
      dependency and length of stay at hospital.&#xD;

    <description>One short oral interview to complete the Lubben Social Network Scale in auto-survey, translated in French. It contains 6 questions on 30 points, higher scores are associated with more social engagement, lower scores, specifically under 12/30, are associated with social isolation.</description>
