  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single site pilot study. 30 subjects with EPP, defined as medical record&#xD;
      documentation of the onset of clinically significant psychotic symptoms within the past ten&#xD;
      years, will be enrolled. Prior to randomization (Session 1), subjects will undergo fMRI&#xD;
      during EM and RS paradigms. This baseline scan will also include a high-resolution structural&#xD;
      sequence for neuronavigation purposes. Then on three separate days each occurring one-week&#xD;
      apart, subjects will receive one session of inhibitory (1 Hz) rTMS, one session of excitatory&#xD;
      (20 Hz) rTMS, and one sham stimulation session targeting the precuneus. The order of the&#xD;
      three interventions will be randomized. Immediately following each rTMS or sham session,&#xD;
      subjects will undergo repeat fMRI during EM and RS paradigms. The investigators will also&#xD;
      examine the effect of rTMS on EM performance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In spite of existing work studying rTMS as a treatment modality in schizophrenia, there are&#xD;
      no studies that have examined the effects of precuneus directed rTMS on either EM deficits or&#xD;
      the neurocircuitry subserving EM in schizophrenia. It is also important to note that the vast&#xD;
      majority of studies using rTMS in schizophrenia have examined chronic populations where&#xD;
      confounds associated with prolonged duration of illness may be present. EPP is a desirable&#xD;
      population to study because these individuals tend to have fewer psychiatric and physical&#xD;
      comorbidities and less antipsychotic drug exposure, all of which are factors that may&#xD;
      confound investigations of new treatment interventions for this illness. In light of the&#xD;
      significant unmet medical need associated with schizophrenia and the grave clinical effect of&#xD;
      disrupted EM in the illness, rTMS modulating the precuneus, and potentially EM circuitry,&#xD;
      represents an unexplored and potentially novel potential treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to combine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with inhibitory&#xD;
      LF (1 Hz) and excitatory HF (20 Hz) rTMS protocols to interrogate the effects of rTMS&#xD;
      targeting the precuneus on: 1) precuneus activation during EM task performance; 2) functional&#xD;
      connectivity between the precuneus and key EM circuitry, specifically the DLPFC, ACC, and&#xD;
      hippocampus and 3) performance during an in-scanner scene encoding and recognition EM task.&#xD;
      This study will provide vital preliminary data on target engagement informing future clinical&#xD;
      trials seeking to utilize rTMS to treat EM impairment in schizophrenia. This is an important&#xD;
      population for study because if effective, rTMS may represent a novel treatment for EM&#xD;
      deficits in schizophrenia. This study will also seek to refine the understanding of the brain&#xD;
      circuitry that mediates the potential pro-EM effects of rTMS through the use of fMRI at&#xD;
      baseline and following the course of rTMS administration.&#xD;
