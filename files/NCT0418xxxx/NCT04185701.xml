      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ametropia is an eye refractive disorder typically leading to myopia, hyperopia,&#xD;
      astigmatism... 4.5 billion people are currently affected worldwide, of whom only 2 billion&#xD;
      are corrected. Of these people, about 30% (or +/- 600,000) do not benefit from an adequate&#xD;
      correction. From an economic point of view, the cost on productivity of the absence or poor&#xD;
      vision correction is estimated at more than 270 billion euros / year worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any correction of an ametropic disorder necessarily requires a precise and relevant eye&#xD;
      examination in order to identify the disorder and determine the best possible visual&#xD;
      correction. The procedure for this examination is identical in all countries. It must follow&#xD;
      specific steps[Benjamin 2006; Grosvenor 2007].&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present the refraction measurement is done manually by an expert. The optical correction&#xD;
      may vary from one examination to another, for multiple physiological and/or&#xD;
      examination-related reasons. Several factors can cause fluctuations in subjective refraction.&#xD;
      These include examiner and subject characteristics [Grein et al. 2014].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, there is also variability due to the measurement itself, depending on each&#xD;
      examiner. The repeatability (on the same subject) and, in addition, the reproducibility&#xD;
      (inter-examiners) of the subjective refraction measurement related to the examiner's&#xD;
      interpretation, examination process and experience, among other things, are therefore&#xD;
      important data to be defined in order to know the tolerance of the measurement determined&#xD;
      between two examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In studies involving a large number of subjects, the repeatability/reproducibility limit is&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 0.71D [Zadnik 1994, Bullimore 1998, MacKenzie 2008], and more&#xD;
      particularly during inter-examiner measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the SiVIEW solution is therefore to make the measurement of subjective&#xD;
      refraction both repeatable and reproducible regardless of the practitioner and his expertise,&#xD;
      by completely automating the search for the best visual prescription using an expert system&#xD;
      that aims to make this examination simple, intuitive and reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore essential to compare the SiVIEW measurement with that of an optometrist&#xD;
      expert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interest of the investigator's study will be to demonstrate that the results between a&#xD;
      refraction expert and the measurement obtained by SiVIEW are clinically similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Show that the equivalent sphere refraction measurements obtained by the SiVIEW software have&#xD;
      no significant clinical difference with those obtained by an optometrist expert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Show that the sphere refraction measurements obtained by the SiVIEW software have no&#xD;
      significant clinical difference with those obtained by an optometrist expert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Show that the cylinder refraction measurements obtained by the SiVIEW software have no&#xD;
      significant clinical difference with those obtained by an optometrist expert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Show that the visual acuity measurements obtained by the SiVIEW software do not have a&#xD;
      significant clinical difference with those obtained by an optometrist expert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demonstrate that the report delivered for each eye exam by SiVIEW software is consistent and&#xD;
      relevant to a vision health practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Show that the differences obtained between two eye examination experts are consistent with&#xD;
      those found in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a comparative prospective open monocentric cross-sectionnal study.&#xD;
