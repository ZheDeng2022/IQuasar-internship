      The aim of the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate the association of auditory evoked brainstem response characteristics with&#xD;
      salivary cortisone concentrations in noise-exposed workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate the magnitude of the amplitudes and latencies of auditory brainstem&#xD;
           responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate the concentration of cortisone in saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate the correlation of the characteristics of auditory evoked brainstem&#xD;
           potentials with the age of the subjects or the length of work in noise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Investigate the association of salivary cortisone concentration with subjects' age or&#xD;
           length of work in noise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Investigate the prevalence of mild, moderate and severe hearing impairment in the 19-35&#xD;
           age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Investigate the relationship of hearing threshold shift with the age of the subjects or&#xD;
           the length of work in noise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To investigate the difference in the characteristics of auditory evoked brainstem&#xD;
           potentials and the difference in salivary cortisone concentration between subjects with&#xD;
           a bilaterally normal hearing threshold (≤25 dB) at high frequencies and subjects with&#xD;
           unilaterally or bilaterally increased hearing threshold (&gt; 25 dB) at high frequencies .&#xD;

      The research is cross-sectional. The expected duration of the survey is at least 18 months.&#xD;
      Assuming that the characteristics of the auditory evoked brainstem potentials are correlated&#xD;
      with salivary cortisone concentration with a correlation coefficient of 0.4, a test power of&#xD;
      80% and a significance level of α = 0.05, at least 46 subjects should be included in the&#xD;
      study. Test power analysis was performed using MedCalc Statistical Software, version 19.1&#xD;
      (MedCalc Software bv, Ostend, Belgium; https://www.medcalc.org; 2019). According to the data&#xD;
      distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), appropriate parametric and / or non-parametric&#xD;
      statistical tests will be applied in accordance with the obtained results. The data will be&#xD;
      presented in tables and graphs. Numerical variables will be represented using the range,&#xD;
      arithmetic mean and standard deviation, respectively, the median and the interquartile range,&#xD;
      in cases of distribution that does not follow the normal distribution. The categorical&#xD;
      variables will be presented using absolute frequencies and their respective proportions.&#xD;
      Differences in the values of the numerical variables between the test groups with a defined&#xD;
      hearing threshold will be analyzed by parametric Student's t-test for independent samples,&#xD;
      and non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test for independent samples. Differences in categorical&#xD;
      variables between the examined groups will be analyzed by chi-square test or Fisher's exact&#xD;
      test in cases where the number of subjects in each group is less than 5. The corresponding&#xD;
      correlation coefficients (Pearson's or Spearman's) between individual clinical variables will&#xD;
      be calculated. An appropriate regression model for the prediction of belonging to a group&#xD;
      with a defined hearing threshold shift will be made, which will include those that have a&#xD;
      significance level of P≤0.20 in the previous statistical analyzes. In the above tests,&#xD;
      significant P values will be considered to be less than 0.05. The statistical analysis of&#xD;
      data will use IBM SPSS Statistics licensed software version 25.0.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Research plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An employer finds workers who meet points 1-5 of study inclusion criteria. A head of the&#xD;
      research checks their medical history and includes them in the study if they do not meet any&#xD;
      of first six exclusion criteria. A head of the research orally informs these workers at the&#xD;
      meeting and helps them to understand and sign a written informed consent for participation in&#xD;
      the research. Each of them receive an information about the date of arrival at the place of&#xD;
      research and also a unique password that encodes saliva samples, completed questionnaires and&#xD;
      electronic and printed findings derived from the assessment of hearing health. The research&#xD;
      leader, research mentors, and occupational safety manager, who is responsible for supervising&#xD;
      the sampling and storage of saliva samples in the refrigerator at +4 ℃ in the workplace, know&#xD;
      the password and associated name.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A participant is expected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Give three saliva samples at the workplace immediately after the morning shift. The&#xD;
           first saliva sample was given 3 days (Tuesday) before arrival at the research place, the&#xD;
           second sample 2 days (Wednesday) before arrival, and the third sample 1 day (Thursday)&#xD;
           before arrival at the research site. One hour before saliva sampling, a respondent&#xD;
           should not brush his/her teeth nor eat nor drink. Fifteen minutes prior to sample&#xD;
           administration, the subject should rinse his/her mouth with a cold water. Then head of&#xD;
           the research analyses coded saliva samples in laboratory by using High Performance&#xD;
           Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) at the Translational Medicine Division of the Srebrnjak&#xD;
           Children's Hospital. After processing and preparing each of the saliva samples for HPLC,&#xD;
           the native sample no longer exists. After the analytes will be detected in the isolate,&#xD;
           all the material will be completely eliminated as infectious waste.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Collaboration in the process of assessing hearing health at the research place. The&#xD;
           assessment includes: otoscopy, tympanometry and audiometry. Subjects who do not meet&#xD;
           point 6 and 7 of the inclusion criteria or who meet point 7 of the exclusion criteria&#xD;
           will not be tested for auditory evoked brainstem response. Other subjects will be tested&#xD;
           for auditory evoked brainstem response in only one ear, with a more regular hearing&#xD;
           threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Self-assessment of perceived stress and psychosocial risk factors in the workplace by&#xD;
           completing a questionnaire at the research site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A researcher conducting this research and the research participants will not receive a&#xD;
      financial fee for their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected scientific contribution of the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantification of the association of auditory evoked brainstem response characteristics with&#xD;
      salivary cortisone concentrations among workers exposed to noise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible risks of participating in the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research involves no risk other than the usual daily risk.&#xD;
