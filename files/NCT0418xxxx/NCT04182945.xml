      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard to assess fever, is to conduct invasive intravascular, esophageal or&#xD;
      bladder thermistor core body temperature (CBT) measurements. Since these methods are time&#xD;
      consuming for the medical staff and more importantly displeasing to the patients, alternative&#xD;
      CBT/fever assessments is needed. greenTEG is developing a CBT algorithm that will be able to&#xD;
      reliably calculate CBT continuously form skin temperature (ST) and the corresponding heat&#xD;
      flux (HF). This can be achieved from subjects developing fever in intensive care unit, since&#xD;
      the prevalence of fever is high and optimally assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to develop and validation of an algorithm that allows the detection&#xD;
      of fever in patients through a non-invasive wearable prototype sensor, which calculates CBT&#xD;
      from ST, HF and heart rate (HR) data streams, allowing a more effective patient management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      ST, HF, HR and CBT data are collected for at least 24hrs until 3 day, depending on the ICU&#xD;
      length of stay of the patient. ST, HF, HR and CBT values from different measurement positions&#xD;
      (subclavicular, lateral ribcage, upper arm and wrist) of the non-invasive wearable research&#xD;
      prototypes will be compared with each other and compared to clinical invasive method&#xD;
      particularly CBT measured by blood temperature from a pulmonary catheter if present or&#xD;
      vesical temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional-Single Group Assignment, monocentric, open label.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measure of quality will be the mean absolute difference (MAD) between the CBT prediction&#xD;
      and the reference signal where the mean is taken over the whole measurement of a single&#xD;
      candidate. An aggregate performance measure over a group of candidates is defined by&#xD;
      averaging the MAD values of each candidate in the group. When a group of candidates for&#xD;
      algorithm validation is defined, the total improvement will be defined by comparing aggregate&#xD;
      performances of old and new algorithm for the validation group. Balancing the probability of&#xD;
      occurrence of the factors in the population and the overall size of the study, a final size&#xD;
      of 50 candidates is reasonable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion- / Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age ≥18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients which are treated at the cardiosurgical and vascular intensive care unit of the&#xD;
           University Hospital Zurich.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expected length of stay in the intensive care unit at least 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical standard monitoring including an invasive CBT measurement (e.g. blood&#xD;
           temperature from a pulmonary catheter if present or from a vesical catheter routinely&#xD;
           placed)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent signed by the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute medical contraindications against the measurement of the non-invasive wearable&#xD;
           device (e.g. skin diseases) and band-aid allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implanted pacemakers or other implanted life sustaining devices&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comatose state of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant Women&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Participants with Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants in the study :50 candidates. The study will be divided in two parts.&#xD;
      In the first part data are collected from 38 patients. In the second part, data form 12&#xD;
      patients will be collected. The reason for the first part is to collect data in order to&#xD;
      develop the algorithm. The reason to collect additional data from 12 candidates in the second&#xD;
      part is to validate and adjust the algorithm that is develop in the first part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      50% of the research prototypes (4 pieces) will be mounted to the patient on left side of the&#xD;
      body (sub clavicula, lateral ribcage, upper arm and wrist), after being admitted to the ICU&#xD;
      and having signed the informed consent. As soon as a patient gets fever, the other 50% of the&#xD;
      research prototypes (4 pieces) will be applied on the right side of the body (sub clavicula,&#xD;
      lateral ribcage, upper arm and wrist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited and screened 1-3 days before the measurements starts. 50% of the&#xD;
      research prototypes (4 pieces) will be applied to the patient on the left side of the body&#xD;
      (sub clavicula, lateral ribcage, upper arm and wrist), after being admitted to the ICU and&#xD;
      having signed the informed consent. After the development of the fever, the other 50% of the&#xD;
      research prototypes (4 pieces) will be applied on the right side of the body (sub clavicula,&#xD;
      lateral ribcage, upper arm and wrist). At the end of intervention all prototypes will be&#xD;
      removed from the patient. A greenTEG employee will collect all the prototypes.&#xD;
