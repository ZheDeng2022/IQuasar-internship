  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electroacupuncture improves pain and wrist functionality in patients undergoing&#xD;
      rehabilitation therapy after distal radius fracture Distal radius fracture is extremely&#xD;
      common, and it is about 10% of all fractures in the human body. Therefore, the distal radius&#xD;
      is the most frequently fractured part of the upper limbs of the human body. Once the fracture&#xD;
      occurs, internal fixation is the main surgical procedure. And, the postoperative goal is to&#xD;
      restore the function of the forearm and the mobility of the wrist joint. Therefore,&#xD;
      rehabilitation treatment is the key. However, postoperative patients often delay&#xD;
      rehabilitation therapy due to pain, resulting in stiffer wrist joints. In recent years,&#xD;
      electroacupuncture(EA) has been widely used to relieve pain after surgery, and many studies&#xD;
      have confirmed that it is effective. And it is already an alternative to postoperative pain&#xD;
      relief. The investigators hope that by electroacupuncture, the investigators can help&#xD;
      patients reduce pain, increase joint mobility, and make patients willing to start&#xD;
      rehabilitation therapy, reduce joint stiffness, and restore wrist function as soon as&#xD;
      possible, which will help patients return to work and normal life early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that 30 patients will be randomly assigned to the following groups:&#xD;
      electroacupuncture group, control group without EA. Two groups of subjects started to&#xD;
      rehabilitation at the 4th week after surgery.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that 30 patients will be randomly assigned to the following groups:&#xD;
      electroacupuncture group, control group without EA. Two groups of subjects started to&#xD;
      rehabilitation at the 4th week after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mode of operation: Electroacupuncture group: At the 4th week after surgery,&#xD;
      electroacupuncture was performed, and the activity of wrist joint on the affected side was&#xD;
      performed at same time, and at a frequency of two times per week for six weeks, for a total&#xD;
      of twelve times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: At the 4th week after surgery, only the activity of wrist joint on the&#xD;
      affected side was performed, and at a frequency of two times per week for six weeks, for a&#xD;
      total of twelve times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupoint selection: needles were inserted to Taixi (KI3), Taichong (LR3), Zusanli(ST36),&#xD;
      Yanglingquan (GB34), contralateral to the operated leg and deqi sensation elicited at&#xD;
      acupoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluator does not know the patient group to achieve a single blind effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use the visual analog scale (VAS) to assess the patient's pain level&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire(DASH) to assess the&#xD;
           patient's pain and the functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The degrees of wrist mobility were measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Three time points were recorded: before the first electroacupuncture (4th week after&#xD;
           surgery, when removing fixation), after the 6th, 12th (last) electroacupuncture.&#xD;
