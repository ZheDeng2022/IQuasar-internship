  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Operational Stress Injuries (OSIs), including post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are&#xD;
      prevalent among veterans deployed in recent combat missions, the effects of which are&#xD;
      experienced within their families. The development of evidence-based programs for veterans&#xD;
      with OSIs and their families is critical because family functioning both affects and is&#xD;
      affected by OSIs. Few programs have been implemented, however, particularly in Canada, and&#xD;
      those that have are not evaluated. Research suggests that brief, systems-focused family&#xD;
      psychoeducation programs are useful in the treatment of OSIs, specifically PTSD, leading to&#xD;
      increases in targeted PTSD knowledge and skills and enhancing resilience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot study is to: (1) develop a systems-focused, virtual&#xD;
      psychoeducational program designed to enhance resilience in veterans with OSIs receiving&#xD;
      clinical care at an OSI clinic in Atlantic Canada and their families; (2) to implement the&#xD;
      virtual program with veterans and their families at the OSI clinic; (3) to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of the program; and (4) to compare resilience-building family psychoeducation to the&#xD;
      standard information-providing services currently available to families at the OSI clinic.&#xD;
      Results will be shared within the network of OSI clinics in Canada and will inform the&#xD;
      development of a proposal for a mixed-method study.&#xD;

      Context&#xD;
&#xD;
      The capacity of military and veteran families to develop and maintain positive mental health&#xD;
      and well-being is challenged by contemporary operational imperatives. Since 1990, the&#xD;
      Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) has engaged in more than 20 major international operations,&#xD;
      involving multiple rotations of members serving in complex missions including Rwanda, Bosnia,&#xD;
      Afghanistan, and, more recently, Mali. The intensified operational tempo is associated with&#xD;
      an increase in the prevalence of operational stress injuries (OSIs). OSIs are persistent&#xD;
      psychological difficulties resulting from operational duties performed while serving in the&#xD;
      CAF. OSIs span a spectrum, including diagnosed psychiatric conditions such as anxiety&#xD;
      disorders, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as other conditions&#xD;
      that may be less severe, but still interfere with daily functioning. In a recent iteration of&#xD;
      the Life After Service Study (LASS), a national survey of CAF veterans receiving services&#xD;
      from Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC), 23% reported a diagnosis of one or more mental disorders,&#xD;
      5.8% reported suicidal ideation, and 1.1% reported a suicide attempt in the previous year.&#xD;
      Specialized OSI clinics are now in place to support treatment-seeking veterans who qualify&#xD;
      for care through VAC. An increase in mental health diagnoses requiring clinical management in&#xD;
      these clinics has been documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of OSIs in members and veterans ripple through their families. Results of a&#xD;
      recent study focusing on the impacts of OSIs on the mental health and well-being of families&#xD;
      of CAF veterans suggest that the imperative to care for the veteran becomes the central,&#xD;
      organizing facet of family experience. In response, family structure, including family role&#xD;
      redefinition and reallocation, shifts. Spouses assume full responsibility for family&#xD;
      functioning and adapt routines, as required, while providing care to the veteran. Some&#xD;
      spouses describe themselves as caregivers to the veteran, performing daily work that involves&#xD;
      mediating and buffering the internal and external stresses affecting him/her. Consequently,&#xD;
      spouses report burn out and specific health conditions attributed to the stress emerge. These&#xD;
      health outcomes develop in an environment characterized by loss of identity and social and&#xD;
      geographic isolation for some. Emotional stress, relationship tensions, and financial&#xD;
      concerns resulting from changes in employment impact the whole family. Throughout, family&#xD;
      members must reconcile the loss of the veteran as he/she once was. In some cases, children&#xD;
      share these burdens, enacting role behavior incompatible with their developmental stage.&#xD;
      Children may also experience emotional and behavioural problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some veteran families cope with these challenges successfully, developing resilience through&#xD;
      practical task management, problem-solving, and social support. Family resilience results&#xD;
      from the interplay of individual assets and the social contexts in which they develop.&#xD;
      Maintaining shared family beliefs, facilitating family organization, and communicating are&#xD;
      processes that facilitate resilience through stress and adversity. Maintaining shared beliefs&#xD;
      helps family members make sense of stress and adversity. Shared beliefs can be introduced or&#xD;
      reintroduced to the family system through religious, spiritual practice, artistic expression,&#xD;
      or through connection with family rituals or the natural environment. Furthermore, some&#xD;
      research suggests that agency and self-determination are mobilized through shared belief&#xD;
      systems and are instrumental in efforts to reinterpret adversity as a challenge that can be&#xD;
      mastered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family organization enables families to manage the impacts of OSIs on both the veteran and&#xD;
      the family system. Clear and consistent organizational patterns reassure family members,&#xD;
      particularly vulnerable family members such as children, that, notwithstanding the adversity&#xD;
      and stress, the structure of the family is continuous, dependable, and strong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Communication processes are also important in resilient families. Clear and unambiguous&#xD;
      messages, empathetically and openly shared, encourage inclusion, collaborative&#xD;
      problem-solving, and conflict resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For families experiencing adversity, such as the stresses associated with supporting a&#xD;
      veteran living with an OSI, resilience processes enable families to recover or &quot;bounce back&quot;&#xD;
      by developing &quot;resistance to psychosocial risk experiences&quot; or to reconfigure by &quot;bouncing&#xD;
      forward&quot; as new capacities are developed. Resilience is not innate or merely a function of&#xD;
      individual personality traits. Rather, it can be learned and developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief, systems-focused psychoeducational programs have the potential to support the&#xD;
      development of veteran family resilience. These programs enhance individual and relational&#xD;
      capacities that reduce psychological and relational distress. The tools required to navigate&#xD;
      interconnected systems (informal and formal social networks) can also be acquired. Early&#xD;
      identification of issues and enhancement of help-seeking behaviours are the focus of&#xD;
      psychoeducational programs. They are a complement to therapy, not a replacement. Indeed,&#xD;
      brief, systems-focused programs attract and retain families in need who are unlikely to seek&#xD;
      out therapeutic intervention and have a significant role to play in addressing their complex&#xD;
      needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, evidence-based, psychoeducational programs for veterans with OSIs and their families&#xD;
      are few in number, particularly in Canada. Some research is ongoing in the United States. For&#xD;
      example, the efficacy of psychoeducation for veterans with OSIs and their families was&#xD;
      measured in an American study involving 100 veterans with PTSD and 96 family members&#xD;
      participating in a longitudinal evaluation of a program entitled REACH (Reaching out to&#xD;
      Educate and Assist Caring, Healthy Families). Results indicate that participation in REACH&#xD;
      positively impacts both veterans with PTSD and their family members. Participants showed&#xD;
      improvements in knowledge about PTSD, family adaptation strategies, family communication, and&#xD;
      empowerment. Relationship satisfaction, perceived social support, and a decrease in PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms were also reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot study is to contribute to the development of evidence-based,&#xD;
      systems-focused virtual psychoeducational programming for CAF veterans with OSIs and their&#xD;
      families. This initiative will draw upon partnerships and expertise at an OSI Clinic in&#xD;
      Atlantic Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretical Framework&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot program will be developed as a brief, systems-focused virtually-delivered&#xD;
      psychoeducational program. Therefore, the ecological family systems theory will serve as a&#xD;
      foundation for the development of the content of the pilot program and its evaluation.&#xD;
      Grounded in a bioecological model of human development, the original ecological family&#xD;
      systems model and its subsequent iterations bring into view a system of four interconnected&#xD;
      environments (microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem), each representing the&#xD;
      interdependent contexts embodied in the lives of individuals and families. These environments&#xD;
      and their roles in developing and maintaining resilience will constitute program components.&#xD;
      For example, loss of identity, shared beliefs, role redefinition/reallocation (microsystem),&#xD;
      changes in routines, caregiving imperatives, family organization strategies (mesosystem),&#xD;
      military and veteran family policies (exosystem), and military culture (macrosystem) and the&#xD;
      processes integral to navigating these interconnected systems will be explored. The&#xD;
      non-normative changes in roles and environments, or the ecological transitions, particular to&#xD;
      the military context that challenge resilience for the families of veterans with OSIs will&#xD;
      also be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      CCAF veterans diagnosed with an OSI at least one year prior to the start of the study and&#xD;
      receiving care through the OSI Clinic in Dartmouth, N.S. and their family members will be&#xD;
      recruited to participate in the pilot program and its evaluation. Two six-week virtual&#xD;
      sessions will be implemented at the clinic - the first in January/February of 2021 and the&#xD;
      second in the spring of 2021. A maximum of 10-15 participants (including both veterans and&#xD;
      their family members) will be recruited for each group. Family members are defined as&#xD;
      spouses/partners, siblings, parents, and adult children. Prior to the start of the program,&#xD;
      participants will be qualitatively interviewed by a member of the research team. Participants&#xD;
      will take part in interviews guided by questions informed by the ecological family systems&#xD;
      theory. Program participants will be interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide; see&#xD;
      interview guide included in attached appendices. Interviews will be taped and transcribed&#xD;
      verbatim. Field notes identifying observations, thoughts, and additional information&#xD;
      contributing to the formative analysis of the data will be maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the weekly sessions will take place over a virtual care platform (Zoom for&#xD;
      Healthcare) and will be led by at least two trained facilitators (one from the research team,&#xD;
      and one member of the OSI clinical staff team). Each of these sessions will focus on&#xD;
      providing education of different topics relevant to those accessing services at the clinic&#xD;
      (e.g., types of treatments available, tools to support families, self care). See attached&#xD;
      appendix for draft outline of group sessions. The facilitators will also be there to support&#xD;
      the participants with any questions they may have. The OSI clinical team member facilitating&#xD;
      these groups will also be able to meet individually with the client outside of the group as&#xD;
      needed to provide additional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each six-week session, program outcomes will be assessed qualitatively by a&#xD;
      member of the research team utilizing the same interview guide as mentioned above. Six weeks&#xD;
      after the end of the session, participants will be interviewed again as a final follow-up.&#xD;
