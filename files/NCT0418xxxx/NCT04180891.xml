    <textblock>
      As the interpersonal skills such as empathy and emotional intelligence take more and more&#xD;
      importance in the medical education, the Paris University of Medicine has introduced for the&#xD;
      first time in 2019 some multiple mini-interviews (MMI) in addition to the traditional written&#xD;
      examination, to graduate the 1st year student in health studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection process aims at promoting students with high academic results but also with&#xD;
      good interpersonal abilities. In this new selection process, MMI will be used in addition to&#xD;
      written tests, but only to attribute the last places available after a first ranking based on&#xD;
      academic results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So after the written examination, students with the best written exam marks will directly&#xD;
      graduate, others will require MMI to graduate and some will directly fail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that this selection procedure may promote stronger interpersonal&#xD;
      abilities profiles in the group that succeed to enter one of the health studies course than&#xD;
      in the group that failed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will measure the clinical empathy and emotional intelligence abilities of all the&#xD;
      1st year students applying for this new selection process, using validate self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the investigators will compare the scores of empathy and emotional intelligence in the&#xD;
      group that succeed the selection process, to the group that failed. Furthermore, in the&#xD;
      success group, the investigators will compare the scores between students that directly&#xD;
      graduated and students that required MMI. Scores will also be compared considering some&#xD;
      sociodemographic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result of that studies could give strong arguments to modify the selection process and&#xD;
      extend the use of MMI in medical school in France.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION : Considering empathy and emotional intelligence in the early stages of health&#xD;
      studies has become a significant concern, all the more as empathy level among medicine&#xD;
      students seems to decrease by the years. This loss of clinical empathy takes particularly&#xD;
      place after the 3rd year of medicine studies, when students start being in contact with real&#xD;
      patients. Starting from that, the investigators will study if the selection that occurs by&#xD;
      the end of the 1st year of health studies in France, and which select students that can enter&#xD;
      one of the course (medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, midwifery), is designed to promote not only&#xD;
      academic skills but also interpersonal abilities. That selection procedure is especially&#xD;
      important because it will determine the profiles of health professionals that will enter&#xD;
      medical course and will be the future practitioner. In order to to consider more the&#xD;
      interpersonal abilities of the students during the selection process, some Multiple&#xD;
      Mini-Interview (MMI) have been introduced. The MMI will be used to attribute the last 20% of&#xD;
      the places available (80% of the places will be directly attributed by the classic written&#xD;
      examen)&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS : In this research, it will be proposed to all the 1st year health students&#xD;
      registered in Paris University of medicine for the year 2019/2020 (about 1200 students) to&#xD;
      complete four self-administered questionnaire : the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (student&#xD;
      version),the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), the Questionnaire of Cognitive and&#xD;
      Affective Empathy (QCAE) and the Emotional Expressivity Scale (EES). The students will get a&#xD;
      personal access to the questionnaires by their digital workspace on the University's website.&#xD;
      By the end of the year, they will be separated in 2 groups : students that have succeeded to&#xD;
      the selection process and that can enter one of the health course, and students that failed.&#xD;
      Then the investigators will compare the scores of the several self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaires in the 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE : That study wants to determine if the selection process in first year of health&#xD;
      student in the Paris University of Medicine is able to promote students profiles with strong&#xD;
      interpersonal abilities so as academics skills. That study will also try to determine if the&#xD;
      introduction of MMI has an impact on the empathy scores of the selected students.&#xD;
