      1.0 BACKGROUND Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disorder of chronic orthostatic&#xD;
      intolerance characterized by symptoms of palpitations, lightheadedness, chest discomfort,&#xD;
      shortness of breath, blurred vision, and mental clouding. These symptoms occur during&#xD;
      standing and are associated with a marked increase in heart rate (HR) in the absence of&#xD;
      hypotension, which typically resolve when sitting or lying down. Most importantly, POTS is&#xD;
      associated with a very poor quality of life and significant functional disability. POTS&#xD;
      patients commonly experience mental clouding (&quot;brain fog&quot;) even while lying down or seated,&#xD;
      which poses significant limitations to daily activities .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, there is a relative paucity in the literature assessing therapies for POTS&#xD;
      patients. Given that excessive tachycardia on standing is a fundamental component of this&#xD;
      syndrome, a handful of studies have evaluated medications that reduce HR. Ivabradine is newer&#xD;
      drug that is a selective If channel blocker that reduces HR without affecting other&#xD;
      cardiovascular functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 RATIONALE / STUDY PURPOSE The investigators propose to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      propranolol and ivabradine on HR response to standing, and symptom burden in patients with&#xD;
      POTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 Study Design This will be a single-center double-blind placebo-controlled randomized&#xD;
      crossover trial conducted in patients with POTS to compare effects of (1) oral ivabradine 5&#xD;
      mg bid plus placebo BID (to fill out a QID schedule); (2) oral propranolol 20 mg qid; and (3)&#xD;
      oral placebo qid in POTS patients. After a baseline screening assessment following a washout&#xD;
      period of 7 days, participants will be randomized to start with a 4-week course of either&#xD;
      ivabradine, propranolol or placebo. The other two treatments will be given in separate 4-week&#xD;
      courses with a 7-day washout period between phases, with each participant acting as his or&#xD;
      her own control. At the end of each 4-week phase, participants will complete the&#xD;
      symptom-rating and HRQOL questionnaires, and also undergo tilt table testing to assess the&#xD;
      change in HR at 10 min with head up tilt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo POTS testing at baseline and at the end of each 4-week treatment&#xD;
      course. This will involve a total of 4 separate study visits.&#xD;

      1.0 BACKGROUND Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disorder of chronic orthostatic&#xD;
      intolerance characterized by symptoms of palpitations, lightheadedness, chest discomfort,&#xD;
      shortness of breath, blurred vision, and mental clouding. These symptoms occur during&#xD;
      standing and are associated with a marked increase in heart rate (HR) in the absence of&#xD;
      hypotension, which typically resolve when sitting or lying down. Most importantly, POTS is&#xD;
      associated with a very poor quality of life and significant functional disability. POTS&#xD;
      patients commonly experience mental clouding (&quot;brain fog&quot;) even while lying down or seated,&#xD;
      which poses significant limitations to daily activities .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, there is a relative paucity in the literature assessing therapies for POTS&#xD;
      patients. Given that excessive tachycardia on standing is a fundamental component of this&#xD;
      syndrome, a handful of studies have evaluated medications that reduce HR. In a randomized&#xD;
      crossover study of 54 patients with POTS, low-dose propranolol (10-20 mg PO) was found to&#xD;
      acutely reduce standing HR compared to placebo. Further, there was greater improvement in&#xD;
      symptom burden (quantified using the Vanderbilt Orthostatic Symptom Score [VOSS]) from&#xD;
      baseline to 2 hours in patients treated with propranolol compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ivabradine is newer drug that is a selective If channel blocker that reduces HR without&#xD;
      affecting other cardiovascular functions. In non-randomized reports, it has been shown to&#xD;
      improve symptoms in patients with POTS. In a case series of 22 patients, approximately 60% of&#xD;
      patients with POTS treated with ivabradine had symptom improvement&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 RATIONALE / STUDY PURPOSE Patients with POTS suffer great disability and currently used&#xD;
      pharmacologic therapies require more rigorous study. Currently, there are no studies&#xD;
      comparing the relative efficacy of propranolol and ivabradine in patients with POTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to compare the efficacy of propranolol and ivabradine on HR response to standing,&#xD;
      and symptom burden in patients with POTS. This would be the first study to compare the&#xD;
      relative efficacy of ivabradine to propranolol in POTS. The results of this exploratory study&#xD;
      may help inform design of a larger multicenter clinical trial investigating the use of&#xD;
      ivabradine or propranolol in POTS over time. We will test the null hypothesis that the heart&#xD;
      rate lowering response to ivabradine is not different than the heart lowering response of&#xD;
      propranolol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we propose to assess sleep complaints and sleep quality using questionnaire and&#xD;
      actigraphy based assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 Study Design This will be a multi-center double-blind placebo-controlled randomized&#xD;
      crossover trial conducted in patients with POTS to compare effects of (1) oral ivabradine 5&#xD;
      mg bid plus placebo BID (to fill out a QID schedule); (2) oral propranolol 20 mg qid; and (3)&#xD;
      oral placebo qid in POTS patients. After a baseline screening assessment following a washout&#xD;
      period of 7 days, participants will be randomized to start with a 4-week course of either&#xD;
      ivabradine, propranolol or placebo. The other two treatments will be given in separate 4-week&#xD;
      courses with a 7-day washout period between phases, with each participant acting as his or&#xD;
      her own control. At the end of each 4-week phase, participants will complete the&#xD;
      symptom-rating and HRQOL questionnaires, and also undergo tilt table testing to assess the&#xD;
      change in HR at 10 min with head up tilt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo POTS testing at baseline and at the end of each 4-week treatment&#xD;
      course in the Libin Cardiovascular Institute TRW Human Physiology Research space. This will&#xD;
      involve a total of 4 separate study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      •• Studies will start between 8-9am, with the patient in a fasting state (to avoid acute&#xD;
      hemodynamic effects from eating).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to hemodynamic data collection, a brief medical history will be conducted to&#xD;
           ensure that the medications have not changed, and that there are not new medical issues&#xD;
           that would make the study unsafe or imprudent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be instrumented for continuous beat-to-beat BP and&#xD;
           electrocardiographic monitoring. BP will be monitored continuously using a finger volume&#xD;
           clamp method (Nexfin, BMEYE Inc.) and calibrated with intermittent brachial cuff&#xD;
           measurements using a standard automatic BP monitor (IVY Model 450C, IVY Medical,&#xD;
           Branford, CT, USA) or by using Finapres NOVA, Finapres Medical Systems .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline seated continuous data (EKG signals and continuous BP will be collected for ~10&#xD;
           min).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological testing of the cognitive domains of memory, attention and executive&#xD;
           function will be assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery&#xD;
           (CANTAB) while seated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be asked to stand and repeat portions of the CANTAB tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline lying down continuous data (EKG signals and continuous BP will be collected for&#xD;
           ~10 min).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will then be strapped onto the tilt table and then tilted to 80° head-up for&#xD;
           10 minutes with continuous hemodynamic data collection. Oxygen saturation will be&#xD;
           assessed from a finger probe. End-tidal CO2 will be measured using nasal prongs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to comment on any side effects or unrated symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VOSS ratings will be collected at the end of tilt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants and the research staff will be asked to &quot;guess&quot; at which intervention was&#xD;
           given on that study day (not applicable to baseline visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the study is finished, we will remove the recording patches, and electrodes. This&#xD;
           testing day will last about 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon conclusion of the tilt testing, we will connect patients to a 24-hour Holter monitor for&#xD;
      continuous ECG and HR monitoring. Participants will return the monitoring device the&#xD;
      following day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This testing protocol will be repeated at baseline, and at the end of phase 1, 2, and 3 with&#xD;
      different study drugs.&#xD;
