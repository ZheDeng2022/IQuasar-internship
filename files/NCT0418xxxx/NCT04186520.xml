      This is a Phase I/II, interventional, single-arm, open-label, treatment study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of Interleukin-7 and Interleukin-15 (IL-7/IL-15)&#xD;
      manufactured chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-20/19-T cells as well as the feasibility of a&#xD;
      flexible manufacturing schema in adult patients with B cell malignancies that have failed&#xD;
      prior therapies.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 1/Phase 2 study. The objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phase 1/1b: Determine the safety of a fixed dose of 2.5 x 10^6 CAR-20/19-T cells/kg&#xD;
           expanded with IL-7/IL-15 at 8 and 12-day manufacturing times in relapsed refractory&#xD;
           B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) followed by expansion cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Determine the three-month complete response (CR) rate of CAR-20/19-T cells in&#xD;
                Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Determine the feasibility of a flexible manufacturing process of CAR-20/19-T cells&#xD;
                from patient apheresis products using the CliniMACS® Prodigy Cell processing&#xD;
