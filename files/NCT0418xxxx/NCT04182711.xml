  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare facilities worldwide still measure respiration manually by counting and timing&#xD;
      chest movements. In clinical departments that are fast-paced in nature and that have either&#xD;
      high patient volumes or require more accurate measurements (e.g. emergency and respiratory&#xD;
      wards), manual methods of counting respiration can be slow, laborious and highly subjective.&#xD;
      While potential solutions such as electrocardiography (ECG) and capnography (CPG) have been&#xD;
      explored for more objective monitoring of respiration, they are not fast enough due to long&#xD;
      setup times to get patient and system ready and prolonged periods of connection to patients.&#xD;
      Furthermore, such ECG/CPG based solutions can be costly, are generally sufficient for&#xD;
      patients in high dependency units, and may be impractical to deploy in a remote setting.&#xD;

      The study will be divided into 2 phases - 1st phase will last 1.5 months and will aim to&#xD;
      recruit at least 50 patients and at most 100 patients. This phase will aim to recruit&#xD;
      near-equal split of patients across the 3 disease states of COPD, asthma and pneumonia - 35&#xD;
      COPD, 35 Asthma and 30 pneumonia patients. The 2nd phase will last 3 months and will aim to&#xD;
      recruit at least 50 patients. This phase can have a mix of patients having either COPD,&#xD;
      asthma, pneumonia, congestive heart failure or any other respiratory diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim in the 1st phase is to benchmark the device against manual counting of respiration&#xD;
      (number of breaths per minute). The aim in the 2nd phase is to benchmark the device against&#xD;
      existing technologies, namely lead-based-ECG sensing, acoustic sensing and capnography. This&#xD;
      phase can have a mix of patients having either COPD, asthma, pneumonia or any other&#xD;
      respiratory diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following is the study protocol that will be implemented over the 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: 1.5 months - 100 patients - General Wards (Time taken for each patient is 25 mins)&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Delegated study team members will brief the study details to the potential participants.&#xD;
      Investigators will answer the query from potential participants if any, and complete the&#xD;
      consent process. (5 mins) b. Trial coordinator will setup the device as follows: (10 mins) i.&#xD;
      Disinfect the device by wiping with an alcohol swab, ii. Turn on the sensor - ensure the USB&#xD;
      dongle is connected to the RIGHT ports on the laptop - check that the USB dongle AND the&#xD;
      sensor light is NOT blinking iii. Paste the sensor on patient using a medical-grade adhesive&#xD;
      tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Trial coordinator will begin data collection by double click the software .exe file -&#xD;
      select the COM ports and enter participant no. (a folder will be created in root directory&#xD;
      for the participant number) d. Click &quot;run&quot; button on the software and start to manually count&#xD;
      the number of breaths after 1 minute. After 1 minute, the number of breaths counted manually&#xD;
      will be recorded on the case report form.4 rounds of 1-minute measurements will be taken e.&#xD;
      Trial coordinator will turn off the device and pass it back to team-member or keep it. Trial&#xD;
      coordinator will remove the medical-grade adhesive tape and throw it away. (5 mins) f.&#xD;
      Team-member will post-process the collected respiration data, benchmark against the manually&#xD;
      counted data in the data collection form provided by trial coordinator and discuss the&#xD;
      results with investigating P.Is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: 3 months - 50 patients - Medical intensive care units (MICU), medical dependency&#xD;
      units (MDU), cardiology high dependency units, and general wards (for congestive heart&#xD;
      failure patients) (Time taken for each patient is 30 mins) g. Delegated study team members&#xD;
      will brief the study details to the potential participants. Investigators will answer the&#xD;
      query from potential participants if any, and complete the consent process. In the event that&#xD;
      the patient is unable to provide consent, the next-of-kin will be approached for consent. (5&#xD;
      mins) h. Trial coordinator will setup the device as follows: (10 mins) i. Disinfect the&#xD;
      device by wiping with an alcohol swab, ii. Turn on the sensor - ensure the USB dongle is&#xD;
      connected to the RIGHT ports on the laptop - check that the USB dongle AND the sensor light&#xD;
      is NOT blinking iii. Paste the sensor on patient using a medical-grade adhesive tape. iv.&#xD;
      Attach another sensor on the patient's finger using an adapter. The purpose of this is to&#xD;
      collect heart rate and Sp02, and to calculate respiration from the collected data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Trial coordinator will begin data collection by double click the software .exe file -&#xD;
      select the COM ports and enter participant no. (a folder will be created in root directory&#xD;
      for the participant number) j. Click &quot;run&quot; button on the software. After 1 minute, the number&#xD;
      of breaths, heart rate and Sp02 from other technology devices will be recorded on the case&#xD;
      report form.4 rounds of 1-minute measurements will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      k. Trial coordinator will turn off the device and pass it back to team-member or keep it.&#xD;
      Trial coordinator will remove the medical-grade adhesive tape and throw it away. (5 mins).&#xD;
      Trial coordinator will also remove the device and adapter from the finger location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      l. Team-member will post-process the collected respiration data, benchmark it and discuss the&#xD;
      results with investigating P.Is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collected will be anonymous and no video-taping will be done. The trial coordinator&#xD;
      will act as the control arm. They will measure the respiration or breathing rate of the&#xD;
      subject manually - by counting the number of breaths per minute. The non-control arm will be&#xD;
      the device itself and it will be benchmarked to the manual respiration data collected by the&#xD;
      trial coordinator. The data collected will be kept with the P.I and confidentially of the&#xD;
      data will strictly be maintained. The case report forms or the collection forms will be&#xD;
      passed to the P.I. and kept safely. The subject may choose to withdraw from the study at any&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device is based on multi-modal sensing using illumination at extremely low emission&#xD;
      levels on the order of microwatts. This sensing technique is able to detect the&#xD;
      micro-vibrations along the neck due to breathing.&#xD;
