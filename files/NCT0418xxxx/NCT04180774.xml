  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of inactivated tumor cells&#xD;
      genetically modified with the TAG-7 gene as immunotherapy for cancer. Patients with melanoma&#xD;
      or kidney cancer were included since they have immune-dependent tumors. Treatment was done in&#xD;
      the adjuvant setting after complete cytoreduction of locally advanced or metastatic disease&#xD;
      or in the therapeutic setting in patients where complete cytoreduction was impossible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last decade, novel approaches for cancer treatment have been developed. Antitumor&#xD;
      vaccines are one of the most promising approaches in tumor immunotherapy. Tumor cells possess&#xD;
      low immunogenicity properties due to a number of the not completely understood mechanisms of&#xD;
      resistance. One of the ways to overcome it is immune genes transfection. Genes encoding&#xD;
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-12 have&#xD;
      been used most commonly, both in preclinical studies and clinical trials. These cytokines are&#xD;
      well known to participate in the systemic immune response. Several studies have shown that&#xD;
      the professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) of the host, rather than the vaccinating&#xD;
      tumor cells themselves, are responsible for priming CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, both of which are&#xD;
      required to generate systemic antitumor immunity. Recent findings indicate that the adaptive&#xD;
      arm of immunity is governed by the innate immune mechanisms that control the co-stimulatory&#xD;
      signaling of APCs. Recently, investigators identified a novel gene, tag7, also know as&#xD;
      PGRP-S. The insect ortholog of the tag7/PGRP-S was shown to be involved in the innate immune&#xD;
      response in Drosophila. In preclinical studies, tag7-modified mouse tumor cells induced a&#xD;
      long-lasting T-cell dependent immune response in mice. The effectiveness of antitumor&#xD;
      vaccination was demonstrated on different models of mouse tumors, particularly for melanoma&#xD;
      cells (M3, B16, F10). Clinically important results of vaccine therapy were achieved in&#xD;
      patients with melanoma and renal carcinoma in a number of studies. The results with this&#xD;
      treatment are comparable to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Investigators assume that one has&#xD;
      to activate the innate component of immunity first, followed by the activation of the&#xD;
      adaptive one, to make anticancer vaccines more effective. Thus, a phase I/II clinical trial&#xD;
      has been performed to evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of treatment with autologous&#xD;
      tumor cells modified with the tag7 gene, which has been shown to be involved in innate&#xD;
      immunity mechanisms,&#xD;
