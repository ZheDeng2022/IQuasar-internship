      Fabry disease screening study in patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal tract (GIT)&#xD;
      disease, i.e. with the diagnosis of non-infectious inflammatory bowel disease, functional&#xD;
      dyspepsia or irritable bowel syndrome in particular, is a project designed as a pilot study&#xD;
      of Centre for Fabry disease, General University Hospital in Prague, and Clinical Centre&#xD;
      ISCARE Prague, focused on improving the diagnosis and care of patients with Fabry disease in&#xD;
      the Czech Republic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fabry disease, (FD) is an X-linked inherited, rare, progressive disorder of glycosphingolipid&#xD;
      metabolism affecting multiple organs resulting in organ dysfunction. The earlier diagnosis is&#xD;
      made the earlier treatment is started the better outcome patients have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are screening programs in cardiology, nephrology, neurology or ophtalmology fields. But&#xD;
      not only cardiovascular, renal or eye symptoms are present. Very common are also GI symptoms&#xD;
      in Fabry disease patient population. This is the first screening of FAbry disease in GI&#xD;
      symptom patients.&#xD;

      Fabry disease screening study in patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal tract (GIT)&#xD;
      disease, i.e. with the diagnosis of non-infectious inflammatory bowel disease, functional&#xD;
      dyspepsia or irritable bowel syndrome in particular, is a project designed as a pilot study&#xD;
      of Centre for Fabry disease, General University Hospital in Prague, and Clinical Centre&#xD;
      ISCARE Prague, focused on improving the diagnosis and care of patients with Fabry disease in&#xD;
      the Czech Republic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction Fabry (Anderson-Fabry) disease is a progressive multiorgan X-linked lysosomal&#xD;
      storage disease. The disease is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A.&#xD;
      The enzymatic defect leads to accumulation of enzyme substrate in various tissue types. The&#xD;
      affected tissue types include the vascular endothelium of several organs involving kidneys,&#xD;
      heart, nervous system, and GIT. Glycolipids accumulation triggers function impairment of&#xD;
      affected organs and their subsequent failure. The disease is X-linked and most female&#xD;
      heterozygotes develop milder symptoms or the disease manifests later in life than in affected&#xD;
      hemizygous man. The disease burden is milder in women due to second X-chromosome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A typical clinical picture can emerge in males as early as childhood. The onset of clinically&#xD;
      evident symptoms manifests with attacks of neuropathic pain of the extremities, followed with&#xD;
      early manifestation of hypohidrosis and development of skin lesions - angiokeratomata. In&#xD;
      affected hemizygous males, sign of renal damage can be detected even in the second decade,&#xD;
      representing already considerable renal damage leading to ultimate organ failure with the&#xD;
      need for hemodialysis or kidney transplantation. The first gastrointestinal symptoms occur.&#xD;
      From the third decade onwards, both males and females can present neurological symptoms such&#xD;
      as white matter lesions as well as stroke, mostly of ischemic nature. Cardiac involvement is&#xD;
      characterized by a thickening of the ventricular wall occurring in the third decade in men&#xD;
      and approximately ten years later in women. The finding may remind of classical sarcomeric&#xD;
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in its full extent, including left ventricular outflow tract&#xD;
      obstruction. Patients suffer dyspnea, arrhythmias and chest pain. In some patients, other&#xD;
      classical symptoms and manifestations of Fabry disease may be completely absent, and the&#xD;
      patients with predominant or exclusive cardiac involvement are sometimes referred to as&#xD;
      having a cardiac variant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients with Fabry disease report GI symptoms of diarrhea, with frequent abdominal pain&#xD;
      attacks and increased flatulence. Defecation frequency varies, most often 4-6 times a day,&#xD;
      which patients consider normal. However, more than 8-times-a-day evacuation episodes are&#xD;
      common. Unlike in inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's or ulcerative colitis, no blood&#xD;
      or mucus in stool is present. Some patients, on the other hand, complain of severe&#xD;
      constipation. Patients with Fabry disease may then be followed-up under diagnosis of&#xD;
      non-infectious inflammatory bowel disease, functional dyspepsia or irritable bowel syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of Fabry disease is based on the evaluation of the defect enzyme activity level&#xD;
      in plasma or leukocytes in males. In females, this test is less effective as the enzyme&#xD;
      activity levels can reach near normal levels. Thus, sequencing of DNA of the GLA gene is&#xD;
      necessary for a diagnosis in most females. they are diagnosed by DNA analysis for a mutation&#xD;
      responsible for enzyme deficiency. In women Prior to sequencing, level of the lyso-Gb3&#xD;
      biomarker can be tested and the finding of elevated lyso-Gb3 should be the ultimate&#xD;
      requirement for genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment is based on enzyme replacement therapy. Two approved treatments are available in&#xD;
      Europe. Chaperones, small molecules that stabilize defective α-galactosidase A enzyme, and&#xD;
      allow its residual activity to be increased, have recently been introduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the Study The aim of the study is to screen patients for Fabry disease in medical&#xD;
      centers concentrating patients diagnosed idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease to better&#xD;
      determine the prevalence of this disease in the Czech Republic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This is the first screening study organized by of Centre for Fabry disease in&#xD;
      cooperation with departments of gastroenterology. The Clinical Centre ISCARE Prague is&#xD;
      invited to participate. The aim of the Study is to obtain samples of dry blood spot along&#xD;
      with a elementary medical history of the gastrointestinal tract disease from a study&#xD;
      population of 500-800 patients at least that were diagnosed with idiopathic inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel disease, functional dyspepsia or irritable bowel syndrome. The study has been evaluated&#xD;
      and is approved by the Multicenter Ethics Committee of the General University Hospital in&#xD;
      Prague (EC General University Hospital in Prague).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of both sexes older than 18 years and under 60 years of age are enrolled in the&#xD;
      Study. Other inclusion criteria include previous examination and follow-up for the GIT&#xD;
      symptoms, usually the above-mentioned diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a routine outpatient follow-up, samples of 4 drops of blood will be drawn from the&#xD;
      patient finger as per the instructions. Alternatively, the blood sample will be taken during&#xD;
      another routine blood test. Enzyme activity evaluation and/or genetic tests will be carried&#xD;
      out by the ARCHIMED Lie Science Laboratories GmbH (Austria). The dry blood spot kits will&#xD;
      first be sent to Center for Fabry Disease at II. Internal Clinic of Cardiology and Angiology&#xD;
      of the First Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital, where they will be&#xD;
      anonymized and sent for processing. At the same time, the attending physician will complete a&#xD;
      brief questionnaire on the patient's basic clinical data (age, gender, GIT symptoms, other&#xD;
      symptoms of Fabry disease). Patients with a positive test result will then be invited to the&#xD;
      Center for Fabry Disease at the General University Hospital in Prague, where specific&#xD;
      treatment will be considered in accordance with the current criteria for covering by the&#xD;
      health insurance company. Patients do not receive any financial compensation for their&#xD;
      participation in the study. Patients invited to the Center for Fabry Disease will be&#xD;
      reimbursed for their travel expenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is a pilot study. If patients suffering Fabry disease are identified, a&#xD;
      nationwide screening will follow.&#xD;
