    <textblock>
      Scientific Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the known health benefits of exercising during old age, older people remain highly&#xD;
      sedentary. Official exercise guidelines aimed specifically at older people focus primarily on&#xD;
      aerobic activity, and tend to be over generalized.There is need for personalized exercise&#xD;
      programs, which account for the increasing variability in measures of fitness and mobility&#xD;
      with advancing age, and offer exercises aimed at improving balance, strength, flexibility and&#xD;
      aerobic fitness, and which can be performed at home. Advancing smartphone technology provides&#xD;
      tools which might help address this important area of public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop a novel digital smartphone app, which enables assessment of fitness components,&#xD;
      and provides personalized comprehensive exercise programs which update at regular intervals&#xD;
      according to changes in fitness levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective interventional randomized control study involving 360 people aged ≥65 living at&#xD;
      home/ sheltered living. Stage 1 will include selecting exercise and fitness tests, developing&#xD;
      a smartphone app for self-assessment of these tests, and designing exercise programs to meet&#xD;
      specific capabilities. A pilot study (n=60) will validate results from the app compared to&#xD;
      standard laboratory tests, before finalizing the study platform, and will create a platform&#xD;
      for matching exercise programs to levels of fitness. At Stage 2 - the main study -&#xD;
      participants (n=300) will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (personalized&#xD;
      updating exercise program via the app), an active control group (receiving World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) exercise guidelines), or control group (no intervention). Using the app&#xD;
      for assessment, all participants will be tested during stage 2 at T0 (baseline), T1 (6 week)&#xD;
      T2 (12 weeks), and during Stage 3 follow-up at T3 (18 weeks) and T4 (24 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novelty and Applicability:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This innovative technology will enable older people to test their fitness level, and receive&#xD;
      a personalized exercise program based on their current ability and preferences, which changes&#xD;
      over time according to their progress. The program will be presented as photos and short&#xD;
      videos, available on their smartphones, or easily transferable to computer or television (TV)&#xD;
      screens.&#xD;

      1.1 Scientific Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the health benefits of exercise among the elderly are accepted, there is a need for&#xD;
      greater accuracy in assessment of a wide range of fitness and mobility parameters, in order&#xD;
      to provide a comprehensive exercise program delivered in the home environment. Advances in&#xD;
      smartphone technology may provide useful tools to help address this important area of public&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Research Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: 1) To examine whether an individually prescribed personalized comprehensive physical&#xD;
      activity program performed at home, based on individual motor and physical evaluation,&#xD;
      performed by a standard smartphone at home, is more effective than accepted standardized&#xD;
      recommendations from the World Health Organization for physical activity, among people aged&#xD;
      65 years and above. The prescribed program will include colorful, clear pictures and videos&#xD;
      of various exercises, presented in a user-friendly manner on the user's smartphone, TV or&#xD;
      computer screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: 2) To enable the personalized exercise program to be updated (by the study exercise&#xD;
      specialists), according to the changes in level of fitness, as measured by home testing using&#xD;
      the smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: 3) The ultimate goal of the program is to improve health of older people by increasing&#xD;
      the level of physical activity in a safe, enjoyable and effective manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Research Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will employ an interventional, prospective randomized control study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Approval: The study has been approved by the Hadassah Hospital Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:The study population will include a total of 360 community dwelling adults aged&#xD;
      ≥65 years, without significant cognitive impairment, (60 adults in the Pilot Study, and a&#xD;
      subsequent 300 adults in the Phase II main study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Recruitment will be by flyers and lectures by the study PI's, at local elderly&#xD;
      clubs, day centers, and independent living facilities (retirement homes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent: Informed consent will be attained following a detailed explanation given by&#xD;
      the study physician experienced in geriatrics/exercise medicine (either the PI Prof Jacobs or&#xD;
      Co Investigator-to be announced closer to the study initiation) concerning study details and&#xD;
      any possible medical complications caused either directly (e.g. risk of falls and fractures,&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pains, strained ligaments) or secondary to the exercise programs (e.g.&#xD;
      cardiac arrhythmias or angina).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure and design of research tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Phase I: Preliminary preparations and a pilot study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Designing the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Developing a dedicated digital app of the selected tests: 'Montfort Brain Monitor Ltd'&#xD;
           will provide an app to enable measurement of the test battery using the mobile phone.&#xD;
           Following testing using the smartphone at home, data will be remotely uploaded to the&#xD;
           Montfort data bank for subsequent analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Developing the Exercise Program: The photos and videos of the exercises will be&#xD;
           presented in a user-friendly manner on the user's smartphone, TV or computer screen.&#xD;
           Throughout the study period, participants will receive regular notifications via the&#xD;
           smartphone, reminding them to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pilot Study: Validation of the study instrument: Older adults (n=60), from the Netanya&#xD;
           area (close to Wingate College) will be recruited for the pilot study. They will be&#xD;
           tested using both the smartphone app as well as state of art laboratory tests, will be&#xD;
           given an exercise program installed on their phone for performing at home, and will be&#xD;
           tested again after 6 weeks of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Preparations for the main study: At this point, a study app will be finalized for&#xD;
           running the smartphone app tests + running the matched exercise programs (provided&#xD;
           individually by the research exercise specialists), and uploading data to the remote&#xD;
           data bank for subsequent analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Phase II: Main Study lasting 12 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants (n=300) from day care centers, elderly clubs, retirement villages, etc.,&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The experimental group: (n=100). Intervention-Personalized exercise program focusing&#xD;
           upon Balance/Upper limb/shoulder flexibility and strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An active control group: (n=100). All participants in this group will receive exercise&#xD;
           counseling and asked to exercise according to the official general guidelines published&#xD;
           by the World Health Organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A control group: (n=100). Advised to continue their normal routine, and if interested,&#xD;
           will be able use the smart app exercise program after the completion of the main study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from all groups will be tested individually by the tests app before (T0), after&#xD;
      6 weeks (T1), and after 3 months (T2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Phase III: Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental group and the active control group will be re-assessed 6 weeks (T3) and 3&#xD;
      months (T4) following the termination of Phase II. The control group will get the treatment&#xD;
      at that point, if they so desire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Power Analysis: Statistical power was calculated using G * Power. Based on a&#xD;
      2-way ANOVA (3 groups X 5 tests) with repeated measures on the tests factor, 100 participants&#xD;
      in each subgroup enable detecting group differences in statistical power of &gt;99% for a&#xD;
      moderate (Cohen's f = .25) and large (Cohen's f = .4) effect size. In addition, the&#xD;
      statistical power for detecting differences between repeated measures, and in the interaction&#xD;
      between groups in the repeated measures is higher than 99% in the moderate effect size as&#xD;
      well as in the high effect size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Additional Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sociodemographic data&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Self-reported medical diagnosis and health related variables, Frailty Index&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Level of physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Mini-Cog test validated Hebrew version&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Geriatric depression score (short 5 item validated Hebrew version )&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Quality of life assessment ( Short Form-36, validated Hebrew version)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants in the experimental group (Personalized Balance/strength/flexibility&#xD;
           exercise programs) will show greater improvement than participants with similar profiles&#xD;
           in the active-control or control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants in the experimental group will adhere more to the exercise regime than&#xD;
           participants in the active control group, thus will exhibit significantly more physical&#xD;
           and motor improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Both the experimental group and the active control group will gain more improvements in&#xD;
           fitness than the non-active control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: the selected digital tests for assessing the fitness components are to be&#xD;
      determined in the first study phase. It is likely that a two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA,&#xD;
      3 groups X 5 measurements) with repeated measures on the measurements factor will be applied&#xD;
      in most tests. Fisher Least Significant Difference will be used for post-hoc analyses.&#xD;
      Significance level for all statistical tests will be set at alpha = .05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Equipment and Films of exercises: The new exercises created for the current study will be&#xD;
      photographed and/or filmed for video at the laboratory of education technology at the Wingate&#xD;
      College.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to establish the validity of the new dedicated mobile phone tests, participants of&#xD;
      the pilot study will be tested on gold standard measurements at the biomechanical,&#xD;
      physiological and motor control laboratories at the Wingate College. The laboratories are&#xD;
      equipped with the following devices: Vicon Motion Capture Systems for 3D motion analysis&#xD;
      (gait analysis and postural control), Biodex Medical Systems for isokinetic force&#xD;
      measurements (strength of upper and lower extremities), motorized treadmill -Woodway, Germany&#xD;
      (cardiovascular fitness - predicted VO2), and Balance Tutor (postural control, static and&#xD;
      dynamic balance).&#xD;
