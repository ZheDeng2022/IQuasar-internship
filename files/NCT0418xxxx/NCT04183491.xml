      This study is designed to assess pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of interferon beta-1a&#xD;
      and peginterferon beta-1a across an appropriate dose range to inform clinical trial operating&#xD;
      characteristics for future clinical pharmacology pharmacodynamics similarity studies.&#xD;

      This study is designed to assess pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of interferon beta-1a&#xD;
      and peginterferon beta-1a across an appropriate dose range to inform clinical trial operating&#xD;
      characteristics for future clinical pharmacology pharmacodynamics similarity studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-dose, parallel arm study in 84 healthy&#xD;
      subjects assigned to one of three dose groups (low, intermediate, and high) of each drug&#xD;
      (interferon beta-1a and peginterferon beta-1a) or placebo. Interferon beta-1a doses are 7.5,&#xD;
      15, and 30 µg. Peginterferon beta-1a doses are 31.25, 62.5, and 125 µg. Each arm will include&#xD;
      12 subjects (6 male and 6 female).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be admitted for treatment on day -1 and receive a single dose of study drug or&#xD;
      placebo on day 1. Depending on the treatment arm, subjects will remain in confinement for 7&#xD;
      days (interferon beta-1a) or 14 days (peginterferon beta-1a and placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples (approximately 5 mL per sample) will be collected for determination of plasma&#xD;
      concentrations for study drug and neopterin levels. Additional blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected for determination of lipids (5 mL per sample; pharmacodynamic measure) and&#xD;
      exploratory proteomics analyses (5 mL per sample).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluations will include adverse event (AE) monitoring, vital sign measurements, and&#xD;
      physical examinations. All AEs reported by the subject or observed by the investigator or&#xD;
      clinical research unit (CRU) staff will be recorded. Any AE reported after the informed&#xD;
      consent is signed and before study drug application will be recorded as medical history.&#xD;

Subjects and staff will be blinded to treatment assignment during confinement, but route of administration will not be blinded. The blind will be maintained through a randomization schedule held by the dispensing pharmacist. Subjects and staff will be informed of a subject's end of study day when discharged from confinement. Subjects and staff will not be informed of the specific treatment arm assignment. The clinical research nurse will administer the subcutaneous study drug in unit dose containers that are not transparent.</masking_description>

             and comprehensive metabolic panel) at Screening that are outside the reference ranges&#xD;
             provided by the clinical laboratory and considered clinically significant by the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Subject has a positive test result at Screening for HIV 1 or 2 antibody, hepatitis C&#xD;
