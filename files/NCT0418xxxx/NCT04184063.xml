    <measure>Changes in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy rating Scale (PSPRS) individual scales scores from baseline in PSP patients compared to placebo treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 85 days</time_frame>
    <description>For PSP specific scales (to study on PSP patients):- Progressive Supranuclear Palsy rating Scale is used as a quantitative measurement of disability in PSP patients. The available total score ranges from 0 (normal) to 100. Six items are rated on a 3-point scale (0-2) and 22 are rated on a 5-point scale (0-4). The History/Daily Activities area includes seven items with a total maximum of 24 points, the mentation area four items with 16 points, the bulbar area two items with 8 points, the ocular motor area four items with 16 points, the limb motor area six items with 16 points and the gait area five items with 20 points. Scores from each subscale is summed and combined to compute a total score. Higher values for each scale range provided represent worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Changes in FAB individual scales scores from baseline in PSP patients compared to placebo treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 85 days</time_frame>
    <description>For PSP specific scales (to study on PSP patients):- Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) is a brief tool that can be used at the bedside or in a clinic setting to assist in discriminating between dementias with a frontal dysexecutive phenotype and Dementia of Alzheimer's Type (DAT). The FAB has validity in distinguishing Fronto-temporal type dementia from DAT in mildly demented patients (MMSE &gt; 24). The 6 subtests of the FAB explore the following: conceptualization and abstract reasoning; mental flexibility; motor programming and executive control of action; resistance to interference; inhibitory control; and environmental autonomy. Each subtest is scored from 3 (better score) to 0, for a maximum score of 18. Scores from each subscale is summed and combined to compute a total score. Higher scores indicate better performance.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS) individual scale from baseline in MSA patients compared to placebo treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 85 days</time_frame>
    <description>Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS) is a multimodal scale used to provide a surrogate measure of disease progression in multiple system atrophy. Components: Part I, historical, 12 items; Part II, motor examination, 14 items; Part III, autonomic examination (descriptive); and Part IV, global disability scale. Scale is used by physician who rates the average functional situation for the past 2 weeks (unless specified) according to the patient and caregiver interview. Scores are ranging from 0 to 104; higher scores indicate greater impairment. Rating scale includes autonomic symptoms (questions 9-12 - activities of daily living subscale [range 0-16]) and motor symptoms (questions 1-8 - activities of daily living subscale [range 0-32] and the UMSARS motor examination subscale, range 0-56), as well as their effect on activities of daily life (activities of daily living subscale, range 0-48). Scores from each subscale is summed and combined to compute a total score.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Non-Motor Symptoms assessment scale (NMSS) individual scale from baseline in MSA patients compared to placebo treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 85 days</time_frame>
    <description>Non-Motor Symptoms assessment scale for Parkinson s disease assesses 9 domains: Cardiovascular (2 items); Sleep/fatigue (4 items); Mood/cognition (6 items); Perceptual problems/hallucinations (3 items); Attention/memory (3 items); Gastrointestinal tract (3 items); Urinary function (3 items); Sexual function (2 items); and Miscellaneous (4 items). Score for each item is based on a multiple of severity (from 0 to 3) and frequency scores (from 1 to 4). The scale can therefore capture symptoms that are severe but relatively infrequent and those that may be less severe but persistent. Scores from each subscale is summed and combined to compute a total score. Lower result indicates better health results.</description>
