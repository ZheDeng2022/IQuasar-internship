    <textblock>
      In this study, the characterization of human malignant glioma cell lines is described. After&#xD;
      mechanical and enzymatic digestion of glioblastoma human biopsies from Neuromed IRCCS&#xD;
      Neurosurgery patients, the investigators analyzed the established cell lines by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry. The investigators have already characterized 10 cell lines and results&#xD;
      revealed that not all cell lines are positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), but&#xD;
      only one was positive: the so-called COGI cell line. Moreover, the expression of Isocitrate&#xD;
      Dehydrogenase 1(IDH1) and alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked protein&#xD;
      (ATRX) was investigated in all established cell lines. COGI cell line was also positive for&#xD;
      IDH1R132 mutation and for ATRX. The results of characterization were summarized in table 1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive type of brain tumor arising from glial cells&#xD;
      accounting for 52% of all parenchymal brain cancer cases and 20% of all intracranial tumors.&#xD;
      GBM has pronounced mitotic activity, substantial tendency toward neoangiogenesis&#xD;
      (microvascular proliferation), necrosis, and high proliferative rates. Because of their&#xD;
      intrinsic infiltrative nature, GBM has a highly aggressive malignant clinical course. The&#xD;
      adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (RT) with temozolomide (TMZ) after maximal safe resection remains&#xD;
      the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain cancer is a unique because of the &quot;blood-brain barrier&quot;, which severely restricts the&#xD;
      bloodstream of the brain. While the blood brain barrier (BBB) is great for protecting the&#xD;
      brain from danger, when the brain has cancer cells, the BBB can be a problem. Therefore, it&#xD;
      is important to find new drug targets. The mechanisms underlying radio- and chemo-resistance&#xD;
      are poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that up-regulation of the molecular target of&#xD;
      rapamycin (mTOR) plays a pivotal role in determining resistance to treatment. The&#xD;
      upregulation of mTOR in GBM has been reported by multiple experimental and pathological&#xD;
      findings. Moreover, the up-regulation of mTOR is also the key for cell growth and cell&#xD;
      proliferation as demonstrated by in vivo studies. In fact, specific factors derived from&#xD;
      brain endothelial cells maintain glioblastoma stem-like cell expansion through the mTOR&#xD;
      pathway. The key to successful treatment of glioblastoma will be no doubt in the realization&#xD;
      that this clinic is an entity in biologic terms, more than one disease, and is likely that&#xD;
      specific targeted therapies will be effective in molecularly defined subsets. In this way,&#xD;
      the molecular classification of these tumors will be defined in clinically relevant terms&#xD;
      based on the identification of markers that define subsets and are predictive of response to&#xD;
      promising agents. Additional investigations and identifications of new biomarkers will help&#xD;
      to better define the clinical and biologic subtypes of glioblastoma and an improved disease&#xD;
      control. In short, the brain tumor has peculiar ad personam mutations. This is why the&#xD;
      investigators have decided to set up primary lines starting from the patient's biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results of the scientific research project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first instance, the primary outcome will be to establish cell cultures and stem cells&#xD;
      that faithfully reproduce in vitro the physiology of the tumor maintaining the same&#xD;
      characteristics of patient's neoplasm&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effect of new target drugs on the proliferation of primary and continuous&#xD;
           human glioblastoma cell lines by setting up growth curves and methyl thiazolyl&#xD;
           tetrazolium (MTT) toxicity assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Screening of natural and synthetic drugs using patient-derived primary glioblastoma cell&#xD;
           lines&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Characterize the mechanisms and proteins involved in the apoptotic and / or autophagic&#xD;
           pathway with immunohistochemistry and western blot assays in control and treated cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Validation of previously identified molecular targets in preclinical models of brain&#xD;
           cancers. The investigators are able to identify novel molecular determinants that can be&#xD;
           targeted by pharmacological intervention to decrease or block the tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor Specimen Collection and Cryopreservation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resection specimens of glioblastoma (GBM) tumors (n = 20) were received sterile and freshly&#xD;
      from Neuromed Neurosurgery. Tumor tissue samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and&#xD;
      stored in the gas phase above liquid nitrogen. Additionally, tumor tissue cubes (3 × 3 × 3&#xD;
      mm) were frozen vitally. For this procedure, tumor pieces were cut with a sterile scalpel&#xD;
      blade, and 4 tumor pieces were transferred into a sterile cryo-tube in 1.5 ml freezing medium&#xD;
      (fetal calf serum containing 10% DMSO), sealed in a freezing container (Nalgene, Rochester ,&#xD;
      USA), and placed immediately at -80 ° C. Until thawing, tubes were kept at -80 ° C (for at&#xD;
      maximum of 6 weeks) or, after overnight cooling, transferred to nitrogen tank (for longer&#xD;
      storage periods).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical samples from 5 patients with WHO grade IV GBM and 3 patient with a relapsed&#xD;
      Astrocytoma, WHO grade III and one with oligodendroglioma grade III (Table 1) were collected&#xD;
      from the Neurosurgery department at Neuromed IRCCS. Prior informed consent was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue Culture and Cell Line Establishment&#xD;
&#xD;
      With written consent from patients and/or in accordance with institutional guidelines,&#xD;
      immediately after the resection collect tumor samples (200-500 mg of tumor is recommended)&#xD;
      into a tube containing cold sterile stem cell media without growth factors. Transport the&#xD;
      specimen immediately to the tissue culture hood for processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For surgeries at a remote site, cut the tumor sample into smaller fragments and place into a&#xD;
      tube containing cold sterile stem cell media without growth factors (keep on ice) for&#xD;
      transportation. The tumor can be processed within 2-3 hours after the resection. Tumor&#xD;
      specimens from a pre-clinical animal model of human GBM tumor can also be collected and&#xD;
      processed in the same way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In sterile BSL II laminar flow hood, place the tumor into a 35 mm petri dish with 3 mL of&#xD;
      Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS). Wash tumor specimen (2 to 3 times) by transferring them&#xD;
      sequentially to new 35 mm dishes filled with 5 mL HBSS to remove blood and debris. Aspirate&#xD;
      excessive HBSS from the dish. Immediately cut the tumor into small fragments and mince with a&#xD;
      sterile scalpel blade into approximately 1 mm3 fragments. The best yield can be achieved when&#xD;
      tumors are minced to very small pieces. Add 3 mL of enzymatic digestion mixture&#xD;
      (collagenaseD/DNase 1) to the minced tissue and collect the minced tissue with 5 mL&#xD;
      disposable pipet, pipetting up and down a few times. Then, transfer the tumor fragments into&#xD;
      30 mL of pre-warmed enzymatic digestion mixture.The final concentration of enzymes should be&#xD;
      1 mg collagenase D and 0.1 mg DNase I per milliliter of HBSS. After digestion tissue single&#xD;
      cells were washed and plated . The cell lines were identified with the first letters of&#xD;
      patient's name and surname.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growth Kinetics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cells (5×10^5 cells) were plated in 5 ml media in quintuplicate in T25 culture flasks per&#xD;
      cell line and allowed to attach for 48 h; vital cells were assessed by trypan blue staining&#xD;
      and one flask was counted every 24 h for five consecutive days using a Neubauer chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      For analyzing the MGMT promoter concerning methylation the MethyLight method was applied.&#xD;
      Briefly, genomic DNA (gDNA) was subject to bisulfite conversion using the Epitect Bisulfite&#xD;
      Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A primer/probe&#xD;
      combination specific for methylated MGMT promoter sequence was used (forward:&#xD;
      5'-GCGTTTCGACGTTCGTAGGT-3'; reverse: 5'-CACTCTTCCGAAAACGAAACG-3'; probe:&#xD;
      5'-6FAM-CGCAAACGATACGCACCGCGA-TMR-3'), with SensiFast Probe Kit (Bioline, Luckenwalde,&#xD;
      Germany). Cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) Methylase (SssI) treated DNA served as&#xD;
      calibrator, as it is considered as fully methylated. The collagenase gene 2A1 (COL2A1), was&#xD;
      used as endogenous control (forward: 5'-TCTAACAATTATAAACTCCAACCACCAA-3'; reverse:&#xD;
      5'-GGGAAGATGGGATAGAAGGGAATAT-3'; probe: 5'-6FAM-CCTTCATTCTAACCCAATACCTATCCCACCTCTAAA-TMR-3').&#xD;
      The percentage of methylated reference (PMR) value was calculated by dividing the MGMT/COL2A1&#xD;
      ratio of the sample by the MGMT/COL2A1 ratio of the SssI-treated DNA, and multiplying by 100.&#xD;
      Samples with a PMR value &gt;4 were considered as methylated. All reactions were performed in&#xD;
      triplicate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mutation analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples underwent analyses for the following loci: IDH1 R132 (exon 4), IDH2 R172 (exon 4),&#xD;
      B-Raf V600 (exon 15), K-Ras G12, G13 (exon 2) and Q61 (exon 3) and TP53 exons 5 to 8. The&#xD;
      desired genomic regions were amplified by PCR using specific primers. The polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (PCR) was performed using MyTaqHS polymerase (Bioline) according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's recommendations. The PCR reaction was controlled by agarose gel&#xD;
      electrophoresis and 15 µl of the products were purified using 3 units of FAST AP™ Alkaline&#xD;
      Phosphatase (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and 30U of Exonuclease I (Fermentas) by&#xD;
      incubation at 37°C for 15 min and subsequent heat inactivation at 85°C for 15 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Success Rates&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator assessed attachment and outgrowth rates of 2 consecutive WHO grade IV GBM&#xD;
      tumor samples and two relapsed Astrocytoma, when prepared fresh directly after resection&#xD;
      (culture #4). After fresh preparation, cells attached in 100% of the cases. The four most&#xD;
      rapidly and stable outgrowing pairs of cell cultures were subsequently characterized in&#xD;
      detail. In the following, stable outgrowing cultures (could be passaged &gt;10 times) are termed&#xD;
      cell lines. Cell lines derived from fresh material were marked with the initials of the&#xD;
      patient's name and surname to ensure anonymity while respecting the patient's privacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunohistochemistry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Representative cell line of each tumour were stained by Immunohistochemistry for&#xD;
      Ki67(proliferation index estimated as a (%) percentage of positive cells in a field of 100),&#xD;
      IDH1, ATRX (markers of brain tumors) and GFAP (glial marker) (Ventana, Tucson, Ariz.) was&#xD;
      performed automatically with a Nexes instrument (Ventana). Antibody detection was performed&#xD;
      using a multilink streptavidin-biotin complex method, and antibodies were visualized by a&#xD;
      diaminobenzidine chromagen method. Negative control samples were incubated with primary&#xD;
      antibodies only.&#xD;

      On these established cell cultures, new substances, including natural substances, will be&#xD;
      tested and used as adjuvant substances for traditional therapy with Temodal. In this project&#xD;
      the investigator intends to use coumaric acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effect of coumaric acid on the proliferation of human glioblastoma cells:&#xD;
           primary and continuous lines;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate the mechanisms triggered by coumaric acid in the neoplastic cell to block&#xD;
           its growth. Analyze the expression of regulatory cell cycle proteins in human&#xD;
           glioblastoma cells after treatment with coumaric acid at various concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the growth of human glioblastoma cells in an animal model (naked CD1 mice&#xD;
           inoculated with a continuous line of human glioblastoma U87MG cells) and after coumaric&#xD;
           acid treatment.&#xD;
