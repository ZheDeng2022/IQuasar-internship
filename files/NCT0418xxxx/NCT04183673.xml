      Objective To investigate the effectiveness of the use of the QMD Helios Laser device in&#xD;
      association with standard rehabilitation therapy in reducing inflammatory symptoms in&#xD;
      patients following total knee replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Randomized controlled trial. Setting Rehabilitation structure, inpatient Main outcome&#xD;
      measures Pain subscale of the WOMAC and Lequesne's Algo-Functional Index (LIKERT scale), knee&#xD;
      circumference (measured at the middle line of the knee joint space) and knee flexion&#xD;
      /extension range of motion by goniometer.&#xD;

      As life expectancy increases, more and more people are afflicted with degenerative joint&#xD;
      diseases. Knee osteoarthritis is a pathology typical of old age (over 60 years), but it can&#xD;
      also occur in younger people (aged 40-50 years) and is more prevalent in women (11%) than men&#xD;
      (7%). Total knee replacement surgery is becoming increasingly frequent.In the immediate&#xD;
      post-operative period, the main problems encountered by patients are: inflammation, edema&#xD;
      and, above all, pain. These can strongly influence the restoring of a correct muscle-joint&#xD;
      function and hence the time needed for a return to normal activities of daily living&#xD;
      (ADLs).Post-operative rehabilitation is now a fundamental part of the functional recovery of&#xD;
      patients after knee replacement surgery. Traditional rehabilitation programs are mainly&#xD;
      focused on improving joint mobility, reducing musculotendinous retractions, increasing muscle&#xD;
      strength and establishing a correct gait pattern. Over the years, in addition to the manual&#xD;
      rehabilitative techniques, the use of instrumental methods to stimulate the healing processes&#xD;
      and speed up recovery times has become a frequent practice, especially for the management of&#xD;
      post-operative pain and inflammation. One of these methods is laser therapy, which consists&#xD;
      of light radiation composed of a beam of photons with specific physical characteristics that&#xD;
      interacts with living tissue to produce an anti-inflammatory, analgesic and biostimulation&#xD;
      effect. Another form of instrumental therapy used in rehabilitation for the management of&#xD;
      pain/edema resulting from an inflammatory process is the application of cold (cryotherapy) or&#xD;
      heat (thermotherapy) or both together in combination (contrast therapy). Cryotherapy is a&#xD;
      type of physical therapy that produces temporary anesthesia of the part undergoing&#xD;
      treatment.Thermotherapy consists of the application of heat to stimulate a biological process&#xD;
      inducing the release of chemotactic substances and growth factors, which have a powerful&#xD;
      regenerative and reparative action. An innovative device that combines the therapeutic&#xD;
      advantages of these different forms of physical therapy is QMD Helios (Hakomed, Egna, BZ,&#xD;
      Italy), designed to provide cryo-thermal and laser treatment. The device is equipped with a&#xD;
      high-power diode laser. This therapeutic laser can work at 3 different wavelengths (808&#xD;
      nm,1064 nm, 1120 nm). The wavelengths are each individually controlled and can be delivered&#xD;
      in various modes: continuous wave, pulsed mode, super pulse, and Harmonic pulsation (laser&#xD;
      wave emission with a variable frequency - determined by means of a scan performed by the&#xD;
      device - suited to the tissue to be treated). This innovative triple-wavelength emission&#xD;
      represents the most versatile solution when one wishes to obtain different therapeutic&#xD;
      effects at the same time. In addition to the use of laser, the device allows the application&#xD;
      of cryo-thermal therapy, simultaneously or separately. Simultaneous administration promotes&#xD;
      thermal shock, a basic principle of contrast therapy characterized by a marked variation of&#xD;
      temperature (30-40 degrees) within a short space of time (30-60 seconds) inducing&#xD;
      vasodilation through the heat and vasoconstriction through the cold. Thermal shock is&#xD;
      effective in the early stages of rehabilitation for a rapid resolution of pain and&#xD;
      swelling.Although in recent years instrumental therapy has come to play a very important role&#xD;
      in rehabilitation medicine in the management of pain/inflammation in the acute patient, there&#xD;
      is lack of reported evidence in the literature on the use of laser therapy in patients after&#xD;
      knee replacement surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the use&#xD;
      of the QMD Helios laser device in association with standard rehabilitation therapy in&#xD;
      reducing edema and pain symptoms in patients following total knee replacement.&#xD;
