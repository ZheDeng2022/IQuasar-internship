      Under contract to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Mathematica is&#xD;
      conducting an impact study of California Department of Public Health, Center for Family&#xD;
      Health, Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health's (MCAH) Adolescent Family Life Program&#xD;
      Positive Youth Development (PYD) program for a Federal Evaluation of Programs for Expectant&#xD;
      and Parenting Youth (PEPY). The impact study will be designed to address the impact of PYD,&#xD;
      compared to the business-as-usual condition, AFLP, in delaying repeat pregnancies, completing&#xD;
      high school, improving health of the parent and child, and improving linkages and networks of&#xD;
      support for expectant and parenting teens.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Adolescent Family Life Program (AFLP) has been used by MCAH for more than 3 decades. The&#xD;
      program was recently enhanced with a positive youth development component, referred to as&#xD;
      Adolescent Family Life Program Positive Youth Development (PYD) program. The enhanced program&#xD;
      is a shorter, more intensive program that requires case managers to use motivational&#xD;
      interviewing to guide participating youth through a prescribed set of activities designed to&#xD;
      set achievable goals for life planning and building self-sufficiency. A random assignment&#xD;
      design will be used to assess the program's impact on exposure to program content and short&#xD;
      term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation includes two sub-studies, each with a distinct design. In the first sub-study,&#xD;
      individuals were randomly assigned as part of the enrollment process within two provider&#xD;
      sites to receive either PYD or AFLP. These two provider sites could support individual random&#xD;
      assignment because they had enough case managers and clients to support both study conditions&#xD;
      (PYD and AFLP). In the second sub-study, 13 provider sites, each with a smaller number of&#xD;
      case managers and clients, were randomly assigned to PYD or AFLP. In this second sub-study,&#xD;
      participants enrolled after sites were randomly assigned. Potential study participants were&#xD;
      recruited between December 2014 and January 2017, and were considered eligible for&#xD;
      participation if they were they (1) were interested in the program, (2) were pregnant or&#xD;
      parenting, (3) had not been served at the site in the prior six months, (4) spoke either&#xD;
      English or Spanish, (5) were between ages 14 and 18, and (6) were not enrolled in Nurse&#xD;
      Family Partnerships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For sub-study 1, potential participants who were eligible were randomly assigned to (1) a&#xD;
      treatment group that was eligible for PYD or (2) a control group that received AFLP. Random&#xD;
      assignment was conducted within two blocks determined by random assignment site and whether&#xD;
      study participants were pregnant at the time of random assignment or were parenting at the&#xD;
      time of random assignment. After random assignment, the study enrollment manager assigned the&#xD;
      young mother to a case manager delivering the program to which she was assigned. The assigned&#xD;
      case manager then tried to locate and conduct a first visit with each randomized youth&#xD;
      mother, but not all could be found. For most who were found and visited, case managers were&#xD;
      instructed to follow a script that described the program in general terms (without&#xD;
      differentiating between AFLP and PYD) and the study in detail. The script did not reveal the&#xD;
      group to which the young mother was assigned. As part of the scripted interaction, case&#xD;
      managers sought study consent from young mothers to participate in the study data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For sub-study 2, provider sites were first randomized to either the PYD or AFLP. Young&#xD;
      mothers were then referred to sites in the same manner as in the first sub-study, went&#xD;
      through the same initial eligibility screening process. Eligible mothers were assigned a case&#xD;
      manager. The assigned case manager then tried to locate and conduct a first visit with each&#xD;
      eligible youth mother, but not all could be found. For most who were found and visited, case&#xD;
      managers were instructed to follow a script that described the program in general terms&#xD;
      (without differentiating between AFLP and PYD) and the study in detail. The script did not&#xD;
      reveal the group to which the young mother was assigned. As part of the scripted interaction,&#xD;
      case managers sought study consent from young mothers to participate in the study data&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study draws on data from LodeStar, MCAH's administrative records on service receipt, a&#xD;
      baseline survey administered after enrollment into the study, a follow-up survey administered&#xD;
      approximately 12 months after enrollment and a follow up survey administered approximately 24&#xD;
      months after enrollment.&#xD;
