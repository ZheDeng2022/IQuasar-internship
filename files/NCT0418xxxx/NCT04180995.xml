  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is one monocentric, single-arm, open, phase Ⅱ clinical study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of Toripalimab monoclonal injection (Tuo Yi) combined with axitinib&#xD;
      tablet (Inlyta®) as neoadjuvant therapy for localized mucosal melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To evaluate pathological response (pCR+pPR) rate of Toripalimab combined&#xD;
      with axitinib as neoadjuvant therapy for localized mucosal melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will receive Toripalimab and Axitinib combined therapy after enrollment, and&#xD;
      receive operation 2 weeks after the last dose of Axitinib. Toripalimab will be given for a&#xD;
      total of 4 cycles (8 weeks), whereas Axitinib will be given for a total of 8 weeks.The&#xD;
      subjects can receive Toripalimab for up to one year after the operation.&#xD;
