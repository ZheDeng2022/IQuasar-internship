      This Phase 2 study aims to improve preparedness for future Ebola outbreaks by vaccination of&#xD;
      a well-known population at risk, ie, a cohort of health care providers (HCP) (such as&#xD;
      primary, emergency, and community health care workers) who may be exposed to Ebola in the&#xD;
      event of a future outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This study will&#xD;
      enhance the immunogenicity database by investigating the kinetics of the humoral immune&#xD;
      response. The study will contribute to the safety database (serious adverse events) for&#xD;
      VAC52150 following a heterologous vaccine regimen with Ad26.ZEBOV as first vaccine followed&#xD;
      by second dose with MVA-BN-Filo administered 56 days later (Day 57). Additionally, after&#xD;
      randomization (1:1), a booster vaccination with Ad26.ZEBOV will be executed at 1 year post&#xD;
      first dose or 2 years post first dose.&#xD;

      This study is an open-label, monocentric (in Tshuapa province, DRC), phase 2 study to&#xD;
      evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Ad26.ZEBOV (5x1010 viral particles [vp]) as first&#xD;
      dose and MVA-BN-Filo (1x108 50% infectious units [Inf U]) as second dose vaccination at a&#xD;
      56-day interval in health care providers (HCP) who may be exposed to Ebola in the event of a&#xD;
      future Ebola outbreak in DRC. Additionally, after randomization (1:1) a booster of Ad26.ZEBOV&#xD;
      (5x1010 vp) will be offered at respectively 1 year or 2 years after the first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A planned total number of approximately 700 participants will be recruited from the Tshuapa&#xD;
      province in DRC. At Day 1, interested participants will be assessed for their understanding&#xD;
      of the study, will provide consent, their general health will be evaluated by the&#xD;
      investigator, medical history (including vaccination history) will be collected, urine&#xD;
      pregnancy testing for women of childbearing potential will be performed. Further during this&#xD;
      first visit, vital signs will be measured and a blood sample for baseline immunogenicity&#xD;
      assessment will be taken for testing of binding antibody level against EBOV GP using FANG&#xD;
      ELISA, presence of pre-existing Human anti-EBOV GP IgG and anti-EBOV NP IgG using ELISA and&#xD;
      on the first 100 subjects additionally testing for neutralizing antibody level against Ad26&#xD;
      and MVA vectors using respectively Ad26 VNA and MVA PRNT. Subsequently, a blood sample for&#xD;
      baseline safety assessment will be performed to test hemoglobin, hematocrit, blood cell count&#xD;
      (red and white), platelet count, urea, creatinine and transaminases. After these primary&#xD;
      assessments, they will be vaccinated with first dose Ad26.ZEBOV vaccine. They will be given&#xD;
      instructions to contact the study team for any serious adverse event that occurs up until 6&#xD;
      months after each vaccination, or in case of pregnancy of the participant during the study.&#xD;
      Lastly on day 1, randomization will be performed (1:1) to determine timing of the booster&#xD;
      vaccine at 1 year or 2 years after first dose. Contact information will be verified and an&#xD;
      appointment for the second dose on Day 57 will be arranged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Day 57, participants will return to the study site for urine pregnancy testing for women&#xD;
      of childbearing potential, vital signs measurement, assessment of safety (serious adverse&#xD;
      events), for a blood sample for immunogenicity assessment (the binding antibody levels&#xD;
      against EBOV GP using FANG ELISA) and afterwards administration of the MVA-BN-Filo&#xD;
      vaccination, and they will be reminded to contact the study team for any serious adverse&#xD;
      event that occurs, or in case of pregnancy of the participant during the study. Contact&#xD;
      information will be verified and an appointment for the 21-day post-dose 2 (Day 78) visit&#xD;
      will be arranged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 21 days post-dose 2 (Day 78), all participants will return to the study site for&#xD;
      assessment of safety (serious adverse events) and collection of a blood sample for&#xD;
      immunogenicity assessment. Contact information will be re-verified. They will be reminded to&#xD;
      contact the study team for any serious adverse event that occurs, or in case of pregnancy of&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At approximately 6 months post-dose 2 vaccination, participants will be contacted by phone to&#xD;
      inquire about any occurrence of serious adverse events, and to confirm contact information&#xD;
      for additional follow up at 1 year post-first dose vaccination. At 1 year after first vaccine&#xD;
      dose, a blood sample will be collected for immunogenicity assessment of all participants&#xD;
      (where applicable, pre-administration of the booster dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on randomization performed at Day 1, the booster vaccination with Ad26.ZEBOV&#xD;
      (5x1010 vp) will be given at 1 year after the first dose or 2 years post-first dose.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to collect solicited adverse events in a participant diary&#xD;
      starting on the day of vaccination and continuing for the subsequent 7 days. At day 8 post&#xD;
      booster (PB) the safety data including solicited adverse events will be reviewed and a blood&#xD;
      sample for immunogenicity will be taken to document the immunity response. At 6 months PB,&#xD;
      the participants will be contacted by phone and questioned about any serious adverse events&#xD;
      that have occurred since the last vaccination. For all participants at 2 years after first&#xD;
      dose, a sample will be collected for immunogenicity assessment (where applicable,&#xD;
      pre-administration of the booster dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study is 2 years and 6 months post-first dose.&#xD;
