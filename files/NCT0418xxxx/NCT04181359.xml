    <textblock>
      Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) is a is a lung disorder which makes breathing more difficult.&#xD;
      During exercise, patients with ILD are not efficient breathers and this leads to serious&#xD;
      breathing difficulties, which often causes these patients to stop exercise at low&#xD;
      intensities. The investigators think that these patients with ILD have problems exchanging&#xD;
      fresh gas (i.e., oxygen) into the blood stream because of poor lung blood vessel function.&#xD;
      The investigators will test whether inhaled medications, specifically nitric oxide, can&#xD;
      improve lung blood vessel function and decrease breathing difficulties during exercise. With&#xD;
      this research, the investigators will understand more about breathing efficiency and lung&#xD;
      blood vessel function in mild ILD patients, and find out whether improving lung blood vessel&#xD;
      function helps ILD patients breathe easier and exercise longer. Understanding the reasons&#xD;
      behind the feeling of difficult breathing may lead to more effective therapy and improved&#xD;
      quality of life in ILD patients.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) is a respiratory disorder characterized by chronic&#xD;
      inflammation and fibrosis of the lung parenchyma. Exertional dyspnea (perceived&#xD;
      breathlessness) is a hallmark of ILD regardless of severity and is the primary reason for the&#xD;
      observed exercise intolerance, typically observed in this population. Dyspnea in ILD has been&#xD;
      shown to profoundly reduce quality of life, physical activity, and impair the ability of&#xD;
      participants with ILD to complete day-to-day tasks. Previous work in ILD has demonstrated&#xD;
      that exertional dyspnea is the result of increased work of breathing during exercise, and&#xD;
      that this increased work of breathing comes from: 1) an exaggerated ventilatory response to&#xD;
      exercise (i.e. increased minute ventilation relative to carbon dioxide production,&#xD;
      V̇E/V̇CO2), and 2) airflow limitation (i.e. expiratory flow limitation and resulting dynamic&#xD;
      hyperinflation). A growing body of work has focused on respiratory mechanics in ILD; however,&#xD;
      very little has been done to understand and treat the exaggerated ventilatory response to&#xD;
      exercise in ILD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several previous studies in ILD have consistently shown an elevated ventilatory response&#xD;
      (i.e. greater V̇E/V̇CO2) during exercise. This increased V̇E/V̇CO2 in ILD appears to be&#xD;
      secondary to increased deadspace ventilation (i.e. sections of the lung with ventilation, but&#xD;
      no perfusion), and this increased deadspace ventilation results in a compensatory increase in&#xD;
      total minute ventilation (i.e. increased V̇E/V̇CO2) to maintain effective alveolar&#xD;
      ventilation and arterial blood gas homeostasis. The underlying mechanism(s) for the increased&#xD;
      deadspace ventilation and V̇E/V̇CO2 during exercise in mild ILD is currently unclear;&#xD;
      however, pulmonary microvascular abnormalities and hypoperfusion of pulmonary capillaries are&#xD;
      potential pathophysiologic mechanisms. Individuals with ILD have a reduced pulmonary&#xD;
      capillary blood volume and, in more severe ILD, present with pulmonary vascular dysfunction&#xD;
      and are prone to developing exercise-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension. It is likely&#xD;
      that the pulmonary vascular dysfunction, in ILD, may impair pulmonary capillary perfusion,&#xD;
      leading to ventilation (V̇A) -perfusion (Q̇) inequality (specifically, areas of high, V̇A/Q̇,&#xD;
      which is indicative of increased deadspace), however this has not yet been examined. Inhaled&#xD;
      nitric oxide (NO) is commonly used to test for pulmonary vasodilatory responses in&#xD;
      individuals with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), as it increases NO bioavailability&#xD;
      and improves pulmonary vascular function. Previous work in PAH and heart failure (HF) has&#xD;
      shown that standard doses (20-40 parts per million (ppm)) of inhaled NO can reduce pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular resistance and increase peak oxygen consumption (V̇O2peak). If inhaled NO can reduce&#xD;
      vascular dysfunction and increase perfusion in ILD, this would result in a reduction in&#xD;
      V̇E/V̇CO2 and dyspnea, and improved exercise tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To examine the effect of inhaled NO on exercise capacity (V̇O2peak), ventilation and&#xD;
      dyspnea in ILD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Inhaled NO will improve exercise capacity, secondary to reduced V̇E/V̇CO2 and&#xD;
      dyspnea, in individuals with ILD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized double-blind cross-over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six sessions will be completed over a 3-week period in the following order: Day 1)&#xD;
      Participant enrollment, medical history, standard pulmonary function (PFT) and&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). Days 2 &amp; 3) Randomly-ordered experimental CPETs while&#xD;
      either breathing room air or inhaled nitric oxide (room air with 40 ppm NO). Days 4 &amp; 5)&#xD;
      Randomly-ordered constant load exercise tests, at 75% peak power output, while either&#xD;
      breathing room air or inhaled nitric oxide (room air with 40 ppm NO). Day 6) Resting and&#xD;
      exercise trials while breathing room air or inhaled nitric oxide with ultrasonography doppler&#xD;
      measurements to determine pulmonary arterial systolic pressure. Each visit will take&#xD;
      approximately 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, participants will complete the informed consent procedure, fill out a medical&#xD;
      history questionnaire and be screened for exercise using the physical activity readiness&#xD;
      questionnaire. Study participants will undergo lung function and cardiopulmonary exercise&#xD;
      testing on the same day. The participants will be spending approximately three hours in the&#xD;
      laboratory on this testing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days 2 &amp; 3 (one day per week in 2 consecutive weeks; order randomized), the participants&#xD;
      will breathe the placebo, which is medical grade air (room air) or room air titrated with 40&#xD;
      parts per million of nitric oxide and have blood flow/cardiac output and expired gas&#xD;
      evaluated, and time to exhaustion determined in a standard incremental cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 2, the participant will lie supine and be rested for 5 minutes. Resting blood pressure&#xD;
      will be determined using manual auscultation. Resting cardiac output will be evaluated using&#xD;
      noninvasive impedance cardiography (PhysioflowTM) and oxygen saturation estimated with pulse&#xD;
      oximetry. Ventilation will be measured from expired gas analysis. Following these&#xD;
      measurements, the subject will begin to breathe medical grade room air. Following a 20 minute&#xD;
      wash-in period, ventilation, cardiac output and oxygen saturation recordings will be&#xD;
      repeated. Participants will then perform a standard cardiopulmonary exercise test while&#xD;
      continuing to breathe the medical grade room air. The participants will be spending&#xD;
      approximately three hours in the laboratory on this testing day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 3 will be identical to day 2 except, in the place of medical grade room air, participants&#xD;
      will breathe room air with 40 parts per million of nitric oxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days 4 &amp; 5 (one day per week in 2 consecutive weeks; order randomized), the participants&#xD;
      will breathe the placebo, which is medical grade air (room air) or room air titrated with 40&#xD;
      parts per million of nitric oxide and have blood flow/cardiac output and expired gas&#xD;
      evaluated, and time to exhaustion determined in a standard constant work rate cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise test. Measurement procedures will be identical to days 2 &amp; 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 6, the participants will complete resting and sub-maximal exercise trials while&#xD;
      breathing placebo or iNO, with ultrasonography Doppler measurements to determine pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial systolic pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will lie supine and be rested for 5 minutes. Resting blood pressure will be&#xD;
      determined using manual auscultation and pulmonary arterial pressure by echocardiography.&#xD;
      Resting cardiac output will be evaluated using impedance cardiography (PhysioflowTM) and&#xD;
      oxygen saturation estimated with pulse oximetry. Ventilation will be measured from expired&#xD;
      gas analysis. Following these measurements, the subject will begin to breathe either placebo&#xD;
      or iNO. Upon completion of resting measurements, participants will complete 5-minutes of&#xD;
      sub-maximal exercise at 40 Watts in each experimental conditions. All resting measurements&#xD;
      will be repeated during exercise. At least 10-minute recover will be given between conditions&#xD;
      to ensure washout of NO and restoration of baseline oxygen saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhaled Nitric Oxide Intervention: Inhaled NO is a selective pulmonary vasodilator and has&#xD;
      been shown to improve blood flow to well-ventilated lung areas (i.e. improve V̇A/Q̇ matching)&#xD;
      in conditions with elevated vascular tone. Inhaled NO has been previously shown to lower&#xD;
      pulmonary artery pressure during exercise in individuals with severe lung disease, while not&#xD;
      affecting systemic blood pressure. It is important to note that a selective pulmonary&#xD;
      vasodilator will be used instead of an intravenously infused vasodilator (e.g. prostacyclin)&#xD;
      to avoid systemic vasodilation, severe arterial hypotension and syncope. Consistent with&#xD;
      previous work, a standard 40 ppm dose of inhaled NO will be administered using a&#xD;
      non-rebreathing circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and Interpretation: A 2-way repeated measures ANOVA will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate the changes in V̇E/V̇CO2, dyspnea and exercise capacity (V̇O2peak) with inhaled NO&#xD;
      during exercise. Type of intervention (room air vs inhaled NO), and time-point (baseline and&#xD;
      during exercise) will be used as fixed factors in the statistical analysis. Should inhaled NO&#xD;
      reduce V̇E/V̇CO2 and dyspnea, and improve exercise capacity in ILD, these results would&#xD;
      indicate that pulmonary vascular dysfunction contributes to exercise intolerance as well as&#xD;
      the potentiated ventilatory and dyspnea response to exercise in participants with ILD.&#xD;
