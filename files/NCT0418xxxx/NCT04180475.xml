      This study will test the feasibility of MedRem, a novel medication reminder and tracking&#xD;
      system on wearable wrist devices, specifically with the Apple Watch 4. The study team will&#xD;
      load the MedRem app onto two Apple Watch 4s for use during the study. As the device is placed&#xD;
      on the wrist, it is free from the limitations of smartphones. However, one of the major&#xD;
      challenges in developing interactive systems for wrist devices is their form factor. The&#xD;
      touch screens available on these devices are tiny and much smaller compared to smart phones&#xD;
      and tablet computers. MedRem enables user interactions by incorporating speech recognition&#xD;
      and text-to-speech features along with clever interface design. The tiny display of the&#xD;
      device is used for minimal inputs and outputs, while a user can retrieve and provide more&#xD;
      information from/to the system through voice commands. Personalized models are built and&#xD;
      updated over time to reduce errors in recognizing users' voice commands, and thus better user&#xD;
      experience is provided.&#xD;
