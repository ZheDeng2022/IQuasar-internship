    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate dry mouth relief in subjects with self-reported&#xD;
      feeling of dry mouth after using an experimental mouth rinse or a positive control compared&#xD;
      to a water control.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a controlled, randomized, 3-treatment, parallel study for subjects with self-reported&#xD;
      dry mouth symptoms as determined by an Oral Examination and subject responses to the Dry&#xD;
      Mouth Inventory (DMI) questionnaire (see section 12) at the Acclimation visit. Qualified&#xD;
      subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three treatments at the Baseline visit. Safety&#xD;
      will be assessed by Oral Examinations at Baseline/Day1 and Day 8. Subjects will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires before product use, immediately after product use (Day 1 only), and after 30&#xD;
      minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours and 6 hours of product use on Baseline/Day 1 and Day 8. The&#xD;
      PPAQ II questionnaire will be completed on the morning of Day 8 (see study schedule for&#xD;
      details).&#xD;
