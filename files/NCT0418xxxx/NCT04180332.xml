      To evaluate the role of antioxidants - superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione and total&#xD;
      anti oxidant levels in the serum of chronic periodontitis patients and chronic periodontitis&#xD;
      with DM Type II patients, then to compare it with healthy controls, to assess their possible&#xD;
      role as biomarkers for chronic periodontitis and the possible systemic effects of&#xD;
      periodontitis.&#xD;

      This was a cross sectional study involving 300 subjects ,30-60 years of age. 80% was&#xD;
      calculated as the power of the study and error was set at 5%. The ethical clearance for the&#xD;
      study was obtained from the University central ethics committee. A consent form, was given to&#xD;
      all the subjects, which was explained to them and a written consent was taken before&#xD;
      enrolling them. As per the prepared case history format, case history was taken for all the&#xD;
      subjects who were part of the study The body mass index (BMI) was assessed and subjects who&#xD;
      were overweight &amp; obese, with a BMI above 25 , were not included in the study.7 Of the total&#xD;
      of 300 subjects,100 subjects who did not have any systemic diseases were included in group I&#xD;
      and III, and 100 subjects with diabetes mellitus type II, who were not suffering from any&#xD;
      other systemic diseases were included in group II. The diabetic patients in group II were on&#xD;
      oral medication (Metformin derivatives) and appropriate diet control measures, for a period&#xD;
      of at least one year but not more than five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I and II patients had chronic generalized severe periodontitis.8 Subjects in group III&#xD;
      were systemically healthy and not suffering from any periodontal disease. A single trained&#xD;
      investigator examined the periodontal status of all the subjects. Any other type of&#xD;
      periodontitis was not included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were excluded if they had taken antibiotics any time in the last 4 weeks. Vitamin&#xD;
      and mineral supplement intake and those who underwent periodontal treatment procedures in the&#xD;
      course of the last 6 months were eliminated from the study. Tobacco users, alcoholics,&#xD;
      pregnant as well as lactating women were not included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only subjects who had a a RBS score of less than 120 and HbA1c score of less than 7 were&#xD;
      accepted in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then a periodontal examination was carried out, the status of the periodontal condition was&#xD;
      determined, and the subjects were alloted to the three groups by the single trained&#xD;
      investigator,patient was also referred to a physician to determine the systemic condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this the patients were allotted to the various groups as per the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Patients not fulfilling the various criteria were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5ml of venous blood was taken from the ante cubital vein from each of the study subjects. The&#xD;
      blood from each of the subjects was centrifuged and then stored at -20Â°C. The serum samples&#xD;
      were then analysed for the various anti oxidants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis of the data was done using SPSS version 17&#xD;
      software. The comparison of the means of the 2 groups was done using the students 'T' test.&#xD;
      Analysis of variance (ANOVA) two tailed test was used to compare the means of more than 2&#xD;
      groups. HSD tukey test with ANOVA jointly,was used to find means that were significantly&#xD;
      different from one another. 'p' value (level of significance) less than 0.05 was taken to be&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 ml venous blood which was taken from each study subject was divided into 2 parts. 2 ml of&#xD;
      it was collected in EDTA coated vacutainer tubes and 2 ml in plain tubes. The blood in the&#xD;
      EDTA coated tubes was used to assess GSH &amp; SOD. The blood in the plain tubes was used to&#xD;
      assess the CAT and total antioxidant levels . It was centrifuged and the serum obtained was&#xD;
      stored at - 200C for subsequent analysis Superoxide dismutase, glutathione and catalase were&#xD;
      assessed by u.v double beam spectrophotometer and total anti-oxidant levels by&#xD;
      spectrophotometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total antioxidant capacity of serum was determined by the phosphomolybdenum method . The&#xD;
      estimation of superoxide dismutase enzyme was carried out by Beauchamp and Frodovich method.&#xD;
      The catalase activity was assessed using the Hydrogen Peroxide reduction method and&#xD;
      estimation of glutathione was by the DTNB method.&#xD;
