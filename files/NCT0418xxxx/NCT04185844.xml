  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite many advances in our understanding of the natural history and progression of chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease (CKD) and cardio vascular disease (CVD) in the parent CRIC study over the past&#xD;
      15 years, important questions about key risk factors for these diseases remain unanswered in&#xD;
      the AI population. To address this burden of CKD in AI communities Investigators formed a&#xD;
      consortium of investigators with extensive experience in conducting research of chronic&#xD;
      diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular and kidney disease in AIs of Southwestern US. The&#xD;
      proposed CRIC ancillary cohort study of 500 AIs (AI-CRIC) will rapidly improve our&#xD;
      understanding of both potential risk factors for CKD progression, as well as the scope of&#xD;
      this disease among AIs. This study leverages the current CRIC study and incorporates the&#xD;
      planned activities of the next phase of the study - &quot;CRIC 2018&quot; - by implementing&#xD;
      contemporary CRIC protocols for kidney and cardiovascular measurement and outcomes.&#xD;

      Investigators will conduct a longitudinal study of a CKD cohort of Southwest AIs to identify&#xD;
      unique risk factors for CKD and CVD progression and compare CKD and CVD event rates and risk&#xD;
      factors between AI and the populations represented in CRIC. Investigators will establish a&#xD;
      specimen bank to support future ancillary studies designed to identify and examine biomarkers&#xD;
      associated with the progression of CKD in AIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Clinic Visit the following will occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  weight is measured&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood pressure and heart rate are recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  information about medical history and medication used recently&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood draw (about Â½ cup) for the following tests: CBC (Complete Blood Count), tests of&#xD;
           metabolism, and several other heart and kidney tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood pressure in the leg and arm calculated as the Ankle Brachial Index (ABI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  urine sample collection for kidney function testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete questionnaires about quality of life, diet, mood, thought processes and&#xD;
           physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This visit takes about 1 to 2 hours. Participants will be contacted by telephone six months&#xD;
      after the Baseline Visit to ask about recent medical events and medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to return to the center for annual visits during which many but&#xD;
      not all of the procedures described above will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will be asked to participate in one of two substudies using remote&#xD;
      data collection techniques to identify trajectories of kidney function and cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk sub-phenotypes&#xD;
