    <textblock>
      The P-VECT Study proposes to test the use of CCTA-derived FAI measurements in a group of&#xD;
      patients with coronary artery inflammation, who will receive routinely-used statin and&#xD;
      aspirin treatment. The P-VECT Study is a pilot study that will provide the rationale and data&#xD;
      for power calculations to enable design of pivotal trials of the clinical effectiveness of&#xD;
      FAI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this research we will study the ability of coronary CT angiography (CCTA)- derived Fat&#xD;
      Attenuation Index (FAI) measurements to detect changes in coronary artery inflammation&#xD;
      following treatment with atorvastatin and aspirin . CT scan images are used to evaluate the&#xD;
      presence of atherosclerotic plaque in the wall of the coronary arteries. The new CCTA&#xD;
      technique, FAI, detects and quantifies coronary artery inflammation by analysis of the&#xD;
      characteristics of the adipose tissue (fat) around the wall of the artery - the peri-vascular&#xD;
      adipose tissue (PVAT) This is a pilot study, involving patients undergoing a clinically&#xD;
      indicated CCTA as part of their routine clinical care who are shown (on their scans) to have&#xD;
      mild coronary artery plaques (&lt;50% luminal stenosis) with a high FAI value (&gt;70.1 HU).&#xD;
      Patients will have 6 visits (one of which screening) with hospital attendance on 3 occasions&#xD;
      for blood tests and drug supply. The pilot study will provide the rationale for power&#xD;
      calculations from which further studies can be developed to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness of FAI.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants must satisfy the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or Female, aged 30 to 80 years,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. CCTA scan showing mild coronary artery plaques (&lt;50% luminal stenosis) with a high FAI&#xD;
             value (&gt;70.1 HU) within last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No definite clinical indication for statin treatment (i.e. do not have either&#xD;
             cholesterol &gt;6.5 mM, or cholesterol &gt;5.0 mM and QRISK score &gt;10%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clinical equipoise for statin and aspirin treatment, as determined by the local&#xD;
             treating physician. In these patients, there is clinical equipoise because routine&#xD;
             treatment with aspirin and statin is not mandated by current guidelines, but the&#xD;
             presence of minor coronary artery plaques is frequently interpreted by clinicians as&#xD;
             an indication for aspirin and statin treatment. Accordingly, some patients in this&#xD;
             group typically receive aspirin and statin treatment, whereas others do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willing and able (in the Investigators opinion) to comply with all study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing to allow his or her General Practitioner and consultant, if appropriate, to be&#xD;
             notified of any incidental findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Able to understand both verbal or written English&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Known diabetes mellitus&#xD;

                  months)&#xD;
&#xD;
              13. Any clinically significant abnormality identified at the time of screening that,&#xD;
                  in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude safe completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
              14. Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
                  Investigator, may either put the participants at risk because of participation in&#xD;
                  the study, or may influence the result of the study, or the participant's ability&#xD;
                  to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
              15. Participants who have participated in another research study involving a&#xD;
                  treatment intervention or an investigational product, in the past 12 weeks.&#xD;
