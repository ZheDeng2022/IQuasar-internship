  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to train individuals with opioid use disorder to control their brain&#xD;
      activity in a way that has been associated with their symptoms. Participants in the&#xD;
      experimental group will be given direct feedback regarding their brain activity while they&#xD;
      are undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning, and will try to learn&#xD;
      to control their brain activity during these feedback sessions. A separate group of&#xD;
      participants will be given a control form of feedback that we do not believe can have&#xD;
      clinical benefits. Our primary hypothesis is that the neurofeedback training will reduce&#xD;
      opioid use and clinical features of opioid use disorder more than the control feedback.&#xD;

    <measure>Opioid use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to one month post follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Opioid use will be monitored by weekly urine test and the timeline followback method (TLFB). TLFB asks subjects to estimate drug use during a specific time period in the past.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>2. Functional connectivity patterns in the brain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through follow-up (4 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid Craving</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to one month post follow-up (up to 2 months).</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured with the Opioid Craving Scale, a 3-item measure of craving that uses a 0-10 analog scale. Total possible score is 30, with higher score indicating more craving.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Negative affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to one month post follow-up (up to 2 months).</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. This is a 16-item measure, using a 0-3 scale for each item. Total possible score is 48, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity.</description>
