      The study objective is to estimate a maintaining daily dose of Jarlsberg cheese in healthy&#xD;
      pre-menopausal women obtaining an increase in the osteocalcin level of at least 10% after 6&#xD;
      weeks on maximum efficacy dose (MED) of Jarlsberg cheese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4: Population and sampling The study population consists of Healthy Voluntary (HV) women&#xD;
      between 20 years and pre-menopausal age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed as a one-dimensional, within-patient, 3-level Response Surface&#xD;
      Pathway (RSP) designed trial with individually adjustment of the dose. Each design period&#xD;
      will be 3 weeks. Only HVs obtaining an increase in the osteocalcin level ≥ 10% from baseline&#xD;
      after 6 weeks on the MED of 57g Jarlsberg cheese daily will be offered to participate in this&#xD;
      de-escalation study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recruited HV women fulfilled the inclusion without the exclusion criteria for the study&#xD;
      will undergo a screening clinical investigation. The participants will be asked to avoid use&#xD;
      of other cheese than the one allocated to in the study, but eat as usual. One week later, the&#xD;
      first clinical investigation in the study will take place including blood sampling and&#xD;
      measurement of visual signs. The HV women verified to fulfil the criteria for participation&#xD;
      and signed the informed consent form will be included in the study. During this first&#xD;
      clinical investigation in the study denoted as Day 0, the participants receive a study&#xD;
      identification number. The daily intake of cheese will be 57g/day . The trial cheese can be&#xD;
      consumed with other food at breakfast, lunch or other meals during the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants meet for new clinical investigations every third week with measurement of&#xD;
      visual signs and blood sampling. The first 12 HVs finalized 6 weeks with daily intake of 57 g&#xD;
      Jarlsberg cheese obtaining an increase in the osteocalcin level from baseline ≥10% will be&#xD;
      offered participation in this de-escalation study. The results of the osteocalcin analysis&#xD;
      after 6 weeks will be ready within one week and the HVs continue on unchanged cheese dose.&#xD;
      The HVs participating in this de-escalation study will be included in this part after 7&#xD;
      weeks. The remaining HVs will continue the Jarlsberg cheese intake as prescribed in protocol&#xD;
      HV-Jarlsberg/III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The de-escalation study consists of three design level each of three weeks duration. The&#xD;
      analysis of the osteocalcin level taken after three weeks will be ready within one week&#xD;
      later. This measurement will be the background for change in the dose for the next design&#xD;
      level. During this first week after the three-week period, the HVs will continue on the same&#xD;
      cheese dose until the results from the osteocalcin analysis is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HVs included in this de-escalation study will receive a reduced daily dose of Jarlsberg&#xD;
      cheese for three weeks in the first design level. The reduction in the daily Jarlsberg cheese&#xD;
      dose will be individually calculated. Assume a given HV obtained X % increase in the&#xD;
      osteocalcin level during the previous six weeks with a daily dose of 57g. The reduction in&#xD;
      the daily Jarlsberg cheese dose for the first design level will be x% [(57*X)/100]. If the&#xD;
      osteocalcin level reduces &gt; 10% from the 6-weeks level after 3 weeks on the reduced dose, the&#xD;
      dose will be increased for this HV on the second design level. In case the obtained change in&#xD;
      the osteocalcin level is ± 10%, the dose will be unchanged. If the osteocalcin level&#xD;
      increases &gt; 10 % from the 6-week level, the cheese dose will be reduced for this HV in the&#xD;
      second design level. The size of the dose increase or decrease from the first to the second&#xD;
      design level depending on the change in the osteocalcin level from the 6-week level and&#xD;
      calculated in accordance with the RSP procedure. The change in the osteocalcin level during&#xD;
      the second design level will be the basis for calculation of the dose to be used in the third&#xD;
      design level. The same procedure as described for the dose-change from the first to the&#xD;
      second design level will be used. Clinical investigation and blood sampling will be performed&#xD;
      every third week. Osteocalcin and vitamin K will be analysed every third week whereas the&#xD;
      haematological and biochemical analysis will be performed at baseline and after 6 and 18&#xD;
      weeks of cheese intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main variable in this study will be osteocalcin measured in serum blood and percent&#xD;
      increase in osteocalcin from baseline. Additionally, carboxylated and under carboxylated&#xD;
      Osteocalcin and the ratio OR = [Carboxylated / Under Carboxylated] osteocalcin in serum will&#xD;
      be central together with the K2 variants MK-7, 8, 9, 9(4H) and vitamin K1. Triglyceride, LDL-&#xD;
      and HDL cholesterol, vitamin D and vital signs will be secondary variables. As safety&#xD;
      variables, haematological- and biochemical variables and adverse events (AE) will be recorded&#xD;
      at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with the development of the RSP-procedure, 12 HVs will be included in the study&#xD;
      and participate in all the three design levels.&#xD;
