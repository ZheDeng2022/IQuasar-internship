  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will include up to 25 patients with cancer experiencing chemotherapy-induced&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy. Patients enrolled in the study will participate in a 10-week QiGong&#xD;
      for Chemotherapy-Induced Neuropathy program. Patients will be evaluated before and after&#xD;
      their program participation. Within 2 weeks before the program start date, patients will be&#xD;
      administered an objective neuropathy assessment by a physician or nurse, and will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires assessing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, perceived cognitive&#xD;
      functioning, quality of life, and cancer-related symptoms. Patients will repeat these&#xD;
      assessments at the end of the last QiGong class and will be asked to provide feedback on the&#xD;
      QiGong program as a whole. Self-report questionnaires will also be repeated one week after&#xD;
      the last class.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of subject participation will be 11-13 weeks. Total duration of the study is&#xD;
      expected to be approximately 9 months.&#xD;
