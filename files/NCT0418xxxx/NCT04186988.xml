    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well [18F]-AraG works in detecting T-cell activation in patients with&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced), who are&#xD;
      undergoing PD-1/PD-L1-directed therapy. [18F]-AraG is a &quot;radiotracer&quot; which attaches to&#xD;
      immune cells directed at the cancer and shines a light that can be seen using a special&#xD;
      camera, called a &quot;positron emission tomography&quot; or &quot;PET&quot; scanner. [18F]-AraG may improve the&#xD;
      ability to detect a response of the cancer in the body to immunotherapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To quantify fluorine F 18 Ara-G ([18F]-AraG) uptake (standardized uptake value [SUV]) in&#xD;
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumor (primary, nodal, and metastatic sites) at&#xD;
      baseline and after 1 dose of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in both patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
      monotherapy and in patients treated with immunotherapy/chemotherapy combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate change in [18F]-AraG uptake before and after the start of therapy with&#xD;
      radiographic response in patients treated with immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive [18F]-AraG intravenously (IV) and then undergo PET/CT over 2 hours at&#xD;
      baseline and within 2 weeks after starting immunotherapy. Patients may also undergo blood&#xD;
      sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 12 months.&#xD;

    <description>The positron emission tomography (PET) images will be interpreted qualitatively and semi-quantitatively on a lesion-by-lesion basis. Semi-quantitative analysis will be employed as follows: (a) Regions of interest (ROIs) will be placed around tracer avid foci suspicious for malignancy in order to obtain standardized uptake value (SUV) parameters, including maximum SUV (SUVmax), SUVpeak, SUVmean; (b) SUV data will be recorded along with volumetric and positional information in a standardized form.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in SUV</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to within 2 weeks after starting immunotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>All SUV measurements will be summarized descriptively, separately for baseline and follow-up. Descriptive statistics for the SUVs will be done on a subject basis and a per lesion basis. Graphical summaries including box plots will be prepared to illustrate distributions and detect outliers or other findings; numerical summaries will include, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, and range as appropriate. For each target lesion, the scan 1 and scan 2 SUV will be determined and compared. A mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to estimate the mean change in SUV from scan 1 to scan 2, allowing for possible need to account for between-patient random variation both in baseline level of SUV and amount of change. The primary result will be an estimate of the mean change in SUV, with a 95% confidence interval, along with the between patient and within-patient, between-lesion variation.</description>
