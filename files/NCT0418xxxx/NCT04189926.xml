  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leading health organizations have identified prevention of obesity in young children as a&#xD;
      critical public health challenge. Low levels of physical activity and high levels of&#xD;
      sedentary behavior may contribute to the development of excessive fatness in young children,&#xD;
      but these relationships have not been fully explored, and accelerometry rarely has been used&#xD;
      to measure physical activity levels in infants and toddlers. No previous study has used&#xD;
      accelerometry as an objective measure of physical activity in young children as they develop&#xD;
      from infancy to preschool age. Accordingly, little is known about the factors associated with&#xD;
      the development of physical activity behavior in very young children, and little is known&#xD;
      about the influence of physical activity and sedentary behavior, measured objectively, on&#xD;
      development of weight status during the transition from infancy to age 3. The first aim of&#xD;
      this study is to describe physical activity and sedentary behavior in young children as they&#xD;
      develop from infancy to preschool age. The second aim is to describe the longitudinal&#xD;
      associations of weight status with physical activity and sedentary behavior as young children&#xD;
      develop from infancy to preschool age. The proposed investigation will employ a longitudinal,&#xD;
      observational study design. Participants will be 160 children and their biological mothers&#xD;
      living in Columbia, South Carolina. For each participating child, measurements will be taken&#xD;
      at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months of age. At each time point, each child's physical&#xD;
      activity, sedentary behavior, weight status and motor developmental status will be measured&#xD;
      objectively, and each child's mother will complete a survey to assess demographic, social and&#xD;
      physical environmental factors; gross motor milestones; parenting practices related to&#xD;
      physical activity and sedentary behavior; and dietary practices. Childcare center directors&#xD;
      will complete a survey annually to assess center characteristics, and the Environment and&#xD;
      Policy Assessment and Observation (EPAO) will be administered in the child's classroom&#xD;
      annually.&#xD;

      Subjects and Settings. The proposed research will be conducted in Columbia/Richland County,&#xD;
      South Carolina (SC). Participants will be 160 children and their biological mothers. Children&#xD;
      of all races and ethnic backgrounds will be included. Our recruitment procedures will be&#xD;
      designed to produce a sample with the following approximate race/ethnicity distribution: 38%&#xD;
      non-Hispanic African American, 38% non-Hispanic White, 20% Hispanic, and 4% other. Further,&#xD;
      we anticipate that approximately two-thirds of the participating children be attending formal&#xD;
      childcare centers and one-third will be at home or staying with a family member. Equal&#xD;
      percentages of female and male children will be included. Children will be excluded from the&#xD;
      study if they were born before 37 weeks gestation or have a physical limitation that would&#xD;
      invalidate accelerometry as a measure of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of Participants. Participants in the study will be 160 mother-child dyads who&#xD;
      will be recruited into the study when the children are between 3 and 6 months of age. They&#xD;
      will be residents of Richland County, South Carolina. Recruitment will take place across a&#xD;
      9-month period and will be designed to recruit two cohorts of 80 children each. Baseline data&#xD;
      collection will occur when each child is within one month of being 6 months of age. The&#xD;
      recruitment process will be coordinated by Richland County First Steps (RCFS), a non-profit&#xD;
      organization founded in 1999 to support provision of quality early childhood education for&#xD;
      children ages 0 to 5 in Richland County.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-third of participants will be mother-child dyads from families in which the child does&#xD;
      not attend a formal childcare center. Richland County First Steps, in addition to its work&#xD;
      with childcare centers, delivers programs directly to families of young children, including&#xD;
      Latino families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort Maintenance. Participating mothers and children will be retained in the study across a&#xD;
      30-month period of observation by maintaining excellent communication with the parents and,&#xD;
      for children attending formal childcare centers, the directors and staff of the childcare&#xD;
      centers they attend. The process of maintaining excellent relationships with parents and&#xD;
      center staff will be coordinated by RCFS and managed collaboratively with the&#xD;
      University-based study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior. Total day physical activity and sedentary behavior&#xD;
      will be measured objectively using an ActiGraph accelerometer (GT3X-BT model, Pensacola, FL).&#xD;
      Accelerometers will be initialized prior to data collection and will be set to begin&#xD;
      collecting data at midnight of the day of distribution. Children will be fitted with the&#xD;
      accelerometer during a data collection visit with the parent and child at his/her childcare&#xD;
      center, home or other appropriate location. Based on preliminary work, we anticipate creating&#xD;
      two variables to define physical activity. The first variable will be based on counts per&#xD;
      minute averaged across 7 days of wear. This expression of the data will be applicable to the&#xD;
      full age range since intensity cutpoints have not been established for non-ambulatory&#xD;
      children. The second expression will use age-specific cutpoints to determine minutes per hour&#xD;
      of total physical activity and sedentary behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Behavior. We will examine how diet, physical activity and sedentary behavior interact&#xD;
      in influencing developmental trajectories for weight status in children transitioning from&#xD;
      infancy to early childhood. Five instruments will be used in assessing children's dietary&#xD;
      behavior. At baseline data collection (child age = 6 months) the mother will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the Baby Eating Behavior Questionnaire 80, which will provide information on the&#xD;
      child's appetite during the first three months of life, and the ECLS-B Parent Questionnaire&#xD;
      (9-month version),81 which will provide information on the child's current and previous&#xD;
      feeding behavior, including breast-feeding history. At subsequent data collection points&#xD;
      (child age = 12 to 36 months) the mother will complete the ECLS-B Parent Questionnaire&#xD;
      (24-month version), which will provide information on specific dietary behaviors, and the&#xD;
      Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) Dietary Intake survey, which will provide&#xD;
      information on foods consumed by the child on the previous day. In addition, at the 18-month&#xD;
      and 36-month data collection points, mothers will complete the Dietary Food Frequency&#xD;
      Self-Administered Questionnaire as developed for use in the National Children's Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep characteristics. Sleep behavior will be assessed via actigraphy in children whose&#xD;
      parents consent to participation in this component of the protocol. Due to the substantial&#xD;
      participant burden, participation in this procedure will be optional. All parents&#xD;
      participating in the overall study will be invited to take part, and those who consent will&#xD;
      receive an additional incentive. Participating children will wear an actigraph&#xD;
      (MicroMini-Motionlogger, Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc.) 24 hours per day for seven days, except&#xD;
      during bathing or other water activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight Status. At each timepoint, data collectors will measure weight and length/height using&#xD;
      standard protocols. Age- and sex-specific weight-for-length percentiles and Z-scores will be&#xD;
      calculated from weight and length according to the World Health Organization (WHO) growth&#xD;
      charts. For children 24 months of age and older, the age- and sex-specific body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) percentiles and Z-scores will be calculated according to the CDC growth charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic Characteristics. At the first measurement point, each child's biological mother&#xD;
      will report her child's date of birth, gender, race/ethnicity, birth weight, length at birth,&#xD;
      and gestational age. The mother will report her own age, race/ethnicity, marital status, and&#xD;
      highest level of education achieved, which will be used as an indicator of socioeconomic&#xD;
      status. The mother will also report information related to her pregnancy with the&#xD;
      participating child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social Environmental Factors. At each measurement point, each child's mother will report her&#xD;
      employment status, physical activity behavior, and screen media use. Mothers will report the&#xD;
      number of other children living in the child's home and the age and gender of the children.&#xD;
      Mothers will also report whether there is another adult that lives with the child. Mothers&#xD;
      will also report the amount of time they spend playing with their child and the amount of&#xD;
      time the child spends playing with children of a similar age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Environmental Factors. Each child's mother will report her child's sleep habits,&#xD;
      outdoor play, television and screen media use, time spent in confining equipment, and care&#xD;
      arrangements during weekdays. Mothers will also report physical activity equipment in the&#xD;
      home. This information will be collected at each of the six time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Childcare Center Characteristics. For children attending childcare, we will conduct&#xD;
      assessments of their center once per year. The goal will be to perform a comprehensive&#xD;
      evaluation of the center's policies and practices related to nutrition and physical activity.&#xD;
      Center directors will provide information about their center's characteristics and policies,&#xD;
      and teachers will complete a survey about classroom practices related to physical activity&#xD;
      and nutrition. The director survey will address global policies related to physical activity&#xD;
      and nutrition as well as institutional characteristics. The teacher survey will address&#xD;
      classroom practices, including physical activity, sedentary behavior, meals and snacks, and&#xD;
      teacher behavior and engagement, using the Go NAP SACC self-assessment instrument.91 In&#xD;
      addition, we will conduct observations of the childcare environment using the Environment and&#xD;
      Policy Assessment and Observations (EPAO).92 The EPAO is a standardized instrument that has&#xD;
      been used widely to assess physical activity and nutrition in childcare environments. The&#xD;
      EPAO is completed by a trained observer during a full-day visit to a childcare center, during&#xD;
      which a single classroom is observed. Scores on 8 nutrition and 8 physical activity subscales&#xD;
      will be calculated as well as a total physical activity and total nutrition score for each&#xD;
      center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor Developmental Status. Each child's biological mother will report the age (in months)&#xD;
      when her child first rolled over, sat unassisted, and began walking independently. In&#xD;
      addition, motor developmental status will be assessed using the Peabody Developmental Motor&#xD;
      Scales-2 (PDMS-2).94 Two trained data collectors will administer and score the PDMS-2; data&#xD;
      collection will take place at the participating child's childcare center or other appropriate&#xD;
      community location. The following gross movement subtests will be administered according to&#xD;
      standard age-specific protocols: reflexes, stationary performances, locomotion and object&#xD;
      manipulation. A Gross Motor Quotient will be calculated as the sum of the child's scores on&#xD;
      three subtests. For children less than 1 year of age the sub-tests will be Reflexes,&#xD;
      Stationary and Locomotion. For children ages 1 to 3 years the sub-tests will be Stationary,&#xD;
      Locomotion, and Object Manipulation. Performance is reported as both a raw score and as an&#xD;
      age-specific percentile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement Logistics. A total of 160 children, organized in two waves of 80 children each,&#xD;
      will be measured. For each participating child, there will be six measurement time points at&#xD;
      6-, 12-, 18-, 24-, 30-, and 36-months of age, with data collection occurring +/- 1 month of&#xD;
      the specified age. The same measurement protocol will be applied at each measurement time&#xD;
      point. Each child will be assessed during two visits at each measurement time point. The&#xD;
      first visit will include anthropometric measures, accelerometer distribution, and parent&#xD;
      survey administration, and the second visit will include the motor development assessment.&#xD;
      The first visit will take place at the child's home, at the childcare center or at another&#xD;
      appropriate community location. The motor development assessment will take place at the&#xD;
      childcare center or other appropriate community location. The motor development assessment&#xD;
      will occur within two weeks of the first visit, but not during the week of accelerometer&#xD;
      wear. All data collection procedures will be administered by trained and experienced research&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For children attending a childcare center, center directors will complete a survey annually&#xD;
      to assess center characteristics. The classroom teacher(s) of participating children will&#xD;
      complete a survey annually. The EPAO will be completed on each classroom serving a&#xD;
      participating child once per year, or as children change to new classrooms. The EPAO will be&#xD;
      completed by trained data collectors. The Measurement Coordinator will download data from the&#xD;
      accelerometers as the monitors are collected, and the data will be scanned by the data&#xD;
      collection staff on a weekly basis. Surveys, anthropometric forms, and observation forms will&#xD;
      be entered into secure databases on a weekly basis. This measurement logistics plan is&#xD;
      similar to the plan that has been used by this research team in two previous studies of&#xD;
      physical activity in preschool children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collected and entered will be reviewed weekly by the Measurement Coordinator for&#xD;
      quality control of data entry and completeness. Quality control and data completeness reports&#xD;
      will be generated monthly and discussed at project meetings. Reliability assessments of&#xD;
      anthropometry and motor development assessments will be conducted at least twice per year for&#xD;
      each data collector. Quality control visits will be conducted at least twice per year to&#xD;
      participating childcare centers for the purpose of observing data collectors.&#xD;
