    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of infectious diseases molecular-based stool testing compared&#xD;
      to conventional stool testing on reducing the need for contact precautions among hospitalized&#xD;
      patients. Half of patients' stools will be tested with the molecular assay , while the other&#xD;
      half will be tested with conventional testing.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute infectious gastroenteritis can be caused by viruses, bacteria or parasites, resulting&#xD;
      in a diarrheal illness that may be accompanied by fever, abdominal pain and/or cramping,&#xD;
      hematochezia, nausea, and vomiting. Up to 12.5% to 25% of the population develop a&#xD;
      gastrointestinal infection each year, with the majority of cases being self-limiting and&#xD;
      symptoms usually resolving within 14 days without treatment. While the vast majority of the&#xD;
      estimated 4 million Canadians who develop gastroenteritis have a mild and self-limited&#xD;
      illness, approximately 9 250 to 14 150 are hospitalized each year with 1.6% to 2.2% dying&#xD;
      from their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For hospitalized patients, the majority will have stool samples collected and tested using&#xD;
      standard microbiology methods that includes culture for bacteria, nucleic acid amplification&#xD;
      for viruses and bacteria and microscopy or enzyme immunoassays for parasites. The number of&#xD;
      pathogens that can be identified is limited in most microbiology laboratories, and the&#xD;
      turnaround time to reporting can take up to 3 days. Recently, new nucleic acid amplification&#xD;
      technologies have been developed that can test for multiple gastrointestinal pathogens in a&#xD;
      single run that usually takes less than a 1 day turnaround time to reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BioFire® FilmArray Gastrointestinal Panel (FGP) is a multiplex polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      test that can simultaneously test for 22 different viruses, bacteria and parasites with&#xD;
      excellent sensitivity and specificity with a turnaround time of 1 hour. Compared to&#xD;
      conventional testing methods, the FGP costs 40% more, or about $180 (CDN) per test. Despite&#xD;
      detecting more pathogens in a shorter period of time, a recent systematic review did not find&#xD;
      any evidence to support a positive impact on either improved patient outcomes or&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness compared to conventional testing. Since most gastrointestinal illness&#xD;
      episodes are mild and self-limiting, it may not be feasible to design a randomised trial to&#xD;
      demonstrate clinical efficacy of test-treatment given the majority of the 22 pathogens&#xD;
      detected by the FGP do not benefit from antimicrobial therapy. Instead, measuring other&#xD;
      outcomes like reduced utilization of hospital resources such as contact isolation days, could&#xD;
      provide evidence for both clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the available evidence on the cost-effectiveness of the FGP assay has been based&#xD;
      largely on observational studies, usually historically controlled before-after designs&#xD;
      associated with high risk of bias. The only study that was of sufficient quality to be&#xD;
      included in a systematic review of cost-effectiveness utilized a different PCR-based test.&#xD;
      Since the FGP assay has been shown to have very similar diagnostic characteristics in a&#xD;
      head-to-head comparison with this other PCR-based assay, the results will be used to inform&#xD;
      the primary outcome for this study. In the study by Goldenberg et al., differences in contact&#xD;
      isolation days between conventional (observed) and PCR-based testing (simulated) were&#xD;
      estimated and found to result in a reduction of 34.3% in contact isolation days in the&#xD;
      PCR-based group. Among the 800 patients, this amounted to a mean reduction of 0.94 contact&#xD;
      isolation days per patient. Unfortunately, confidence intervals were not estimated for this&#xD;
      point estimate. The cost of a single isolation day was reported as approximately £88 (UK) for&#xD;
      fiscal 2011/2012. A breakeven analysis demonstrated that a reduction of 252 contact isolation&#xD;
      days, a reduction of 11.4%, was needed to offset the increased costs associated with the&#xD;
      PCR-based assay. The cost of the PCR-based assay used in this study was 0.4 times the cost of&#xD;
      the FGP assay, suggesting that the number of contact isolation days needed to breakeven with&#xD;
      the FGP assay could be as high as 635. In a more recent conference report of a randomised&#xD;
      study in the United Kingdom using FGP, an interim analysis estimated a reduction in contact&#xD;
      isolation days by 0.9 days per patient (95% CI 0.4 to 1.6). There was no data provided for&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness. Given the extent of uncertainty around both the clinical effectiveness&#xD;
      and cost-effectiveness of the FGP assay, a randomised test-treat trial would be the best&#xD;
      option to resolve these uncertainties.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient in whom an appropriate stool sample has been collected and received by the&#xD;
             microbiology laboratory that is:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. accompanied by a physician request for microbiologic testing for viruses,&#xD;
                  bacteria and/or parasites, and is&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. appropriate for testing as determined by the microbiology laboratory standard&#xD;
                  (stool sample must have sufficient consistency to take shape of collection&#xD;
                  container), and&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. patient is admitted to hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Stool testing done between Monday 08:00 and Friday 14:00 a. The Infection&#xD;
                  Prevention and Control Practitioners (IPAC) are only available to review the&#xD;
                  stool test results between Monday 08:00 and Friday 17:00. Since IPAC is&#xD;
                  responsible for all decisions regarding contact isolation initiation and&#xD;
                  discontinuation, time delays from stool test reporting and decisions regarding&#xD;
                  contact isolation on the weekends or after 17:00 on weekdays would confound the&#xD;
                  primary outcome. As a result, FGP testing will only be available between Monday&#xD;
                  08:00 and Friday 14:00 during the study period since each FGP test requires&#xD;
                  approximately 1 hour to complete, and the laboratory can only run 1 test at a&#xD;
                  time. Outside these hours, only conventional testing will be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Immunocompromised patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Investigation of possible diarrheal outbreak by either public health officials or&#xD;
             infection prevention and control practitioners&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Nosocomial Clostridioides difficile infection defined as a positive polymerase chain&#xD;
             reaction test in any patient who meets any of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Has been hospitalized for ≥ 72 hours and then develops ≥ 3 loose bowel movements&#xD;
                  per day&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Develops ≥ 3 loose bowel movements per day regardless of length of hospital stay&#xD;
                  and has been hospitalized in the preceding 3 months for ≥ 48 hours&#xD;
