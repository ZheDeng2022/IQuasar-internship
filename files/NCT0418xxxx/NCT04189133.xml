      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall clinical question is whether LH supplementation to men in indication for FSH&#xD;
      according to the AIFA note 74, or with HH, will improve spermatogenesis and pregnancy rate&#xD;
      (spontaneous or after ART) over FSH alone or FSH+hCG. However, since LH has never been used&#xD;
      in men so far, the first, specific object of this study is the assessment of pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      and safety profile of LH in HH men. To this end, this study will evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics and safety profile of recombinant LH (Luveris) and compare the response to&#xD;
      Luveris and urinary hCG (Gonasi HP) in HH men. The pharmacodynamics will be assessed&#xD;
      primarily for testosterone levels in response to increasing doses of LH and the comparison of&#xD;
      the response to a fix dose of hCG, and later for more extend steroid profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicentre longitudinal, interventional, randomized, open-label, phase II, clinical trial,&#xD;
      assessing pharmacodynamics of LH in acquired HH men. The statistical hypothesis is&#xD;
      non-inferiority of the highest LH dose employed compared to a fix hCG dose. Primary endpoint:&#xD;
      serum testosterone levels evaluated by liquid-chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry&#xD;
      (LC-MS/MS). Secondary endpoints: Safety and tolerability as determined by AE reporting, vital&#xD;
      signs, and ECG, stereognosis (inhibin B, free testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin&#xD;
      (SHBG), estradiol, whole steroid profile provided by LC-MS/MS) and testicular volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: 32 men with acquired HH, including HH after neurosurgery for tumours or HH due to&#xD;
      pituitary adenoma-related mass effect. Patients will be randomized (1:1) according to a&#xD;
      permuted- blocks randomization list, to the study group, treated with Luveris (increasing&#xD;
      doses at two weekly intervals), or to the control group treated with Gonasi HP (2000 IU&#xD;
      twice/week). In the study group, increasing LH dosages will be administered to obtain a&#xD;
      testosterone dose-response curve, starting with the minimum expected efficient dose (75 IU/d,&#xD;
      sc) for two weeks followed by 150, 225 and 300 IU at two-weekly interval, respectively. The&#xD;
      control group will be treated by the standard approach, i.e. hCG 2000 IU IM twice-weekly for&#xD;
      8 weeks. Patients will be further followed up for 4 weeks after treatment withdrawal. During&#xD;
      the study, the patients will be evaluated two times per week during the treatment phase and&#xD;
      every two weeks in the follow-up phase.&#xD;

      Primary end point The pharmacodynamics of LH and the comparison of response to LH and hCG&#xD;
      will be assessed by measuring serum steroid levels by liquid-chromatography, tandem mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The primary end point is serum testosterone levels in response to&#xD;
      increasing doses of LH (pharmacodynamics) and the comparison of the response to a fix dose of&#xD;
      hCG. The statistical hypothesis is non-inferiority of the highest LH dose compared to the fix&#xD;
      hCG dose employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Full Safety profile (see below, the appropriate paragraph).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identification of the LH dosages needed to restore normal testosterone production in men&#xD;
           with acquired HH and of the relationship between LH administered and testosterone&#xD;
           increase, e.g. in terms of % serum testosterone increase per IU of r-hLH. This parameter&#xD;
           will be useful for future clinical studies based on LH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparison of steroid profiles, hormone related profiles and serum levels of testicular&#xD;
           steroids upon stimulation by LH or hCG by immunoassay and by LC-MS/MS technique when&#xD;
           available as validated method. The LC-MS/MS technique allows simultaneous detection and&#xD;
           quantification of several steroids. The investigators have previously studied serum&#xD;
           testicular steroid profiles in men with Klinefelter syndrome after acute hCG stimulation&#xD;
           and in diabetic men chronically treated by a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (Santi,&#xD;
           Granata et al. 2017). In in vitro systems, the investigators showed that LH and hCG&#xD;
           display biased signalling in Leydig cells, where LH is a partial agonist of the LHCGR on&#xD;
           progesterone production, while hCG is a full agonist. However, both hormones were&#xD;
           equivalent on testosterone production (Riccetti, Yvinec et al. 2017). This point is&#xD;
           clinically relevant because progesterone is a pro-inflammatory hormone (Zitzmann, Erren&#xD;
           et al. 2005). Should similarity of the two gonadotropins on testosterone production come&#xD;
           together with higher progesterone secretion in the case of hCG, this finding might&#xD;
           deserve further studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Testicular size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a multicentre, longitudinal, interventional, randomized, open-label,&#xD;
      phase I/II, clinical trial. According to the study questions, the study is designed to&#xD;
      characterise the LH pharmacodynamics in men, compared to the standard approach, represented&#xD;
      by hCG administration and to evaluate rLH safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The centre at the PI site (Unit 1 - Modena) will coordinate the study and will prepare the&#xD;
      randomization list by permuted blocks, which will be sent to each enrolling centre. Moreover,&#xD;
      Unit 1 will perform centralized hormone measurements at the end of the study, will coordinate&#xD;
      monitoring of centres, will maintain the study database and will analyse the data collected.&#xD;
      Finally, pharmacy at Unit 1 will receive IMP and will buy the drug comparator, will package&#xD;
      and distribute drugs needed for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria at each Centre.&#xD;
      During the screening visit, the following evaluations will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations at the participating centre:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total testosterone serum levels; Basal hormonal and biochemical assays needed to fulfil&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scrotal ultrasound for the evaluation of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      varicocele presence and degree; testicular volume and structure; epididymis. All other&#xD;
      imaging analyses needed to fulfil inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as suggested by&#xD;
      the guidelines for pituitary diseases (Raverot, Burman et al. 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central evaluations at Unit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total testosterone serum levels, using LC-MS/MS; Progesterone,17-hydroxyprogesterone,&#xD;
      androstenedione, didehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulphate (DHEAS), corticosterone,&#xD;
      11-deoxycortisol and cortisol using LC-MS/MS by a validated method (Fanelli, Belluomo et al.&#xD;
      2011); Other hormonal analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be enrolled in the study after signing the informed consent. Eligible&#xD;
      patients that are under androgen replacement therapy at the time of screening visit will be&#xD;
      enrolled after three months of testosterone withdrawal. On the contrary, eligible patients&#xD;
      who are not treated at the time of screening visit will be immediately enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 1 (V1), patients will be randomized according to the randomization list centrally&#xD;
      provided and will be allocated to the two following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group; Control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group will undergo two consecutive phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment phase;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Follow-up phase. The first phase will last two months and follow-up two months,&#xD;
           characterized by treatment withdrawal. Total study duration is three months. Patients&#xD;
           will be evaluated two times weekly, during the treatment phase and one time every two&#xD;
           weeks during the follow-up phase. The patient will be monitored for the safety at each&#xD;
           visit by the medical staff at PI and participating centres. The patient will remain&#xD;
           under supervision for four hours at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit two blood samples will be collected (Total of 18ml) in the morning after an&#xD;
      overnight fast. The first serum sample will be stored at -20°C and sent at the end of the&#xD;
      study to Unit 1 for central measurements. The second blood sample will be used locally to&#xD;
      monitor the treatment efficacy and safety. Overall, the study protocol includes a screening&#xD;
      visit followed by 18 visits. During the study protocol, pharmacovigilance will be performed&#xD;
      according to Italian rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit the following evaluations will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations at participating centre:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total testosterone serum levels Safety profile (as elaborated below) Basal hormonal and&#xD;
      biochemical assays Central evaluations at Unit 1:Total testosterone serum levels, using&#xD;
      LC-MS/MS Other sex steroids using LC-MS/MS Other hormonal analyses Biochemical evaluations&#xD;
      performed at each centre will be useful to monitor the treatment efficacy and safety, whereas&#xD;
      centrally performed analyses will be used for the final statistical analysis. Moreover, at&#xD;
      the end of treatment phase (V16) and at the end of follow-up phase, scrotal ultrasound will&#xD;
      be repeated to address possible morphological changes related to endogenous testosterone&#xD;
      increase. Finally, at each visit, the occurrence of AESI will be properly registered and&#xD;
      reported. Pharmacovigilance will be carefully considered and evaluated by CRO. During each&#xD;
      visit, testosterone levels were performed locally and evaluated by clinicians. Whether&#xD;
      testosterone serum levels will reach levels higher than 12 nmol/L, the drug dosage will be&#xD;
      not increased in both groups. The hormonal results will be available in about 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The IMP is Luveris. The comparator is Gonasi HP. Luveris will be provided by&#xD;
      Merck. Gonasi HP, will be purchased (packages with vials of 250, 1000 and 2000 IU each) by&#xD;
      the coordinating centre. The entire amount of the IMP and comparator will be delivered to the&#xD;
      pharmacy of the coordinating centre (according to existing regulations) and distributed in&#xD;
      batches to the centres. At the coordinating centre, packages containing the number of&#xD;
      ampoules sufficient for the patients to be allocated to the study within the next 6 months&#xD;
      will be prepared and shipped to each centre. The pharmacy of the coordinating centre will be&#xD;
      responsible for IMP and comparator reception, labelling, packaging and sending to the centres&#xD;
      according to existing regulations. All medications to be used in this study will have been&#xD;
      manufactured, tested, and released according to current GMP guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator or authorized staff will have to document the receipt, dispensation, and&#xD;
      return of all IMPs received during this study. Records on receipt, use, return, loss, or&#xD;
      other disposition of IMPs will be maintained. This process will be monitored by a CRO&#xD;
      (Clinical Research Organization) during the study. The IMP shipment will be provided in two&#xD;
      times during the study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All remaining IMPs, used and unused, shall be collected and returned for destruction at the&#xD;
      end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Luveris will be self-administered once daily by the patient sc in the abdominal skin.&#xD;
      Patients will be properly trained on how to perform injection and reconstitute the product.&#xD;
      Since the sc route is generally preferred by patients, this route is selected for this trial&#xD;
      in order to increase treatment compliance. Luveris will be package in vial of 75IU and it&#xD;
      will be dissolved in a vial of solvent. When higher dosages of Luveris will be needed for the&#xD;
      protocol (150, 300 and 600), 2, 4 and 8 vials of Luveris will be respectively dissolved in a&#xD;
      single vial of solvent. In particular, when 300 IU should be used, 4 Luveris vials will be&#xD;
      dissolved in 2 vials of solvents. When 600 IU should be used, 8 Luveris vials will be&#xD;
      dissolved in 3 vials of solvents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gonasi HP will be injected im.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At V1 patients will be randomized into two different groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group Control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group will receive the daily administration sc of Luveris with increasing dosages&#xD;
      every two weeks (Treatment phase) as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rec-LH 75 IU daily for 2 weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rec-LH 150 IU daily for 2 weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rec-LH 300 IU daily for 2 weeks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Rec-LH 600 IU daily for 2 weeks. The decision to proceed to the next dose level of LH&#xD;
           will be made by the Study Team [and the investigator] based on safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
           preliminary data obtained in at least 5 participants at the prior dose level. If&#xD;
           moderate or severe AE are consistently observed across participants in a cohort or if&#xD;
           unacceptable pharmacological effects, reasonably attributable to LH in the opinion of&#xD;
           the investigator are observed in more than 15% of the participants in a cohort, then&#xD;
           dose escalation will be temporarily halted and no further participants will be dosed&#xD;
           until a full safety review of the study has taken place. Relevant reporting and&#xD;
           discussion with the Medical Monitor, PI, and the IRB/IEC will take place before&#xD;
           resumption of dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two months of treatment will be followed by one month of treatment wash-out (follow-up&#xD;
      phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive the administration im of Gonasi HP as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      hCG 500 IU two times weekly, for 2 weeks; hCG 1000 IU two times weekly, for 2 weeks; hCG 1500&#xD;
      IU two times weekly, for 2 weeks; hCG 2000 IU two times weekly, for 2 weeks. Hypopituitary&#xD;
      patients participating to the study will continue to receive their standard substitution&#xD;
      therapy inasmuch needed (thyroxine, hydrocortisone). During the study duration, androgen&#xD;
      replacement therapies will be not permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Luveris is provided in vials containing 75 IU of lyophilized material + ampoules of solvent.&#xD;
      Patients in the study group will be instructed to use one vial/d during the first two weeks&#xD;
      of treatment, then two in the second two weeks, four in the third two weeks and eight in the&#xD;
      last two weeks of the treatment phase. Up to 3 vials of lyophilized Luveris can be dissolved&#xD;
      using only one vial of solvent, whereas 4 Luveris vials will be dissolved in 2 solvents.&#xD;
      Eight Luveris vials will be dissolved in 3 solvents. This will reduce discomfort for the&#xD;
      patient. Both IMP and comparator can be either self-administered by the patient or by a third&#xD;
      person, as described in the drug instructions. At each visit empty vials will be collected by&#xD;
      each centre, to ensure patients' compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up for further 8 weeks after drug withdrawal according to the&#xD;
      study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both LH and hCG are not known to interfere with other medications, so that no specific drug,&#xD;
      including rescue medications, is not allowed during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance will be monitored by asking the patients to return the empty Luveris and Gonasi HP&#xD;
      ampoules and packages at the next visit. In addition, LH/hCG and total testosterone serum&#xD;
      levels will be measured at each visit before the next LH/hCG injection at each participating&#xD;
      centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a prospective, interventional design. Thus, consecutive patients attending the&#xD;
      participating Units will be enrolled according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The aim&#xD;
      of the study is the evaluation of LH pharmacodynamics in HH men, in terms of testosterone&#xD;
      serum levels increase and to evaluate rLH safety profile. Considering the only one case&#xD;
      available in the literature, in which LH and hCG were compared in a HH man, the hypothesis is&#xD;
      a non-inferiority between IMP (at least at the highest dose) and comparator. Thus, the study&#xD;
      design includes the randomization of eligible patients in study and control groups, treated&#xD;
      with Luveris and Gonasi HP, respectively. Patients' allocation will follow the random&#xD;
      sequence generated at Unit 1 before the start of the study. The list will be generated using&#xD;
      permuted blocks, considering at maximum 10 patients for each Unit. The randomization list&#xD;
      will be sent to each Unit before study start. Moreover, being a pharmacodynamics, phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial, a placebo-group is not foreseen. The study, however includes a group&#xD;
      receiving the &quot;standard&quot; comparator, in order to reveal possible qualitative differences&#xD;
      (e.g. serum steroid profile) in the biological response in the male. Considering the&#xD;
      different frequency and route of drug administration in the two groups, a double-blind design&#xD;
      is not possible. Indeed, the study is open-label, since each patient is aware of the LH or&#xD;
      hCG dosage to be used. Similarly, clinicians involved in the study will be not blinded to&#xD;
      allocation. The following study personnel will be kept blinded to the treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central lab in which LC-MS/MS assays will be performed; The clinician involved in scrotal&#xD;
      ultrasound evaluations; The statistician who finally will perform the statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are practical and scientific reason for the choice of the drug and the methodology&#xD;
      proposed. Concerning r-hLH, Luveris is the only LH approved for human use. The dosage was&#xD;
      chosen according to the literature evidences of the different actions of LH and hCG at&#xD;
      molecular level and in vivo in women (Santi, Casarini et al. 2017). The dosage and the&#xD;
      frequency of administration were chosen according to the only previous experience existing&#xD;
      and considering the half-life of LH. Daily injections are appropriate because clinical&#xD;
      practice in women undergoing ART or with HH demonstrates the efficacy of LH daily protocols.&#xD;
      In The investigators previous experience, LH was administered as single daily bolus, reaching&#xD;
      a significant testosterone increase. The investigators considered that physiological LH&#xD;
      secretion is pulsatile. Veldhuis et al., compared constant to pulsatile infusion of r-hLH in&#xD;
      19 healthy men previously treated with GnRH antagonist. These two LH administration patterns&#xD;
      reached a similar testosterone increase, suggesting that pulsatile LH administration is not&#xD;
      necessary to stimulate Leydig cells activity. Moreover, in this clinical trial, a daily LH&#xD;
      dosage of 112.5 IU resulted in maximum testosterone levels of 485+114 ng/dl, in the&#xD;
      physiological range. Similarly, in the investigators case report, the HH man was treated with&#xD;
      75 IU of daily LH, restoring eugonadism. Thus, much lower LH dosages than expected seem to be&#xD;
      sufficient to increase testosterone serum levels into the normal range. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators will test different LH dosages, starting from the expected minimum efficient&#xD;
      dosage (75 IU), to the maximum dosage (600 IU) expected to obtain testosterone serum levels&#xD;
      in the upper half of normal ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparator (Gonasi HP) type and dosage was chosen according to the literature, the&#xD;
      rationale provided above, according to the current standard of treatment, and the fact that&#xD;
      it is the only hCG preparation approved for use in male HH available in Italy at the moment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be gathered with the following modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At the participating Units:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. patient's clinical information including safety and tolerability as determined by&#xD;
                AE, SAE reporting, vital signs, ECG, Concomitant medication, laboratory parameters&#xD;
                should be included in each panel (e.g., for haematology, chemistry, urinalysis) and&#xD;
                evaluation of anti-Human-LH Antibodies formation in the serum,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. basal hormonal assessment,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. collection and storage of 2 serum samples (18 ml) at -20°,&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. packaging and shipment of the samples to the centralized laboratory site. Each Unit&#xD;
                will receive from the Unit 1 a detailed investigator manual and a study kit&#xD;
                containing tubes, labels and boxes for sample storage and shipment. All modalities&#xD;
                of data collection will be explained in an investigator meeting before starting the&#xD;
                study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each participating Unit will follow and treat patients during the entire duration of the&#xD;
           trial according to the study design and patients' allocation. All Units possess an&#xD;
           institutional accreditation and have a quality management in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At Unit 1 (Coordinating centre):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. patient's clinical information including safety and tolerability as determined by&#xD;
                AE, SAE reporting, vital signs, ECG, Concomitant medication, laboratory parameters&#xD;
                should be included in each panel (e.g., for haematology, chemistry, urinalysis) and&#xD;
                evaluation of anti-Human-LH Antibodies formation in the serum,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. basal hormonal assessment,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. collection and storage of 2 serum samples (18 ml) at -20°,&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. At the end of the study the centre will receive all stored serum samples from the&#xD;
                Units and provide centralized hormone analysis through LC-MS/MS. In addition, all&#xD;
                other parameters indicated in the section &quot;outcomes&quot; will be measured in the&#xD;
                hormone laboratory using validated techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. keep the overall database;&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. perform data analysis. All clinical and hormonal data will be recorded in&#xD;
                appropriate electronic case report forms (eCRFs) provided by an experienced CRO.&#xD;
                These data, together with hormonal parameters assessed centrally and eCRFs data&#xD;
                will represent the dataset for the final analysis. The quality of the data will be&#xD;
                checked by monitoring (site visits) by an independent party, the selected CRO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up of the patients will last 2 months after drug withdrawal to check for return of the&#xD;
      values to baseline. The investigators planned a possible loss-to-follow-up of 10%.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Acquired HH forms&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HH after neurosurgery for tumors (i.e. pituitary adenoma, including prolactinoma,&#xD;
             craniopharyngioma, germinomas, meningiomas, gliomas, and astrocytomas). Infiltrative&#xD;
             disease (hemochromatosis, granulomatous disease, histiocytosis, and sarcoidosis), OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HH due to pituitary adenoma-related mass effect, in case of cured or controlled&#xD;
             hormone hypersecretion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total testosterone serum levels below the normal ranges (lower than 3 ng/mL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No androgen replacement therapies in the last three months before enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No hyper-secretion of other pituitary hormones&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        HH forms, such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Combined pituitary hormone deficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Genetic syndromes (e.g., Prader-Labhart-Willi, CHARGE, Lawrence-Moon- Bardet-Biedl)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Iatrogenic HH forms, such as traumatic pituitary stalk interruption syndrome,&#xD;
             irradiation, high dose corticosteroids, and anabolic steroids&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Drug abuse and major systemic diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic severe liver disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant illnesses which could interfere with the study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active malignancy diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or possible androgen-dependent tumors for example male breast carcinoma or&#xD;
             prostatic carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac failure, hypertension, renal dysfunction, migraines, or epilepsy. (since&#xD;
             aggravation or recurrence may occasionally be induced as a result of increased&#xD;
             androgen production)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Haematocrit &lt;40% or &gt;54%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Congenital HH are excluded since these genetic forms of HH could be related to other&#xD;
             systemic or pituitary diseases, which could bias the selection of patients.&#xD;
