  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the impedance&#xD;
      spectroscopy device prototype in the detection of anal sphincter injuries in women in the&#xD;
      early postpartum period. The study is prospective. The study group comprises up to 56&#xD;
      patients; up to 16 weeks from a natural delivery. The planned participation of each patient&#xD;
      in the study is up to 4 weeks and two visits will take place at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining written consent, at the first visit (V1) each patient will undergo a physical&#xD;
      examination (both proctological and gynecological examination), blood samples for laboratory&#xD;
      tests and stool samples for calprotectin concentration assessment will be collected. The&#xD;
      presence of clinical symptoms of both gas and stool incontinence will be assessed during the&#xD;
      visit with the use of Wexner's scale. Then, the dates of two reference tests will be planned:&#xD;
      Trans-rectal USG and Recto-anal manometry which will be performed as part of the V1 visit&#xD;
      within a period not exceeding 27 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The V2 visit, which will also be the final visit, will include a reassessment of the&#xD;
      patient's general condition, recording the values of basic vital parameters, subjective and&#xD;
      physical examination, and then the doctor conducting the examination will finally determine&#xD;
      the extent of sphincter damage, present the patient with therapeutic options and decide on&#xD;
      the treatment or rehabilitation of sphincter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the visits, all adverse events will also be monitored, both those reported by patients&#xD;
      and those related to the examined diagnostic device.&#xD;
