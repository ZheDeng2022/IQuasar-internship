  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  The study is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, single blinded&#xD;
           clinical study consisting of 150 subjects from up to 20 centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subjects are randomized to receive 1 of 2 treatments, either with ActiGraft and&#xD;
           standard of care (SOC) or with SOC alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The target ulcers are evaluated weekly by the investigator. The subject is treated once&#xD;
           a week, to receive weekly applications of the ActiGraft + SOC or SOC until for up to 12&#xD;
           weeks or until the study ulcer has completely healed (i.e., 100% closure as assessed by&#xD;
           the Investigator and blinded assessor and confirmed 2 weeks later at the healing&#xD;
           confirmation visit (HCV). One additional visit per week is optional for both arms, for&#xD;
           the purpose of changing only (1) the secondary dressing in the ActiGraft arm or (2)&#xD;
           change the standard of care dressing in the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immediately after the study ulcer is confirmed as completely healed, subjects will enter&#xD;
           the 12-week Follow-up Phase. During the Follow-Up phase, subjects will be evaluated&#xD;
           twice during the first month and then monthly for two additional visits every 4 weeks&#xD;
           until the completion of the 12-week Follow-up Phase.&#xD;
