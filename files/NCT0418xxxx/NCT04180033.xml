  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Testicular cancer (TC) survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy have an increased&#xD;
      risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) (hazard ratio (HR) 3.9 for platinum-containing chemotherapy&#xD;
      versus no platinum-containing chemotherapy, 95% confidence interval 1.7-8.9). Colonoscopy&#xD;
      screening can reduce CRC incidence and mortality. Given this increased risk of CRC,&#xD;
      colonoscopy surveillance should be considered for TC survivors treated with platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic yield of advanced colorectal neoplasia&#xD;
      during colonoscopy surveillance in TC survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to determine cost-effectiveness and burden of colonoscopy.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the molecular profile of advanced neoplasia will be evaluated to create insight&#xD;
      into the carcinogenesis. The effectiveness of fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) will be&#xD;
      evaluated with colonoscopy as a reference. Finally, blood plasma platinum-levels will be&#xD;
      determined to examine a potential correlation with the outcome of the ccolonoscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Testicular cancer (TC) survivors have an increased risk of various second primary&#xD;
      malignancies. A recent cohort study showed that platinum-based chemotherapy was associated&#xD;
      with increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in a dose dependent manner (hazard ratio (HR)&#xD;
      3.9 for platinum-containing chemotherapy versus no platinum-containing chemotherapy, 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval 1.7-8.9). Colonoscopy screening can reduce CRC incidence and mortality.&#xD;
      Given this increased risk of CRC, colonoscopy surveillance should be considered for TC&#xD;
      survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. However, the diagnostic yield,&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness and burden of colonoscopy in TC survivors treated with platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy has never been assessed. Additionally, the molecular profile of advanced&#xD;
      neoplastic lesions and CRC in TC survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy has not&#xD;
      been established but can provide valuable insight into CRC carcinogenesis in this group of&#xD;
      patients. Also the effectiveness of fecal tests has not been evaluated among TC survivors&#xD;
      treated with platinum-based chemotherapy compared to that among population controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to assess the diagnostic yield of&#xD;
      colonoscopy surveillance in TC survivors treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are 1) to evaluate the molecular characteristics of colorectal&#xD;
      (advanced) neoplasia in TC patients in relation to the cumulative doses of/ level of plasma&#xD;
      cisplatin, in order to improve the understanding of CRC carcinogenesis following cisplatin&#xD;
      exposure, 2) to determine the association of platinum levels in plasma with cumulative&#xD;
      administered cisplatin doses as well as with presence of colorectal (advanced) neoplasia at&#xD;
      colonoscopy and to determine the platinum amount in the colorectal tissue derived during&#xD;
      primary colonoscopy screening, 3) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and burden of&#xD;
      colonoscopy. Our 4th secondary objective is to assess the effectiveness of a stool test for&#xD;
      CRC screening in TC survivors compared to standard colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A multicentre prospective cross-sectional screening study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: TC survivors will be derived from an established, well-defined multicentre&#xD;
      cohort. Inclusion criteria of this study are 1) participants should have been treated for TC&#xD;
      in a participating Dutch hospital before the age of 50 years, 2) treatment consisted of at&#xD;
      least three cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin) with or without additional&#xD;
      radiotherapy, 3) participants should be at least 8 years after start of treatment, with a&#xD;
      minimum age at first colonoscopy screening of 35 years, 4) the maximum age at participation&#xD;
      is 75 years, 5) detection and potential treatment of advanced colorectal neoplasia is&#xD;
      considered beneficial.&#xD;
