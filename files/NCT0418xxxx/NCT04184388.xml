    <measure>MoCA-K; Korean Version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Korean Version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment(MoCA-K) was measured in baseline and 12 week. The cognitive function evaluation using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment(MoCA-K) is a total of 8 items, and evaluates cognitive functions such as time / execution power, vocabulary, memory, attention, sentence, abstraction, delayed recall, and orientation.&#xD;
Time / execution power's total score is 5 points, vocabulary's total score is 3 points, attention's total score is 3 points, sentence's total score is 3 points, abstraction's total score is 2 points, delayed recall's total score is 5 points, orientation's total score is 6 points. It takes about 10 minutes to complete, and the total score is 30 points and total score make sum score. A score of 23 points or more is regarded as normal. If you have less than 6 years of education, add 1 point.</description>

    <measure>PSS; Perceived stress scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived stress scale(PSS) was measured in baseline and 12 week. It consists of 10 questions. Each question is evaluated from 0 (none) to 4 (very often), and 4 items (4, 5, 7, 8) are scored back and added to the remaining questions. The duration of the last month should be presented before implementation (if the duration is longer, the predictability is lowered).</description>

    <measure>BDI; Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Beck Depression Inventory(BDI) was measured in baseline and 12 week. It consists of 21 items including cognitive, emotional, synchronous, and physical symptoms of depression. The total score ranges from 0~63 points for each question. Beck Depression Inventory(BDI) score is 0 ~ 9 points non-depression, 10 ~ 15 is mild depression, 16 ~ 23 is moderate depression, and 24 ~ 63 is severe depression.</description>
