  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is a kind of hematological malignancy caused by the proliferation of&#xD;
      malignant clonal plasma cells. In recent years, the emergence of new therapeutic drugs such&#xD;
      as bortezomib and lenalidomide has significantly improved the therapeutic effect of mm.&#xD;
      However, due to the presence of myeloma stem cells, most patients will inevitably relapse and&#xD;
      die. With the development of biomedicine and immunology, immunotherapy with chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptor modified T cells has attracted great attention for its amazing efficacy. CAR-T cells&#xD;
      carry receptors that can specifically recognize myeloma associated antigens, and their&#xD;
      killing effect is not limited by MHC molecules. B-cell mature antigen is only expressed on&#xD;
      the surface of B cells in germinal center, malignant and normal plasma cells, not on other&#xD;
      normal human tissues and CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells. It is a relatively specific high&#xD;
      expression on the surface of myeloma cells, which is an ideal target for MM immunotherapy.&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of BCMA targeted T cell&#xD;
      infusion in the treatment of BCMA positive multiple myeloma.&#xD;
