  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators aim to develop and evaluate a culturally informed family motivational&#xD;
      engagement strategy (FAMES) and implementation toolkit for coordinated specialty care (CSC)&#xD;
      programs for first episode psychosis. First, 5 family member participants will be recruited&#xD;
      into a three-month trial of FAMES and implementation toolkit. The investigators will then&#xD;
      conduct a 16-month non-randomized, stepped-wedge trial with 50 family members from 5 CSC&#xD;
      programs in community-based mental health clinics.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FAMES involves three distinct and revolving components - early, continuous, and motivational&#xD;
      contact - that incorporate motivational techniques and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&#xD;
      of Mental Disorders 5TH Edition (DSM-5) Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a&#xD;
      brief provider-led FAmily Engagement Motivational Strategy (FAMES) and its accompanying&#xD;
      implementation toolkit. The investigators will also preliminary examine whether FAMES&#xD;
      improves family engagement and retention in treatment, and motivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 50 participants with a loved one enrolled in CSC program for FEP will be recruited&#xD;
      from five CSC programs in Washington State to take part in a non-randomized stepped-wedge&#xD;
      pilot trial. Each CSC program will represent a cluster and serve as its own control. A&#xD;
      two-month implementation transition period will occur at each CSC program and during which&#xD;
      providers will be introduced to the intervention using the implementation toolkits and&#xD;
      trained to conduct FAMES. A 12-month open cohort design will be utilized to recruit&#xD;
      approximately 50 family members during the study period.&#xD;
