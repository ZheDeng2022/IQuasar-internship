  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study of central nervous system (CNS) locoregional adoptive therapy with&#xD;
      autologous CD4+ and CD8+ T cells lentivirally transduced to express a B7H3-specific chimeric&#xD;
      antigen receptor (CAR) and EGFRt. CAR T cells are delivered via an indwelling catheter into&#xD;
      the tumor resection cavity or ventricular system in children and young adults with diffuse&#xD;
      intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), diffuse midline glioma (DMG), and recurrent or refractory&#xD;
      CNS tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A child or young adult meeting all eligibility criteria, including having a CNS catheter&#xD;
      placed into the tumor resection cavity or into their ventricular system, and meeting none of&#xD;
      the exclusion criteria, will have their T cells collected. The T cells will then be&#xD;
      bioengineered into a second-generation CAR T cell that targets B7H3-expressing tumor cells.&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned to one of 3 treatment arms based on location or type of their&#xD;
      tumor. Patients with supratentorial tumors will be assigned to Arm A, and will receive their&#xD;
      treatment into the tumor cavity. Patients with either infratentorial or&#xD;
      metastatic/leptomeningeal tumors will be assigned to Arm B, and will have their treatment&#xD;
      delivered into the ventricular system. The first 3 patients enrolled onto the study must be&#xD;
      at least 15 years of age and assigned to Arm A or Arm B. Patients with DIPG will be assigned&#xD;
      to Arm C and have their treatment delivered into the ventricular system. The patient's newly&#xD;
      engineered T cells will be administered via the indwelling catheter for two courses. In the&#xD;
      first course patients in Arms A and B will receive a weekly dose of CAR T cells for three&#xD;
      weeks, followed by a week off, an examination period, and then another course of weekly doses&#xD;
      for three weeks. Patients in Arm C will receive a dose of CAR T cells every other week for 3&#xD;
      weeks, followed by a week off, an examination period, and then dosing every other week for 3&#xD;
      weeks. Following the two courses, patients in all Arms will undergo a series of studies&#xD;
      including MRI to evaluate the effect of the CAR T cells and may have the opportunity to&#xD;
      continue receiving up to a total of six courses of CAR T cells if the patient has not had&#xD;
      adverse effects and if more of their T cells are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that an adequate amount of B7H3-specific CAR T cells can be manufactured to&#xD;
      complete two courses of treatment with 3 or 2 doses given on a weekly schedule followed by&#xD;
      one week off in each course. The other hypothesis is that B7H3-specific CAR T cells can&#xD;
      safely be administered through an indwelling CNS catheter or delivered directly into the&#xD;
      brain via indwelling catheter to allow the T cells to directly interact with the tumor cells&#xD;
      for each patient enrolled on the study. Secondary aims of the study will include evaluating&#xD;
      CAR T cell distribution with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the extent to which CAR T cells&#xD;
      egress or traffic into the peripheral circulation or blood stream, and, if tissues samples&#xD;
      from multiple timepoints are available, also evaluate disease response to B7-H3 CAR T cell&#xD;
      locoregional therapy.&#xD;
