    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIa, double blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo controlled multi&#xD;
      centre study to evaluate the effect of AZD8154 (administered via nebulizer daily [QD]) on&#xD;
      allergen-induced inflammation in subjects with mild allergic asthma challenged with an&#xD;
      inhaled allergen. Approximately 36 subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
      randomized (1:1) to receive either AZD8154 or placebo.&#xD;

      This is a Phase IIa, double blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo controlled multi&#xD;
      centre study which will include 36 subjects in total and 18 subjects in each treatment group&#xD;
      are needed for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD8154 or placebo is administered via nebulizer QD for 10 consecutive days. This study will&#xD;
