      Early identification of tissue injury from a rattlesnake bite is critical to prevent&#xD;
      complications and reduce health care costs. Given the limitations of clinical assessment,&#xD;
      there is a need to develop a more objective reproducible, anatomically detailed diagnostic&#xD;
      tool for to accurately assess tissue damage and assist with timely administration of&#xD;
      antivenom, if needed. Emergency physician performed point-of-care ultrasonography has been&#xD;
      shown to be beneficial in the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections.&#xD;
      The innovative use of bedside ultrasound technology can provide new information to&#xD;
      individualize antivenom treatment and to improve patient outcomes. The objectives of this&#xD;
      study is to compare clinical assessment and bedside ultrasound findings in the detection of&#xD;
      tissue injury in emergency department patients with rattle snakebite and determine if bedside&#xD;
      ultrasound can alter management (antivenom dosing) in emergency department patients with&#xD;
      rattle snakebite.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arizona has the highest per capita rate of rattlesnake envenomation (the process by which&#xD;
      venom is injected by the bite of a venomous animal) in the United States leading to millions&#xD;
      of dollars in health care costs. Local tissue destruction typically manifests in the first&#xD;
      few hours after snakebite and can progress over days or weeks leading to long-term&#xD;
      complications such as muscle, nerve, and circulatory damage. The cornerstone in the treatment&#xD;
      of rattlesnake envenomation is accurate estimation of progression of local tissue damage and&#xD;
      timely administration of antivenom to halt the progression of venom effects. The initial&#xD;
      decision to administer antivenom is based on clinical parameters such as edema, induration,&#xD;
      bullae and blisters. The need for repeat doses of antivenom is determined by serial clinical&#xD;
      assessments and laboratory parameters. However, no definitive clinical or laboratory&#xD;
      parameters currently exist. The current practice is limited by inter-observer variability in&#xD;
      the clinical assessment and the inability to accurately assess the extent of tissue injury.&#xD;
      In a significant number of cases, it is difficult to accurately track the progression of the&#xD;
      venom effects until they become more pronounced and severe. With the limitations of clinical&#xD;
      assessment, administration of antivenom is delayed potentially resulting in poor patient&#xD;
      outcomes. A further complicating factor is that not all rattlesnake bites result in&#xD;
      envenomation. A substantial number of bites by rattlesnakes can result in &quot;dry bite&quot; in which&#xD;
      snake venom is not transferred from snake to human and thus will not cause tissue&#xD;
      destruction.4 Because of limitations of clinical assessments, these patients receive&#xD;
      antivenom even though it is not necessary. This liberal and inappropriate use of antivenom is&#xD;
      not cost effective and can also affect patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early identification of tissue injury from a rattlesnake bite is critical to prevent&#xD;
      complications and reduce health care costs. Given the limitations of clinical assessment,&#xD;
      there is a need to develop a more objective reproducible, anatomically detailed diagnostic&#xD;
      tool for to accurately assess tissue damage and assist with timely administration of&#xD;
      antivenom, if needed. Emergency physician performed point-of-care ultrasonography has been&#xD;
      shown to be beneficial in the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections.&#xD;
      The innovative use of bedside ultrasound technology can provide new information to&#xD;
      individualize antivenom treatment and to improve patient outcomes. The quick, noninvasive&#xD;
      nature and repeatability of point-of-care ultrasonography makes it an ideal objective tool&#xD;
      for the assessment of emergency department (ED) patients with rattle snakebites. Ultrasound&#xD;
      technology can reveal subcutaneous edema, localized fluid collections, tissue necrosis, and&#xD;
      muscle contractions resulting from a rattlesnake bite.6 Point-of-care ultrasonography&#xD;
      performed by emergency physicians can detect the tissue injury that is not evident on&#xD;
      clinical assessment and accurately track the patterns of injury prior to their external&#xD;
      manifestations. This innovative approach can expedite treatment in patients with rattle snake&#xD;
      envenomation thereby preventing complications such as coagulopathy (a condition in which the&#xD;
      blood's ability to clot is impaired) and compartment syndrome (excessive pressure build up&#xD;
      inside an enclosed space in the body). Additionally ultrasound can eliminate the&#xD;
      inappropriate use of antivenom in patients with dry bite potentially reducing health care&#xD;
      costs and improving patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our preliminary experience and prior literature suggests that point-of-care ultrasound can&#xD;
      detect subcutaneous edema, help clinicians to make an accurate assessment of proximal&#xD;
      progression of local findings due to a snake bite and can expedite the consultation and&#xD;
      appropriate treatment in patients with snake bite.The objectives of this study is to compare&#xD;
      clinical assessment and bedside ultrasound findings in the detection of tissue injury in&#xD;
      emergency department patients with rattle snakebite and determine if bedside ultrasound can&#xD;
      alter management (antivenom dosing) in emergency department patients with rattle snakebite.&#xD;
