  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of futibatinib in patients&#xD;
      with FGFR aberrations in 3 distinct cohorts. Patients will be enrolled into one of 3 cohorts:&#xD;
      patients with advanced, metastatic or locally-advanced solid tumors harboring FGFR1-4&#xD;
      rearrangements (excluding primary brain tumors and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma [iCCA]);&#xD;
      patients with gastric or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) cancer harboring FGFR2&#xD;
      amplification; and patients with myeloid or lymphoid neoplasms with FGFR1 rearrangements.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      Study TAS-120-202 is an open-label, multinational, 3-arm Phase 2 study evaluating the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics of futibatinib in patients with FGFR&#xD;
      aberrations. Eligible patients will be assigned to 1 of 3 treatment cohorts based on&#xD;
      diagnosis and FGFR gene aberration status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive futibatinib at an oral dose of 20 mg once a day on a continuous 28-day&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A: 60 patients with locally advanced, advanced, or metastatic solid tumor&#xD;
           harboring FGFR rearrangements other than primary brain tumor or iCCA;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B: 35 patients with locally-advanced, advanced, or metastatic gastric cancer or&#xD;
           gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) with FGFR2 amplification;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort C: 20 patients with myeloid or lymphoid neoplasms (MLN) with FGFR1 rearrangements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment in all cohorts will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or&#xD;
      any other of the criteria for treatment discontinuation is met. For patients who discontinue&#xD;
      treatment for reasons other than disease progression, tumor assessments should be continued&#xD;
      until radiologic disease progression is documented or until initiation of subsequent new&#xD;
      anticancer therapy (whichever occurs first).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for survival every 12 weeks (±2 weeks) until survival events&#xD;
      (deaths) have been reported for 75% of enrolled patients or the study is terminated early by&#xD;
      the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional cohorts may be added in the future in case of new emerging efficacy data.&#xD;
