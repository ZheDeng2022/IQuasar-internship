      This is an open-label, single center, non-randomized, phase I trial to evaluate safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of using the combination treatment of SHR-1210 with Paclitaxel-albumin and&#xD;
      gemcitabine of metastatic PDAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 is a humanized monoclonal antibody, and the heavy chain is&#xD;
      immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4), the light chain is immunoglobulin κ (IgK). SHR-1210 specifically&#xD;
      binds to PD-1 and blocks the interaction of PD-1 with its ligand (PD-L1), allowing T cells to&#xD;
      recover against tumor immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of SHR-1210 will be assessed by ongoing reviews of clinical laboratory tests,&#xD;
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, physical examination,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG), and adverse events. Evaluations of immune safety will also be&#xD;
      conducted (immune-related adverse events (AEs), or labs of autoimmune sera, inflammatory&#xD;
      events, and immunogenicity). Safety evaluations (both clinical and laboratory) are performed&#xD;
      at baseline, before each study treatment, and throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor response will be assessed by radiographic examination in screening visit and every 2&#xD;
      cycles after first dose.&#xD;
