      -  Background: In emergency situations there are difficulties for treatment in that patient&#xD;
           health records are not immediately provided because patient information is separately&#xD;
           managed by each hospital. Another reason for the difficulty is that if the patients&#xD;
           don't know their personal health record, they can't inform medical staffs of it. In&#xD;
           addition, the increase of emergency situation of the chronically ill is also&#xD;
           problematic. And patients have a growing desire for their health information. In this&#xD;
           situation, the investigators developed the service showing patient health record&#xD;
           altogether which is managed by each hospital separately and recording the patient health&#xD;
           information based on mobile application.&#xD;
