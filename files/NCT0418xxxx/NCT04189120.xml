  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain after thoracotomy is known to be sever acute pain that is resulted from retraction,&#xD;
      resection or fracture of ribs .This pain increases post operative morbidity and if not&#xD;
      properly managed peri-operatively, chronic post thoracotomy pain syndrome may develop.&#xD;
      Different methods are described to manage post thoracotomy pain.Thoracic epidural analgesia&#xD;
      is believed to be the corner stone in the peri-operative care for thoracotomy providing the&#xD;
      most effective analgesia. Serratus anterior plane (SAP) block has recently been described as&#xD;
      a regional anesthetic technique to provide analgesia for thoracic wall surgeries. During SAP&#xD;
      block, local anesthesia are deposited in the fascial plane either superficial to the serratus&#xD;
      muscle or deep to the serratus anterior muscle in the mid-axillary line . Serratus anterior&#xD;
      block provides analgesia to a hemithorax by blocking the lateral branches of the intercostal&#xD;
      nerves. This study aims To compare the effect of superficial, deep serratus plane blocks and&#xD;
      thoracic epidural analgesia in maintaining hemodynamic and controlling post thoracotomy pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of thoracotomy surgery is to explore the thoracic cavity and manage different&#xD;
      pathologies including pulmonary, diaphragmatic, mediastinal, esophageal and vascular&#xD;
      pathologies. It can be performed posterolaterally, anterolaterally or even anteriorly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain after thoracotomy is known to be sever acute pain that is resulted from retraction,&#xD;
      resection or fracture of ribs and dislocation of costovertebral joints; injury of intercostal&#xD;
      nerves or even irritation of the pleura by chest tubes inserted at the end of surgery. This&#xD;
      pain increases post-operative morbidity and if not properly managed peri-operatively, chronic&#xD;
      post thoracotomy pain syndrome may develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different methods are described to manage post thoracotomy pain. Intravenous (IV) drugs such&#xD;
      as opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), infiltration of local&#xD;
      anesthetics to the wound and regional anesthetic techniques such as thoracic epidural&#xD;
      analgesia (TEA), paravertebral block, intercostal block and intra/extra pleural block are&#xD;
      methods frequently used to relieve post thoracotomy pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thoracic epidural analgesia is believed to be the corner stone in the peri-operative care for&#xD;
      thoracotomy providing the most effective analgesia. However, thoracic epidural analgesia is&#xD;
      associated with serious complications such as hypotension, dural puncture with the needle or&#xD;
      the catheter, post-dural puncture headache, respiratory depression with adding opioids,&#xD;
      spinal cord injury and anterior spinal artery syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The serratus muscle is a superÔ¨Åcial and easily identified muscle that is considered a true&#xD;
      landmark to implement thoracic wall blocks because the intercostal nerves pierce it.Serratus&#xD;
      anterior plane (SAP) block has recently been described as a regional anesthetic technique to&#xD;
      provide analgesia for breast and thoracic wall surgeries. During SAP block, local anesthesia&#xD;
      are deposited in the fascial plane either superficial to the serratus muscle or deep to the&#xD;
      serratus anterior muscle in the mid-axillary line .Serratus anterior block provides analgesia&#xD;
      to a hemithorax by blocking the lateral branches of the intercostal nerves.SAP block is also&#xD;
      expected to avoid autonomic blockade associated with TEA and other complications involving&#xD;
      the pleura and central neuraxial structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound imaging made the practice of regional anesthesia easier in visualization and&#xD;
      identification of usual and unusual position of nerves , blood vessels , needle during its&#xD;
      passage through the tissues, as well as deposition and spread of local anesthetics in the&#xD;
      desired plane and around the desired nerve.&#xD;

    <description>Under full aseptic conditions and wearing sterile gloves while the patient is in setting position, skin infiltration will be done with 2 ml of 1% lidocaine, then an 18-G Epidural needle with a 20-G catheter (Perifix, B.Braun, Germany) will be inserted through the T6-T7 interspace, and the epidural space located using the loss of resistance technique. The catheter then advanced approximately 3 cm cephalic. A test dose of 3 ml of 1% lidocaine containing epinephrine in a ratio of 1:200,000 administered to detect unintentional intrathecal or IV injection. After negative response, 15 ml of 0.25% epidural bupivacaine will be injected and the patient will be turned to the supine position.</description>
