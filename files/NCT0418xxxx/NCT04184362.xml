  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of peripheral nerve stimulation on opioid craving and use&#xD;
      and pain in participants with chronic non-cancer pain (NCP) and opioid misuse. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive the active or sham control treatment for the duration of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminarily examine&#xD;
      efficacy of peripheral nerve stimulation with the Empower Neuromodulation System on reducing&#xD;
      opioid craving and use and decreasing pain. Opioid prescribing for chronic pain has increased&#xD;
      dramatically over the past several decades, with devastating public health consequences,&#xD;
      including high rates of opioid misuse and overdose deaths. Safe nonpharmacological treatments&#xD;
      are urgently needed. In this randomized, controlled study, thirty Veterans with chronic&#xD;
      non-cancer pain (NCP) and opioid misuse will be recruited and randomly assigned (1:1) to&#xD;
      either the Active or Control treatment. On Days 1-7, participants will undergo baseline&#xD;
      monitoring, and on Days 8-21, participants will undergo daily nerve stimulation treatment.&#xD;
      Pain scores, craving, and opioid use will be measured daily Days 0-21. Our goal is to provide&#xD;
      an intervention that, alone or in conjunction with current treatments, reduces craving and&#xD;
      reduces reliance on opioids in high-risk chronic pain patients.&#xD;

    <description>Each participant will be given the Empower app and trained on app use. They will record pain levels daily on the Empower app, with a 0-10 scale. 0 indicating a lack of pain outcome. Pain score measures will be taken throughout the study. Throughout the study (Days 0-21), the Empower App will prompt all participants daily to complete the Numeric Rating Scale to assess pain levels immediately before and after treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change in Craving Response and Self Report Measures with Empower Neuromodulation Active Treatment Versus Control Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will be given the Empower app and trained on app use. They will record craving levels daily on the Empower app, with a 0-10 scale. 0 indicating an outcome with a lack of craving.&#xD;
The first week will be the Baseline Monitoring Phase, in which baseline measures of craving are completed daily. On Day 7, participants will return to clinic and will be randomized to use the Empower device at the active site. The subsequent two weeks will be the Treatment Phase, followed by the Post-Treatment Completion visit at the end of the two-week Treatment Phase.&#xD;
Surveys administered through Qualtrics (except for Week 0 screening visit surveys) will be e-mailed to participants directly through Qualtrics. Throughout the study (Days 0-21), the Empower App will prompt all participants daily to complete the following measure of Visual Analog Scale, to assess craving immediately before and after treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change in Opioid Use with Empower Active Treatment Versus Control Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Throughout the study (Days 0-21), the Empower App will prompt all participants daily to complete the measure of prescribed and nonprescribed self-reported opioid use for the previous day. Surveys administered through Qualtrics (except for Week 0 screening visit surveys) will be e-mailed to participants directly through Qualtrics.&#xD;
Participants will complete measures of current opioid misuse, and obsessive-compulsive drug use.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General health monitored</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>General health measures will be monitored through surveys administered through Qualtrics (except for Week 0 screening visit surveys). The surveys will be emailed to participants to measure multidimensional assessment of interoceptive awareness (MAIA-2) 0-5 scale, physical activity (PAS-2) records average activity time per week, brief anxiety inventory (BAI) 0-3 scale, insomnia severity index (ISI) with a 0-4 scale, and distress intolerance index (DII) with a 0-4 scale. Increased MAIA-2 &amp; PAS2, or decreased BAI, ISI, and DII show improvement.</description>
