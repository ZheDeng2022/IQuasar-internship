      Endothelial dysfunction is assessed in patients with chronic venous insufficiency of lower&#xD;
      limbs (grade C4 according to C - clinical manifestations, E - etiologic factors, A - anatomic&#xD;
      distribution of disease, and P - underlying pathophysiologic findings (CEAP) classification)&#xD;

      saphenous vein, microphlebectomy of varicose branches. Two treatment groups (with and without&#xD;
      additional pharmacotherapy) are compared.&#xD;

Mean value of tissue blood perfusion.&#xD;
Flux amplitude - standard deviation for oscillations of microcirculation values at given time interval.&#xD;
Flux motion index.&#xD;
Spectral analysis of blood flow oscillations with determination of oscillation amplitude at given frequency band, as well as determination of contribution of certain frequency bands into total power of biological rhythm spectrum.&#xD;

    <description>Severity of disease estimated by Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS). It is used to assess those with venous disease that that is complementary to the CEAP classification. The score includes 10 clinical parameters (pain, varicose veins, venous edema, skin hyperpigmentation, inflammation, induration, number of ulcers, durations of ulcers, size of ulcers, and compliance with compression therapy). Each item is graded from zero to three depending on severity (None = 0, Mild = 1, Moderate = 2, Severe = 3). The lower the score the less severity, the higher the score the more severity.</description>

    <description>Surgical treatment is performed as endovenous laser ablation of GSV and microphlebectomy of varicose branches according to a standard protocol:&#xD;
The intervention includes treatment of the pathological upright reflux and varicose veins. Ultrasound-guided GSV puncture at the upper third of the leg under local anesthesia. The light guide is inserted into the vein lumen and pushed through to the saphenofemoral junction. Under ultrasound guidance the light guide is positioned at v. epigastrica superficialis junction. Under ultrasound guidance tumescent anesthesia is produced around the GSV from puncture site up to the saphenofemoral junction. Laser coagulation (with radial light guide), linear energy density - 75 J/cm, automatic traction of the light guide at the speed 0.7 mm/sec. Varicose veins are resected through skin punctures using Varady hook 1-2 mm.</description>
