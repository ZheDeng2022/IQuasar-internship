  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being done to see if giving surfactant (CurosurfÂ®) will decrease the&#xD;
      number of days that infants will need a breathing tube, decrease the days in the critical&#xD;
      care unit and decrease the number of days needed in the hospital. The primary hypothesis for&#xD;
      this study is that there will be fewer days needed on mechanical ventilation and improved&#xD;
      lung compliance and pulmonary gas exchange.&#xD;

      This study will enroll infants undergoing cardiothoracic surgery requiring deep hypothermic&#xD;
      circulatory arrest (DHCA) at the University of Michigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital.&#xD;
      Patients that are eligible will be randomized to receive either one dose surfactant or the&#xD;
      sham (air) arm after the surgical procedure. Patients will be monitored for an additional 30&#xD;
      days after the breathing tube is removed. It is possible that subjects may be discharged&#xD;
      prior to the last assessment, therefore for subjects who have been discharged a member of the&#xD;
      study team will contact the parent (s) or legal authorized representative by telephone.&#xD;
