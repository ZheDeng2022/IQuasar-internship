      Noninvasive fat reduction is a rapidly expanding field of cosmetic rejuvenation, as many&#xD;
      patients are unwilling to suffer the downtime and healing associated with traditional&#xD;
      invasive liposuction. The radiofrequency (RF) device has been shown to be safe and effective&#xD;
      for non-invasive fat reduction, as well as cutaneous enhancement and improvement of skin&#xD;
      flaccidity (BOISNIC, et al., 2014).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Brazil, the search for satisfaction with self-image has been increasing, since the profile&#xD;
      of the population has been altered by cultural factors such as industrialized foods with high&#xD;
      caloric content and sedentary lifestyle. These factors result in the accumulation of adipose&#xD;
      tissue in typical and atypical places, caused by the imbalance of the energy balance, that&#xD;
      is, a higher caloric intake when compared to the energy consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninvasive fat reduction is a rapidly expanding field of cosmetic rejuvenation, as many&#xD;
      patients are unwilling to suffer the downtime and healing associated with traditional&#xD;
      invasive liposuction. The radiofrequency (RF) device has been shown to be safe and effective&#xD;
      for non-invasive fat reduction, as well as cutaneous enhancement and improvement of skin&#xD;
      flaccidity (BOISNIC, et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiofrequency emits focused electromagnetic waves that find resistance in the tissue,&#xD;
      generating heat (KRUEGUER, LEVY and SADICK, 2012). This thermal energy affects the triple&#xD;
      helix structure of the collagen, subsequently breaking the intramolecular hydrogen bonds,&#xD;
      resulting in immediate contraction of the collagen and neocollagenesis in the dermis, without&#xD;
      interfering in the epidermis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This neocollagenesis and remodeling of collagen results in a visibly compacted and organized&#xD;
      dermis. Skin enhancement is an important effect, since patients that search for non-invasive&#xD;
      fat reduction usually also seek improvement in skin flaccidity. This represents a substantial&#xD;
      improvement over currently available technology (BOISNIC, et al, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is controversy regarding the mechanism of fat mobilization. Some authors, after&#xD;
      observing human skin cultures at the end of the series of RF treatments found a profound&#xD;
      effect on subcutaneous adipocytes. The analysis resulted in altered morphology and increased&#xD;
      expression of the pyroptosis marker, APAF-1, suggesting that pyroptosis induced by&#xD;
      irreversible electroporation is the mechanism of action. Adipocyte pyroptosis results in the&#xD;
      release of triglycerides from disintegrated cell membranes, but in a delayed and gradual&#xD;
      manner, allowing a slow and safe removal through the interstitial space and liquid transport&#xD;
      systems, lymphatic vessels and other metabolic functions. There was no evidence of necrosis&#xD;
      or inflammatory changes observed in adipocytes after treatments with BodyFX, a type of&#xD;
      radiofrequency (BOISNIC, et al, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other authors say that the increase in temperature caused by RF has physiological effects,&#xD;
      such as increased cellular metabolism, increased vasodilation and blood supply and activation&#xD;
      of branches of the autonomic nervous system releasing adrenaline and noradrenaline (BELENKY,&#xD;
      et al., 2012; PUMPRALA, et al., 2015, MESSINA, et al., 2017, RYDDEN and ARNER, 2017). These&#xD;
      effects culminate in the better efficacy of lipolysis, which is a biochemical process where&#xD;
      lipid hydrolysis occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation and application of the protocol will be performed in the therapeutic resources&#xD;
      laboratory of the physiotherapy course of Federal University of Triângulo Mineiro- UFTM&#xD;
      (whose coordinator is the researcher responsible for this study), the material will be&#xD;
      collected at the Clinical Hospital of the UFTM surgical center and the preparation and&#xD;
      analysis of the slides will be carried out in the pathology laboratory of UFTM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women who will undergo plastic abdominoplasty surgery at the Clinical Hospital of the&#xD;
      UFTM will be invited to participate in the study. These women are in the electronic queue&#xD;
      awaiting surgery and will be invited by the plastic surgery team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers will receive radiofrequency (TECAR-BTL® device, with epidermal temperature&#xD;
      above 40ºC) in the right infraumbilical abdominal region, with an application time of 10&#xD;
      minutes (2 minutes per applicator area) and the left region will be used as control. A single&#xD;
      session will be held. After approximately 30 days of this application the material for&#xD;
      histological analysis will be collected during the surgical act, at which point the skin and&#xD;
      the subcutaneous tissue of the infraumbilical region are discarded by the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fragments collected during surgery will be fixed in Methacarn (60% methanol, 30% chloroform,&#xD;
      10% acetic acid) for 2 hours at room temperature (RT). The slides will be made by the&#xD;
      department of general pathology of the Federal University of the Triângulo Mineiro. Samples&#xD;
      will be dehydrated in ethanol, diaphonized in xylol and embedded in paraffin. Histological&#xD;
      sections of 5 μm thickness will be obtained in microtome (Jung) and placed on pre-coated&#xD;
      sheets with polylysine. The histological sections will be stained with hematoxylin and eosin,&#xD;
      Picro-sirius and Verhoeff. By the staining of Hematoxylin-Eosin will be analyzed the general&#xD;
      morphology of the tissue including the quantity and volume of the adipose vacuoles,&#xD;
      Picro-sirius the presence and morphology of the collagen fibers and Verhoeff the elastic&#xD;
      fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blades stained by Hematoxylin-Eosin, Picro-sirius and Verhoeff will be visualized with a 20x&#xD;
      objective. The images will be captured by a common light microscope and analyzed by the Axion&#xD;
      Vision Automatic Image Analyzer System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way the field to be quantified will be captured, photographed through a camera&#xD;
      attached to the microscope and to the computer for image scanning. Images will be saved in&#xD;
      TIFF format. All blade fields will be photographed and saved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the fields are saved, the Image J® program will be used to improve them, using the&#xD;
      illumination reference so that they all have the same quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentage of collagen, elastic fibers and the analysis of the amount and volume of the&#xD;
      adipose vacuole will be marked by the Image J® program and registered in a Microsoft Excel&#xD;
      worksheet.&#xD;
