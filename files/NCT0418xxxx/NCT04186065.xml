      This study investigates how often cavities develop on the permanent teeth of patients with&#xD;
      braces (orthodontic treatment). The hypothesis is that there is no difference in the number&#xD;
      of cavities on the permanent teeth of patients with braces compared to similar patients&#xD;
      without braces.&#xD;

      The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to determine the prevalence of early carious&#xD;
      lesions (white spot lesions, or WSLs) for patients who are receiving orthodontic treatment&#xD;
      compared to patients who are not receiving orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from the University of Kentucky Orthodontic Clinic patient pool.&#xD;
      Orthodontic care at the University of Kentucky College of Dentistry (UKCOD) is provided by&#xD;
      orthodontic faculty, as well as students enrolled in the graduate orthodontic program at the&#xD;
      UKCOD. Subjects will be invited to participate in this study after receiving an initial&#xD;
      treatment plan with fixed appliances for at least one arch.&#xD;

        Participants have to be 10 years older who are treatment planned for orthodontic treatment&#xD;
        with fixed appliances in the Graduate or Faculty Orthodontic Clinic at University of&#xD;
        Kentucky.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Based upon the racial distribution of patients currently receiving treatment in the&#xD;
        Graduate and Faculty Orthodontic Clinics, investigators expect that study population to be&#xD;
        predominantly Caucasian, with minority representation from the African-American and&#xD;
        Hispanic communities. The sample composition is expected to be equally weighted with&#xD;
        respect to gender.&#xD;
