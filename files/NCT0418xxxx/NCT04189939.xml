  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to investigate how the brain changes in patients undergoing&#xD;
      electroconvulsive (ECT) treatment for depression. Subjects will be invited to be in this&#xD;
      study because (1) he/she is a patient about to receive ECT treatment for depression, or (2)&#xD;
      he/she is a healthy adult volunteer with no history of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All volunteers must be between ages 18-70. Participation in this research will involve three&#xD;
      visits. Each visit will last about 4-5 hours. If subject is a patient receiving ECT for&#xD;
      depression the study team will schedule study visits to go along with patient treatment&#xD;
      visits. If subject is a healthy volunteer, visits will occur 1 month and 2 months after the&#xD;
      initial visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this research will involve playing simple computer games while subject's&#xD;
      brain is scanned with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Additionally, study team will assess&#xD;
      symptoms of depression using questionnaires. Patients receiving ECT will not experience any&#xD;
      changes to their standard of care ECT treatment plan. Healthy volunteers will not undergo ECT&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal for this study will be to test the following overall hypotheses: (1) that adaptive&#xD;
      decision-making processes are disrupted in patients with treatment-resistant depression, and&#xD;
      (2) the neural and behavioral changes associated with treatment-resistant depression can be&#xD;
      assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging paired with computationally constrained&#xD;
      adaptive decision-making games.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use computational modeling of incentivized decision-making tasks,&#xD;
      brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI), and standard clinical&#xD;
      assessments, to characterize patients referred to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center for ECT.&#xD;
      Characterization will occur over multiple visits to be aligned with the normal course of&#xD;
      patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected may be used in hypothesis driven analyses to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. classify treatment resistant depression versus healthy controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. predictors of ECT treatment success versus failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. characterize brain and behavioral changes consistent with treatment success versus&#xD;
           failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. predict who will need maintenance ECT therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. determine what changes in decision-making behavior are apparent in patients who require&#xD;
           ECT maintenance therapy versus those who do not.&#xD;
