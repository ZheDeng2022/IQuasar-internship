  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label, single-dose, randomized, three-treatment, three-period,&#xD;
      four-sequence, crossover study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability of a test&#xD;
      formulation of lofexidine granules for reconstitution (oral) and LUCEMYRA tablets under&#xD;
      fasted conditions and to evaluate the effect of food on the relative bioavailability of&#xD;
      lofexidine granules for reconstitution (oral) when administered under fed compared to fasted&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
