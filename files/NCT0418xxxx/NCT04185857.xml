    <textblock>
      Current guidelines recommend withdrawal of treatments that affect the aldosterone/renin ratio&#xD;
      (ARR) when screening for primary aldosteronism (PA). However, abandonment of&#xD;
      mineralocorti-coid-receptor antagonist (MRA) and/or blockers of the renin-angiotensin system&#xD;
      can deteriorate control of blood pressure (BP) and hypokalemia. Thus, in consecutive patients&#xD;
      with an unambiguous diagnosis of PA in wash-out from confounding treatments and subtyped by&#xD;
      AVS, the investigators have compared within-patient the plasma aldosterone and active renin&#xD;
      concentration, and the ARR values, measured at baseline, and after a one-month treatment with&#xD;
      MRA alone and combined with an AT-1 receptor blocker (ARB). Patients on a regular salt intake&#xD;
      have been treated with canrenone (50-100 mg orally) for 1 month, after which olmesartan (10&#xD;
      or 20 mg orally) has been added for another month with up-titration of both treatments over&#xD;
      the first 2 weeks to control BP and hypokalemia, however maintaining background therapy. The&#xD;
      biochemical variables and the ARR have been assessed in an identical manner at baseline&#xD;
      values and after each month of treatment. The investigators calculated that with a sample&#xD;
      size of 40 patients the study will have a 95% power to show a clinically significant 20%&#xD;
      change in the ARR at an 5% alfa-value using a two-sided paired t-test. Hence, this study will&#xD;
      allow to determine if an MRA alone, or added to an ARB at doses that control BP and&#xD;
      hypokalemia, affect or not the ARR, thus allow to establish if these agents can be&#xD;
      administered or must be forbidden during the screening of PA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a common form of hypertension caused by aldosterone secretion&#xD;
      inappropriate for blood pressure (BP) and volume status. It involves over 11% of the patients&#xD;
      referred to specialized hypertension centres, about one fifth of those with drug-resistant&#xD;
      hypertension and even a large proportion of the hypertensive patients seen in general&#xD;
      practice. The only main subtype of PA that can be unambiguously diagnosed based on&#xD;
      post-adrenalectomy using a &quot;five corners&quot; approach is aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients undergoing screening for PA the current guidelines recommend pharmacological&#xD;
      wash-out or, more correctly, switch to antihypertensive therapy not influencing the values of&#xD;
      plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and direct renin concentration (DRC) and therefore of&#xD;
      the aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR). This therapy generally entails a long-acting calcium&#xD;
      channel blocker, alone or in combination with an alpha-blocker. However, a significant&#xD;
      proportion of hypertensive patients, about one third, require more complex therapies to&#xD;
      maintain acceptable BP levels. In addition, a proportion, estimated at around 10% of patients&#xD;
      with PA, have hypertension resistant to common antihypertensives, as shown in the PATWAY-2&#xD;
      study. Noteworthy, these patients usually exibit a BP lowering response to&#xD;
      mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists (MRAs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRAs act as diuretics and therefore stimulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system&#xD;
      (RAAS), which might confound the results of the diagnostic tests, increasing renin and&#xD;
      therefore reducing the ARR. This is considered to increase the rate of false negative tests.&#xD;
      Moreover, some data suggest that MRA could inhibit the synthesis of aldosterone. However,&#xD;
      this remains contentious as there are no prospective studies in this regard. Therefore, the&#xD;
      use of MRAs, which can effectively control BP and hypokalemia during the PA screening is&#xD;
      generally discouraged, despite the lack of solid prospective studies in this regard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stimulation of SRAA, if it actually occurs in a patient with PA, could be controlled, or&#xD;
      prevented, by the use of an angiotensin AT-1 receptor blocker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators set out a prospective observational study aimed at&#xD;
      investigating, with a within-patient comparison, the values of PAC, DRC, ARR, serum&#xD;
      potassium, in addition to blood pressure, in patients unambigously diagnosed with PA, who&#xD;
      underwent screening and subtyping in washout from confounding treatments according to the&#xD;
      current guidelines, with the values produced by treatment with MRA (canrenone) given alone or&#xD;
      in combination with an angiotensin AT-1 receptor blocker (olmesartan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will prospectively recruit consecutive PA patients which have been&#xD;
      previously studied in washout from confounding treatments (first basal evaluation) and will&#xD;
      be subtyped by adrenal vein sampling (AVS) in the Clinica dell'Ipertensione Arteriosa,&#xD;
      University of Padova, Italy (second basal evaluation). Inclusion criteria: patients between&#xD;
      the ages of 18 and 75, diagnosed with APA according with the guidelines, which will give&#xD;
      written informed consent. The exclusion criteria comprise the refusal to participate in the&#xD;
      study of the history of intolerance or allergy to canrenone or ARBs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with canrenone 50-100 mg orally for 1 month followed by canrenone&#xD;
      plus olmesartan 10 or 20 mg for another month. At the end of each month they will undergo a&#xD;
      clinical and biochemical reevaluation to investigate the effects of both treatments and&#xD;
      compared with the ARR values observed during washout (i.e. during the first and second basal&#xD;
      evaluations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After two biochemical and clinical evaluations under baseline conditions and after&#xD;
      pharmacological washout from diuretics, betablockers, ARBs or ACEI (about 4 weeks) and MRAs&#xD;
      (abut 6 weeks), PA patients will be treated with canrenone 50-100 mg orally once a day. After&#xD;
      one and tho weeks the dose will be doubled if necessary to control BP and serum potassium.&#xD;
      After one month of such therapy they will undergo the a clinical and biochemical evaluation&#xD;
      (FW1) in a manner identical to the two basal evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After, they will continue with a combination therapy with canrenone, at the dose reached,&#xD;
      plus olmesartan starting with 10 mg a day for oral administration, a dose that can be&#xD;
      doubled, if necessary, to achieve normotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the second month of the double therapy, patients will undergo a biochemical&#xD;
      re-evaluation at the Center of Hypertension (FW2) with methods identical to those performed&#xD;
      in the two baseline evaluations and after one month of canrenone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is commonly used in the Center of Reference - UOSD Hypertension for the optimal&#xD;
      preparation of patients with PA for the eventual intervention of laparoscopic adrenalectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, within-patient, observational study aiming at comparing, in patients&#xD;
      with PA, the values of PAC, DRC and ARR assessed in wash-out (or in treatment with CCBs and&#xD;
      or alfa-blockers) with the values observed after 1 month treatment with canrenone 50 or 100&#xD;
      mg o.d. and after another month treatment with canrenone 50 or 100 mg o.d. plus olmesartan 10&#xD;
      mg or 20 mg o.d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation and statistical analysis A statistical power to detect any&#xD;
      intra-patient difference of ormonal concentrations will be reached considering 40 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the data will be performed initially globally (i.e. on the entire cohort) and&#xD;
      subsequently conducted separately: in patients with APA where the diagnosis will be confirmed&#xD;
      at the adrenalectomy and biochemical follow-up one month after surgery, and in patients with&#xD;
      PA not lateralized where the one month follow up will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results. The investigators expect to conclusively determine if and how MRA alone or&#xD;
      combined with an ARB at doses that control BP and hypokalemia, affect plasma concentration of&#xD;
      PAC and DRC and therefore the ARR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the results of this study will not show a confounding effect of one or the other&#xD;
      treatment, this study could open the way to perform the screening tests for PA without the&#xD;
      need to suspend these treatments and therefore with the possibility of minimizing the risks&#xD;
      due to the reduction of therapy antihypertensive in hypertensive patients.&#xD;
