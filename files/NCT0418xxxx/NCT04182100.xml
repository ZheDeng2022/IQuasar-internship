  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 single arm study to investigate efficacy and safety of P1101 for adult&#xD;
      Japanese patients with PV.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be treated with P1101, starting at 100 μg (or 50 μg in patients under&#xD;
      another cytoreductive therapy). The dose should be gradually increased by 50 μg every two&#xD;
      weeks (in parallel, other cytoreductive therapy should be decreased gradually, as&#xD;
      appropriate) until stabilization of the hematological parameters is achieved (hematocrit&#xD;
      &lt;45%, platelets &lt;400 x 10^9/L and leukocytes &lt;10 x 10^9/L). The maximum recommended single&#xD;
      dose is 500 μg injected every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 36 (month 9) and week 52 (month 12), the primary study endpoint, phlebotomy-free CHR,&#xD;
      will be analyzed. After completion of the 52-week study duration, provision and&#xD;
      administration of P1101, collection of the long-term follow up information (blood parameters,&#xD;
      molecular and cytogenetic data, safety parameters and as also the optional bone marrow data)&#xD;
      will be continued until the drug becomes commercially available for all study subjects..&#xD;

    <description>P1101 (ropeginterferon alfa-2b) will be administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks at the starting dose of 100 μg every two weeks (or 50 μg in patients under another cytoreductive therapy). The dose should be gradually increased by 50 μg every two weeks (in parallel, other cytoreductive therapy should be decreased gradually, as appropriate) until stabilization of the hematological parameters is achieved (hematocrit &lt;45%, platelets &lt;400 x 10^9/L and leukocytes &lt;10 x 10^9/L). The maximum recommended single dose is 500 μg injected every two weeks.

    <intervention_name>Phlebotomy</intervention_name>
    <description>Phlebotomy is performed aiming at a hematocrit &lt; 45%. When the hematocrit value is 45% or higher, phlebotomy is performed. The volume of phlebotomy per procedure should be 200 to 400 mL while monitoring the circulatory dynamics such as blood pressure and pulse. In the elderly and patients with cardiovascular disorders, a small volume (100-200 mL) should be considered to avoid rapid changes in hemodynamics.</description>
