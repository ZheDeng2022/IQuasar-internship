        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and/or females over age 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid tumor for which&#xD;
             no established standard therapy is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one measurable lesion by CT or MRI according to RECIST1.1, which is not in&#xD;
             irradiated area (only for expansion phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recovered from toxicities of prior anti-cancer treatment to Grade 1 or less (in case&#xD;
             of alopecia, Grade 2 is acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants of child bearing potential agree not to be pregnant or lactating&#xD;
             during the study and for three months following the last dose of study drug. Both men&#xD;
             and women of reproductive potential must agree to use a highly effective method of&#xD;
             birth control during the study and for three months following the last dose of study&#xD;
             drug. A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a&#xD;
             low failure rate, i.e., less than 1% per year, when used consistently and correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any anti-tumor treatment with radiation therapy, surgery, or immunotherapy wihtin 2&#xD;
             weeks (3 weeks for chemotherapy; 6 weeks for nitrosoureas or Mitomycin C) prior to&#xD;
             trial entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical history of difficulty swallowing, malabsorption or other chronic&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disease, or conditions that may hamper compliance and/or absorption&#xD;
             of the tested product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously treated malignancies other than the current disease, except for adequately&#xD;
             treated non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ cancer, or other cancer from which the&#xD;
             subject has been disease-free for at least 2 years at the trial entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within 4 weeks prior to the trial entry,&#xD;
             without complete recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory values not within the Protocol-defined range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac disease , including congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, unstable&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or symptomatic peripheral arterial vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, requiring systemic&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with the conduct of the trial,&#xD;
             or that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to the&#xD;
             subject in this trial.&#xD;
