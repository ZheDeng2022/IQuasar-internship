  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Zonisamide (ZNS) (1,2-Benzisoxazole-3-methanesulfonamide) is an anti-epileptic drug. In three&#xD;
      double blinded placebo controlled studies, ZNS- as an adjunctive treatment- showed beneficial&#xD;
      effects on motor symptoms of PD with a low incidence of adverse events. As a result 25 mg&#xD;
      daily of ZNS was approved in 2009 in Japan as an adjunctive treatment in PD patients whose&#xD;
      condition responded insufficiently to Levodopa treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most observations of a beneficial effect of ZNS have been in Japanese people, and the&#xD;
      antiparkinsonian mechanism of action is unclear. So, ZNS is a promising but still&#xD;
      investigational drug to treat PD and more studies are warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      this study will investigate the efficacy and tolerability of Zonisamide as an adjunctive&#xD;
      treatment in Egyptian patients with advanced PD, including motor fluctuations, levodopa&#xD;
      induced dyskinesia and existing nonmotor symptoms. Additionally it investigates its effects&#xD;
      on quality of life of PD patients.&#xD;

      Type of Study: Randomized double blinded Placebo controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Setting: Movement disorders clinic of neurology department, Ain Shams University&#xD;
           Hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Period : 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Population: Patients with advanced PD and insufficient response to dopaminergic&#xD;
           drugs .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age older than 18 years of both male and female genders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals diagnosed with PD based on the presence of 2 of 3 cardinal features &amp; United&#xD;
           Kingdom bank criteria for idiopathic Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with manifestations of advanced PD defined according to the consensus on the&#xD;
           definition of advanced PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inadequate response to dopaminergic medications due to limitations related to side&#xD;
           effects, or levodopa related long-term problems as wearing-off phenomena, &quot;on&quot;-&quot;off&quot;&#xD;
           fluctuation, levodopa induced dyskinesia and freezing phenomena, no-&quot;on&quot; and&#xD;
           delayed-&quot;on,&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with atypical or secondary parkinsonian syndromes excluding PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who could not perform the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Women who were or might be pregnant, who did not practice effective contraception and&#xD;
           were of childbearing potential, or who were breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the patients will be informed of the objectives, procedures and possible benefits and&#xD;
      risks of the study and will provide written voluntary consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will conform to the standards of the Ethical Review Committee, Ain Shams&#xD;
      University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients diagnosed with PD will be evaluated for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: placebo group , ZNS group 25 mg&#xD;
      and ZNS group 50 mg (30 patients each).In ZNS 50 mg group, ZNS will be started with a dose of&#xD;
      25 mg daily for one week then increased to 50 mg once daily to minimize side effects. The&#xD;
      dosage and regimen of ongoing antiparkinsonian drugs and other drugs that may affect PD&#xD;
      symptoms will remain unchanged one month before and through the treatment period.&#xD;

Randomization was done by a research randomization program (https://www.randomizer.org), The copy of the randomization table of patients to the 3 groups was kept with 2 different personnel not working on the study.&#xD;
Amid to COVID19 and less access to patients in an advanced stage, a crossover design will be included SO patients in:&#xD;
Placebo arm will be randomized to arm 25 mg or 50 mg with at least 1-month washout Arm 25 mg &amp; arm 50 mg will be shifted to placebo with at least 1 month washout</intervention_model_description>
