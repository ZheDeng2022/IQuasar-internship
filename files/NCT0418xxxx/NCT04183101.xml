  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this cross-over trial is to assess aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, as a novel&#xD;
      treatment to block complement activation in the kidneys and thereby attenuate renal disease&#xD;
      and stabilize or improve kidney function and compare it to the currently used treatment with&#xD;
      the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, in patients with the&#xD;
      complement-mediated renal disease C3 glomerulopathy. Patients will be randomized to one or&#xD;
      the other treatment for the first 6 months and then switch to the other treament for the&#xD;
      following 2.5 years. Treatment will continue for altogether 3 years for each patient.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the effect and safety of aliskiren on reducing systemic&#xD;
      and local complement activation as indicated by a reduction of serum C3 during the cross-over&#xD;
      study and serum C3 and complement deposition in renal biopsies during the extension study in&#xD;
      patients with C3 glomerulopathy as compared to the currently used treatment with the&#xD;
      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) enalapril.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to assess the effect of aliskiren as compared to the currently used&#xD;
      treatment with the ACEi enalapril on: complement activation (such as serum C3a, C3dg, C5a and&#xD;
      related complement assays), proteinuria, kidney function, kidney biopsy findings, blood&#xD;
      pressure, activation of the renin angiotensin system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aliskiren will be administered orally in tablet form at 150 -300 mg/daily (maximal dose 300&#xD;
      mg). Enalapril 2.5-20 mg/daily (maximal dose 20 mg). These drugs may be administered once or&#xD;
      twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators estimate an inclusion of maximum 15 patients for start of treatment with&#xD;
      aliskiren and maximum 15 patients for start of treatment with enalapril. Suitable patients&#xD;
      will be chosen from those patients who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do not have severe renal failure. Pediatric patients will be included if they have a&#xD;
           glomerular filtration rate ≥ 50 ml/min/1.73m2, adults ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Children, above the age of 6 years of age and adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients treated with aliskiren will be compared to patients treated with the ACE&#xD;
           inhibitor enalapril as monotherapy. Use of ACE inhibitor as a nephroprotective therapy&#xD;
           will increase renin levels without blocking its effect. Thus, the investigators will&#xD;
           compare patients on aliskiren with those on enalapril to investigate if ACE inhibition&#xD;
           as monotherapy has a negative effect on complement activation in comparison to direct&#xD;
           renin inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients treated with immune suppressive medications at the start (such as mycophenolate&#xD;
           mofetil (MMF) or corticosteroids) will be compared to patients treated with MMF or&#xD;
           steroids plus aliskiren or enalapril.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All suitable patients who fulfill inclusion criteria and who submitted written informed&#xD;
      consent (patient or patient's legal guardians) will have undergone a renal biopsy at the most&#xD;
      2 years before inclusion or at inclusion and will be randomized for treatment with aliskiren&#xD;
      or enalapril. After 6 months patients on aliskiren will switch to enalapril and vice versa,&#xD;
      patients on enalapril will switch to aliskiren treatment. Patients will be followed&#xD;
      routinely, every 3rd month, regarding renal function (creatinine, urea, estimated glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate), albumin (blood and urine), renin levels and complement activation assays in&#xD;
      blood samples (C3, C3dg, C5, properdin, soluble terminal complement complex, C3a, C5a, C3&#xD;
      nephritic factor and other complement assays). The follow-up period, a total of 3 years from&#xD;
      the start, will be carried out by the patient's own nephrologist and will not differ from the&#xD;
      clinical follow-up offered patients not participating in the study. After 1-3 years (when&#xD;
      medically indicated but at the most 3 years after start), a repeat renal biopsy will be&#xD;
      performed to validate the effect of treatment on renal morphology. Renal biopsies, both the&#xD;
      initial and the repeat biopsy, will be evaluated for complement deposition and glomerular&#xD;
      basement membrane thickness.&#xD;
