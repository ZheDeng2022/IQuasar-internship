    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication, occurring in approximately 20% of&#xD;
      hospitalized cirrhotic patients and has a significant negative impact on patients' outcomes&#xD;
      according to either the initial stage (at the time of the first fulfillment of AKI criteria),&#xD;
      or the peak stage (at the peak value of serum creatinine concentration during&#xD;
      hospitalization). Among all the precipitating factors to cirrhotic AKI, acute&#xD;
      gastrointestinal hemorrhage is a common cause that leads to a decrease in effective arterial&#xD;
      blood volume in the hyperdynamic circulatory status of cirrhosis. However, there is still&#xD;
      lack of optimal predictors to developing AKI in cirrhotic patients suffering from acute GI&#xD;
      bleeding. A number of biomarkers associated with AKI were recently described. Some studies&#xD;
      have shown that these novel biomarkers increase with the severity of liver injury and are&#xD;
      predictive of clinical outcomes. However, the effective prediction, definitive diagnosis and&#xD;
      differentiation of AKI by these biomarkers are still controversial. Furthermore, there is no&#xD;
      clinical studies focus on the applicability and potential alteration in the setting of acute&#xD;
      gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis. Aim and significance: In this study,&#xD;
      we aim to investigate the capability of novel renal biomarkers in predicting development of&#xD;
      acute kidney injury, differentiating causes (between pre-renal AKI, acute tubular necrosis,&#xD;
      and hepatorenal syndrome), and predicting the response to renal treatment as well as the&#xD;
      hepatic and overall outcomes in patients with cirrhosis suffering from acute gastrointestinal&#xD;
      hemorrhage.&#xD;

      Specific aims of this study :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the influences of acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage on the serological or&#xD;
           urinary level of novel renal biomarkers in patients with cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the ability of novel biomarkers to predict the development of acute&#xD;
           kidney injury and the response to renal salvage treatment in patients with cirrhosis&#xD;
           suffering from acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate the ability of novel biomarkers to differentiate the precipitating&#xD;
           factors (such as sepsis-induced AKI, hypervolemia-induced AKI, etc.) and the causes of&#xD;
           AKI between pre-renal AKI, acute tubular necrosis, and hepatorenal syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To investigate the ability of these novel biomarkers to predict the hepatic and overall&#xD;
           outcomes in patients with cirrhosis suffering from acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimation of sample size :&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to previous studies, the estimated incidence of AKI in cirrhotic patients suffering&#xD;
      from gastrointestinal hemorrhage is about 10-15%. The type 1 error is set as 0.05; and the&#xD;
      type 2 error is set as 0.2. Then, the calculated sample size is about 80. Considering the&#xD;
      possibility of loss of follow-up is about 10%, the estimated sample size will be about 90&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection and laboratory experiments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be prospectively followed from admission until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sample collection: A fresh 30-mL of urine sample will be collected either by way of&#xD;
           clean catch or Foley catheter tubing will be collected at the time in admission to our&#xD;
           hospital, at the peak stage of AKI, and after the recovery (if recovery occurs) 10cc of&#xD;
           blood will be collected from the peripheral vessel once at the time in admission to our&#xD;
           hospital, at the peak stage of AKI, and after the recovery (if recovery occurs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Abdominal sonography (including evaluation of bilateral kidneys) will be arranged if no&#xD;
           image study available within 3 months upon admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), IL-18, spot urine protein,&#xD;
      albumin, creatinine, urea nitrogen, sodium, kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), liver-type&#xD;
      fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP), insulin-like growth factor, and tissue inhibitor&#xD;
      metalloproteinase will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      serum NGAL, cystatin C, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, IL-1, tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor alfa will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Record clinical information and regular follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Record any precipitating factors, including: presence of active infection or sepsis, the&#xD;
      dosage and types of diuretics, presence of acute hemorrhage, the frequency and the drainage&#xD;
      volume of each therapeutic paracentesis, supplement of albumin or other colloid fluid,&#xD;
      presence of heart failure or active pulmonary problems, prescription of non-selective beta&#xD;
      blockers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics, herbs and other&#xD;
      nephrotoxic drugs, as well as others. Record any chronic underlying diseases, including:&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, hypertension, congestive heart failure (the baseline left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection rate if available), chronic kidney disease (baseline glomerular filtration rate),&#xD;
      autoimmune disease, anemia of chronic disorder, the severity of liver diseases (such as&#xD;
      status of ascites, serum albumin level, presence of varices, etc.), and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular follow-up of renal function and fluid status at least twice per week as the routine&#xD;
      management in clinical practice. Regular measurements of patients' clinical data, including&#xD;
      vital signs will be done in daily practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed laboratory methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples will be immediately refrigerated and then centrifuged at 5,000g for 10 minutes&#xD;
      at -4°C. Aliquots of 1 mL of supernatant will be subsequently stored within 6 hours of&#xD;
      collection in cryovials at -80°C for NGAL, IL-18, KIM-1, L-FABP, albumin, sodium, and&#xD;
      creatinine measurements. No additives or protease inhibitors will be used. All biomarkers&#xD;
      will be measured from frozen aliquots that will not undergo any additional freeze-thaw&#xD;
      cycles. Laboratory measurements will be performed by personnel blinded to patient&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
