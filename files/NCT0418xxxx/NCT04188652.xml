      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian cysts are common in women. The vast majority is benign; yet, ovarian cancer (OC) is&#xD;
      seen in 500 women every year in Denmark. OC is often diagnosed in advanced stages, and OC is&#xD;
      the fifth most deadly cancer in women in more developed countries. It can be a clinical&#xD;
      challenge to distinguish benign ovarian cysts from OC. Currently, the Risk of Malignancy&#xD;
      Index (RMI) is used to detect women at high risk of OC in Denmark, however, new methods to&#xD;
      correctly differentiate benign ovarian cysts from OC at an early stage is needed. New&#xD;
      promising studies suggest an improved diagnostic accuracy by adding the biomarker Human&#xD;
      Epididymis Protein 4 (HE4) and systemized ultrasound imaging International Ovarian Tumor&#xD;
      Analysis (IOTA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of HE4 and IOTA in a Danish clinical&#xD;
      setting. Furthermore, to develop an optimized diagnostic algorithm to differentiate ovarian&#xD;
      cysts based on a combination of symptoms, biomarkers and IOTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective, observational study. Women with ovarian cysts are included from&#xD;
      gynecological practitioners and departments in the Capital Region of Denmark. Detailed&#xD;
      information on health and symptoms are registered, and the cysts are systematically described&#xD;
      by the gynecologist in accordance to the IOTA terminology. HE4 will be analyzed in those&#xD;
      women who routinely needs a diagnostic blood test for CA125. Data will be coupled with data&#xD;
      from the patient file and Danish Gynecological Cancer Database (DGCD). The diagnostic utility&#xD;
      of HE4 and IOTA will be evaluated both alone and in combinations with health information,&#xD;
      symptoms, and CA125. The study has been approved by the Regional Committee on Health Research&#xD;
      Ethics (H-19021342) and the Data Protection Agency (P-2019-340).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study establishes a unique database which will form the basis for developing an&#xD;
      optimized method for differentiating ovarian cysts, and thus optimize referral and diagnosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian cysts are commonly found in women with an estimated prevalence up to 35 % in&#xD;
      premenopausal women and 17 % in postmenopausal women. The majority are of benign character&#xD;
      and sometimes self-limiting; however, malignancy occurs as ovarian cancer (OC). More than 500&#xD;
      women are diagnosed with OC every year in Denmark, and Denmark has the highest OC incidence&#xD;
      rate in the Nordic countries. Today, more than 70% of women with OC are diagnosed with&#xD;
      advanced stage disease, where the five-year overall survival rate is 16-29% compared to&#xD;
      70-88% in early stages. Symptoms are often present months prior to diagnosis, however, they&#xD;
      are vague and un-specific of character leading to delay of diagnosis. Attempts to improve&#xD;
      patient awareness and correct symptom interpretation are encouraged. OC rates the fifth most&#xD;
      deadly cancer among women and causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female&#xD;
      reproductive system in more developed countries. Centralized treatment of OC9, OC&#xD;
      guidelines10, fast-track OC programs, and a gynecologic cancer database (Danish Gynecological&#xD;
      Cancer Database (DCGD)) are all national approaches that has contributed to a decreased&#xD;
      mortality rate in Denmark during the past decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet further approaches to improve OC survival are highly needed. Given that OC survival is&#xD;
      considerably better in early stage disease, methods to correctly differentiate benign ovarian&#xD;
      tumors from OC at an early stage is a high research priority. In Denmark, gynecologists&#xD;
      currently use the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) to detect women at high risk of OC. RMI&#xD;
      calculation is based on transvaginal ultrasound findings, serum Cancer Antigen 125 (CA125)&#xD;
      level, and menopausal status. Women in high risk of OC (RMI â‰¥ 200) are referred in the&#xD;
      national fast-track cancer program for further diagnostics at a tertiary center specialized&#xD;
      in gynecologic malignancies, whereas women in low risk of OC (RMI &lt; 200) can be observed or&#xD;
      treated at a local department of gynecology or in a gynecology practice. However, RMI is not&#xD;
      optimal to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors with a sensitivity of 92 %,&#xD;
      specificity of 82 %, negative predictive value of 97 %, and a positive predictive value of 62&#xD;
      % in a Danish population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the high prevalence of benign ovarian cysts in comparison to OC, it is of utmost&#xD;
      importance, that efforts to detect OC at an early stage is not accompanied by an unintended&#xD;
      increase of false positive tests, resulting in overdiagnosis and overtreatment. New promising&#xD;
      studies suggest an improvement in the diagnostics and risk assessment models by adding the&#xD;
      serum biomarker Human Epididymis protein 4 (HE4) and systemized ultrasound imaging in&#xD;
      accordance to the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biomarker HE4 is a secretory gluco-protein that is highly elevated especially in serum&#xD;
      from women with OC. The diagnostic performance of HE4 is equal to CA125 and improves further&#xD;
      when HE4 and CA125 is combined In the newly developed diagnostic Copenhagen Index (CPH-I),&#xD;
      HE4 is combined with age and CA125. On tertiary center data, CPH-I has shown to distinguish&#xD;
      benign gynecologic disease from OC significantly better than RMI in the international,&#xD;
      multicenter, validating cohort demonstrating an area-under-curve (AUC) at 0.951 and 0.935,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IOTA is an internationally accepted classification system for describing a pelvic mass; and&#xD;
      was developed by the IOTA group and published by Timmerman et al. in 2001. The classification&#xD;
      system is based on standardized definitions and terms regarding ultrasound morphological&#xD;
      features, doppler analysis, and presence/absence of ascites. Several promising models for&#xD;
      risk analysis of a pelvic mass (e.g. Logistic Regression 2 model, Simple Rules, ADNEX model)&#xD;
      have been developed based on the IOTA classification system. An increasing number of&#xD;
      gynecologists in Denmark are IOTA certified; however, IOTA has never been validated in a&#xD;
      Danish cohort and is not yet implemented . HE4, CPH-I, and the IOTA classification appear to&#xD;
      be more accurate in differentiating ovarian cysts. However, these methods all need further&#xD;
      prospective evaluations in the primary- and secondary sector before clinical implementation&#xD;
      in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to evaluate symptoms and the diagnostic performance of HE4, CPH-I and the IOTA&#xD;
      classification in Danish women diagnosed with an ovarian cyst. Furthermore, the aim is to&#xD;
      develop and validate an optimized diagnostic algorithm to differentiate benign ovarian cysts&#xD;
      from OC, based on symptoms, biomarkers, and IOTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and population: The study is a prospective, observational study. After oral and&#xD;
      written project information and consent is given, women are included by gynecologist from a&#xD;
      gynecology practice or a department of gynecology in the Capital Region of Denmark. Women&#xD;
      with ovarian cysts are eligible for study inclusion. Exclusion criteria are age &lt; 18 years&#xD;
      and unable to provide consent. We expect to include around 2.500 women in a period from&#xD;
      ultimo 2019 to May 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation: A preliminary power calculation was performed based on specificities of&#xD;
      RMI and CPH at 0.78 and 0.81, respectively. Sample size was estimated to 665 cases using a 2&#xD;
      sample non-inferiority or superiority calculation with type I error set at 1 %, power at&#xD;
      0.80, a non-inferiority or superiority margin of -0.1, and a sampling ratio of 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data: Included women will be asked to answer a questionnaire with detailed&#xD;
      information on health data and symptoms, that previously have been shown to be correlated to&#xD;
      a pelvic mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound: The ultrasound examination will be performed as part of the routine examination.&#xD;
      It is performed in lithotomy position, with an empty bladder, using a transvaginal probe and&#xD;
      high-end equipment. Ultrasound beam frequencies are set between 5.0 and 9.0 MHz, and the&#xD;
      internal female reproductive organs are systematically examined with transvaginal gray scale.&#xD;
      Doppler settings regarding pulse repetition frequency are fixed at 0.3 to 0.9 MHz, and color&#xD;
      gain is gradually increased until appearance of flash artifacts; followed by a frequency&#xD;
      decrease to a level, where slow flow in blood vessels is still visible when examining for&#xD;
      tumor vascularity. A transabdominal probe is also used when necessary. The ovarian cyst is&#xD;
      described by the gynecologist in accordance to IOTA terminology in the patient's medical&#xD;
      record. The definition of a lesion and how to classify, distinguish, and measure the&#xD;
      morphological features, including septae, solid tissue, papillary projections, regularity of&#xD;
      internal walls, cystic content, acoustic shadows, and ascites, are specifically defined by&#xD;
      the IOTA group.25 Furthermore, five specific ultrasound images per patient will be stored for&#xD;
      later validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling, biomarkers, and analyses: Blood sampling for HE4 analysis will be performed&#xD;
      as part of the routine examination in women tested for CA125. Blood sampling takes place at&#xD;
      the gynecology practice or at in- or out-hospital laboratories in the Capital Region. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected in 4-milliliter blood collection tubes. After sampling, the blood&#xD;
      is centrifuged and fractionated; and serum is extracted before analysis. After routine CA125&#xD;
      examination is made, serum will be safely stored in the Danish CancerBiobank (DCB), a part of&#xD;
      the Bio- and GenomeBank, Denmark (RBGB).26 Samples will be stored at -80 degrees Celsius&#xD;
      until batch analysis. Levels of HE4 will be quantitatively measured using Elecsys HE4 fully&#xD;
      automated chemiluminescent immuno-assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and storage: Information on symptoms and health care information will be&#xD;
      obtained from questionnaires answered by the patient. Information about routine diagnostics&#xD;
      and follow-up are is retrieved from the electronical patient files used in the gynecology&#xD;
      practice and departments of gynecology and Labka. Information on diagnosis is retrieved from&#xD;
      Patobank and Danish Gynecological Cancer Database (DGCD). Together with ultrasound images and&#xD;
      results from HE4 analyses, all data will be continuously transferred to an electronic&#xD;
      database as prescribed by the Capitol Region in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics of the study will be listed and compared between groups using the Chi&#xD;
      square test or the Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney test&#xD;
      for continuous variables. Categorical variables will be listed as numbers (n) and percentages&#xD;
      (%), whereas continuous variables will be listed in medians and ranges. P-values for the&#xD;
      differences will be calculated, and a p-value â‰¤ 0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPH-I is calculated using the formula defined by Karlsen et al.:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPH-I = - 14.0647 + 1.0649 x log 2 (HE4) + 0.6050 x log 2 (CA125) + 0.2672 x age / 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RMI is calculated by the formula by Jacobs et al.:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RMI = Menopause (yes=3 points; no=1 points) x ultrasonic findings (unilocular=0; bi- or&#xD;
      multilocular=1, solid areas=1, excrescences=1, bilateral=1, ascites=1, other ovarian&#xD;
      disease=1 --&gt; 0-1=1 points and 2-6=3 points) x CA125 (U/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to differentiate between healthy women, women with non-gynecologic disease,&#xD;
      benign gynecologic disease, and OC will be examined using univariate and multivariate&#xD;
      logistic regression analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of study results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All projects with positive, inconclusive, as well as negative results will be published in&#xD;
      international peer-reviewed scientific journals. The study group and other relevant&#xD;
      collaborators will be co-authors, if they meet the Vancouver criteria. Intellectual property&#xD;
      of the study belongs to the study group and can be shared after consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of the project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most ovarian cysts are benign and can be followed or surgically treated at the local&#xD;
      gynecology practice or department of gynecology. Sometimes, however, it can be challenging to&#xD;
      differentiate from OC with the diagnostic tools available. We expect to develop an optimized&#xD;
      diagnostic tool used to detect women in low risk of OC from women in high risk of OC with a&#xD;
      higher precision than existing risk models. Furthermore, the implementation of the DOC study&#xD;
      will contribute to a quality improvement in the daily clinical practice applying consistent&#xD;
      use of systematic ultrasound and standardized terminology in patient file templates.&#xD;
