  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subcutaneous Immunotherapy (allergy injections) is a potentially disease-modifying therapy&#xD;
      that is effective for the treatment of allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis, allergic asthma and&#xD;
      stinging insect hypersensitivity. Pain, which results from the irritation of nearby nerves is&#xD;
      a common concern of patients, particularly in children, during or after the injections. This&#xD;
      can be a stressful and negative experience for the children. There are various techniques&#xD;
      available to minimize pain in general. However, there is a lack of published research on how&#xD;
      to use these techniques in children receiving allergy injections. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate and compare the efficacy of the standard of care method (Ethyl Chloride/Pain&#xD;
      Ease Spray) and three non-pharmacological pain control devices (Buzzy Bee® I, Buzzy Bee II&#xD;
      and Shot Blocke®r) in decreasing the perception of pain during subcutaneous allergy injection&#xD;
      in a pediatric allergy/immunology clinic setting.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled study. Approximately 100 children, age 4 - 17 years, who are&#xD;
      currently receiving subcutaneous immunotherapy, will randomly select a blinded envelope which&#xD;
      assigns the distraction technique to be utilized during their study participation. There will&#xD;
      be 25 envelopes assigned to each study group for a total of 100 envelopes. Each envelope will&#xD;
      contain a paper with a colored sticker for the associated group assignment and number&#xD;
      sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distribution of group assignment by number sequence and color is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional Groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Shot Blocker® Number 1-25 (RED)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Buzzy I® (vibrating only) Number 26-50 (GREEN)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Buzzy II® (vibrating and ice wings) Number 51-75 (BLUE) Control Group&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ethyl Chloride/Pain Ease Spray Number 76-100 (YELLOW)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three interventional groups are currently marketed distraction devices. The control group&#xD;
      is the current clinical standard of care option for pre-allergy injection application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two visits. Both visits will be conducted during the participants&#xD;
      routine clinic visit for allergy injections. At the first visit the investigator will assess&#xD;
      eligibility. An overview of the study requirements will be provided to parent/child and&#xD;
      consent/assent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second visit, the child will be randomized to a distraction technique or standard&#xD;
      of care group to be utilized with the allergy injection(s) administered at this visit.&#xD;
      Adherence with institutional allergy injection guidelines will be maintained. Prior to the&#xD;
      application of the distraction method, the investigator will interview the parent to collect&#xD;
      data related to demographic information and their child's current allergy health and&#xD;
      treatment regime. The child's pain perception will be assessed before and after the allergy&#xD;
      injection. The parent's perception of their child's pain will be assessed after the allergy&#xD;
      injection. The investigator will provide information on the application of the randomized&#xD;
      method and will provide instruction on the completion of the pain scales and questionnaires.&#xD;
      The investigator and study staff will not indicate a method preference or guide the child or&#xD;
      parent with their pain level responses. After completion of the second visit, the child's&#xD;
      study participation is complete.&#xD;
