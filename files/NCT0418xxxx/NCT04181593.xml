    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OmegaD softgels for the&#xD;
      treatment of dry eye disease. A daily dose of 2 OmegaD softgels dosed orally BID will be&#xD;
      compared to 2 placebo softgels (mineral oil ) dosed orally BID for 84 days. Approximately 300&#xD;
      subjects will be evaluated for their signs and symptoms of dry eye disease and for safety&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation is a key component of dry eye disease. Increasing the systemic levels of omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acids relative to omega-6 levels can mediate immune responses. Evaluating whether&#xD;
      omega-3 supplementation can improve dry eye disease signs, symptoms and associated measures&#xD;
      of inflammation may present a new therapeutic option for dry eye disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of twice daily&#xD;
      (BID) dosing of OmegaD softgels in subjects with dry eye disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female subjects between 18 years and 90 years of age, with at least moderate ocular&#xD;
      surface disease (OSDI ≥ 20) dry eye symptoms and a clinical diagnosis of dry eye disease&#xD;
      supported by global clinical assessment will be screened and enrolled. Each subject must&#xD;
      have, in at least one eye, tear osmolarity of ≥ 312 mOsm/L and meibomian gland dysfunction as&#xD;
      defined by a grade of 1 or 2 on the meibomian orifice size scale at both Screening and&#xD;
      Baseline in at least one eye. In addition, Tear break up time (TBUT) must be ≤ 7 seconds in&#xD;
      both eyes at Screening and the Schirmer's test score in both eye(s) must be ≥ 5 mm at&#xD;
      Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 300 subjects will be randomized (1:1) to 1 of 2 treatment arms and treated for&#xD;
      84 days (12 weeks) with either OmegaD softgels; 2 softgels BID or placebo softgels; 2&#xD;
      softgels BID. The study will be double-masked with OmegaD and placebo being&#xD;
      identical-appearing softgels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will participate in safety and efficacy assessments throughout the study. Efficacy&#xD;
      assessments will include, tear osmolarity, meibomian gland dysfunction grading, TBUT,&#xD;
      Schirmer's Test, and dry eye symptoms based on the OSDI questionnaire, Safety assessments&#xD;
      will include, slit lamp examination and adverse events.&#xD;
