      Lower and upper extremities of 36 health subjects will be measured be trained experts to&#xD;
      collect measures for made-to-measure compression garments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fit of made-to-measure compression garments, which are not on the market yet, among healthy&#xD;
      subjects will be tested on one day, simulating daily activities. Fit will be assessed&#xD;
      directly after donning and after a wearing period of maximum 7 hours at the study site by&#xD;
      trained experts. Healthy subjects will give back study products at the end of the wearing&#xD;
      period. AEs will be documented throughout the study.&#xD;
