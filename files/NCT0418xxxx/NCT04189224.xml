    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, single-masked, crossover clinical trial. There are two study&#xD;
      lenses. Each lens will be dispensed for 3 ± 1 days and then an optimization visit will occur.&#xD;
      The final lens pair will be dispensed for 12 ± 2 days and the follow-up on the final lens&#xD;
      pair will occur. The second study lenses will then be fit and the above sequence repeated.&#xD;

    <measure>Binocular Contact Lens-Corrected Visual Performance Under Standard High Contrast Bright</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The contact lens-corrected visual performance on logMAR scale was evaluated binocularly under high luminance high contrast, dim luminance high contrast and high luminance low contrast conditions at 4 meters (distance), 64 cm (intermediate) and 40 cm (near) using ETDRS/reduced Guillon-Poling charts. A value of 0.0 logMAR equates to 20/20 vision on a Snellen Scale. Lower values indicate better visual performance. The average visual performance was reported for each lens type and distance.</description>

    <measure>Overall Vision Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Overall vision scores were assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, aged 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120.</description>

    <measure>Number of Grade 3 or Higher Slit Lamp Findings</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Slit Lamp Findings (SLF) were assessed using a biomicroscope and was graded using the FDA grading scale (Grade: 0, 1,2, 3 and 4) with grade 0 represents the absence of findings and 1 to 4 representing successively worse findings (i.e. Grade 1 = trace, Grade 2 = Mild, Grade 3 = moderate and Grade 4 = severe). Slit Lamp Findings were assessed at the 2-Week Follow-up. SLF is a binary response where Y=1 for at least one Grade 3 or 4 slit lamp finding. The number of eyes with SLF with grade 3 or higher by lens was reported.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Subjects That Reported Ocular Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Subject reported ocular symptoms were assessed using a questionnaire at the 2-week follow-up. Subjects were asked if they experienced any of the following symptoms: Burning/Stinging, Itchiness/Scratchiness, Dryness, Lens Awareness, Grittiness/Foreign Body Sensation, Redness, Irritation/Discomfort, Cloudy/Blurry/Hazy, Variable Vision and Other; using the scale of: None, Mild, Moderate and Severe. The proportion of subjects that reported symptoms (Mild, Moderate and Severe) was reported for each lens type.</description>

        <title>Binocular Contact Lens-Corrected Visual Performance Under Standard High Contrast Bright</title>
        <description>The contact lens-corrected visual performance on logMAR scale was evaluated binocularly under high luminance high contrast, dim luminance high contrast and high luminance low contrast conditions at 4 meters (distance), 64 cm (intermediate) and 40 cm (near) using ETDRS/reduced Guillon-Poling charts. A value of 0.0 logMAR equates to 20/20 vision on a Snellen Scale. Lower values indicate better visual performance. The average visual performance was reported for each lens type and distance.</description>

CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, aged 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Subjects That Reported Ocular Symptoms</title>
        <description>Subject reported ocular symptoms were assessed using a questionnaire at the 2-week follow-up. Subjects were asked if they experienced any of the following symptoms: Burning/Stinging, Itchiness/Scratchiness, Dryness, Lens Awareness, Grittiness/Foreign Body Sensation, Redness, Irritation/Discomfort, Cloudy/Blurry/Hazy, Variable Vision and Other; using the scale of: None, Mild, Moderate and Severe. The proportion of subjects that reported symptoms (Mild, Moderate and Severe) was reported for each lens type.</description>

        <title>Binocular Contact Lens-Corrected Visual Performance Under Standard High Contrast Dim With Goggles</title>
        <description>The contact lens-corrected visual performance on logMAR scale was evaluated binocularly under high luminance high contrast, dim luminance high contrast and high luminance low contrast conditions at 4 meters (distance), 64 cm (intermediate) and 40 cm (near) using ETDRS/reduced Guillon-Poling charts. A value of 0.0 logMAR equates to 20/20 vision on a Snellen Scale. Lower values indicate better visual performance. The average visual performance was reported for each lens type and distance.</description>
