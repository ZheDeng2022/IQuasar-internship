    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Jin-shui Huan-xian granule for&#xD;
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), establish the treatment scheme, and obtain the high&#xD;
      quality clinical evidences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive and ultimately fatal&#xD;
      interstitial lung disease. With worsened dyspnea and an increasing loss of pulmonary&#xD;
      function, IPF patients will have very poor quality of life. It has also brought an increasing&#xD;
      social-economic burden. Researches show that pirfenidone and nintedanib could be effective to&#xD;
      IPF, which were also recommended by the guideline. However, the application has been limited&#xD;
      by side effects and high prices. It is urgent to develop other effective treatments and&#xD;
      strategies to manage IPF. The investigators' previous studies shown that Jin-shui Huan-xian&#xD;
      granule could be effective to IPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicerter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of Jin-shui Huan-xian granule in reducinig the acute exacerbations, improving&#xD;
      exercise capacity, and delaying the disease progression for IPF. After a 2-week wash-out&#xD;
      period, 312 patients will be randomly assigned into treatment or control group for 52-week&#xD;
      treatment. The primary outcomes are frequencies of acute exacerbation, 6-minute walking test,&#xD;
      and percentage of patients with progression-free survival. The secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      pulmonary function, all-cause mortality, clinical symptoms, dyspnea score, and quality of&#xD;
      life. Safety will also be evaluated.&#xD;
