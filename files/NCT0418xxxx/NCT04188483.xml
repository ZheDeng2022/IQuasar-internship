    <textblock>
      The study is designed to assess whether selenium supplementation can boost the immunity&#xD;
      response to influenza vaccination in healthy adults. This is a randomized, prospective study&#xD;
      enrolling a total of 60 healthy subjects, 18-55 years old.&#xD;

      Background: Selenium is an essential trace element required for human health and wellbeing.&#xD;
      Despite mouse studies and human clinical trial suggest selenium supplementation might enhance&#xD;
      immunity, little is known for the effects of selenium supplementation on humoral immunity.&#xD;
      Vaccination is the most effective medical intervention to prevent infections and to reduce&#xD;
      disability and mortality associated with infectious disease. However, some individuals, in&#xD;
      healthy or disease conditions, mount less effective humoral immune responses to vaccination.&#xD;
      Therefore, new strategy to enhance humoral immunity upon vaccination is highly sought after.&#xD;
      Using mouse models, we have observed that selenium supplementation significantly increased&#xD;
      antigen-specific antibody responses. Thus, we hypothesize that selenium supplementation may&#xD;
      be beneficial in enhancing humoral immunity in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To investigate whether selenium supplementation will boost the humoral response&#xD;
      to influenza vaccination in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and trial size: This is a randomized prospective study. A total of 60 healthy&#xD;
      subjects, 18-55 years old, will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and duration: The enrolled subjects will be randomized into selenium&#xD;
      supplementation and control group. The selenium supplementation group will receive 200 μg&#xD;
      selenium daily by taking two selenium-enriched yeast tablets (SelenoPrecise®, Pharma Nord)&#xD;
      once daily for 60 days. The control group will not receive selenium supplementation. Thirty&#xD;
      days after allocation, both groups will receive standard seasonal influenza vaccination for&#xD;
      the 2019-2020 season. Peripheral blood samples will be collected at baseline (day 0, prior to&#xD;
      treatment), day 30, day 37 (7 days after vaccination) and day 60 (30 days after vaccination).&#xD;
