    <textblock>
      For several decades, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell trans-plantation (allo-HSCT) has&#xD;
      remained an important strategy in the management of patients with high-risk hematological&#xD;
      malignancies. The acceptance of umbilical cord blood (UCBT) and haploidentical grafts (Haplo)&#xD;
      as viable alternative donors for allo-HSCT has increased the options for patients with no&#xD;
      matched donors and now ensures that a donor can be identified for virtually all patients.&#xD;
      Relapsed disease is a principal threat to these patients and affects 30-50% of them. The&#xD;
      therapeutic options for these relapsing patients are diverse but remain largely ineffective&#xD;
      in altering their long-term outcomes. Therefore, pre-emptive treatment post allo-HSCT is&#xD;
      considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class II molecules are a family of molecules normally&#xD;
      found only on hematopoietic cells. cell-surface proteins are responsible for the regulation&#xD;
      of the immune system in humans and are important in disease defense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They are the major cause of organ transplant rejections. Different HLA-DPB1 alleles exist in&#xD;
      the general population. HLA-DPB1*04:01 is the most frequent (70.5%) while HLA-DPB1*02:01&#xD;
      represents 32% and HLA-DPB1*03:01 20%. In allo-HSCT, the donor and the recipient may express&#xD;
      different HLA-DPB1 molecules. HLA-DPB1 matching status has an impact on GVL (graft versus&#xD;
      leukemia) and GVHD. In recipients of HSCT, a match for DPB1 is associated with a&#xD;
      significantly increased risk of disease relapse, irrespective of the matching status of other&#xD;
      HLA molecules.. Therefore, one could anticipate that a mismatched of HLA class II could&#xD;
      induce a selective GVL reactivity without GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HLA-DP-expressing B cell and myeloid malignancies can be recognized and lysed by&#xD;
      HLA-DP-specific T cells. The majority of leukemic cells (Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Acute&#xD;
      Lymphoid Leukemia, Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia) express HLA-DP. A T cell clone recognizing&#xD;
      specifically HLA-DPB1*0401 has been developed as a permanent cell line This clone has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be able to kill HLA-DPB1*0401 positive leukemic cells. In addition, this&#xD;
      clone harbors a special suicide gene allowing the destruction of the clone in presence of a&#xD;
      specific anti-viral drug named ganciclovir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that infusion of a third party suicide gene-transduced T cell clone directed&#xD;
      against HLA-DPB1*401 might protect against possible relapse of hematological malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to inject iv escalating dose of a third party clone recognizing HLA-DPB1*04:01, 4&#xD;
      to 5 months following transplantation (when immunosuppressive drugs have been discontinued)&#xD;
      in patients HLA-DPB1*04:01 positive with a donor HLA-DPB1*04:01 negative to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility, toxicity, benefits of this immune intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale Despite graft-versus-tumor effect, relapse remains one of the main causes of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in allo-HSCT recipients. Forty to 50% of deaths following allo-HSCT&#xD;
      are due to disease relapse. In case of relapse, the prognosis is very poor and disease burden&#xD;
      remains a challenge for the use of adoptive cellular therapy alone. The 3 year overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) in case of post-transplant relapse is dismal. The post-transplant period is&#xD;
      characterized by a prolonged phase of immunodeficiency leading to increased vulnerability to&#xD;
      infections and risk of relapse. For this reason, maintenance or pre-emptive therapies for&#xD;
      patients in CR (complete remission) are now considered to prevent future relapse. Following&#xD;
      allo-HSCT, the recognition by donor T lymphocytes of recipient HLA antigens may result in&#xD;
      different consequences. On one side, T cells may recognize antigens present on malignant&#xD;
      cells and eradicate residual disease or prevent tumor relapse. On the other side, injection&#xD;
      of unselected T cells may induce a graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HLA-DPB1 is one of MHC class II molecule lying centromeric to other class II loci on&#xD;
      chromosome 6p21.3. Increase recombination events are found in the region between the HLA-DP&#xD;
      loci and other class II loci, explaining the relative lack of linkage disequilibrium (LD)&#xD;
      between HLA-DP (* HLA- DP: Human Leucocytes Antigen (DP allele))and the rest of MHC&#xD;
      haplotype. For this reason, it is difficult to find a donor matched for DPB1 in addition to&#xD;
      other classic HLA molecules. In sibling donors, the rate of incompatibility has been&#xD;
      estimated to be as high as 10.9% and in unrelated donors a mismatch rate can be up to 89%.&#xD;
      HLA-DPB1 is often not taken into consideration in donor selection. However HLA-DPB1 matching&#xD;
      status has an impact on GVL and GVHD. In recipients of HSCT, a match for DPB1 is associated&#xD;
      with a significantly increased risk of disease relapse, irrespective of the matching status&#xD;
      of other HLA molecules. HLA class II molecules expression is mainly restricted to&#xD;
      hematopoietic cells. Therefore, one could anticipate that a mismatched of HLA class II could&#xD;
      induce a selective GVL reactivity without GVHD. However, HLA class II expression can be&#xD;
      upregulated on various tissues following exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines with a risk&#xD;
      of GVHD as it is the case following some conditioning regimens or infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of the different HLA-DPB1 alleles in the general population is well known:&#xD;
      HLA-DPB1*04:01 is the most frequent (70.5%) HLA-DPB1*02:01 and and HLA-DPB1*03:01 represent&#xD;
      32% and 20% respectively. 96% of leukemic cells could potentially be targeted with only three&#xD;
      CTL clones directed against HLA-DPB1*04:01, 03:01 and 02:01.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HLA-DP-expressing B cell and myeloid malignancies can be recognized and lysed by&#xD;
      HLA-DP-specific CD4+ cells ( CD4+ : cluster of differentiation 4+). The majority of leukemic&#xD;
      cells (AML, ALL, CLL) express HLA-DP. CD4+ cytotoxic T cell (CTL) clones recognizing&#xD;
      specifically HLA-DPB1*04:01 can be identified and have been demonstrated to be able to kill&#xD;
      HLA-DPB1*04:01 positive leukemic cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it has already been shown that HLA-DP-specific CD4+ T cells can induce&#xD;
      graft-versus-leukemia reactivity in the presence or absence of graft-versus-host disease. In&#xD;
      this study the presence of HLA-DP-specific CD4+ T cells correlated with the clinical response&#xD;
      to DLI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The team of the Inserm unit 1232 (H. Vi√©, B. Clemenceau, both co-investigators of this&#xD;
      project) has developed a suicide gene-transduced CD4+ T cell clone that recognizes the&#xD;
      HLA-DPB1*401, which is the most frequent HLA-DPB1 allele expressed by leukemic blasts (70%).&#xD;
      This clone has been described in detailed in :&quot;The doubling potential of T lymphocytes allows&#xD;
      clinical-grade production of a bank of genetically modified monoclonal T-cell populations&quot; by&#xD;
      Vivien R et al. Cytotherapy. 2018 Mar;20(3):436-452.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical trials have evaluated the possibility to inject, following allo-HSCT, donor&#xD;
      lymphocytes transduced with a suicide gene either to treat tumor relapse or to accelerate the&#xD;
      immune reconstitution. No acute infusion-related toxicity has been reported. Ganciclovir was&#xD;
      used in some patients to control GVHD, leading to a rapid elimination of TK+ cells (tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase +).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clone was obtained by performing a mixed lymphocytes culture (MLR) between two&#xD;
      populations differing only by HLA-DP, and subsequently by transducing reactive T cells with&#xD;
      high efficiency, and finally cloning them directly, before selecting each clone for the&#xD;
      desired characteristics. Thanks to a clinical grade Herpes-simplex-virus-TK vector, the clone&#xD;
      harbors a suicide gene and can be killed in presence of ganciclovir (GCV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clone presents several important characteristics in terms of efficiency and safety. The&#xD;
      clone is stable following thawing. It can be grown and amplified in vitro following thawing&#xD;
      (at least more than one million times), while maintaining its cytotoxic capacity. It produces&#xD;
      TH1-type cytokines in large amounts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the safety of the CTL antiDP under study, we emphasized on two major points:&#xD;
      Specificity and sensitivity to ganciclovir:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specificity. The clone is specific for HLA-DPB1*04:01. The clone was selected against a donor&#xD;
      homozygous for HLA-DPB1*04:01 (and identical for HLA-A, B, C, DQ, DR). Specificity testing&#xD;
      confirmed the recognition of HLA-DPB1*:04:01. Yet, HLA-DPB1 alleles described are numerous&#xD;
      (447 proteins to date IMGT (ImMunoGeneTics database)/HLA release,&#xD;
      www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/index.html), and it is just impossible to anticipate the cross reactions&#xD;
      exhaustively (beyond some against HLA-DPB1*04:02 and HLA-DPB1*05:01 that have been observed&#xD;
      against particular cell lines). The risk, since we are in a context of allo-HSCT, would be&#xD;
      the recognition of donor cells and thus a possibility of graft rejection. For this reason, we&#xD;
      will perform a pre-inclusion testing where donor cells will be used as targets for the clone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity to ganciclovir (GCV) : The proliferation tests in the presence of GCV confirms&#xD;
      the efficacy of GCV with sufficient margin according to GCV blood levels reached during a&#xD;
      conventional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from our colleagues show a low number of T cells detectable during the first months&#xD;
      post-transplant, with a relative increased of Treg cells meaning that the clone may not be&#xD;
      eliminated rapidly by donor T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reasons to administer a suicide gene-transduced CD4+ T cell clone recognizing&#xD;
      HLA-DPB1*04:01 following allogeneic transplantation can be summarized in the following points&#xD;
      :&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Relapse of the hematological malignancy remains a serious concern in these types of&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. The immune reconstitution is very delayed allowing for injection of a third party T cell&#xD;
      clone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. In case of GVHD following the CTL infusion, the CTL clone can be rapidly eliminated using&#xD;
      ganciclovir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis We hypothesize that the infusion of a third party suicide gene-transduced T cell&#xD;
      clone directed against HLA-DPB1*04:01 following allogeneic transplantation can be safe and&#xD;
      might protect against possible relapse of hematological malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed description of the methodology (number of necessary subjects) Patients candidate for&#xD;
      allogeneic transplantation who are both HLA-DPB1*04:01 and with aHLA-DPB1*04:01-expressing&#xD;
      hematological malignancy (almost 100% of cases) with a donor HLA-DPB1*04:01 negative, will be&#xD;
      proposed to receive one single infusion of the T cell clone at 4-5 months&#xD;
      post-transplantation, once the immunosuppression by cyclosporine and/or mycophenolate mofetil&#xD;
      has been discontinued. The expression of HLA-DPB1* by tumor cells will be checked by&#xD;
      cytometry or immunohistochemistry. Any possible cross-reactivity of the clone against donor&#xD;
      cells will also be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard 3 + 3 phase 1 dose-escalation study will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level 1: 1 x 104 cells/kg of recipient, Level 2: 5 x 104 cells/kg, Level 3: 25 x 104&#xD;
      cells/kg, Level 4: 50 x 104 cells/kg, Level 5: 100 x 104 cells/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditioning regimens : no restriction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of DLI in case of mixed chimerism or relapse is permitted after the clone infusion if&#xD;
      necessary. In case of acute GVHD post CTL clone infusion, ganciclovir will be administered&#xD;
      (at the dose of 5 mg/kg twice daily) for 14 days.&#xD;
