  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to many vascular branches on the supra-hepatic vena cava (SHVC) and infra-hepatic vena&#xD;
      cava (IHVC), in the whole procedures of preparation of liver donation, preparation of hepatic&#xD;
      vena cava (HVC) is the most key and troublesome step. Magnetic Spiderman (MS) is a novel&#xD;
      surgical instrument, designed and created to solve the vital problems of preparation of liver&#xD;
      donation's HVC. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and security&#xD;
      of MS when using it prepare the liver donation's HVC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      From January 1 2020 to June 30 2020, after inclusion and exclusion, donors' livers will be&#xD;
      divided to MS group and manual (MA) group. In MS group, MS grips the SHVC and IHVC,&#xD;
      respectively. MS's magnets are adsorbed on the wall of the basin and MS can pull the HVC&#xD;
      accordingly. By changing the position of MS on the wall of the basin, the attending can&#xD;
      expose the surgical field that make the operation convenient. In MA group, assistants use&#xD;
      vessel forceps to pull the HVC according to the attending's requirements. In both groups,&#xD;
      right adrenal vein, phrenic veins and other branches of the HVC are isolated and ligated,&#xD;
      then SHVC and IHVC where MS's clamps gripped are cut off. After preparation, the SHVC and&#xD;
      IHVC remain at least 1.5 cm. Excess diaphragms are removed. Outcomes of two groups are&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;
