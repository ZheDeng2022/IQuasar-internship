  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      How does oesophageal atresia/trache-oesophageal fistula affect feeding and swallowing in the&#xD;
      first year of life?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 150 babies a year are born with oesophageal atresia and/or trache-oesophageal&#xD;
      atresia. Oesophageal atresia occurs when the oesophagus (food pipe) fails to join up during&#xD;
      early foetal development. Trache-oesophageal fistula describes an abnormal connection that&#xD;
      forms between the oesophagus and trachea (wind pipe). When the baby feeds, milk cannot pass&#xD;
      into the stomach but can pass into the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is needed within the first few days of life and is extremely successful, with 90-95%&#xD;
      of babies surviving. However, approximately 50-80% of babies will have ongoing feeding or&#xD;
      swallowing difficulties resulting in choking, chest infections and pneumonia. They can also&#xD;
      lead to food refusal, distress at mealtimes and parental anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is limited understanding of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the exact nature of the feeding and swallowing difficulties&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the risk factors for developing difficulties&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the impact on parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will address these issues through two complimentary projects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project 1: A study of swallow physiology Babies with oesophageal atresia and/or&#xD;
      trache-oesophageal fistula who have surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital will be invited&#xD;
      to have a detailed swallow assessment using videofluoroscopy (video x-ray) and high&#xD;
      resolution impedance manometry (a pressure monitor) at 2-4 months of age and at 8-12 months&#xD;
      of age. Results will be compared to parent report of feeding at 1 year old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project 2: A study of the impact on parental well-being This study will be carried out in&#xD;
      conjunction with the 'TOFS' support group. A Facebook page will be used to carry out an&#xD;
      online forum. Parents of any child who has had TOF/OA will be invited to share their&#xD;
      experiences of establishing feeding. This information will be used to develop a questionnaire&#xD;
      to look at how wide-ranging these experiences are.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is made up of two standalone projects (described as work packages), the results of&#xD;
      which will be combined to describe feeding and swallowing difficulties seen in children born&#xD;
      with OA/TOF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work package one: Prospective cohort study This study will follow a group of children (a&#xD;
      cohort) born with OA/TOF through their first year of life. At Great Ormond Street Hospital&#xD;
      all children with OA/TOF have swallow assessments but not all have the same assessments at&#xD;
      the same time. Therefore, using information from hospital records is not a reliable or useful&#xD;
      way of learning about swallowing in this group. Children taking part in the cohort study will&#xD;
      have two assessments; one at 2-4 months and one at 8-10 months of age. They will be followed&#xD;
      up when they are 12 months old to see what and how they are eating and drinking. This will&#xD;
      provide detailed information about how swallowing works and how it relates to what a child&#xD;
      eats and drinks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the planned cohort is small, the data collected will be the first of its kind. The&#xD;
      investigators will use a new type of swallow assessment, called high resolution impedance&#xD;
      manometry (HRIM). The study will also allow us to explore how useful and feasible this test&#xD;
      is. Results of this study can be used to help design future, larger studies of swallowing in&#xD;
      TOF/OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What will participating involve? For each swallow assessment children will have a half day&#xD;
      hospital visit. The assessment will involve our current 'gold standard' test called a&#xD;
      videofluoroscopy/barium swallow and the new test, HRIM. There will be a telephone review at&#xD;
      one year of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High resolution impedance manometry will compare the swallowing of the OA/TOF cohort with&#xD;
      data that has already been collected from children with 'normal' swallowing. This will give&#xD;
      new information about:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differences in swallow muscle pressures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differences in the coordination of muscle movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How these differences effect the movement of food and fluid through the throat and food&#xD;
           pipe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HRIM will be carried out alongside a videofluoroscopy/barium swallow. Videofluoroscopy/barium&#xD;
      swallow is the most commonly used swallow assessment in children. It will be used to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the timing and coordination of swallowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify any anatomical differences that may be causing swallowing difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give information from our current 'gold standard' swallow assessment to compare with the&#xD;
           new information available from HRIM. This will help us understand whether both&#xD;
           assessments are needed in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No previous research has investigated whether swallowing changes over time in children born&#xD;
      with OA/TOF. By carrying out assessments at 2-4 months and 8-10 months the investigators&#xD;
      will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be able to assess milk drinking and weaning foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate whether swallow pressures change over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether it is important to assess children more than once. The final part of&#xD;
           this study will involve the family completing a food diary at home for three days when&#xD;
           their child is one year old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a simple paper diary on which the parent notes what their child eats and drinks,&#xD;
           how long the meal took and whether they had any difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For example, breakfast: 1 weetabix with mashed banana and milk, Â½ cup of water, took 25&#xD;
           mins. Ate easily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The food diary is returned by post or through the MyGOSH app (parent portal of the&#xD;
           hospital notes system) to the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once completed a telephone call will be used to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clarify the food diary entries to ensure they are understood by the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Get the most recent weight and height.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ask whether the child has had any chest infections since the last assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ask whether the child has been admitted to hospital since the last assessment. The&#xD;
           telephone call is expected to take up to 15-30 minutes. If the parent is in agreement,&#xD;
           results of all the assessments will be shared with the appropriate hospital and&#xD;
           community healthcare teams to inform clinical care and optimise the support given around&#xD;
           eating and drinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the swallow assessments Videofluoroscopy data will be analysed using a protocol&#xD;
      that has been used in previous research (McGrattan et al, 2018; McGrattan et al, 2019). It&#xD;
      involves detailed analysis of 11 components of the child's swallow. High resolution impedance&#xD;
      manometry data will be analysed using online software called 'swallow gateway'. The data are&#xD;
      uploaded anonymously. The software is free to use. This will provide information on 17&#xD;
      components of the upper part of the swallow (mouth and throat) and 14 components of the lower&#xD;
      part of the swallow (food pipe).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the swallowing data will be summarised using averages, counts and percentages. Given the&#xD;
      number of children in the study the investigators will not carry out statistical analysis&#xD;
      that would infer the results are applicable to all children with OA/TOF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work package two: a mixed methods study of parent experience This study will investigate the&#xD;
      impact that establishing feeding has on parents. The first part of the study will use an&#xD;
      online forum (via Facebook) to understand the issues parents face when they are helping their&#xD;
      child learn to feed. This will include breast or bottle feeding, moving on to pureed or&#xD;
      weaning foods and then moving on to family foods. The information gained from the forum will&#xD;
      be used to design a questionnaire. The questionnaire will give a deeper understanding of how&#xD;
      common these issues are, whether there are factors that make the impact on parents more or&#xD;
      less significant and whether there are time points that are particularly challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online forum&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years online social networks have become increasingly important sources of support&#xD;
      for parents of children with and without health needs. They provide a quick and easy means of&#xD;
      asking questions and sharing opinions and ideas. Previous research has found that carrying&#xD;
      out an online forum is a successful way of understanding parents experiences (Wray et al,&#xD;
      2018). It is good for parents of children with health needs for a number of reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents can participate at a time and in a place convenient to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants do not have to answer every question. Therefore, parents can give as much&#xD;
           or as little time as they wish or are able.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents do not have to travel anywhere to take part. This means that people in&#xD;
           geographically remote places can participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents do not need additional childcare to take part.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is a familiar format. Many parents are used to asking or responding to questions in&#xD;
           this way. Previous research has found participants find an online forum a comfortable&#xD;
           place to share information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants to influence the direction of discussion, arguably ensuring that the issues&#xD;
           explored are those most important to those taking part, reducing the risk of researcher&#xD;
           bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online forum will be conducted using a method described by Wray et al (2018). It will be&#xD;
      carried out in conjunction with the 'TOFS', the UK support group for OA/TOF via their&#xD;
      existing Facebook page. A separate 'closed' group will be created specifically for the&#xD;
      purposes of the research project. The forum will be moderated by the 'TOFS' administration&#xD;
      team for an agreed fee of Â£750. This administrator will be responsible for all day-to-day&#xD;
      running and moderation of the forum in line with a standard operating procedure developed in&#xD;
      collaboration with the research team. This will include processes for managing inappropriate&#xD;
      or offensive messaging and distressed users as well as procedures for running the forum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions and a probing guide will be generated from available literature, topics raised by&#xD;
      public involvement activities and with the study steering group, comprising three parents, a&#xD;
      Dietitian, a Speech and Language Therapist, a Surgeon and a specialist Nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions will be put to the forum one at a time with the order and probing determined by the&#xD;
      responses received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Each week a full transcript will be sent by the forum moderator to the research&#xD;
      team. They will ensure the responses are anonymous by replacing names with a study number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the forum is complete the data will be analysed using a process called thematic&#xD;
      analysis. This involves:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data familiarisation: identification of interesting or significant points&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data coding: a summary of the point being made&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Integration of similar codes into categories&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Integration of categories into over-arching themes&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Consensus discussion to reach agreed themes This process will be conducted by three&#xD;
           members of the research team and a parent representative to ensure the influence of&#xD;
           researcher bias is minimised. These themes will be used to develop a questionnaire to&#xD;
           explore the prevalence of the issues raised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire A questionnaire will be developed from the themes identified in the online&#xD;
      forum to understand how common these issues are in parents of children aged 0-5 years and&#xD;
      whether there are critical time points. It will target a larger number of parents than the&#xD;
      online forum. Questionnaire development requires results from the online forum, therefore an&#xD;
      amendment will be submitted in the future for approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to use questionnaires that capture the themes within the online forum&#xD;
      that have already been developed and validated. For example, questionnaires about parental&#xD;
      anxiety or mealtime behaviours. The project steering group will review the possible&#xD;
      questionnaires. Discussion of relevance and importance will be combined with ease of&#xD;
      completion to inform final questionnaire selection. In the absence of a suitable&#xD;
      questionnaire to capture an important theme, specific questions will be developed. The&#xD;
      questionnaires will be piloted to make sure they are readable, not too lengthy and as easy to&#xD;
      complete as possible. Following advice from parents questionnaires will be online and mobile&#xD;
      optimised. A paper version will be made available if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information regarding the child's age, medical conditions, feeding method (oral or tube),&#xD;
      household members and access to formal and informal support services accessed will be&#xD;
      collected. Names will not be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How will the information be analysed? Analysis will be finalised once the questionnaires are&#xD;
      selected. Statistical analysis to understand the importance of a child's age, diagnosis and&#xD;
      access to support is expected.&#xD;
