      This study compares two oral medications (tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid) as&#xD;
      hemostatic agent administered in patients undergoing primary total hip replacement&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the aging population, the incidence of joint osteoarthritis is rising. Total hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most common surgeries used for the treatment of end-stage&#xD;
      degenerative hip disease, which is almost always accompanied by joint pain, deformity and&#xD;
      motor dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few articles have compared TXA and ε-ACA in joint arthroplasties. Whether ε-ACA has&#xD;
      comparable hemostatic effects compared with TXA is unknown. A recent systematic review&#xD;
      compared the effectiveness of TXA versus ε-ACA administered intravenously as a hemostatic&#xD;
      agent in patients who had undergone a TKA and THR, and the results showed that the total&#xD;
      blood loss was greater in the ε-ACA groups, but no significant differences between the two&#xD;
      groups regarding transfusion rates were identified (Liu et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding oral administration, two clinical trials compared the use of oral TXA versus&#xD;
      intravenous and topical in patients who had undergone THA, reaching the conclusion that if&#xD;
      efficiency, safety, and cost are considered the main crucial parameters during the evaluation&#xD;
      of TXA administration methods, oral TXA stands as an efficacious, safe, and low-cost method&#xD;
      to reduce blood loss after THA compared with the IV and topical forms. Additionally,&#xD;
      considering the ease of drug administration in the tablet form, oral TXA appears to represent&#xD;
      a superior mode of administration than IV and topical TXA (Kayupov et al., 2017; Luo et al.,&#xD;
      2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's work team previously published a randomized controlled clinical trial in&#xD;
      which it prospectively compared blood loss, transfusion rate and complications similar to&#xD;
      this study but in total primary knee replacement, finding no differences with respect to any&#xD;
      of the parameters studied except for the adverse effects, which were greater for the group&#xD;
      that received tranexamic acid, this study was the first to compare the oral administration of&#xD;
      these two medications in the field of orthopedics (Morales-Avalos et al., 2019) and the&#xD;
      present protocol wants to do it now in the total primary hip replacement which is well known&#xD;
      to be associated with greater blood loss than total knee replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: There are no significant differences in blood loss (total blood loss, external&#xD;
      blood loss, hidden blood loss, intraoperative blood loss and drainage output), transfusion&#xD;
      index, complications and hemoglobin/hematocrit levels in patients undergoing total hip&#xD;
      prostheses treated with tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General objectives To compare the effect of oral aminocaproic acid as a hemostatic agent&#xD;
      against oral tranexamic acid administered preoperatively and postoperatively in patients&#xD;
      undergoing elective surgery of total hip replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Selection and randomization of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Performing total hip replacement surgery and administration of AAC or AXA according to&#xD;
           randomization and the methodology established in this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Establishment of a protocol for the administration of aminocaproic acid orally for its&#xD;
           use as a hemostatic agent in elective surgery of total hip replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determination of total blood loss, external blood loss, hidden blood loss, transfusion&#xD;
           index, decrease in hemoglobin/hematocrit levels, drainage volume, intrahospital stay,&#xD;
           analogous visual scale and SF-12 scale between tranexamic acid and the aminocaproic&#xD;
           acid, both orally, in each group in the pre-operatively, trans operatively and&#xD;
           post-operatively established times and compare them statistically.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Determine and record the possible complications and side effects observed with the use&#xD;
           of both drugs included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Determine the cost and monetary savings associated with the administration of each drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Comparison and statistical analysis of the results between the study groups.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Two study groups will be generated, each consisting of 45 research subjects, randomly each recipient will receive 3 doses of one of the two study drugs (tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid). The group to which the patient belongs will be assigned through a computer program, the patient will not know to which group he belongs or what medication he will receive.

    <masking_description>Prior to being included in the study, the patient will be mentioned the times when he will receive the medication as well as the dosage of administration. The patient will not know what medication is being administered to him / her. The pills will be given to the patient in a medicine cup without access to any information legend. In the same way, the medication will be administered by a doctor outside the research protocol and will not participate in any other phase of the study so that no member of the research team will know what medication was administered.</masking_description>

Hb below 10 g/dl in patients with poor clinical tolerance of lower values was also an indication for transfusion.
