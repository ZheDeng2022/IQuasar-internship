    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the potential interventions of exercises in adults&#xD;
      with sickle cell anemia (SCA) and cardiopulmonary disease; only including the more severe&#xD;
      genotypes of sickle cell disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that affects approximately 100,000 people&#xD;
      in the United States. People living with sickle cell disease have numerous complications that&#xD;
      cause significant morbidity and mortality such as painful episodes of vasoocclusion, acute&#xD;
      chest syndrome, stroke, end organ damage, and early death. Unfortunately, their lifespan&#xD;
      remains markedly shorter than the general population and this had not dramatically changed in&#xD;
      the last 2 decades. Adults, are now not dying primarily from infections and sickle cell&#xD;
      disease related complications, but cardiopulmonary disease is a leading cause of death. The&#xD;
      etiology of cardiopulmonary disease in sickle cell disease is unclear but studies suggest&#xD;
      that microvascular hypoxia, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction play a major role in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis. In the general population, exercise reduces cardiovascular complications,&#xD;
      pulmonary exacerbations, and decreases cardiovascular death. However, exercise used as&#xD;
      primary or secondary prevention in sickle cell disease for cardiopulmonary disease has not&#xD;
      been explored. Evidence shows that exercise in sickle cell disease can decrease oxidative&#xD;
      stress, lower blood viscosity, and increase nitric oxide levels in both human and mouse&#xD;
      models, but there remains some concern that high-intensity training in sickle cell disease&#xD;
      may trigger vaso-occlusive crisis and adverse outcomes. However, multiple recent studies show&#xD;
      that moderate intensity exercise can be safely performed in adults with sickle cell disease.&#xD;
      Currently, providers lack evidence-based knowledge to inform the quantity and quality of&#xD;
      regular exercise training that is safe but also improves cardiovascular outcomes in sickle&#xD;
      cell disease. In addition, data does not exist on the feasibility and adherence of home-based&#xD;
      training regimens in adults with sickle cell disease. Only one study has explored the&#xD;
      feasibility and adherence in children. This study will be a qualitative assessment of&#xD;
      potential interventions of exercises in adults with sickle cell anemia, only including the&#xD;
      more severe genotypes of sickle cell disease.&#xD;
