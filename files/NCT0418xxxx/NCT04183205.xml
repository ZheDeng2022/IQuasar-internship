  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to examine the effectiveness of a brief screening method that may&#xD;
      predict which people with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are most likely to show a&#xD;
      positive response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications. Participants&#xD;
      will be recruited over approximately 3.25 years, until at least 94 participants complete the&#xD;
      17 week study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are prescribed to approximately 60% of&#xD;
      Veterans with PTSD treated within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). However, many&#xD;
      patients are not responsive to SSRIs. Currently, there is no way to determine whether a&#xD;
      particular patient will benefit from an SSRI; treatment is primarily accomplished through&#xD;
      'trial and error' over several weeks or months. The overarching goal of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the pre-treatment usefulness of a simple electrophysiological test for predicting&#xD;
      the likelihood of a favorable response to an SSRI. This study will investigate whether a&#xD;
      brief pre-treatment auditory event-related potentials procedure [referred to going forward as&#xD;
      &quot;Loudness Dependence of Auditory Evoked Potentials&quot; (LDAEP)] offers a means for predicting&#xD;
      treatment response to an SSRI for men and women diagnosed with PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has four aims: 1) To determine the strength of the relationship between LDAEP and&#xD;
      clinical response to SSRI treatment. 2) To determine LDAEP cut-off values that would enable&#xD;
      clinicians to make individualized SSRI treatment recommendations. 3) To assess the&#xD;
      reliability of LDAEP and the usefulness of change in LDAEP as an objective measure of SSRI&#xD;
      response. 4) Exploratory: To determine whether the relationship between LDAEP and clinical&#xD;
      response to sertraline differs between men and women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Means to Protect Subjects' Identities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure confidentiality, questionnaire and interview data will be stored in locked filing&#xD;
      cabinets within locked offices. Each participant will have his or her own participant number&#xD;
      and these numbers will be the only means by which participant information can be identified.&#xD;
      Electronic data will be stored on a secure private, password-protected drive that can only be&#xD;
      accessed by members of the study team and labeled only with the participant number. One list&#xD;
      of names and participant numbers will be kept on a private, password-protected computer&#xD;
      account on a separate drive from the de-identified data and accessible only to the study&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADMINISTRATION OF DRUGS IN RESEARCH NOT FUNDED BY NIH Description Of Identification Of Drug:&#xD;
      SERTRALINE. Because the goal of this study is to identify pre-treatment predictors of SSRI&#xD;
      response that ultimately could be used in routine clinical care, the investigators designed&#xD;
      the study with ecological validity in mind. Specifically, the investigators chose sertraline&#xD;
      as the study medication because it is: a) the most commonly prescribed SSRI in the US, b) one&#xD;
      of only two FDA-approved drugs for treating PTSD, and c) one of the two most effective SSRIs&#xD;
      for major depression, a common comorbidity with PTSD. Dosing will follow clinical practice&#xD;
      guidelines, i.e., doses will be chosen based on clinical response and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description Of Administration Of Drug: The investigators are using an approach , which&#xD;
      represents enhanced clinical care in that participants discuss medication levels, side&#xD;
      effects, and symptoms with a psychiatrist every two weeks. Study medication and placebo will&#xD;
      be stored and distributed by VA Boston Pharmacy service.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants will be unaware of whether or not they are on placebo or sertraline at any given moment and the placebo and sertraline capsules look identical.

    <measure>Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at screening session 1, and weeks 0, 2, 6, and 14</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS-5 is the &quot;gold standard&quot; clinical interview for assessing PTSD. This measure will be used to characterize the sample regarding PTSD diagnosis and as a measure of PTSD severity. Each of the 20 symptoms of PTSD included in DSM-5 is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0-4, with a 0 or 1 indicating that the symptom is absent or subthreshold and a score of 2-4 indicating that a symptom has reached the threshold to be included as a symptom and ranges in severity from moderate to extreme. The total range of the CAPS-5 is 0-80.</description>

    <measure>Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology- Self Report (QIDS-SR) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at screening session 1, and weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS-SR will be used to measure the severity of depressive symptoms. The QIDS provides equivalent weightings (0-3) for each symptom item, gives clearly stated anchors that estimate the frequency and severity of symptoms, and includes all items required to diagnose a major depressive episode.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at weeks 0, 2, 6 and 14</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D is the most widely used clinician-administered scale for assessing severity of depression symptoms. The 6-item unidimensional core Melancholia subscale of the HAM-D will be used as the primary depression outcome variable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at screening session 1, and weeks 0, 2, 6, and 14</time_frame>
    <description>DASS-21 is a 21-item measure that assesses the severity of a range of symptoms common to depression, anxiety, and stress. The total score can be used as a measure of general distress or depression, anxiety, and stress subscales can be scored separately.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at screening session 1, and weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item measure that assesses DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD. Participants will rate how much they experienced each symptom on a 5-point Likert-type scale (0 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 = &quot;extremely&quot;) during the past week (total range=0-80). The PCL-5 will be anchored to participants' worst traumatic event. In addition to the administration of these measures during the four assessment sessions, the PCL-5 will also be administered bi-weekly at each psychiatrist check-in visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at screening session 1, and weeks 0, 2, 6, and 14</time_frame>
    <description>The PANAS consists of two, 10-item mood scales that measure positive (e.g., 'enthusiastic') and negative (e.g., 'upset') affect separately.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at screening session 1, and weeks 0, 2, 6, and 14</time_frame>
    <description>SCL-90-R measures the following nine primary psychiatric symptom dimensions: somatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism. The Global Severity Index (GSI) is the average rating given to all 90 items and provides a measure of general psychopathology.</description>

Thereafter, sertraline will be increased flexibly by 25 to 50 mg per day (at a rate no higher than 50 mg per week) to achieve a total daily dose of 50 to 200 mg, based on clinical response and tolerability, with a maximum dose of 200 mg/d. Subjects unable to tolerate higher doses may be dropped back to the previous dose and remain at that dose for the remainder of the study.</description>
