  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is evaluating a drug called BT5528 alone and in combination with&#xD;
      nivolumab in participants with advanced solid tumors that are identified as positive for&#xD;
      EphA2 expression. The main goals of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Find the recommended dose of BT5528 that can be given safely to participants alone and&#xD;
           in combination with nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about the side effects of BT5528&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about BT5528 therapy alone and in combination with nivolumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BT5528 consists of a bicyclic peptide (BicycleÂ®) which binds to EphA2, and is covalently&#xD;
      attached to a spacer and a protease cleavable peptide linker attached to MMAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase I/II multi-center, open-label trial will evaluate BT5528 administered once-weekly&#xD;
      as a single agent and in combination with nivolumab. The Phase I portion is a dose escalation&#xD;
      primarily designed to assess the safety and tolerability of BT5528 and to determine a&#xD;
      recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). Following selection of a recommended Phase II dose (RP2D),&#xD;
      a dose expansion portion will be initiated with the primary objective of evaluating the&#xD;
      clinical activity of BT5528.&#xD;
