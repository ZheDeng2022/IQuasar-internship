  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how effective the study drugs, nivolumab (also known&#xD;
      as Opdivo®) and talazoparib (also known as Talzenna®) are when given as a combination&#xD;
      treatment for unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The study team wants to know the&#xD;
      effectiveness of these drugs together in treating cancer than if each study drug was given by&#xD;
      itself.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single arm, multi-institutional, open label trial in a sample size of 37&#xD;
      primary or recurrent, unresectable or metastatic melanoma patients progressed on prior&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor therapy with germline or somatic mutations in BRCA1/2 or BRCA-ness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the clinical efficacy of nivolumab plus&#xD;
      talazoparib in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRCA1/2 or other DNA&#xD;
      damage repair mutations (defined as BRCA-ness)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives and their endpoints include progression free survival (PFS) defined as&#xD;
      time from first dose of treatment until disease progression, treatment related adverse&#xD;
      events, anti-tumor activity , and immune-related progression free survival (irPFS).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known symptomatic brain metastases requiring steroids. Patients with previously&#xD;
             diagnosed brain metastases are eligible if they have completed their treatment and&#xD;

             P-gp inducer (avasimibe, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, and St. John's wort), or&#xD;
             inhibitor of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) (curcumin, cyclosporine,&#xD;
             elacridar [GF120918], and eltrombopag).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to swallow capsules or known intolerance to talazoparib or its excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because animal studies have demonstrated&#xD;
             that nivolumab and talazoparib may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant&#xD;
             women. Breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because nivolumab and&#xD;
             talazoparib may be excreted in human breastmilk and the potential for serious adverse&#xD;
             reactions in nursing infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy &gt; Grade 1.&#xD;
