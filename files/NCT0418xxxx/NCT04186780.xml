  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The daily change in population routine has stimulated the development of health beneficial&#xD;
      value added products. Lentinula edodes (Shiitake) is a mushroom with high protein&#xD;
      concentration, low lipid content, rich in fiber, minerals, vitamins, antioxidant compounds,&#xD;
      β-glucans and chitosan. This is clinical study phase II, randomized, double-blind for analyze&#xD;
      in the effect of eating Shiitake bars on cholesterolemia and oxidative stress levels in&#xD;
      individuals with borderline cholesterol. Individuals with at least one of the following&#xD;
      biochemical markers (total cholesterol, LDL or triglycerides) at the borderline level were&#xD;
      recruited through online questionnaire. Individuals (n = 68) were randomly allocated to two&#xD;
      groups (Group I - Shiitake free bar (n = 32); Group II - Shiitake bar (n = 36). Each&#xD;
      individual underwent blood collection at 0, 33 and 66 days, and received an unidentified&#xD;
      opaque bag containing the bars.Biochemical analyzes (triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL,&#xD;
      HDL and glucose) and oxidative stress markers (Catalase, GSH and TBARS) were performed on&#xD;
      samples of individuals.&#xD;

      Study design The primary outcome of the study was cholesterolemia, as assessed by total&#xD;
      cholesterol levels, triglycerides or low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density&#xD;
      lipoproteins (HDL). The secondary outcomes included blood glucose, Body Mass Index (BMI) and&#xD;
      oxidative stress biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective Phase II, randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled trial was conducted&#xD;
      from September 2018 to December 2018. The study accomplished at University of Sorocaba&#xD;
      (UNISO), São Paulo State, Brazil. The study was approved (Annex D) by Human Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committee from University of Sorocaba (protocol number 2.824.297), in accordance with&#xD;
      Resolution 466/2012 of the National Health Council (BRASIL, 2012) and Research Ethics Review&#xD;
      Committee (ERC) (WHO, 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of individuals For the recruitment of individuals, the disclosure was initiated&#xD;
      five months before the start of Phase II trial. The research was published on the website of&#xD;
      the University of Sorocaba (UNISO), on social media and folders distributed throughout campus&#xD;
      containing a brief explanation about the research, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and&#xD;
      contact of the researcher. According to the Resolution 1.170, from Anvisa (National Health&#xD;
      Surveillance Agency), Phase II studies are not allowed with less than 12 people; however, the&#xD;
      Agency suggests using a minimum of 24 volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria A total of 165 individuals completed the Google online survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion Criteria Individuals aged from 20 to 65 years old, of both gender, who had at&#xD;
           least one of the following biochemical markers at the borderline level (total&#xD;
           cholesterol 180 to 239 mg/dL; LDL 130 to 159 mg/dL; triglycerides of 150 to 200 mg/dL),&#xD;
           were recruited, diagnosed by biochemical exams with dates recent to the day of&#xD;
           recruitment. The be tolerant to bars ingredients and to Shiitake. Availability to attend&#xD;
           the date and time of blood collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion Criteria However, some of them had diseases such as cancer, heart disease,&#xD;
           neurodegenerative disease, diabetes, among others. These diseases could be considered as&#xD;
           confounders of the study and some recruited people had to be excluded. Pregnant,&#xD;
           lactating or hormone replacement women could not participate either.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals were instructed to no change their eating habits and patterns, physical activity&#xD;
      level or oral contraceptive use during the study, thus identifying only the effects of&#xD;
      Shiitake added to the diet for each individual on the exposed group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Interventions. The study officially started with 68 individuals, who signed an informed&#xD;
      term of consent. In the first (Time 0 - T0), in the second (Time 33 days - T33) and in the&#xD;
      third (Time 66 days - T66) meetings, the subjects were submitted to nutritional assessment&#xD;
      and anamnesis, 24-hour recall of eating habits and eating frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first month of the study 4,100 placebo or mushroom bars were produced and in the&#xD;
      second month the production was 3,500 bars. According to the Grotto and collaborators (2015),&#xD;
      conducted a study evaluating different Shiitake concentrations (100, 400 and 800 mg/Kg/day)&#xD;
      to determine the degree of toxicity in animals. Shiitake concentration of 100 mg/Kg/day has&#xD;
      been shown to be safe. Besides, the Shiitake sweet bar formulation was approved in the&#xD;
      sensory analysis and purchase intention in the previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization The individuals (68) were randomly allocated (using a table of random numbers)&#xD;
      into 2 groups: I - Placebo group (n = 32) and II - Intervention group (n = 36). To ensure the&#xD;
      daily recommended intake of Shiitake of 100 mg/Kg/day, each participant was weighted to&#xD;
      determine the number of bars consumed per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Individuals after nutritional assessment and blood collection, received an unidentified&#xD;
      opaque and sealed packed containing individually vacuum bars for a period of T33 days. The&#xD;
      patients and the data collector were blind. The bars of the intervention and placebo groups&#xD;
      were similar in texture, flavor, aroma and appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one month, all individuals returned to the University of Sorocaba for new nutritional&#xD;
      assessments, receiving more food bars and blood collection with the same double-blind care&#xD;
      (T33). At the end of sixty-six days (T66), subjects returned for the last blood collection&#xD;
      and final nutritional assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical Analysis Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and&#xD;
      glucose were analyzed by commercial kits, following the manufacturer's specifications, in the&#xD;
      automated equipment COBAS C111 (Roche®) according to the methodologies below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cholesterol, 10 µL of sample and 1.0 mL of enzyme reagent were mixed at 37 ºC for 10 min&#xD;
      for total transformation into free cholesterol, by lipoprotein lipase enzyme. The reaction&#xD;
      involved the oxidation of free cholesterol to cholesterol-3-one and H2O2 by the cholesterol&#xD;
      oxidase enzyme. And with the action of peroxidase on phenol with 4-aminoantipyrine formed a&#xD;
      cherry chromogen, the color being proportional to the concentration of cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the determination of HDL, the serum was treated with phosphotungstate acid and magnesium&#xD;
      chloride. So, the LDL was precipitated out from the fraction after centrifugation for 2 min&#xD;
      at 10.000 rpm. HDL, which remained in the supernatant, was performed according to the&#xD;
      cholesterol methodology. HDL concentration is proportional to the color. LDL was calculated&#xD;
      by subtracting HDL cholesterol from total cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum triglycerides were hydrolyzed to glycerol and free fatty acid by lipoprotein lipase. In&#xD;
      the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and glycerol kinase, glycerol-3-phosphate was&#xD;
      phosphorylated, which was oxidized to acetone dihydrogen phosphate and H2O2 by the glycerol&#xD;
      phosphate oxidase. H2O2, 4-aminoantipyrine and p-chlorophenol underwent the same reaction&#xD;
      process reported above by peroxidase in a 37 ºC water bath for 10 minutes until formation of&#xD;
      red color.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the blood glucose test, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase oxidized glucose-6-phosphate in&#xD;
      the presence of NADP in gluconate-6-phosphate. No other carbohydrates have been oxidized. The&#xD;
      rate of NADPH formation during the reaction was directly proportional to the glucose&#xD;
      concentration, being determined photometrically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative Stress Analysis The determination of reduced glutathione (GSH) was made by&#xD;
      quantification of reduced total thiols based. For this, 150 µL of the blood was vortexed with&#xD;
      100 µL 10% Triton X-100 and 100 µL 30% TCA, then centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm. In the&#xD;
      cuvette 900 µL of 1M TFK, 50 µL of supernatant, and 50 µL of 10 mM DTNB were pipetted, which&#xD;
      reacted to form a yellow complex. The reading was taken at 412 nm in a spectrophotometer. For&#xD;
      the calculation of concentration, the calibration curve with predefined GSH concentrations&#xD;
      (0.005; 0.01; 0.025; 0.05; 0.1 mM) was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the activity of the catalase enzyme was used, based on the decomposition of H2O2&#xD;
      by catalase, monitored at 240 nm. For this, the blood was diluted 60 times in 50 mM TFK. An&#xD;
      aliquot of 20 μL was mixed to 1910 μL of the same TFK, and 70 μL of H2O2 was added,&#xD;
      initiating the monitored reaction for three minutes. A constant of variation (κ) per minute&#xD;
      helped in the expression of catalase enzyme (κ/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were used as a biomarker of lipid&#xD;
      peroxidation. Plasma aliquots (150 µL) were mixed with 50 µL NaOH and 50 µL Milli-Q ultrapure&#xD;
      water (Direct 8, Millipore®) and incubated at 60 °C for 30 minutes with shaking. 250 µL of 6%&#xD;
      H₃PO₄, 250 µL of 0.8% TBA and 100 µL of 10% SDS were added to the samples and taken to the 80&#xD;
      °C bath for one hour. Lipid peroxides reacted with TBA in acidic medium to form a pink&#xD;
      compound and read in a spectrophotometer at 532 nm. To calculate the concentration of TBARS&#xD;
      in plasma, a calibration curve of malondialdehyde, the main thiobarbituric acid reactive&#xD;
      substance, was made (0.28; 0.56; 1.7; 3.4; 6.6 µM).&#xD;

A constant of variation or coefficient of variation (κ) per minute helped in the expression of catalase enzyme (κ/min). The Catalase enzyme has the responsibility to break down hydrogen peroxide. Higher scores mean a better outcome.&#xD;
