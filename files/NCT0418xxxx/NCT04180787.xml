  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, crossover study is to investigate the effects&#xD;
      of Bang速 Keto Coffee on resting and post-exercise metabolism and muscular performance during&#xD;
      lower body resistance exercise.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Resistance-trained males and females will be recruited for participation in a randomized,&#xD;
      double-bind, crossover trial. After providing informed consent, each participant will undergo&#xD;
      a familiarization session to become accustomed to the study procedures. Following&#xD;
      familiarization, each participant will complete two laboratory visits consisting of&#xD;
      metabolism and exercise performance assessments. In both visits, a baseline assessment of&#xD;
      resting metabolic rate (RMR) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) will be conducted using&#xD;
      indirect calorimetry. Following the initial RMR assessment, each participant will ingest a&#xD;
      coffee flavored beverage, either VPX Bang速 Keto Coffee or a flavor-matched placebo. After&#xD;
      beverage consumption, the participant will return to the supine position and rest prior to&#xD;
      initiation of the second RMR assessment. Immediately following the second RMR assessment, the&#xD;
      participant will begin a 5-minute dynamic bodyweight warm up. Participants will then begin&#xD;
      squat testing procedures on a mechanized squat device. After completing the squat testing,&#xD;
      participants will complete a standard 1-repetition maximum and repetitions to failure using a&#xD;
      plate-loaded hip sled machine. Following the hip sled testing, participants will repeat the&#xD;
      mechanized squat testing. Following completion of the exercise testing, a third and final RMR&#xD;
      assessment will be performed. Following successful completion of the first condition, each&#xD;
      participant will enter a wash out period, after which the visit will be repeated with&#xD;
      ingestion of the alternative beverage.&#xD;
