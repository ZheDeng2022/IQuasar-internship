  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lidocaine is a drug that has multiple uses. One of these is that when intravenously&#xD;
      administered it is effective in reducing post-operative pain. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the beneficial effects of intravenous lignocaine on reducing pain, nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Also, by this research, we are aiming to find a&#xD;
      suitable alternative analgesic.&#xD;

      After approval of synopsis from College of Physician and Surgeons of Pakistan (CPSP) and&#xD;
      Ethical review committee (ERC) of Aga Khan University Karachi, patients fulfilling the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. Written informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      before the surgery. Patients will be randomly allocated by CTU through computer generated&#xD;
      block randomization into either lidocaine group (LG) or placebo group (PG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial unit (CTU) will be responsible to prepare the study drug and placebo in&#xD;
      the same volume, color, consistency and packaging and treatment allocation would be done by&#xD;
      assigning the study drug and placebo numbers. The staff, patient and the anaesthetists will&#xD;
      be blind by the drug allocation. Only the CTU will have the list of randomization and their&#xD;
      treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient will be given general anesthesia as per standard of care. All patients will be&#xD;
      pre-medicated with oral midazolam 7.5 mg one hour before operating room. Standard American&#xD;
      Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) monitoring (NIBP, ECG, and Pulse Oximetry) will be&#xD;
      applied. General anesthesia will be induced by Propofol 2 mg/kg, Nalbuphine 0.1mg/kg and&#xD;
      Cis-Atracurium 0.2 mg/kg. Isoflurane 1% - 1.5% in a mixture of oxygen and air (50:50) will be&#xD;
      used for maintenance of anesthesia. Before tracheal intubation, patients will receive&#xD;
      intravenous bolus injection of the study drug in dose of 1.5mg/kg followed by the continuous&#xD;
      infusion at the rate of 1.5mg/kg/hr. via standard computerized programmable infusion pump.&#xD;
      The infusion will be continued throughout the surgery and will be stopped after extubation.&#xD;
      After intubation, patients' minute ventilation will be adjusted to maintain normocapnia (end&#xD;
      tidal CO2 35 - 40 mm of Hg). All patients will be given 1gm of intravenous Paracetamol after&#xD;
      induction of anaesthesia. Supplemental analgesia, Nalbuphine 1mg, during surgery will be&#xD;
      given if the heart rate and systolic blood pressure increases above 20% of respective&#xD;
      baseline values and causes other than pain had been ruled out, which would be at the&#xD;
      discretion of the primary anaesthetist. Prophylaxis for nausea and vomiting will be given by&#xD;
      Dexamethasone 0.1mg/kg at induction of anaesthesia and Ondansetron 0.1mg/kg after the removal&#xD;
      of gall bladder. At the end of surgery, residual neuromuscular blockade will be reversed by&#xD;
      0.05mg/kg of neostigmine and 0.5mg of glycopyrolate. The trachea will be extubated once the&#xD;
      patient regained consciousness and then transferred to the post anesthesia care unit (PACU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the PACU, each patient will be assessed by the primary investigator for pain, nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting at 15, 30, and 60 minutes. If the patient's pain will be equal to 4 or more on the&#xD;
      numerical rating scale, he/she will be given Nalbuphine 1mg as a rescue analgesic. Likewise,&#xD;
      if the patients has complain of nausea or vomiting, equal to or greater than 2 on Bellvile&#xD;
      nausea score, he/she will be given Metoclopramide 10mg as rescue antiemetic. The analgesic&#xD;
      and anti-emetic requirement in the ward for the first 6 hr. post-operatively will be recorded&#xD;
      by the primary investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time of arrival at PACU will be recorded as &quot;T1&quot;. The discharge time from PACU will also&#xD;
      be recorded and would be declared as &quot;T2&quot;. The time required for the patient to be discharged&#xD;
      from the hospital will be recorded as &quot;TD&quot;. TD will be the time when surgical team decides&#xD;
      that patient can be discharged from the hospital. The difference between the length of stay&#xD;
      in the hospital between the two groups will be calculated as total time spent (in HOURS) in&#xD;
      the hospital &quot;TT&quot;. It will be the sum of time interval between T1 to T2, and T2 to TD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TT= (T1+T2+TD)&#xD;
