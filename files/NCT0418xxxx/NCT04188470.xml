    <textblock>
      Introduction: In recent years, multi-aging has increased by 25%. This is related to&#xD;
      plutipatology, frailty, polymedications, elevated sanitary cost, low quality of life, adverse&#xD;
      events and mortality. To improve this it is necessary to apply the people-centered care model&#xD;
      that includes and individualized therapeutic plan taking into account medication&#xD;
      appropriateness, frailty, complexity and patient preferences. A collaborative model by a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team is proposed to make decisions to optimize drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: person-centered care model by a multidisciplinary team at primary care improve&#xD;
      drug appropriateness in polymedicated elderly patients Material and Method: Design:&#xD;
      Randomized (1:1), open-label, multicentre, parallel-arm clinical trial with 1-year follow-up.&#xD;
      Study population: community-dwelling polymedicated (≥8 drugs) elderly (≥75 years old) people&#xD;
      at 9 primary healthcare team in Bages and Anoia (Catalonian region). Period: May 2020 and&#xD;
      ends at 12 months of follow-up of the last included subject. Method: 9 primary healthcare&#xD;
      team will be randomized to control or intervention group, then volunteers basic healthcare&#xD;
      team will participate in the study and they will be assigned to control or intervention group&#xD;
      depending on which team they work, then the subjects assigned to theses basic healthcare&#xD;
      teams that meet the inclusion criteria and not exclusion criteria will be selected and&#xD;
      finally the informed consent of these will be obtained. In the intervention group the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary work team comprised by the clinical pharmacist, expert collaborator doctor&#xD;
      and the basic healthcare team will meet periodically to review subjects, a multidimensional&#xD;
      review will be carried out by assessing the frailty, complexity, morbidity and the&#xD;
      appropriateness drug therapy, if proposed changes in the therapeutic plan will have to be&#xD;
      agreed with the patient taking into account their preferences. At 6 and 12 months or when&#xD;
      their basic healthcare team requests it they will be reviewed again. In the control group the&#xD;
      necessary study data collection will be carry out at the beginning and at 6 and 12 months,&#xD;
      and the routine clinical practice in relation to the use of medication will be carried out.&#xD;
      Measurements: variation of the mean of incidents (potencially prescription inadequate) per&#xD;
      patient, variation of the number of prescribed drugs per patient, changes in the therapeutic&#xD;
      plans implemented and variation of the number of hospitalizations.&#xD;

      JUSTIFICATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project focuses on the clinical review from primary care because the healthcare&#xD;
      team are close to the community-dwelling people and therefore offer integral care. The added&#xD;
      value is given by the participation of a multidisciplinary team, in addition to the reference&#xD;
      healthcare team, an expert chronicity physician and the primary care pharmacist are also&#xD;
      involved, thus offer a greater amplitude in the centered vision and care in the patient and&#xD;
      in the process of therapeutic appropriateness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Care Pharmacist (FAP) in the Project ENAPISC, defined in Catalonia, positions&#xD;
      itself as a necessary healthcare professional in the healthcare teams to ensure adequacy use&#xD;
      of the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the evidence published on the result of the implementation of these interventions in&#xD;
      the primary care environment is multiple, its application is still scarce, which gives added&#xD;
      value to the realization of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GENERAL: To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention to improve the therapeutic&#xD;
      appropriateness of the elderly polymedicated patients by the application of person-centered&#xD;
      prescription review method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the characteristics of the sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease the number of detected incidents in the prescription&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease the number of prescribed medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  -decrease the numer of hospitalizations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detect if there are incidents related to the medication derived from the intervention&#xD;
           done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Know the changes produced in the medication plan of the intervention group after one&#xD;
           year after the intervention has finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized (1:1), open-label, multicentre, parallel-arm clinical trial with&#xD;
      1-year follow-up Study period: May 2020-July 2023. Study population: polymedicated patients&#xD;
      with the condition of complex chronic patient or patient with advanced chronic disease and /&#xD;
      or ≥ 75 years old assigned to 9 primary healthcare teams in Bages and Anoia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of the primary care center, the basic healthcare team and the subjects: Of the 9&#xD;
      primary care center that belong to the scope of work of the FAP, volunteer basic healthcare&#xD;
      team will participate, these will be randomized and then the possible subjects that meet the&#xD;
      criteria of the study population are selected, taking into account the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria with the calculation of the size of the study population and the sampling&#xD;
      procedure we obtain the selection of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and distribution of subjects: the 9 primary care team will be graded in a 1:1&#xD;
      proportion, then basic healthcare team will be assigned to control or intervention group&#xD;
      depending on which team they will work, to prioritize study subjects, those that are in the&#xD;
      list of possible subjects will be selected, and finally the informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained. It is an open study, therefore, the subjects and the basic healthcare team will be&#xD;
      aware of what group of study they belong to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and sampling procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size has been calculated using the GRANMO v.7.12 program for two independent&#xD;
      proportions. With an alpha risk of 0.05, a beta of 0.20 with a loss ratio of 0.15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      146 subjects are needed in the first group and 146 in the second group to detect how&#xD;
      statistically significant the difference between two proportions of the average reduction in&#xD;
      the number of medications per patient, which for group 1 is expected to be 0.23 and for group&#xD;
      2 of 0.10 . Approximation of ARCSINUS has been used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of data and sources of information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The list of patients defined as study population and who meet criteria of inclusion and no&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be requested from the information systems of the company, the&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited through a telephone visit and in case of acceptance of the&#xD;
      participation the subjects must sign the informed consent that will be offered to them&#xD;
      through a visit with nursing to the center or at home if necessary. The control group or the&#xD;
      intervention group will be assigned according to the basic healthcare team to which they are&#xD;
      assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data necessary to carry out the study and defined in the data collection sheets, should&#xD;
      be obtained from electronic clinical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A description of the variables will be made by calculating proportions in the case of&#xD;
      qualitative variables and representation with the corresponding graphs and a median&#xD;
      calculation in the case of normal or median distribution if this is not the case for&#xD;
      quantitative variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bivariate inferential analysis with a parametric test in the case of normal distribution of&#xD;
      comparison of means (t-STUDENT), and in the case of non-normal distribution a non-parametric&#xD;
      equivalent test, in particular, the Mann-Whitney U will be used. And in the case of&#xD;
      comparison between categorical variables we will use the Ji-cuadrado to determine the&#xD;
      relation between variables and the Cramer V test to determine the intensity of the&#xD;
      association in case there is one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple regression to analyze the effect of the confusing variables on the main result&#xD;
      variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical program SPSS v24.0 will be used to analyze the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WORK PLAN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic healthcare team will be randomized and the subjects of study will be control or&#xD;
      intervention depending on the assigned basic healthcare team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention group, the work group formed by the primary care pharmacist and the&#xD;
      physician and nurse assigned to the patients, will meet periodically to analyze 2-4 patients&#xD;
      each meeting, a multidimensional patient review will be carried out to evaluate the frailty,&#xD;
      complexity, health problems, control of clinical variables to assess the appropriateness of&#xD;
      the medication by means of the detection of incidents, the group will propose changes in the&#xD;
      therapeutic plan which will have to be finally agreed with the patient or caregiver. They&#xD;
      will be reviewed again at 6 and 12 months. Nursing will schedule visit 0 with the patient or&#xD;
      caregiver and the data be collected. At the same time, in a bi-annual manner, meetings with&#xD;
      the work group will be scheduled. Once reviewed the basic healthcare team will schedule&#xD;
      visits with the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1 to 15 days after the group meeting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  visit at 3 months to keep track of agreed changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit at 6 and 12 months prior to the work group meeting about 15 days before In the&#xD;
           case of need for support from the community pharmacist or the social worker or other&#xD;
           physicians, an individualized work plan will be agreed with them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 months or earlier, if a member of the group requires it, the patient's therapeutic plan&#xD;
      will be reviewed again to monitor the clinical follow-up of the patient, to review whether&#xD;
      there has been any incidence in the therapeutic plan adaptation process, and / or make more&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the subjects of the control group the necessary data will be collected to carry out the&#xD;
      study at the beginning and at 6 and 12 months, and the usual clinical practice will be done&#xD;
      in relation to the use of medication. Nursing will program 3 visits (0, 6 and 12 months) in&#xD;
      the center or at home to perform data collection, and the pharmaceutical will review the&#xD;
      therapeutic plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the data of each patient included in the study will be introduced on the file&#xD;
      created to track and evaluate results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIFFICULTIES AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The beliefs of healthcare professionals who treat patients may make it difficult to improve&#xD;
      the adaptation of the therapeutic plan but it is considered that the design of the project&#xD;
      (randomized trial), the multidisciplinary team work, the participation of an expert in the&#xD;
      use of the medication can help reduce the impact of this factor and redirect some beliefs;&#xD;
      The management of the time is also a limitation because the exhaustive review of the&#xD;
      patient's therapeutic plan requires some time, but in this case, the health benefit that the&#xD;
      project can generate can make the investment of time efficient. The results can be biased by&#xD;
      the effect of the professionals on the control group and on the part of the patients knowing&#xD;
      that they participate in the study (open study). Finally, the knowledge and beliefs of&#xD;
      patients regarding medication and health can also be a factor that hinders changes in the&#xD;
      therapeutic plan but with an appropriate process of shared decisions where quality&#xD;
      information is worked for the patient, the autonomy and the decision-making capacity may&#xD;
      reduce the impact of this limitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APPLICABILITY AND PRACTICAL USE OF THE RESULTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed model proposes a systematic work in the process of medication review and&#xD;
      teamwork with the approach from different points of view and degrees of knowledge of the&#xD;
      subject. Until now, the medication review is done without applying a systematic process and&#xD;
      without taking into account the technical knowledge of other skilled professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering as a general and last objective to improve the therapeutic appropriateness of&#xD;
      polymedicated patients, this is an innovative model, since it is characterized by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  multidisciplinary team work: each professional provides different knowledge and&#xD;
           perspectives regarding the use of the medication and the patient's knowledge, and the&#xD;
           sum of all contributes the added value of the person-centered care model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incorporation of the primary care pharmacist as a reference in the safe and quality use&#xD;
           of the medication in the person-centered care assistance process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL ASPECTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be presented to the Committee of Ethics and Research (CEI) of the IDIAP and&#xD;
      the Bioethics Committee of the University of Barcelona (CBUB) to request approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be explained to the patients selected, the patient information sheet will be&#xD;
      delivered, and the informed consent will be requested to participate in the study, which must&#xD;
      be signed. In the case of a patient with moderate-advanced dementia the consent of both&#xD;
      patients and caregivers will be required, and in the case of an invalid patient the consent&#xD;
      must be signed by the legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participation in the investigation is voluntary and the subjects will be able to exercise&#xD;
      the rights of access, rectification, suppression, right to the limitation of the treatment,&#xD;
      as well as to the portability and opposition, whenever the exercise of these rights does not&#xD;
      affect the purposes of the investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ethical principles for biomedical research on human subjects are fulfilled. In accordance&#xD;
      with the provisions of Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5, on the protection of personal data&#xD;
      and the guarantee of digital rights, personal information will always be treated through&#xD;
      codes. The information recorded is encrypted for transfer to the database of the study. All&#xD;
      servers have antivirus protection, firewalls, controlled access, permanent surveillance,&#xD;
      alarms, as well as other relevant security measures to ensure the protection of information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will generate several files with personal data. These will be kept only for the&#xD;
      duration of the study and will be stored under the custody of the principal investigator in&#xD;
      the directory of the shared unit of the company where she's working (SAPDIRASSIST \&#xD;
      Medication Area \ CAROL ROVIRA \). However, these files will be password protected despite&#xD;
      being stored in a private directory. The data collected already consists of the authorization&#xD;
      of the people whose data will be part of this study, complying with the applicable laws on&#xD;
      data protection (LOPD-GDD and RGPD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects of the study may exercise their rights of access, rectification, deletion, right&#xD;
      to limit the treatment of their data, as well as portability and opposition, provided that&#xD;
      the exercise of these rights does not affect the purposes of investigation for which they&#xD;
      were collected.&#xD;
