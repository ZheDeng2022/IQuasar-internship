  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are monogenic disorders associated with inflammation&#xD;
      affecting multiple organs, and early death. Few treatments are available that can modify the&#xD;
      disease course, and there is an urgent need to identify new steps in pathogenesis that can be&#xD;
      targeted therapeutically. The complement system is novel and highly plausible as a primary&#xD;
      driver of inflammation and cellular injury in the LSDs. This study assesses the complement&#xD;
      activation state in patients with Fabry disease (FD), Gaucher disease (GD) and Niemann-Pick&#xD;
      disease, type C (NPC), with comparison to healthy controls. This has the potential for&#xD;
      immense clinical benefit through targeted complement inhibition across the full spectrum of&#xD;
      lysosomal storage disorders, in which key pathophysiological processes including the&#xD;
      inflammatory response to lysosomally 'stored' materials are shared.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, cross-sectional observational study in patients &gt;16 years of age&#xD;
      diagnosed with FD, GD or NPC. The research hypotheses of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. That complement is excessively activated, including at the specifically complement C5&#xD;
           level, in patients with the lysosomal storage disorders FD, GD and NPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. That complement activation drives tissue injury in the LSDs via downstream effector&#xD;
           mechanisms including membrane attach complex (MAC/C5b-9)-mediated cytotoxicity and&#xD;
           C5aR-mediated inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to show enhanced complement activation, including at the C5 level, in patients&#xD;
      with FD, GD and NPC compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research assays for this study include the primary outcome measure of plasma soluble&#xD;
      C5b-9 (sC6b-9) levels measured using ELISA. This assay measures the degree to which ongoing&#xD;
      C5 activation Is occurring in vivo based on sensitive detection in plasma of the key&#xD;
      activation product C5b-9. The assay would be expected to show elevated plasma sC5b-9 levels&#xD;
      in patients with the glycosphingolipidoses compared to disease-free controls, as was&#xD;
      previously demonstrated in patient cohorts of atypical haemolytic uraemia syndrome (aHUS) and&#xD;
      C3 glomerulopathy (C3G). Additional complement activation products will be assessed as&#xD;
      secondary endpoints including plasma C3a and C5a levels by ELISA, and intracellular leukocyte&#xD;
      C5a concentration as a marker of systemic C5a generation and C5aR1 expression.&#xD;
