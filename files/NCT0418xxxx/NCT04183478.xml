  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No Standard therapy has been approved for third-line therapy of advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
      K001 is peptidoglycan prepared from the marine microorganism, with an anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
      Previously, the phase I study of K001 has shown that K001 was safety and had some&#xD;
      effectiveness for pancreatic patients. Now, we would like to lunch a randomized, blinded,&#xD;
      parallel-controlled, multi-center phase II/III study to compare the best support care (BSC)&#xD;
      plus K-001 versus BSC plus placebo for the third-line and later treatment of patients with&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
