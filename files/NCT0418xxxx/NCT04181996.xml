  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death in the developed world.&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis causes plaques in the blood vessels and is a common form of CVD. Inflammation&#xD;
      is now recognized as a major cause of atherosclerosis. Therapies that target inflammation are&#xD;
      being examined as a potential treatment option. Imaging to detect inflammation may be a&#xD;
      solution to understand mechanisms and to optimize patient selection and outcomes for these&#xD;
      drugs. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET imaging can detect inflammation in the plaque and&#xD;
      identify patients vulnerable to plaque rupture which cause events such as myocardial&#xD;
      infarctions (MI) and strokes. The primary objective of this proposal(CADENCE) is to determine&#xD;
      if the drug colchicine has an effect on plaque inflammation in patients at high risk for&#xD;
      events (patients with diabetes or pre-diabetes and recent myocardial infarction, stroke or&#xD;
      transient ischemic attacks (TIAs)). This mechanistic and proof-of-concept study will set the&#xD;
      stage for future studies that will determine if inflammation imaging can be integrated into&#xD;
      clinical practice to personalize decisions for anti-inflammation therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation is a key to atherosclerosis and its serious effects (MI, stroke) and represents&#xD;
      a potentially transformative therapeutic target. Several recent trials have revealed&#xD;
      potential outcome benefit in patients with cardiovascular disease who are treated with&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory therapy. The LoDoCo trial showed a reduction in cardiovascular events in&#xD;
      patients with known coronary artery disease who were treated with colchicine (1). Although&#xD;
      the LoDoCo trial did show outcome benefit, and in fact reduced the number of acute coronary&#xD;
      syndromes in the treatment group, colchicine's mechanism of action at the level of the&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque in patients remains unknown. The COLCOT trial was recently published&#xD;
      which further demonstrated the potential benefit of anti-inflammatory therapy with&#xD;
      colchicine. Compared with placebo, colchicine significantly reduced the risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular events for patients who recently experienced a myocardial infarction (2). It&#xD;
      is not clear at the present time whether colchicine mainly reduces the systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      milieu, thus reducing the likelihood of plaque progression and new lesion formation; or&#xD;
      whether it has a direct effect on local &quot;hot&quot; inflammatory cell activity, thus pacifying the&#xD;
      inflammatory plaque to reduce events. Insight into colchicine's mechanism of action may help&#xD;
      identify the most suitable patients for this novel approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation imaging may represent a solution. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-CT imaging&#xD;
      can define plaque inflammation and identify patients and plaques vulnerable to rupture and&#xD;
      events. Improved FDG uptake occurs with therapies that effectively reduced vascular events&#xD;
      but not with therapies with no outcome benefit. It is provocative to consider inflammation&#xD;
      imaging strategies that may positively impact therapy decisions to yield better patient&#xD;
      selection and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long term goal of this research is to determine the pathobiological effect of colchicine&#xD;
      on plaque inflammation and determine if inflammation imaging can be integrated into clinical&#xD;
      assessment to personalize decisions for anti-inflammation therapies. As the first step for&#xD;
      this goal, the investigators propose The CADENCE study is the first step towards this goal;&#xD;
      it is a mechanistic and proof-of-concept study that will be the basis for a future 2nd phase&#xD;
      definitive RCT integrating inflammation imaging and biomarker strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Objective is to determine colchicine's effect on plaque inflammation in the&#xD;
      carotids and thoracic aorta using FDG PET in patients with diabetes (T2DM) or pre-diabetes&#xD;
      and recent vascular events (ACS/MI, TIA, stroke).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives include defining if baseline inflammation imaging or biomarkers predict&#xD;
      the inflammation response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives will define differences in response to colchicine: i) in patients with&#xD;
      coronary versus cerebral events; ii) in different vascular beds; iii) relationships of&#xD;
      inflammation imaging to other biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In CADENCE patients with T2DM or pre-diabetes and a recent NonSTEMI, STEMI, stroke or TIA&#xD;
      will be recruited to one of 2 arms: colchicine 0.6 mg daily; or placebo. At baseline and 6&#xD;
      months: patients will have FDG PET-CT of carotids and aorta; at 0, 3 and 6 months: clinical&#xD;
      evaluation and blood sampling for inflammation biomarkers (eg hsCRP, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α,&#xD;
      MCP-1). The primary endpoint will be the change in inflammation over 6 months measured as FDG&#xD;
      tissue to blood ratio (TBR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that colchicine will reduce arterial inflammation measured using FDG PET/CT&#xD;
      and reduce biomarkers of systemic inflammation. This would validate that colchicine's&#xD;
      mechanism of action is more than a systemic effect but also a local action at the level of&#xD;
      the vessel wall and plaque. This would further identify arterial inflammation on imaging as a&#xD;
      potential novel therapeutic target for those at high risk of CV events. Such proof-of-concept&#xD;
      data would support a definitive RCT to evaluate and define the potential for new&#xD;
      biomarker-imaging strategies to direct decisions for novel anti-inflammation therapies in&#xD;
      this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current therapies focus on lesion stenosis or ischemia with conflicting results. Use of&#xD;
      inflammation imaging to direct proven treatments would be a bold practice-changing paradigm&#xD;
      shift.&#xD;
