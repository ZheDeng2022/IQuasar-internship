  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to examine if a patient-tailored treatment program has a&#xD;
      better effect on pain and disability than a non-patient tailored treatment or wait and see&#xD;
      approach in patients with (sub)acute (recurrent) NSNP. A secondary goal is to evaluate the&#xD;
      global perceived effect, treatment adherence, recurrence, work absenteeism and medication&#xD;
      use. All interventional treatment arms will consist of a treatment part in a clinical&#xD;
      practice setting, under supervision of a trained physiotherapist, and an educational&#xD;
      intervention and will be compared to the control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-specific neck pain (NSNP) is a widespread health problems and a major cause of pain and&#xD;
      disability. This condition is complex, disabling and has a heterogeneous presentation, which&#xD;
      makes NSNP difficult to treat. Currently, the best evidence supports combining different&#xD;
      forms of manual therapy (mobilizations, manipulations and manual muscle techniques), and&#xD;
      exercises. Yet, identifying the most effective treatment characteristics and dosages remain&#xD;
      challenging. Central in the debate about best practice management of NSNP and NSLBP is the&#xD;
      efficacy of tailored versus generic (non-tailored) treatment. To date, sufficient evidence&#xD;
      for the application of specific physiotherapy modalities or therapy aiming at specific NSNP&#xD;
      subgroups is lacking. Although more research has already been conducted for the lumbar spine,&#xD;
      there is an ongoing quest to identify relevant subgroups and provide patients with an&#xD;
      assessment-driven targeted intervention to achieve meaningful and long-lasting changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts have been made to identify relevant and homogeneous subgroups for patients with&#xD;
      NSNP. Several classification systems have been proposed, based on (1) prognosis or (2) the&#xD;
      underlying mechanism(s) driving the disorder: (2a) pain mechanisms, (2b) features of&#xD;
      movement/posture/muscle activation , and (2c) pathology/diagnosis. The main goal of&#xD;
      subgrouping patients is to enhance treatment efficiency. Nevertheless, a profound clinical&#xD;
      reasoning process is necessary to identify clinically relevant subgroups. By identifying&#xD;
      accurate and useful diagnostic criteria for NSNP and NSLBP, more informed decisions regarding&#xD;
      the management of these conditions could be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians and researchers are hopeful that tailoring treatment to subgroups of patients may&#xD;
      positively impact on patient outcomes and more efficient usage of health-care resources. For&#xD;
      the lumbar spine, tailoring treatment to different subgroups is already present in&#xD;
      literature. For example, in patients with pain provoked by postures/movements, tailoring&#xD;
      treatment to modify specific features of posture/movement is effective and patients allocated&#xD;
      to subgroups respond better to matched rather than unmatched interventions. Yet, other&#xD;
      studies showed no additional benefit. Despite the growing interest for tailoring treatment&#xD;
      for NSNP, the definition of tailored/stratified care is broadly used and interpretation is&#xD;
      diverse. In order to determine best practice for the individual patient, tailoring the&#xD;
      treatment should account for the multidimensional nature of non-specific spinal complaints&#xD;
      and respect the individual characteristics of the patient within its subgroup. Additionally,&#xD;
      it must take into account that patients may present with features of multiple subgroups or&#xD;
      evolve through subgroups during treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies on NSLBP already showed that targeting treatment can reduce costs and may&#xD;
      improve outcomes when specific groups are compared. Unfortunately, at this moment, no&#xD;
      conclusive high-quality evidence is present for its superiority. In addition to the lumbar&#xD;
      spine, research on stratified care for NSNP is scarce compared to NSLBP research. Despite its&#xD;
      major prevalence and socioeconomic consequences, no recommended or validated classification&#xD;
      systems to stratify care for NSNP and to target specific subgroups are available. This&#xD;
      suggests that the treatment decision in this heterogeneous group mostly depends on the&#xD;
      clinical reasoning process, which is often incomplete in research on NSNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the best practice for NSNP, a classification system based on a profound&#xD;
      clinical reasoning process, identifying clinically relevant subgroups should be implemented&#xD;
      to guide treatment tailoring and to allow a holistic and individual approach, instead of&#xD;
      oversimplifying non-specific spinal complaints as one condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GOAL :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effectiveness of a patient tailored treatment (PTT) combined with&#xD;
      individualized education, compared to (1) a non-patient tailored treatment (NPTT) consisting&#xD;
      of a generalized exercise program with education and (2) a control group for (sub)acute&#xD;
      (recurrent) nonspecific complaints.&#xD;
