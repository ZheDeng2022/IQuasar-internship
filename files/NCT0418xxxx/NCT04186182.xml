  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with acquired brain injury (ABI) often struggle with complex impairments, including&#xD;
      cognitive (such as memory and attention), social, emotional and behavioral challenges. There&#xD;
      is broad agreement that there is a lack of evidence-based knowledge about rehabilitation for&#xD;
      children with ABI in the chronic phase. The current study is a feasibility study of a planned&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT), the CICI-intervention, directed towards children with ABI&#xD;
      and their families in the chronic phase. The feasibility study aims to evaluate the study&#xD;
      protocol, the assessment procedures and the technical solutions prior to performing the RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A feasibility study with six participating children and families will be conducted in close&#xD;
      collaboration with schools and local health care providers. The intervention to be tested&#xD;
      (the CICI-intervention) focuses on the child's and family's individually identified target&#xD;
      outcome areas to be addressed, with corresponding rehabilitation goals. The intervention aims&#xD;
      to enhance everyday functioning in the home and school environment by reducing ABI-related&#xD;
      symptoms, and by attaining rehabilitation goals in areas noted as challenging by the&#xD;
      participants. In the future RCT-study the efficacy of the CICI-intervention will be measured&#xD;
      in terms of goal attainment, community participation, cognitive, behavioral, social, and&#xD;
      family functioning.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is considerable knowledge about how to help children with ABI during the first, acute&#xD;
      and post-acute stages. Yet, impairments are often long lasting and, due to the vulnerability&#xD;
      of children's developing brain, new problems may emerge or become increasingly problematic&#xD;
      over time. Children with ABI may struggle at school and with peers, which can lead to or&#xD;
      increase emotional difficulties, and reduce quality of life, affecting the children and their&#xD;
      families. The local communities and the children's schools are, together with the families,&#xD;
      often left responsible for dealing with the chronic challenges of pABI. Parents may&#xD;
      experience considerable stress and develop emotional symptoms when a child suffers an ABI. As&#xD;
      a result, the entire family may experience impaired function, which in turn may affect the&#xD;
      long-term prognosis of the child with ABI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this feasibility study, six children between 6 and 15 years will be included. The children&#xD;
      will have a clinical ABI diagnosis, verified injury related intracranial abnormalities, and&#xD;
      be more than one year post injury at inclusion. The child and/or their family must report&#xD;
      enduring cognitive, emotional, social or physical challenges related to the brain injury. The&#xD;
      intervention will be conducted in collaboration with the children's families, schools and&#xD;
      their local care providers. It consists of individualized goal-oriented strategies adapted to&#xD;
      the home- and school-setting. Goal attainment scaling will be applied. In addition,&#xD;
      psychoeducation will be provided to the family and school/local care providers on topics&#xD;
      related to the child's injury. Parent group sessions will be held for discussions and&#xD;
      knowledge transfer concerning family challenges after a pABI, such as communication skills&#xD;
      and parenting. The intervention will include 7 individualized meetings with the family (2&#xD;
      home visits + 5 videoconferences), 2 parent group sessions and 4 meetings with school and&#xD;
      local care providers during a period of 4-5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study primarily aims to evaluate adherence to the CICI study protocol,&#xD;
      responsiveness of participants and therapists, and the usefulness of the intervention.&#xD;
      Furthermore, recruitment procedures, assessment protocol, goal setting and the technical&#xD;
      solutions will be evaluated. A questionnaire developed for this project will be used to&#xD;
      assess the families' satisfaction with the intervention as well as the acceptability of the&#xD;
      intervention to families and therapists, while checklists, logs and qualitative interviews&#xD;
      will be used to assess the remaining outcomes. Assessments in the future RCT will be&#xD;
      conducted at baseline (T1), at the end of the intervention (T2, 4-5 months after inclusion)&#xD;
      and one year after inclusion (T3). In the feasibility study, T1 and T2 will be included, as&#xD;
      this is considered sufficient to evaluate feasibility of the study protocol as such.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes of the CICI-intervention in the future RCT-study, will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  severity of brain injury symptoms (Health and Behavior Inventory - HBI),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the child's quality of life (The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory - Peds-QL), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  parenting self-efficacy (Tool to Measure Parenting Self-Efficacy - TOPSE/Teens TOPSE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures of the CICI-intervention in the future RCT-study, will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  changes in self- and parental perceived severity of the individually defined target&#xD;
           outcome areas (measured on a 5-point Likert scale),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  goal attainment scaling in the CICI group (Goal Attainment Scaling - GAS),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  emotional symptoms of the children (Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Teacher Report Form&#xD;
           (TRF) and Youth Self-report (YSR))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  emotional symptoms of the parents (Patient Health Questionnaire 9 - PHQ-9 and&#xD;
           Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 - GAD-7),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  children's executive functioning in the home and school environment (Behavior Rating&#xD;
           Inventory of Executive Function 2 - BRIEF-2),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  participation (The Child and Adolescent Scale of Participation - CASP),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  global outcome after pABI (Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended Pediatric Version - GOS-E&#xD;
           Peds),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  parental stress (Parental Stress Scale - PSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  family functioning (Family Assessment Device - FAD), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  unmet healthcare needs of the family (The Family Needs Questionnaire - Pediatric version&#xD;
           - FNQ-P).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the neuropsychological screening battery performed at baseline in the future&#xD;
      RCT-study will consist of the following test measures: Similarities, Matrix Reasoning,&#xD;
      Coding, Digit Span from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-V, Inhibition and&#xD;
      Comprehension of Instructions from Nepsy-II, the Children's Communication Checklist-2&#xD;
      questionnaire and the Children's Auditory Verbal Learning Test-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      October 27, 2020: This feasibility study was recruiting and in early stages when the Covid-19&#xD;
      pandemic forced a halt in the study in March 2020. The insecurity of the situation caused us&#xD;
      not to register the study as suspended, as we hoped from week to week that we would be able&#xD;
      to continue. However, the pandemic resulted in a total halt, and reopening of the entire&#xD;
      study in august 2020. The new timeline has been adjusted accordingly in the clinical&#xD;
      trials.gov records.&#xD;
