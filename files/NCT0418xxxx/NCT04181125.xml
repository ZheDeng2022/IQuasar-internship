    <textblock>
      The relationship between increased femoral anteversion and postural control in healthy&#xD;
      children has not been studied in the current literature. To our knowledge there is no study&#xD;
      to evaluate postural control in children with increased femoral anteversion by computerized&#xD;
      posturography. We aimed to evaluate postural control in children with increased femoral&#xD;
      anteversion using computerized dynamic posturography (Biodex Balance System).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Femoral anteversion is defined as the angle formed by the femoral condyles plane (bicondylar&#xD;
      plane) and a plane passing through the center of the neck and femoral head. Toe-in-gait&#xD;
      pattern may be due to foot deformity (metatarsus adductus) and / or abnormal transverse&#xD;
      alignment of long bones (tibial torsion and / or increased femoral anteversion). Transverse&#xD;
      plane deviations are frequently seen in infants and usually improve with typical&#xD;
      physiological growth mechanisms. Persistent transverse plan disorder may lead to gait&#xD;
      dysfunction. The most important function of the posture is to maintain the balance during the&#xD;
      initiation and continuation of the movement. Postural control regulates maintaining the&#xD;
      balance and keeping the center of gravity within the body's stability limits. It includes&#xD;
      resistance to gravity forces and mechanical support during movement. Postural control is an&#xD;
      integral part of achieving targeted action. To our knowledge the relationship between&#xD;
      increased femoral anteversion and postural control in healthy children has not been studied&#xD;
      in the current literature. Postural control in children with increased femoral anteversion&#xD;
      was evaluated by computerized posturography. In this study, we aimed to evaluate postural&#xD;
      control in children with increased femoral anteversion using computerized dynamic&#xD;
      posturography (Biodex Balance System).&#xD;

    <description>After the demographic information, developmental history and gait information were recorded with the Evaluation Form, clinical evaluation was performed; bilateral lower extremity range of motion, flexibility, leg length measurement, and muscle strength measurement and muscular endurance tests (abdominal, back and lower extremity) will be performed. For the clinical evaluation of postural control, the Modified Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) and the Biodex Balance System for computerized evaluation will be used.</description>
