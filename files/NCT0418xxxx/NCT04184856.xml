  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who suffer from binge eating disorder experience recurrent episodes of binge&#xD;
      eating.During these episodes, they consume an unusually large amount of food in a short&#xD;
      amount of time and experience loss of control over eating. However, why such binge eating&#xD;
      episodes occur is still largely unknown. This makes it difficult to develop targeted&#xD;
      treatments. In this project, the experimenters are investigating the brain mechanisms that&#xD;
      give rise to the disorder. They hypothesize that the binge eating episodes are due to an&#xD;
      increased variability in reward processing, which they will assess repeatedly over days. They&#xD;
      will test this hypothesis using mathematical models based on behavioural and MRI measurements&#xD;
      that are related to the processing of rewards.&#xD;
