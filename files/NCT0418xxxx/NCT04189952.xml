      The purpose of this study is to test a combination treatment of acalabrutunib when given&#xD;
      together with rituximab-ifosfamide-carboplatin-etoposide (R-ICE) to evaluate if it will be&#xD;
      able to improve durable responses and cure some patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy &lt; 21 days prior to first&#xD;

             positive for hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or&#xD;
             hepatitis C antibody will need a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. (PCR positive patients will be excluded.) Hepatitis C antibody positive&#xD;
             patients are eligible if PCR is negative. Hepatitis B core antibody (+) patients&#xD;
