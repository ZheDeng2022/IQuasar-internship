  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of three dose cohorts of LMN-101 followed&#xD;
      by campylobacter challenge. Subjects will begin taking their LMN-101 or placebo regimen 3x&#xD;
      daily on Day -7. They will document AEs in a diary. After 1 wk of dosing, volunteers will be&#xD;
      admitted to an inpatient clinical research facility as they continue the 28-day course of&#xD;
      treatment. After 3 doses of LMN-101 or placebo, subjects will receive the C. jejuni challenge&#xD;
      on Day 0 following an established campylobacter controlled human infection model (CHIM)&#xD;
      protocol (Kirkpatrick et al. 2013; Poly et al. 2008; Rimmer et al. 2018; Tribble et al.&#xD;
      2009). After challenge, safety monitoring will include 24-hour inpatient clinical monitoring,&#xD;
      vital signs at least TID (orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate as clinically indicated),&#xD;
      daily medical interviews and physical exams, blood culture for fever ≥ 39 °C, and daily stool&#xD;
      culture. Specific solicited adverse events include diarrhea, fever, nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      abdominal pain, abdominal cramping, mucoid or bloody stools, headache, fatigue, lack of&#xD;
      appetite, muscle pain, chills, and joint pains. Stool output will be measured. Fluid losses&#xD;
      will be replaced with oral rehydration or intravenously as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will begin taking a 5-day course of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin when they meet&#xD;
      early treatment criteria or it has been 144 hours since the campylobacter challenge,&#xD;
      whichever is earlier. Subjects will be discharged from the inpatient clinical research&#xD;
      facility 48 hours after commencing antibiotics, when all symptoms have resolved or are&#xD;
      resolving, and they have had ≥ 2 consecutive stools negative for C. jejuni. Subjects will be&#xD;
      provided remaining azithromycin and ciprofloxacin to complete 5-day course at home, along&#xD;
      with remaining doses of LMN-101 or placebo to be taken at home to complete the 28-day course.&#xD;
      Subjects will be provided a diary card/memory aid and thermometer for outpatient monitoring&#xD;
      of solicited adverse events. Subjects will be seen as outpatients on Days 14, 21, 28, 35, 56,&#xD;
      and 84 after challenge for protocol-specified evaluations and contacted by telephone 6 months&#xD;
      after challenge. For microbial recrudescence, extra visits to the clinic will be necessary&#xD;
      and an additional course of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin will be given for 10 days.&#xD;

      Healthy subjects will be randomized within one of the following sequential dose cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LMN-101, six 500-mg capsules orally three times daily for 28 days (n=21), or&#xD;
           identical-appearing placebo (n=7); or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LMN-101, two 500-mg capsules and four 500-mg placebo capsules orally three times daily&#xD;
           for 28 days (n=21), or identical-appearing placebo (n=7); or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LMN-101, one 300-mg capsule and five 500-mg placebo capsules orally three times daily&#xD;
           for 28 days (n=21), or identical-appearing placebo (n=7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Campylobacter jejuni CG8421, 1.5 x 10e5 colony-forming units challenge will be administered&#xD;
      orally as a single challenge after 7 days of dosing.The C. jejuni CG8421 (capsule type 23,&#xD;
      36) challenge strain lacks all ganglioside mimicry and the genes needed for synthesis of&#xD;
      N-acetyl neuraminic acid, necessary for glycolipid mimicry associated with Guillain-Barré&#xD;
      (Poly et al. 2008; Tribble et al. 2009).The C. jejuni challenge will be followed 144 hours&#xD;
      later by antibiotics for 5 days. Earlier antibiotic treatment will be initiated if subjects&#xD;
      meet the criteria to start antibiotics or have any illness that necessitates early treatment&#xD;
      in the opinion of the study physician. Additional treatment will be given if microbial&#xD;
      recrudescence is observed.&#xD;
