  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective consists of the following three aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the effect of daily intake of Jarlsberg cheese and Camembert cheese in change&#xD;
           of the Osteocalcin level in healthy women after 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate the long-term increase of the osteocalcin level, change in the lipid pattern&#xD;
           and the vital signs caused by optimized daily intake of Jarlsberg cheese.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To verify the estimated maintaining dose of Jarlsberg cheese related to stabilized&#xD;
           osteocalcin Level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consists of Healthy Voluntary (HV) women between 20 years and&#xD;
      pre-menopausal age. The trial will be performed as a randomized Norwegian multicenter study&#xD;
      with a semi-cross over design in which the participants randomized to Camembert cheese will&#xD;
      be switched to Jarlsberg cheese after 6 weeks.&#xD;

      The recruited HV women fulfilled the inclusion without the exclusion criteria for the study&#xD;
      will undergo a screening clinical investigation. The participants will be asked to avoid use&#xD;
      of other cheese than the one allocated to in the study, but eat as usual. One week later, the&#xD;
      first clinical investigation in the study will take place including blood sampling and&#xD;
      measurement of vital signs. The HV women verified to fulfil the criteria for participation&#xD;
      and signed the informed consent form will be included in the study. During this first&#xD;
      clinical investigation in the study denoted as Day 0, the participants receive a study&#xD;
      identification number. The HV will randomly be allocated to either daily intake of Jarlsberg&#xD;
      cheese or Camembert cheese. The daily intake of cheese will be 57g/day in both study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants meet for new clinical investigations every third week with measurement of&#xD;
      vital signs and blood sampling. Osteocalcin and vitamin K will be analysed every third week&#xD;
      whereas the haematological and biochemical analysis will be performed every six week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HVs allocated to Camembert cheese will after 6 weeks be switched to daily intake of&#xD;
      Jarlsberg cheese in additional 6 weeks with clinical investigations every third week. The&#xD;
      participants performed the 6 weeks of daily intake of Jarlsberg cheese will either be offered&#xD;
      participation in the cheese de-escalation study (HV-Jarlsberg/IB) or an extended study of 6&#xD;
      weeks with unchanged Jarlsberg cheese dose. HVs with an increase &lt;10% in the osteocalcin&#xD;
      level from screening to 6 weeks of Jarlsberg cheese intake will not be offered included in&#xD;
      the de-escalation study. The first 12 HVs finalized 6 weeks with daily intake of Jarlsberg&#xD;
      cheese obtaining an increase in the osteocalcin level from baseline â‰¥10% will be allocated to&#xD;
      the de-escalation study HV-Jarlsberg/IB (separate protocol). The HVs included in the extended&#xD;
      part of this study will receive an unchanged daily dose of Jarlsberg cheese for additional 6&#xD;
      weeks with clinical investigation every third week. The HVs switched to Jarlsberg cheese may&#xD;
      be offered participation in a study part aiming to verify the maintaining dose obtained in&#xD;
      HV-Jarlsberg/IB study. The duration of this part will be 6 weeks with clinical investigation&#xD;
      every third week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main variable in this study will be osteocalcin measured in blood serum. Additionally,&#xD;
      carboxylated and under carboxylated Osteocalcin and the ratio OR = [Carboxylated / Under&#xD;
      Carboxylated] osteocalcin in serum will be central together the K2 variants MK-7, 8, 9, 9(4H)&#xD;
      and vitamin K1. Triglyceride, LDL- and HDL cholesterol, vitamin D and vital signs will be&#xD;
      secondary variables. As safety variables, haematological- and biochemical variables and&#xD;
      adverse events (AE) will be recorded at each visit.Totally 64 HVs completing the study will&#xD;
      be recruited from the eight participating General Practitioners sites.&#xD;
