      Indirect evaluation of the accuracy and the efficacy of biosensors developed for Li+&#xD;
      detection in sweat.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lithium (Li+) is one of the most widely used and studied medications for treating of Bipolar&#xD;
      Mood Disorder, resistant cases of Major Psychiatric Disorders and especially Major Depressive&#xD;
      Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After administration, more than 95% of administered dose of Li+ is eliminated unchanged in&#xD;
      the urine, less than 5% - in the saliva, sweat, and feces. Up to 40% of patients that are on&#xD;
      Li+ therapy encounter adverse effects that can be explained by drug involvement in various&#xD;
      biochemical processes. Li+ efficacy and side effect manifestation are obviously determined by&#xD;
      the drug concentration in blood. The optimal way to prevent manifestation of side effects is&#xD;
      to control that Li+ serum level is within therapeutic range. A blood test is often ordered to&#xD;
      monitor the serum level of Li+ to ensure target serum levels are reached. The available&#xD;
      methods for blood Li+ are invasive, time consuming, and cause of discomfort for patients, yet&#xD;
      are of a great importance as levels of drug in blood outside the therapeutic range may&#xD;
      dramatically affect patient health. It is especially of importance for Li+ treatments it has&#xD;
      a narrow therapeutic window - 0.6-1.5 mmol/L. Thus, there is a growing need for a reliable,&#xD;
      comfortable, and inexpensive method for detection of Li+ in blood that can be performed&#xD;
      easily in an in-patient setting and automatically whenever necessary without the need for a&#xD;
      clinic visit out-patient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spectrophon LTD has developed an algorithm that allows calculation of levels of various&#xD;
      compounds contained in sweat using standard PPG sensors with special coating and thus to&#xD;
      estimate the levels of corresponding chemicals in the bloodstream. This algorithm has proven&#xD;
      useful and accurate in clinical trials on detection of dehydration level, blood sodium level,&#xD;
      and blood glucose level. We suggest that Spectrophon biosensors can be used to detect the&#xD;
      levels of Li+ in sweat that will allow non-invasive estimation of the level of corresponding&#xD;
      medication in blood in real-time.&#xD;

    <description>To confirm that Li+ is detectable in sweat using Macroduct Sweat Collection System for sweat collection.&#xD;
Current studies demonstrate that Li+ can be detected in saliva and in sweat. To confirm it, patients that are on treatment with Li+ will be recruited for this aim; sweat will be collected and checked for Li+ levels.&#xD;
To develop the algorithm for Spectrophon LTD biosensors for Li+ levels measurement in sweat that will allow assessing the level of Li+ in blood.&#xD;
To evaluate the accuracy and the efficacy of biosensors developed by Spectrophon LTD for Li+ detection in sweat.&#xD;
Following positive results in previous objectives, clinical trial will be conducted to estimate the suitability, efficacy and accuracy of developed biosensors for non-invasive detection of Li+ in sweat.</description>
