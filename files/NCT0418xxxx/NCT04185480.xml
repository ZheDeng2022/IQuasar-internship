      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sentinel lymph node biopsy has reduced the number of patients needing to undergo axillary&#xD;
      lymph node dissection (ALND). However, axillary lymph node dissection is part of curative&#xD;
      therapy for a large group of patients with advanced invasive breast cancers and melanoma.&#xD;
      Seroma may cause symptomatic discomfort requiring needle aspiration and is often associated&#xD;
      with infection, wound dehiscence, skin necrosis, persistent fibrotic encapsulated seromas and&#xD;
      may even delay adjuvant therapies [1]. Therefore, extensive research in finding the best&#xD;
      technique in reducing seroma is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substances intended to seal small blood vessels by triggering collagen and fibrinogen&#xD;
      synthesis supporting surgical hemostasis, are assumed to be able to contribute to sealing of&#xD;
      these lymphatic vessels. Contradicting results were found in the effect of several&#xD;
      fibrin-glue coated collagen patches [2-5] and fibrin glue [6,7]. Furthermore, the use of&#xD;
      electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing system (LigaSure) in axillary dissection showed no&#xD;
      significant reduction in rate of aspiration of seroma [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is intended to assess the value of a haemostatic sealant (Hemopatch), a pad&#xD;
      of collagen derived from bovine dermis, coated with NHS-PEG (pentaerythritol polyethylene&#xD;
      glycol ether tetra-succinimidyl glutarate), in reducing seroma related complications after&#xD;
      ALND with the advantage that this sealant is pliable and flexible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate if the use of Hemopatch in axillary lymph node dissection shows potential in&#xD;
      reducing clinically significant seroma and seroma related complications, which might serve as&#xD;
      a basis for a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective cohort will be compared to a historical control group. Eighteen consecutive&#xD;
      patients will undergo axillary lymph node dissection and after completion of lymphadenectomy,&#xD;
      Hemopatch will be applied to the axillary surgical field. These results will be compared to&#xD;
      the results of a historical control group consisting of 46 patients who have undergone ALND&#xD;
      without the Hemopatch between January 2014 and December 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be conducted for three months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of 18 years or older, diagnosed with stage III melanoma or breast cancer and&#xD;
      indication for wide local excision (WLE) and/or axillary lymphadenectomy (ALND).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of Hemopatch after standard axillary lymph node dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proportion of patients treated with Hemopatch who develop clinically significant seroma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be informed about the study before inclusion in the outpatient clinic. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained in the outpatient clinic a week after patients were initially&#xD;
      informed. Postoperative check-ups will be done more frequently. Standard postoperative&#xD;
      check-ups are planned at one week and three months. Additional study postoperative check-up&#xD;
      will be performed at six weeks. Therefore, patients will be required to undergo one&#xD;
      additional check-up. During out patients' visits, the wound will be evaluated and patients&#xD;
      will be asked to fill in a questionnaire. Application of the Hemopatch is expected to reduce&#xD;
      clinically significant seroma after ALND. The only potential risk for the patient is that the&#xD;
      Hemopatch is ineffective.&#xD;
