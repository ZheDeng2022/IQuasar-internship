  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of major depression relies on patient reports, and two patients with the same&#xD;
      diagnosis might share only one symptom. Thus, a single mechanism is unlikely to underlie a&#xD;
      broad descriptive diagnosis such as major depression. Our approach is anchored by a neural&#xD;
      circuit taxonomy that proposes distinct biotypes of depression derived from functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Williams et al., 2016). In this study, we aim to target a&#xD;
      putative type of major depression that arises from dysfunction in cognitive control neural&#xD;
      circuitry with a drug called guanfacine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The flow of procedures and study visits is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment and screening: Participants experiencing depressive symptoms and not taking&#xD;
           any psychiatric medications as determined by a 5 half life wash out period will be&#xD;
           recruited from the community, including students and employees at Stanford. Recruitment&#xD;
           will come primarily from Facebook ads, which will use only IRB approved material. The&#xD;
           flyer will also be physically posted on boards in public locations in order to include a&#xD;
           variety of sources for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Individuals will need to participate in 2 to 3 screening visits (screening visit 2 and 3&#xD;
           can be combined) in order to enroll in the study. During the first visit, participants&#xD;
           will go over informed consent, be administered a clinical interview and complete&#xD;
           cognitive testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The second visit will be a medical screen in order to ensure participants are safe to&#xD;
           continue and will include blood samples, medical history, vitals and a urine drug test&#xD;
           and can be combined with visit three, detailed in step 4 below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If the participant meets medical and cognitive criteria, scans for functional MRI will&#xD;
           be undertaken at another study visit (or in combination with the medical screen) at the&#xD;
           CNI on the Stanford campus. All MRI scans, including the optional MRI scan at week 6,&#xD;
           will last 1.5 hours. If a participant's task-evoked activity in the DLPFC falls within&#xD;
           the highest or lowest quartiles derived from a large data set of healthy volunteers, the&#xD;
           participant will be able to proceed with medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Participants will be randomized to either receive active medication treatment with&#xD;
           guanfacine or placebo in a double blinded fashion. Randomization will be generated using&#xD;
           a random number generator computer program. The probability for random assignment to&#xD;
           each treatment is 50% chance randomized to active treatment with guanfacine and 50%&#xD;
           chance randomized to placebo. A prescription lasting a period of 4 weeks will be sent to&#xD;
           the Stanford Psychiatry Department from Mariner pharmacy. The pharmacist will provide a&#xD;
           research coordinator in the lab with the randomization information, but this research&#xD;
           coordinator will not be involved in patient interaction. The packaging of the medication&#xD;
           itself will not identify drug or otherwise, but have an ID only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. At weeks 1, 3 and 5 when subject is not seen by the study MD, the participant will be&#xD;
           monitored by an appropriately trained clinical research coordinator. All subjects will&#xD;
           have an fMRI scan during week 4 and an optional week 6 fMRI scan. During in-person&#xD;
           visits and phone monitoring, participants will be assessed for changes to physical&#xD;
           health and treatment physical side-effects, anthropometrics and vital signs, changes to&#xD;
           current medications (other than GIR), compliance to GIR treatment, alcohol and drug use&#xD;
           abstinence compliance, birth control usage compliance and likelihood of pregnancy&#xD;
           (female participants of child bearing potential), mood changes (QIDS-SR), suicidality&#xD;
           (C-SSRS), clinical global impression severity (CGI-S) and improvement (CGI-I), Barratt&#xD;
           Impulsiveness Scale (BIS). We will also have participants complete the following&#xD;
           cognitive measures described below on a weekly basis during the treatment period in the&#xD;
           form of an online battery (aka Webneuro): Choice reaction time, emotion test, digit&#xD;
           span, GoNoGo, Verbal Interference, CPT, and Maze.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DETAILS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants: Volunteers will be aged 18-65 years old. The effect size of guanfacine vs.&#xD;
           placebo on ADHD symptoms, including symptoms of inattention, has been estimated to be&#xD;
           between 0.43 and 0.86. Using the most conservative of these values (0.43) and assuming&#xD;
           an alpha of 0.05 with 4 groups, a total of 64 patients will be needed to provide a power&#xD;
           of 80%. This would result in 32 subjects in each of the highest and lowest quartile&#xD;
           groups of DLPFC activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomization: Participants will undergo fMRI scanning using tasks described below,&#xD;
           including the N-back Working Memory Task. A region of interest (ROI) analysis will be&#xD;
           performed using our established methods, to identify BOLD- dependent signal change in&#xD;
           the DPLPC (right, left). Beta values for each ROI will be extracted for each subject and&#xD;
           used to determine eligibility for the study. If a subject falls with the extreme&#xD;
           quartiles of either the right or left DLPFC or both, this individual be randomized in a&#xD;
           double blind fashion into one of two groups: placebo or guanfacine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Suicidal thoughts or psychotic symptoms: Established procedures are in place for direct&#xD;
           and immediate referral and intervention when suicidality and/or psychosis are&#xD;
           identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participants wishing to participate in this study will be screened with a psychiatric&#xD;
           interview, an in-person physical exam (height, weight, vital signs, systems assessment,&#xD;
           general appearance), medical history (history of disorders, diseases and allergies), lab&#xD;
           tests (hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, total and differential WBC count, platelet&#xD;
           count; chemistry: sodium, potassium, chloride, CO2, glucose, creatinine, BUN/urea; liver&#xD;
           panel: albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, AST, ALT, ALP, total protein;&#xD;
           endocrine: TSH; pregnancy test; full urine toxicology).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Participants will be prescribed tabs containing either placebo or guanfacine immediate&#xD;
           release to be taken for 4 weeks and will be monitored by one of the study psychiatrists.&#xD;
           Subjects randomized to GIR will start with 0.25mg GIR upon waking and increase by 0.25mg&#xD;
           every other day with a goal dose of 2mg. If intolerance is encountered with a dosage&#xD;
           increase, the dosage will be reduced to the prior level for a length to be determined by&#xD;
           the treating psychiatrist and then raised again if/when tolerated. Dosing schedule may&#xD;
           be slowed at the discretion of the physician based on participant's reaction to the&#xD;
           drug. Decision to terminate guanfacine treatment will be made by clinicians based on&#xD;
           side effects or lack of response or at patient's request. Follow up care for 2 weeks&#xD;
           will be provided and transfer of care arranged at week 6 according to patients'&#xD;
           decisions. At 4 weeks, the blind will be broken and those taking GIR may choose to&#xD;
           continue this medication or taper off. If patients select to continue, a fMRI scan will&#xD;
           be offered at week 6. Abrupt discontinuation of GIR (either due to side effects or to&#xD;
           study end) will be avoided to prevent rebound hypertension and withdrawal symptoms.&#xD;
           Participants will be seen by the study's psychiatrists at treatment weeks 2, 4, and 6.&#xD;
