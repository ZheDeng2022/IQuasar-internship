  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome (MF/SS) are&#xD;
      cancers that form in the T cells, a type of white blood cell that helps with the body s&#xD;
      immune response. A combination of drugs might be able to better treat these cancers than&#xD;
      existing therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if the drugs IL-15 and mogamulizumab are safe and effective to treat people with ATLL&#xD;
      or MF/SS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with relapsed ATLL or MF/SS that has not responded to at least one&#xD;
      standard treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (including HIV, hepatitis B and C), urine, lung, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow tests (if needed): A needle inserted in the participant s hip will take a small&#xD;
      amount of marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT, PET and/or MRI scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor biopsy (if needed): A needle will take out a small piece of the participant s tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the study drugs by vein for up to six 28-day cycles. They will get&#xD;
      IL-15 the first 5 days of each cycle. They will get mogamulizumab on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of&#xD;
      cycle 1 and days 1 and 15 of the other cycles. They will be hospitalized for 1 week in cycle&#xD;
      1. They may need to get a midline catheter. This is a soft tube put into a vein leading to&#xD;
      the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have repeats of the screening tests throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, participants will have visits every 60 days for 6 months, every 90 days for&#xD;
      2 years, and then every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Advanced mycosis fungoides, its leukemic form Sezary syndrome (MF/SS), and adult T- cell&#xD;
           leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) are all aggressive mature T-cell malignancies which are&#xD;
           considered incurable without an allogeneic stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mogamulizumab is a defucosylated monoclonal antibody directed towards CCR4, a chemokine&#xD;
           receptor expressed by the majority of MS/SS and ATLL cells. It is approved by the United&#xD;
           States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of relapsed MF/SS, and is recommended&#xD;
           by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network for treatment of ATLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Defucosylation of mogamulizumab is thought to enhance its capacity for antibody-&#xD;
           dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC), which is mediated by natural killer (NK) cells and&#xD;
           macrophages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The immunologic effects of recombinant human Interleukin-15 (rhIL-15), a stimulatory&#xD;
           cytokine that promotes the differentiation and activation of NK cells, monocytes and&#xD;
           long- term CD8+ memory T-cells, has been assessed in several phase I trials in cancer&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant administration of rhIL-15 with mogamulizumab may further enhance the ADCC&#xD;
           capacity of the antibody and result in improved efficacy for patients with CCR4-&#xD;
           expressing cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the safety and toxicity profile and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      continuous intravenous infusion (civ) rhIL-15 administration in combination with standard&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) mogamulizumab treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed mycosis fungoides/S(SqrRoot)(Copyright)zary&#xD;
           syndrome or adult T- cell leukemia/lymphoma relapsed after or refractory to at least one&#xD;
           line of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ and marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open-label, single-center, non-randomized phase I study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard &quot;3 + 3&quot; design will be used to determine the MTD of dose-escalated rhIL-15 with&#xD;
           fixed dose of mogamulizumab, with an expansion cohort at the MTD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum 6 cycles (28-day cycles) of combination therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore all dose levels, including further evaluation in a dose expansion cohort, and&#xD;
           to account for unevaluable patients the accrual ceiling will be set at 20 patients.&#xD;
