  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is expand on the Early STEPs project goal of identifying early&#xD;
      developmental delays in infants and young children in a health disparate population and to&#xD;
      collect preliminary data to lay the groundwork for a future NIH grant proposal. Individuals&#xD;
      with less education have poor health and shorter life expectancies than well-educated&#xD;
      individuals, and research reveals that poverty is directly related to limited education. An&#xD;
      innovative approach is needed to overcome barriers, improve health literacy, and educate&#xD;
      parents on effective parenting strategies for this population. Technology may be the part of&#xD;
      the solution to this issue. Through Early STEPs, the occupational therapists will continue to&#xD;
      refer families to early intervention and therapy services as appropriate and follow-up to&#xD;
      ensure that services are initiated. The Occupational Therapist will also determine if the&#xD;
      parents are utilizing the Word Gap App and other provided resources to support their child's&#xD;
      development and to manage their stress. By increasing parental awareness and knowledge of&#xD;
      language and motor skill development, the environments of underserved children will be&#xD;
      enriched and parental stress will be reduced so that these children can have improved health&#xD;
      and reach their full potential.&#xD;

      1. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of developmental&#xD;
           screening to identify developmental delays in order to make appropriate referrals for&#xD;
           early intervention services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rationale: Research has consistently shown that providing timely early intervention (EI)&#xD;
           services for young children identified as developmentally delayed improves both&#xD;
           short-term and long-term outcomes. It is critical that children with delays be&#xD;
           identified as early as possible because intervention programs are more effective when&#xD;
           initiated at a young age. In fact, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advocates&#xD;
           identifying delays before children reach 2 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is evidence that primary care providers tend to under-detect developmental delays&#xD;
           among infants and young children. In addition, in high poverty areas, transportation,&#xD;
           finances and other logistical challenges often prevent parents of young children from&#xD;
           regularly visiting a physician, which further contributes to limited opportunities for&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Under-enrollment in intervention programs has been identified as a national problem, one&#xD;
           that is recognized as a critical issue in the Mid-South due to the lower percentage of&#xD;
           young children being identified and referred for services. Nationally, it is estimated&#xD;
           that 16-18% of children have disabilities; however, less than one-third of these cases&#xD;
           are referred for intervention before kindergarten age. Besides the issue of&#xD;
           under-identification of developmental problems in young children, research suggests that&#xD;
           many children who are referred for Early Intervention services do not end up receiving&#xD;
           therapy due to poor follow-through by caregivers. It is likely that families need&#xD;
           support and guidance regarding the importance of Early Intervention services.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Unaddressed developmental delays can negatively impact the future health and educational&#xD;
           attainment of our nation's infants. Families benefit from screening through an increased&#xD;
           awareness of appropriate developmental and behavioral expectations. For example,&#xD;
           screening can lead to positive outcomes in family interaction and decreased parental&#xD;
           stress levels when developmental information and recommendations for activities are&#xD;
           provided, even for children who do not fully meet the criteria to be referred. In the&#xD;
           Memphis area, enrollment of children under the age of 3 in EI programs has actually&#xD;
           decreased over the past five years, despite strong evidence that the incidence of&#xD;
           disabilities such as autism is on the rise. Nationally, 2.52% of young children receive&#xD;
           EI services; in Tennessee, 1.8% of children are receiving services needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study/Project Population: Through the Early STEPs Project, licensed occupational&#xD;
           therapists will provide free developmental and autism screenings to children ages birth&#xD;
           to and 6 years 11 months 29 days in a pediatric medical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Research Design: To determine the effectiveness of the Early STEPs project,&#xD;
           investigators will compare pre- and post-project referrals for EI services, follow&#xD;
           through by families, and pre and post parental satisfaction qualitative data. The&#xD;
           participating pediatric practices will provide documentation of their prior average&#xD;
           number of monthly early intervention referrals and this information will be compared to&#xD;
           the monthly number of referrals at the end of the study period. The investigators will&#xD;
           follow-up with the parent of the referred child at 6- and 12-months to determine if&#xD;
           early intervention services were initiated by the parent and to determine if the parents&#xD;
           perceived that the developmental app and online support group were helpful and improved&#xD;
           confidence with their parenting skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data collection will begin on February 3, 2014 and end in approximately 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Procedures The developmental screenings will be offered two to four days per month.&#xD;
           Informational flyers will be posted locally and in the pediatrician's offices.&#xD;
           Investigators will obtain parental consent. If parental consent is obtained, the&#xD;
           screenings will be conducted with the parent present. The process will involve the&#xD;
           parents providing qualitative information regarding the confidence with their parenting&#xD;
           skills, and the occupational therapy investigators will complete The Ages &amp; Stages&#xD;
           Questionnaire (ASQ-3) on each participant and the Modified Checklist for Autism in&#xD;
           Toddlers, if age appropriate to the particular child. All information for the screenings&#xD;
           will be collected from the parent. Researchers will not be accessing the subjects'&#xD;
           medical records. Additionally, early intervention/parental coaching sessions will be&#xD;
           provided by occupational therapists as needed. Caregivers will utilize skills training,&#xD;
           free online resources and an online social support network to develop and maintain&#xD;
           nurturing parenting skills. Follow-up phone calls will take place at 6-months and&#xD;
           12-months after a positive screening to determine if therapy services were indicated and&#xD;
           to determine if the use of online resources or the social support network were perceived&#xD;
           to be helpful. During the 6 and 12-month follow-up phone call, study personnel will&#xD;
           collect information regarding parenting confidence using the Parenting Sense of&#xD;
           Competence Scale (PSCO). Parents or caregivers will receive a free t-shirt as available&#xD;
           and a developmental flyer for participating. (Courtesy of The Urban Child Institute).&#xD;
           Parents or caregivers will receive free first year milestone applications for their&#xD;
           cellular devices (courtesy of Aimee's Babies).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Outcome Measures: The PI will monitor and report on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. number of children identified for further assessment,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. common developmental concerns/delays,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. specific services referred to,&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Caregiver follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. The investigators will collect data using the PSCO regarding parenting confidence&#xD;
                at the initial visit and during the 6 and 12-month follow-up phone call.&#xD;
