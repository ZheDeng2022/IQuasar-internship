  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subacromial Impingement Syndrome (SIS) is a pathology resulting from mechanical repetitive&#xD;
      compression and inflammation of the supraspinatus tendon, subacromial bursa and biceps tendon&#xD;
      under the acromion and the coracoacromial ligament. It is the most common cause of shoulder&#xD;
      pain, with an incidence of 44-65%. Restriction of the range of motion, along with the pain in&#xD;
      the anterior region of the shoulder, is the main reason for disability and decreased quality&#xD;
      of life in patients with SIS. Physical exercises to improve the range of motion,&#xD;
      strengthening, and flexibility is the main part of treatment. The subacromial-subdeltoid&#xD;
      bursa corticosteroid injection is shown to decrease pain during the exercise program and&#xD;
      increase participation in the treatment. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      supervised exercise program and home-based exercise program after subacromial-subdeltoid&#xD;
      bursa corticosteroid injection in patients with SIS.&#xD;

      Subacromial Impingement Syndrome (SIS) is a pathology resulting from mechanical repetitive&#xD;
      compression and inflammation of the supraspinatus tendon, subacromial bursa and biceps tendon&#xD;
      under the acromion and the coracoacromial ligament. It was first described in 1972 by Neer.&#xD;
      Neer described SIS as a progressive syndrome with three stages, beginning with chronic&#xD;
      bursitis and proceeding to partial and complete tears of the supraspinatus tendon, which may&#xD;
      extend to rupture of other parts of the rotator cuff and may also involve the long biceps&#xD;
      tendon. SIS is one of the most common causes of shoulder pain and disability reasons in both&#xD;
      primary and secondary care. It is characterized by functional impairment of shoulder resulted&#xD;
      from the progressive limitation of both active and passive glenohumeral movements.&#xD;
      Restriction of the range of motion (ROM) along with the pain in the anterior region of the&#xD;
      shoulder that gets worse with arm elevation or overhead activities is the main reason for&#xD;
      decreased quality of life in patients with SIS. Therapeutic exercise programs are commonly&#xD;
      used treatment methods in relieving pain and improving ROM and muscle elasticity. It was&#xD;
      shown that such programs are more effective in reducing pain and improving functional loss&#xD;
      than placebo in both short- and long-term. However, the optimal exercise regimen with the&#xD;
      variety, frequency, and intensity exercises is still unclear. It is also controversial if a&#xD;
      supervised exercise program is superior to a prescribed home-based exercise program. An&#xD;
      efficient exercise program should target all structures affected by subacromial impingement.&#xD;
      Therefore, both supervised and home-based exercise programs must involve rotator cuff and&#xD;
      scapular stabilizing muscle strengthening, stretching and active-assistive range of motion&#xD;
      exercises and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation exercises. Corticosteroid injection&#xD;
      into the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa is shown to increase participation, decrease pain&#xD;
      during the exercise program, and found to be effective for symptomatic impingement. The&#xD;
      analgesic effect provides significant improvement of functions mainly in the short-term.&#xD;
      Therefore, some physicians prefer corticosteroid injections alone in the treatment of SIS.&#xD;
      However, it was found that the combination of corticosteroid injection and exercise program&#xD;
      is significantly superior to corticosteroid injections alone. Ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      subacromial-subdeltoid bursa injections are shown to have better outcome results than blind&#xD;
      injections for both pain and overall shoulder function. This study aims to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of supervised exercise and home-based exercise programs after ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      subacromial-subdeltoid bursa corticosteroid injection in patients with SIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with SIS will be included and randomized into two groups. Both groups will&#xD;
      receive subacromial-subdeltoid bursa 1 ml (7 mg/ml) betamethasone and 4 ml of 0.5%&#xD;
      bupivacaine injection. The injection will be performed ultrasound-guided while the patient is&#xD;
      in a sitting position with the lateral approach. The first group will perform their exercises&#xD;
      under the supervision of the physiotherapist in the hospital. The second group will be taken&#xD;
      to the home-based exercise program in a brochure format. Thus, both groups will receive the&#xD;
      same exercises every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain will be assessed with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), active and passive ROM will&#xD;
      be measured with a goniometer before injection, immediately, first hour, third week, and&#xD;
      third month after the injection. The quality of life will be evaluated by Short Form 36, and&#xD;
      disability will be questioned by Shoulder Pain and Disability Index before injection and&#xD;
      third week and third month after injection.&#xD;

    <description>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a questionnaire developed to assess pain and disability related to shoulder problems. Pain dimension has 5 questions regarding the pain severity. Functional activities are assessed with 8 questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use. Each question is scored between 0 and 10, and high scores indicate increased severity and high scores indicate increased severity (0 = no difficulty and 10 = so difficult it require help) .The validity and reliability of the questionnaire in Turkish were conducted by Bumin et al.</description>
