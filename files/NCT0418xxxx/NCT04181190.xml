      Real-life, observational, retrospective, multicenter study to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      anti-IL5 biological treatments on blood total IgE Levels in atopic patients with severe&#xD;
      eosinophilic asthma.&#xD;

      Severe asthma, i.e. asthma that is not controlled despite maximal optimized therapy and/or&#xD;
      that worsens when high dose treatment is decreased (GINA guidelines - available at&#xD;
      https://ginasthma.or), is a major unmet medical need. Major advances in the management of&#xD;
      severe asthma occurred in the past few years due to the new targeted biological therapies.&#xD;
      Mepolizumab and Benralizumab are humanized monoclonal antibodies able to block interleukin&#xD;
      (IL)-5 and the receptor for IL-5, respectively. These biological treatments block the&#xD;
      eosinophilic driven inflammation. The effects of these treatments on an other key effector&#xD;
      molecule of the T2-immune response, i.e. IgE, is virtually unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore this issue, we set up a real life, observational, retrospective, multicenter&#xD;
      study. The study will enroll patients with severe eosinophilic asthma already treated with&#xD;
      Mepolizumab or Benralizumab. The following variable will be collected before the the&#xD;
      biological treatment and at 4±2 months after the initiation of the pharmacological regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  demographic data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age of onset of asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  smoking habit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  concomitant pharmacological regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of asthma exacerbations since last visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  concomitant diseases (particularly gastroesophageal reflux, nasal polyposis, atopic&#xD;
           dermatitis, obesity, anxiety-depressive syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  White Blood Cell Count and Differential (and in particular the levels of total&#xD;
           leucocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils and basophils)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung function tests (spirometry)&#xD;
