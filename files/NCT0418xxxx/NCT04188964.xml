      BUR-CL207 is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized Phase 1/2 study in pediatric patients&#xD;
      with XLH initiating treatment with burosumab at &lt;12 months of age. The study includes a total&#xD;
      treatment period of up to 48 weeks across 3 cohorts. Subjects will be enrolled in 2 age&#xD;
      subgroups: (1) ≥6 months to &lt;12 months of age, and (2) &lt;6 months of age at initiation of&#xD;
      burosumab treatment. Cohorts will aim to include 3 subjects per cohort depending on the&#xD;
      starting dose of burosumab and relative response of patients to treatment as assessed by&#xD;
      serum phosphate levels and by the treating physician (Investigator). Cohorts will commence in&#xD;
      a staggered manner starting with Cohort 1, followed by Cohorts 2 and 3, which may start in&#xD;
      parallel after an adequate observation period (4 weeks) in Cohort 1 and with approval from&#xD;
      the Sponsor's Medical Monitor and the DSMB. The cohorts are defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: pediatric subjects with XLH and hypophosphatemia (serum phosphate below the&#xD;
           age-adjusted lower limit of normal [LLN]), and age from ≥6 months to &lt;12 months of age&#xD;
           at initiating treatment with burosumab with starting dose of 0.4 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: pediatric subjects with XLH and hypophosphatemia (serum phosphate below the&#xD;
           age-adjusted LLN), and age from ≥6 months to &lt;12 months of age at initiating treatment&#xD;
           with burosumab with a starting dose of 0.8 mg/kg (upon Data Safety Monitoring Board&#xD;
           [DSMB] confirmation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: pediatric subjects with XLH and hypophosphatemia (serum phosphate below the&#xD;
           age-adjusted LLN), and &lt;6 months of age at initiating treatment with burosumab with a&#xD;
           starting dose of 0.4 mg/kg (upon DSMB confirmation). Following enrollment of the first 3&#xD;
           or 4 subjects in Cohort 3, an interim population PK/PD evaluation may be performed to&#xD;
           determine whether the starting dose for the cohort can be increased to 0.8 mg/kg.&#xD;
