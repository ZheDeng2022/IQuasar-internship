    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most common cancer, accounting for 20% of cancer-related deaths worldwide.&#xD;
      In 2015, an estimated 610,200 patients (22 per cent of cancer-related deaths) died of lung&#xD;
      cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer ((NSCLC)) accounts for 80% to 85% of lung cancer. Most&#xD;
      patients are locally advanced or metastatic diseases at the time of diagnosis. Some IIIA&#xD;
      tumors are considered resectable, but many IIIA (with larger N2) and IIIB (T4, any NM0, any&#xD;
      TN3M0) are not considered suitable for surgery. Since the 1990s, simultaneous radiotherapy&#xD;
      and chemotherapy ((CHRT)) has become the cornerstone of (NSCLC) in locally advanced non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). At present, there is no clinical evidence of survival benefits of&#xD;
      synchronous radiotherapy plus TKI targeted therapy for unresectable stage Ⅲ A and stage Ⅲ B&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer. However, a HELPER STUDY study was conducted to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of continuous intravenous infusion combined with EP regimen plus&#xD;
      concurrent radiotherapy in the treatment of unresectable stage Ⅲ NSCLC. The median survival&#xD;
      time was 34.7 months and the 3-year survival rate was 47.7%. Anlotinib capsule is a small&#xD;
      molecule multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This is a single group partitioned,&#xD;
      multicenter, exploratory clinical study to observe and evaluate the safety and tolerance of&#xD;
      anlotinib hydrochloride combined with cisplatin plus etoposide or pemetrexed in the treatment&#xD;
      of locally advanced NSCLC patients. To determine the maximum tolerable dose of (MTD) and / or&#xD;
      stage II clinical recommended dose (RP2D) and evaluate its preliminary efficacy. In the first&#xD;
      stage of this study, 12 patients with locally advanced NSCLC were divided into 3 experimental&#xD;
      groups. After taking three different doses of anlotinib combined with platinum simultaneous&#xD;
      radiotherapy, the dose limited toxicity was observed, and the maximum tolerable dose was&#xD;
      determined in the second stage. 78 patients were enrolled according to RP2D, and the indexes&#xD;
      such as ORR were evaluated. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of anlotinib combined with&#xD;
      platinum-containing simultaneous radiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced NSCLC.&#xD;

      Lung cancer is the most common cancer, accounting for 20% of cancer-related deaths worldwide.&#xD;
      In 2015, an estimated 610,200 patients (22 per cent of cancer-related deaths) died of lung&#xD;
      cancer. Non-small cell lung cancer ((NSCLC)) accounts for 80% to 85% of lung cancer. Most&#xD;
      patients are locally advanced or metastatic diseases at the time of diagnosis. Some IIIA&#xD;
      tumors are considered resectable, but many IIIA (with larger N2) and IIIB (T4, any NM0, any&#xD;
      TN3M0) are not considered suitable for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the 1990s, simultaneous radiotherapy and chemotherapy ((CHRT)) has become the&#xD;
      cornerstone of (NSCLC) in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). At present,&#xD;
      there is no clinical evidence of survival benefits of synchronous radiotherapy plus TKI&#xD;
      targeted therapy for unresectable stage Ⅲ A and stage Ⅲ B non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
      However, a HELPER STUDY study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of continuous&#xD;
      intravenous infusion combined with EP regimen plus concurrent radiotherapy in the treatment&#xD;
      of unresectable stage Ⅲ NSCLC. The median survival time was 34.7 months and the 3-year&#xD;
      survival rate was 47.7%. anlotinib capsule is a small molecule multi-target tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor. Compared with bevacizumab, its anti-tumor therapy has three unique advantages: 1.&#xD;
      Inhibition of multiple targets, such as VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, c-Kit, etc., improves the&#xD;
      effectiveness against a variety of malignant tumors, mainly in the following three aspects:&#xD;
      first, it is aimed at several fatal pathways of tumor cells themselves, namely, driving gene&#xD;
      pathways. Seal them all off one by one; Secondly, blocking vascular targeting: inhibition of&#xD;
      vascular endothelial cell receptors such as VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR and so on. These three&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase receptors and their corresponding ligands play an important role in&#xD;
      angiogenesis: VEGF can proliferate cells, FGF and PDGF make vascular endothelial cells&#xD;
      chemotactic to the vicinity of the tumor to form neovascularization. Let the pericytes of the&#xD;
      blood vessels be covered to form a complete structure of the blood vessels; Finally, it can&#xD;
      inhibit both tumor cells and tumor angiogenesis: because only suppressing tumor growth, tumor&#xD;
      cells secrete some factors to save themselves, resulting in dense compensation for the&#xD;
      vascular network, so that the tumor is supplied with blood. Will madly proliferate again,&#xD;
      forming drug-resistant tumors. two。. Oral drug, convenient and effective: pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      studies on the metabolism of anlotinib in vivo have found that the peak time of the drug in&#xD;
      blood is 4 to 11 hours after administration, and the half-life is about 90 hours. Stopping&#xD;
      for one week for two weeks can keep the blood drug concentration in the treatment window&#xD;
      stably, which is safe and effective, more tolerant, convenient to use, and can improve the&#xD;
      quality of life of patients. 3. Compared with the macromolecular monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      represented by bevacizumab, the half-life of the drug is shorter, the long-term use of TKI,&#xD;
      is smaller, the corresponding side effects are less, and the incidence of adverse events is&#xD;
      lower than that of bevacizumab. In the II phase study of erlotinib combined with bevazumab,&#xD;
      the incidence of hypertension with JO25567,3 degree or above was as high as 60%, and the&#xD;
      tolerance of the patients was relatively poor. In the ALTER 0303 test, the common adverse&#xD;
      reactions in the anlotinib group were fatigue, hypertension, skin toxicity and so on, but the&#xD;
      incidence of grade 1-2 AE,SAE was lower (15.3%). And most of them can be relieved by&#xD;
      symptomatic treatment or reduction, and the safety of the drug is good. This study was a&#xD;
      clinical study on the treatment of locally advanced unresectable NSCLC with anlotinib&#xD;
      hydrochloride combined with platinum-containing simultaneous radiotherapy. To observe and&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerance of anlotinib hydrochloride combined with cisplatin plus&#xD;
      etoposide or pemetrexed in the treatment of locally advanced NSCLC patients. To determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerable dose of (MTD) and / or stage II clinical recommended dose (RP2D) and&#xD;
      evaluate its preliminary efficacy. In the first stage of this study, 12 patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC were divided into 3 experimental groups. After taking three different doses of&#xD;
      anlotinib combined with platinum simultaneous radiotherapy, the dose limited toxicity was&#xD;
      observed, and the maximum tolerable dose was determined in the second stage. 78 patients were&#xD;
      enrolled according to RP2D, and the indexes such as ORR were evaluated. To evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of anlotinib combined with platinum-containing simultaneous radiotherapy&#xD;
      in the treatment of locally advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Administration regimen: anlotinib (21 days as a cycle, 2 weeks, 1 week). Group 1: 8mg po&#xD;
           qd, Group 2: 10mg po qd, Group 3: 12mg po qd;&#xD;
&#xD;
           Combined chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cisplatin 50 mg 2, ivgt, D1, 8, 29, 36, etoposide 50 mg 2, ivgt, D1-5, 29-33; Or PC:&#xD;
           carboplatin AUC2, paclitaxel 45-50 mg 2 per week; Cisplatin 25 mg 2, ivgt, D1-3, 22-24,&#xD;
           pemetrexed ivgtt,500 mg/m2,ivgtt,d1, d22; (non-squamous cell carcinoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Simultaneous radiotherapy: 3D-CRT or IMRT external radiotherapy (60-66 Gy, 2.0 Gy /&#xD;
           day).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The curative effect was evaluated after 6 weeks of simultaneous radiotherapy and&#xD;
           chemotherapy combined with alotinib, and then the efficacy of alotinib or chemotherapy&#xD;
           was maintained until PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Observation index.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Main outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phase I main outcome measures: maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose limited toxic (DLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Main indicators of II: objective remission rate (ORR). Secondary indicators: disease&#xD;
           control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Administration cycle: patients with complete remission of (CR), partial remission of&#xD;
           (PR) and stable (SD) continued to give drugs until disease progression (PD), intolerable&#xD;
           toxicity or patients asked for withdrawal or progression of (PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Effectiveness evaluation and analysis: effectiveness evaluation is conducted every two&#xD;
           cycles (the time is based on the number of calendar days and is not affected by drug&#xD;
           withdrawal), and the evaluation time is within 7 days of the end of the cycle (except&#xD;
           statutory holidays). CT should be performed in the evaluation (CT evaluation is&#xD;
           recommended every two cycles and PET-CT evaluation is performed once a year). The&#xD;
           imaging techniques used in the evaluation of the same patient should be the same, and&#xD;
           all imaging data should be retained.5. Treatment of possible toxic and side effects of&#xD;
           anlotinib hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of phase I anlotinib monotherapy tolerance test showed that the main adverse&#xD;
      reactions associated with alrotinib hydrochloride were hand and foot syndrome, hypertension,&#xD;
      albuminuria, diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia and albuminuria,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia. Hyperglycemia and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 hand and foot Syndrome (Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome)). Hand and foot&#xD;
      syndrome is palm-foot sensation dull or limb turn red, obvious discomfort, swelling,&#xD;
      tingling, pressure or stress area performance is more obvious. Tumor patients can occur&#xD;
      during chemotherapy or molecular targeted therapy. Grade 1 showed painless mild skin changes&#xD;
      or dermatitis (such as erythema, edema, hyperkeratosis), grade 2 showed painful skin changes&#xD;
      (such as exfoliation, blisters, bleeding, swelling, excessive keratosis). Affect tool daily&#xD;
      life activities; Grade 3 showed severe skin changes (exfoliation, blistering, bleeding,&#xD;
      edema, hyperkeratosis) with pain and affected personal activities of daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with grade 1 toxicity, there is often no need for support treatment, grade 2 or&#xD;
      above toxic patients consider the following symptomatic support treatment: including:&#xD;
      strengthen skin care, keep the skin clean, avoid secondary infection, avoid pressure or&#xD;
      friction; Use moisturizing creams or lubricants, topical lotions or lubricants containing&#xD;
      urea and corticosteroids, and local antifungal or antibiotic treatments if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Hypertension. Blood pressure should be monitored daily for the first 6 weeks of this&#xD;
      study. If there is an increase in blood pressure, it is necessary to actively communicate&#xD;
      with the doctor. When blood pressure rises, conventional antihypertensive therapy can be&#xD;
      controlled. For uncontrollable increases in blood pressure, they can also be alleviated by&#xD;
      reducing the amount of targeted drugs or stopping them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suggestions on staging and routine treatment of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension refers to a pathological increase in blood pressure, which is repeatedly&#xD;
      measured over and over 140/90mmHg. Severity rating:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 1: prehypertension (systolic blood pressure 120-139, diastolic blood pressure 80-89&#xD;
      mmHg) there is no indication of antihypertensive drugs, only blood pressure is monitored.&#xD;
      Grade 2: the first stage of hypertension (systolic blood pressure 140159mmHg, diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure 90-99mmHg), the need for medical intervention, repeated or lasting (greater than or&#xD;
      equal to 24 hours), symptomatic systolic blood pressure increased more than 20mmHg or the&#xD;
      previous normal range increased more than 140mmHg; Blood pressure needs to be monitored with&#xD;
      single drug treatment, and most of them use thiazide diuretics, but also consider angiotensin&#xD;
      converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), angiotensin Ⅱ receptor blocker (ARB), β receptor blocker&#xD;
      and calcium channel blocker. Stage 3: stage II hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater&#xD;
      than or equal to 160mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100mmHg);&#xD;
      requires medical intervention; requires a variety of drugs, usually thiazide diuretics and&#xD;
      ACEI or beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. Level 4: life-threatening (e.g. malignant&#xD;
      hypertension, transient or persistent nerve damage, hypertension crisis); requires emergency&#xD;
      treatment. At present, there is no unified classification at home and abroad. Recently, it&#xD;
      has been divided into two types from the point of view of clinical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main results are as follows: (1) hypertensive emergency (Hypertension emergencies),&#xD;
      diastolic pressure &gt; 120 mmHg, is associated with acute or progressive target organ damage,&#xD;
      such as cerebral infarction, intracranial or subarachnoid hemorrhage, hypertensive&#xD;
      encephalopathy, etc. Among them, progressive or rapid hypertension based on chronic essential&#xD;
      hypertension was the most common (about 40% to 50%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2) (Hypertension urgencies), diastolic blood pressure &gt; 120 mmHg in hypertensive emergency&#xD;
      was not accompanied by or only slight organ damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium nitroprusside or nifedipine was used to reduce blood pressure rapidly, diazepam and&#xD;
      phenobarbital were used to stop convulsions, furosemide and mannitol were dehydrated, sodium&#xD;
      excretion and intracranial pressure were reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of hypertension crisis, the patient should stop taking the drug and withdraw&#xD;
      from this clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3 treatment of diarrhoea. Patients with grade 1 or 2 diarrhea can be given supportive&#xD;
      treatment, such as the earliest onset of Lopebutylamine (such as oral administration of 4 mg,&#xD;
      and then oral 2mg every 2 hours until diarrhea is relieved).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4 Management of Digestive tract Hemorrhage. Gastrointestinal bleeding, including fecal&#xD;
      occult blood (+ +), hematemesis or bloody stool, should be treated actively. Patients with&#xD;
      upper gastrointestinal bleeding should fast, stop acid, protect gastric mucosa, stop bleeding&#xD;
      (hemostatic cyclic acid, standing hemostasis, etc.), transfusion and supporting treatment,&#xD;
      and octreotide can be used if necessary. Patients with lower gastrointestinal bleeding should&#xD;
      be given hemostasis, blood transfusion and supporting treatment, etc.; if the bleeding is&#xD;
      uncontrollable, surgical assistance should be requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.5 suggestions for the treatment of albuminuria. During the whole period of treatment,&#xD;
      proteinuria was closely monitored in all patients, and 24-hour urinary protein determination&#xD;
      should be performed in those with a history of hypertension and two consecutive times of&#xD;
      urinary protein ≥ + +.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the occurrence of albuminuria, the principles of dose adjustment are as follows:&#xD;
      urinary protein + or &lt; 3g/24h continue to be given according to the plan and symptomatic&#xD;
      treatment; If albuminuria ≥ 3G for 24 hours, the administration was suspended and treated&#xD;
      symptomatically until the urine protein &lt; 3g/24h lowered a dose level and continued to be&#xD;
      administered. If the dose is reduced, the second occurrence of urinary protein ≥ 3g 24 hours,&#xD;
      can be restored to &lt; 3g/24h and then reduced by one dose level of treatment. However, if the&#xD;
      third occurrence of urinary protein ≥ 3g 24h, the test would be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 4 degrees proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) occurs, the drug will be permanently&#xD;
      discontinued and withdrawn from this clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.6 Management of hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia. The pre-treatment state and eating habits&#xD;
      of patients with hyperlipidemia should be taken into account. In addition to diet, grade 2 or&#xD;
      higher hypercholesterolemia (≥ 7.75mmol/L), or grade 2 or higher hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 2.5&#xD;
      times the normal upper limit), HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (atorvastatin, etc.) or&#xD;
      appropriate lipid-lowering drugs should be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose adjustment of anlotinib hydrochloride. In the event of drug-related toxicity, the&#xD;
      toxicity was graded according to NCI CTCAE (version 4.0).&#xD;

        vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin, heparin or their analogues. On the premise that the&#xD;
        international standardized ratio of prothrombin time (INR) ≤ 1.5, low dose heparin (6000U /&#xD;
        d for adults) or low dose aspirin (not exceeding 100U / d) is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Urine routine showed that urinary protein ≥ + +, or 24-hour urinary protein quantity ≥&#xD;
        1.0g; 10. The bleeding symptoms in the first 3 months have obvious clinical significance or&#xD;
        definite bleeding tendency, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic ulcer, positive&#xD;

        cerebral infarction), deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        twelve。. The patients participated in clinical trials of other antineoplastic drugs within&#xD;
        4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
