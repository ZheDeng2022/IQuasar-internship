  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In German cardiac rehabilitation clinics the number of patients with reduced ejection&#xD;
      fraction is continuously increasing since years. Approximately 2,000 patients with cardiac&#xD;
      diseases were treated per year per clinic and LVEF &lt; 40% was often found in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean length of stay in the rehabilitation clinics is 21 days, which gives the chance and&#xD;
      the necessity to optimize not only medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, all relevant baseline parameters (indication for rehabilitation, all clinical&#xD;
      diagnoses, age, sex, BMI, echocardiographic parameters such as LVEF or diastolic dysfunction,&#xD;
      laboratory parameters corresponding to the recording standard of the clinic, etc.) will be&#xD;
      recorded in an electronic CRF. Medical treatment is recorded at the drug class level and&#xD;
      enquires about the use of the following drug classes: betablockers (BB) (yes/no), angiotensin&#xD;
      converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) (yes/no), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) (yes/no),&#xD;
      aldosterone receptor antagonist (yes/no) and diuretics (yes/no). Furthermore, treatment&#xD;
      according Guideline ESC 2016 (yes/no) will be recorded in all patients at initial&#xD;
      presentation and follow-up as well as if recommended target dose was reached (yes/no). New&#xD;
      York Heart Association (NYHA) quantification of heart failure symptoms will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, NT-proBNP at baseline and, if available, at discharge, Quality of Life (SF-12),&#xD;
      anxiety and depression (HADS-D) will be determined and non-drug therapy including nutrition&#xD;
      (minimal nutrition assessment = MNA) (5) and exercise (patient exercise diary) will be&#xD;
      investigated during inpatient rehabilitation and follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge, patients will be contacted by mail after three and twelve months. Here,&#xD;
      general questions about drug therapy and dosages, re-hospitalizations especially in&#xD;
      connection with HFrEF are recorded in a standardized questionnaire. If postal response cannot&#xD;
      be achieved, a telephone contact will be carried out. Drug therapy with special regards to&#xD;
      HFrEF will be documented by comparing drug lists at demission to the patient reported drugs,&#xD;
      which are taken at time of follow-up. The patient will be asked whether medication has been&#xD;
      changed and if so, why, and who changed it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observational design of the project allows no exact calculation of sample size, however,&#xD;
      inclusion of 500 patients is aimed (50 patients per site).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be described using summary statistics: mean, standard deviation,&#xD;
      median, 25% and 75% percentiles, and minimum and maximum values. Categorical variables will&#xD;
      be described using number and percent per category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For comparison of change from clinic entry endpoints, which are normally distributed&#xD;
      variables, the paired sample t-test will be used. The Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used&#xD;
      to assess skewed change variables, which do not meet the normality assumption. For&#xD;
      categorical variables, the chi-square test will be employed. Statistical analyses were&#xD;
      performed using SPSS® software, V24 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois).&#xD;
