      This project will use the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) to guide the development of&#xD;
      optimized treatment strategies for the two most effective smoking cessation medications&#xD;
      (Combination Nicotine Replacement [C-NRT] and varenicline). The investigators will recruit&#xD;
      daily smokers from primary care to participate in a fully crossed, 2x2x2x2 factorial&#xD;
      experiment (N=608) that evaluates 4 different factors: 1) Medication Type (Varenicline vs.&#xD;
      C-NRT), 2) Preparation Medication (4 Weeks vs. Standard), 3) Medication Duration (Extended&#xD;
      [24 weeks] vs. Standard [12 weeks]); and 4) Counseling (Intensive vs. Minimal). Participants&#xD;
      will complete assessments one week pre-quit and then assessments of smoking status, treatment&#xD;
      use, side effects, potential treatment mechanisms (e.g., withdrawal, self-efficacy) during&#xD;
      the first week post-target quit date (TQD) and at Weeks 2, 4, 12, 20, 26, and 52 post-target&#xD;
      quit date. These data will be used to examine the main and interactive effects of these four&#xD;
      factors on various outcomes, with biochemically confirmed 12-month abstinence serving as the&#xD;
      primary outcome. These data will also be used to determine which factors and combinations of&#xD;
      factors are most effective with regard to 12-month biochemically confirmed abstinence and&#xD;
      cost, thereby identifying optimized varenicline and C-NRT treatments, with each developed to&#xD;
      yield especially great benefit. These optimized treatments will then be tested in the&#xD;
      Optimized Care Project. The investigators will also examine the relative effects of each&#xD;
      medication on particular outcomes (e.g., 12-month abstinence).&#xD;

      Design and Objective: The Cessation Screening Project is a 4-factor factorial screening&#xD;
      experiment (i.e., 2x2x2x2 = 16 experimental conditions) designed to identify the most&#xD;
      promising intervention components that are especially effective and cost-effective with&#xD;
      regard to their main and interactive effects on 12-month biochemically verified abstinence.&#xD;
      This design will allow us to: 1) detect main effects and interactions within the factorial&#xD;
      experiment and identify especially effective regimens for varenicline and for (Combination&#xD;
      Nicotine Replacement) C-NRT; 2) compare the relative effectiveness of varenicline and C-NRT;&#xD;
      and 3) identify the most effective and cost-effective counseling intensity to use with the&#xD;
      optimized medication regimens. Finally, these results will allow us to identify two optimized&#xD;
      treatment packages for use with primary care smokers interested in quitting: packages that&#xD;
      include both counseling and pharmacotherapies optimized on the bases of effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Participants: Participants (N=608) will be primary care patients from 12&#xD;
      primary care clinics in two Wisconsin healthcare systems. Smokers will be identified via the&#xD;
      healthcare system electronic health record (EHR). All EHR-identified smokers in a clinic will&#xD;
      receive a mailed invitation to find out more about smoking treatment by calling a healthcare&#xD;
      system Care Manager (CM). In addition, using an opt-out strategy, Medical Assistants (MAs),&#xD;
      using an EHR-guided prompt, will inform all identified smokers seen at in-person or&#xD;
      tele-health visits that they will be contacted by the CM unless the participant indicates&#xD;
      s/he wants to opt-out. The participant contact information will then be automatically sent to&#xD;
      the CM unless the participant opts out; the investigators have developed and used this&#xD;
      workflow successfully in their past research. The CM will call and tell patients about the&#xD;
      smoking cessation options available for them including the availability of this smoking&#xD;
      cessation study. If patients are interested, the CM will obtain oral assent for screening and&#xD;
      sharing contact, primary care team, and screening data with the research team before&#xD;
      screening patients for eligibility. Eligible patients will learn more about the study and&#xD;
      have a chance to ask questions and provide verbal informed consent. Finally, participants&#xD;
      will complete a brief series of questions and then the CM will schedule a call with the study&#xD;
      staff (i.e., a Health Counselor) in the database to initiate treatment and complete study&#xD;
      assessments. Participants interested in quitting but not eligible for this study will be&#xD;
      electronically referred to the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line and/or their primary care provider&#xD;
      (PCP) by the CM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who agree to and pass the screening for the inclusion/exclusion criteria for study&#xD;
      participation will be asked to complete an oral consent and HIPAA authorization process next.&#xD;
      After the patient provides oral consent, the CM will notify the patient's PCP via EHR that&#xD;
      the patient has volunteered for a study with C-NRT or varenicline. The PCP will notify the CM&#xD;
      via the EHR that the patient is medically eligible to receive either agent, as required by&#xD;
      the collaborating healthcare systems. This will occur within 5 business days. The PCP will be&#xD;
      notified via EHR of the patient's treatment assignment and of study-related serious adverse&#xD;
      events or adverse events that prompt medication discontinuation that may occur. Care&#xD;
      coordination with the PCP will occur via Tobacco Care Manager entry of data in the patient&#xD;
      EHR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures and Measures: At the second study call, participants (N=608) will be randomized to&#xD;
      one level of each of 4 factors: 1) Medication Type (Varenicline vs. C-NRT), 2) Preparation&#xD;
      Medication (4 weeks vs. Standard), 3) Medication Duration (Extended vs. Standard), and 4)&#xD;
      Counseling (Intensive vs. Minimal). Participants will be told their treatment condition at&#xD;
      Call 2, set a target quit date (TQD), and instructed how to use their study medications.&#xD;
      Medications will be mailed following this call, along with a handout that describes: 1) when&#xD;
      to begin taking study medication; 2) the type and doses involved; 3) how and when to obtain&#xD;
      the next month's medication; and 4) complete instructions on proper medication use, including&#xD;
      information from the package insert and contact information if they have questions regarding&#xD;
      their medication and/or symptoms they experience. Participants will be mailed all Preparation&#xD;
      Medication as well as one month of post-quit study medication after Call 2. They will need to&#xD;
      call in to a study line to request that more medication be mailed to them (Standard Duration&#xD;
      participants will call one time to receive their final 2 months of medication; Extended&#xD;
      Duration participants will call once to get 2 additional months of medication and again to&#xD;
      get the remaining 3 months of study medication). Participants will also receive a counseling&#xD;
      handout with their medications; those randomized to intensive counseling will receive a Quit&#xD;
      Plan listing their target quit day and when they start the medications and those randomized&#xD;
      to minimal counseling will receive the mobile health (mHealth) handout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete phone assessments one week pre-quit, during the first week&#xD;
      post-target quit date (TQD) and at Weeks 2, 4, 12, 20, 26, and 52 post-TQD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary outcome for this study is biochemically confirmed, point-prevalence&#xD;
      abstinence at 12 months post-TQD (Primary Aim 1). The secondary outcome is cost effectiveness&#xD;
      in which the costs of implementing each intervention (minus research-related costs) will be&#xD;
      computed from a payer perspective. Costs will be combined with the intent-to-treat&#xD;
      biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 12 months post-TQD to determine&#xD;
      the cost per quit.&#xD;

Participants who smoke 5-10 cigarettes/day will be given 22 weeks of 14 mg patches and then 2 weeks of 7 mg patches. Participants will receive 2 mg mini-lozenges. Participants will receive four 15-20 minute phone or video counseling sessions (1 prior to the TQD, 1 during the first week post-TQD and during Weeks 2 and 4 post-TQD). The counseling is designed to produce intra-treatment support and skill training, consistent with the Public Health Service (PHS) Clinical Practice Guideline.</description>
