  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of second trimester&#xD;
      medical abortion when provided by nurse midwives compared with physicians. The study sample&#xD;
      will be obtained from Michu Clinic, affiliated with St Paul's hospital, in Addis Ababa.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 10% of all abortions globally take place at or after 13 weeks gestation. Women seeking&#xD;
      second-trimester abortion services are often the most vulnerable and socially disadvantaged&#xD;
      population.Studies show the rate of second-trimester abortion procedures remains stable over&#xD;
      time, even in high-access locations, confirming the ongoing need for accessibility to&#xD;
      services in rural locations with limited access to care. In Ethiopia, second-trimester&#xD;
      abortion services are widely available in Addis Ababa, making up a high proportion of the&#xD;
      total number of abortions occurring each year in the country; however, access to accurate and&#xD;
      reliable data is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization recommends that abortion can be provided at the lowest level of&#xD;
      the healthcare system (WHO abortion guidelines). Training mid-level providers, such as&#xD;
      midwives, nurses and other non-physician providers, to conduct second trimester aspiration&#xD;
      abortions is proposed as a way to increase women's access to safe abortion procedures and has&#xD;
      been highlighted by the WHO as an area in which rigorous research is needed (WHO task-sharing&#xD;
      guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators seek to conduct a comparative study of patients undergoing second trimester&#xD;
      medical abortion provided by either physicians or nurse midwives.&#xD;
