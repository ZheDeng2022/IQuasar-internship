  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New treatments have been developed for asthma that are good at preventing asthma attacks and&#xD;
      improving day-to-day symptoms. Alongside the development of these new drugs, there are new&#xD;
      ways of measuring how the lung is affected by asthma. In particular, investigators have&#xD;
      developed ways of seeing how air moves in the lungs of people with asthma, using MRI&#xD;
      scanning. This study aims to see how quickly these new drugs result in changes in the way the&#xD;
      lung is working, as seen in the MRI scans and other breathing tests. This will help&#xD;
      clinicians in the future to decide who is likely to respond to these new medicines, and once&#xD;
      patients have started taking the drugs, will help clinicians to decide whether long term&#xD;
      treatment is likely to benefit the people receiving them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators plan to do extra breathing tests and MRI scans on people who&#xD;
      are receiving the drug as part of their usual clinical care. The study will not change an&#xD;
      individual's treatment, but will give the investigators more information about the patients'&#xD;
      illnesses and the way the patients' bodies respond to treatment.&#xD;

        This is a pragmatic, cohort feasibility study, the primary aim of which is to determine&#xD;
        which parameters of functional and structural lung MRI change over what time course after&#xD;
        the introduction of a anti-eosinophil strategy in people with eosinophilic asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        At present, the first-line licensed choice for anti-eosinophil therapies is mepolizumab,&#xD;
        which has been shown to be effective at reducing exacerbations of asthma. Mepolizumab is&#xD;
        given every 4 weeks. Benralizumab has two possible advantages over mepolizumab: swifter&#xD;
        onset, and less frequent administration (it is given 4 weekly for the first three&#xD;
        injections, then 8 weekly). People who would be eligible for either therapy will be offered&#xD;
        a choice of participating in this clinical study or receiving mepolizumab through standard&#xD;
        NHS pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Candidate patients will be identified in severe asthma clinics at Sheffield Teaching&#xD;
        Hospitals and through the associated clinics at Rotherham, Doncaster, Barnsley and&#xD;
        Chesterfield.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  People with eosinophilic asthma meeting the National Institute for Health and Clinical&#xD;
             Excellence (NICE) criteria for benralizumab therapy based on eosinophil count and&#xD;
             exacerbation rates will be offered the chance to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical illness that in the opinion of the investigator is likely to significantly&#xD;
             impact on the response to benralizumab or the outcome of the MRI and lung function&#xD;
             testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-concordance with routine asthma therapies (this would be assessed as a mandatory&#xD;
             part of NICE-based criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any additional significant lung illness that would impact on likelihood of response to&#xD;
             benralizumab. Of note, trivial stable bronchiectasis that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             patient's clinician is not clinically significant nor likely to result in either&#xD;
             recurrent exacerbations or impairment of interpretation of investigation results will&#xD;
             not be exclusion criteria. Part of the initial inclusion regarding eligibility by NICE&#xD;
             criteria include an assessment of a likely eosinophilic asthmatic phenotype with&#xD;
             probability of treatment response, and potential subjects with complex lung disease&#xD;
             would be unlikely to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current cigarette smoking, or cigarette smoking within the past 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant lifetime smoking history of â‰¥20 pack years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous use of another biologic therapy targeting eosinophils within 6 months of&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy, planning pregnancy, or breast feeding. Women of childbearing potential must&#xD;
             use effective contraception (concordant use of hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine&#xD;
             device, total abstinence), and urine pregnancy tests will be performed before scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal renal function (eGFR &lt;30), to avoid risks from Gadolinium chelate MRI&#xD;
             contrast agents.&#xD;
