  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) are frequently described as&#xD;
      unified airway inflammatory diseases. Both heavily impacts quality of life with substantial&#xD;
      productivity loss. They share the same pathophysiologic pattern based upon proTh2 immune&#xD;
      response with blood eosinophils recruitment. Eosinophils are the major actor of persistent&#xD;
      mucosal inflammation by promoting their own survival, by attracting other inflammatory cells&#xD;
      and by producing cytotoxic proteins involved in mucosal remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Promising anti-Th2 therapeutic approaches (i.e.anti-IgE, anti-interleukin 5 (IL-5),&#xD;
      anti-IL-4, anti-IL-13) are considered as effective alternative options to long-term&#xD;
      corticosteroid treatment. Their advantage in recalcitrant CRSwNP is under consideration.&#xD;
      Moreover, we still need to delineate the good responders to improve theirs indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to assess blood eosinophil immunophenotypes in asthma or CRSwNP. Flow&#xD;
      cytometric expression of activation markers on eosinophil membrane will be compared with a&#xD;
      group of healthy subjects. Innovative data on eosinophil involvement in airway diseases will&#xD;
      be obtained. The major outcome will be to depict patients' endotypes for a better selection&#xD;
      of immunotherapies.&#xD;

        All patients for the study will be targeted either during hospitalization in Pneumology for&#xD;
        uncontrolled asthma patients, during ENT visit for scheduling of sinus surgery&#xD;
        (recalcitrant CRSwNP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        The healthy subjects are going to be screened in the Clinical Investigation Center of the&#xD;

&#xD;
        For all groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Social insured patient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient willing to comply with all procedures of the study and its duration&#xD;

          -  Provision of signed and dated informed consent form prior to any study specific&#xD;
             procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        For Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Patients with moderate to severe uncontrolled asthma, confirmed by relevant clinical&#xD;
        symptoms and proven variable airway obstruction, and assessed by an expert pulmonologist&#xD;
        according to spirometry criteria (absolute and weighed Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV) and&#xD;
        Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) before and after 2 test),(see CRF for details). Uncontrolled&#xD;
        asthma will be defined by an ACQ score ≥ 1.5. or acute exacerbation&#xD;
