    <textblock>
      This multicenter study conducted in several Portuguese institutions aims to compare the&#xD;
      screening ability of the several Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) validated versions for the&#xD;
      Portuguese population (GDS-30, GDS-15, GDS-10 and GDS-5), as well as to establish their&#xD;
      psychometric properties, using a large sample of elderly people with neurocognitive disorders&#xD;
      attending social responses addressed to the elderly. Secondarily, cognitive state will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is the most common mental health problem among older people, both in Portugal and&#xD;
      around the world. Due to the fast aging of the world population, depression is a significant&#xD;
      problem, with an estimated prevalence between 8% and 16%, which is more common in&#xD;
      institutionalized elderly. Several studies have shown the negative consequences of depression&#xD;
      in the elderly, which has been associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates,&#xD;
      increased use of health services and increased costs. In addition, older people's depression&#xD;
      is associated with major disability, chronic health problems, higher suicide rates, dementia&#xD;
      and a lower quality of life. However, it is often an unrecognized, and therefore untreated,&#xD;
      problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under these circumstances, screening people at risk of depression (people with chronic&#xD;
      illness, stroke, dementia, institutionalized or attending social responses, etc.) is a&#xD;
      strategy with potential to reduce the impact of depression among the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most commonly used screening scales for depressive symptoms in elderly is the&#xD;
      Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), a widely known and widely used scale designed specifically&#xD;
      for older people. For this reason, it does not include questions related to somatic symptoms,&#xD;
      as they lack discriminatory value in older people, because they can be attributed to other&#xD;
      physical conditions or the aging process. The original version of the scale is composed by 30&#xD;
      items with a dichotomous response (yes/no) assessing motivation, energy, past and future&#xD;
      orientation, mood, cognitive complaints, anxiety and irritability. The GDS scale has good&#xD;
      psychometric properties and has been evaluated in a wide range of geriatric populations,&#xD;
      institutionalized patients, elderly with chronic health problems, people with dementia, etc.&#xD;
      In order to achieve better time efficiency in its administration, the original 30-item scale&#xD;
      was abbreviated to a 15-item version. Posteriorly, multiple shorter versions of this scale&#xD;
      were developed, composed by one, four, five, ten or twelve items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GDS scale has been widely translated and validated worldwide. In Portugal, the GDS-30 was&#xD;
      adapted and validated by Pocinho, Farate, Dias, Lee and Yesavage. The versions of GDS-15,&#xD;
      GDS-10 and GDS-5 were adapted and validated by Apóstolo and colleagues having demonstrated&#xD;
      good psychometric properties and, therefore, potential as a screening tool for depressive&#xD;
      symptoms in older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the screening ability of the several validated versions&#xD;
      for the Portuguese population of the GDS scale (GDS-30, GDS-15, GDS-10 and GDS-5), as well as&#xD;
      to establish their psychometric properties, using a large sample of elderly patients&#xD;
      attending social responses addressed to the elderly. This study will allow recommendations on&#xD;
      which is the most sensitive GDS version for detecting depressive symptoms by comparing them&#xD;
      with other depression screening scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this, the results of the several GDS versions will be compared with the&#xD;
      application of a gold standard, the Beck-II Depression Inventory [BDI-II].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the BDI-II, it is important to mention its good psychometric characteristics when&#xD;
      used in the elderly population, which were evident in studies that compared the psychometric&#xD;
      characteristics of different scales used to assess depression in the elderly. I was concluded&#xD;
      that this instrument obtained a test-retest value of 0.93, Cronbach's α ranged from 0.76 to&#xD;
      0.91 in elderly Americans, in a community-dwelling elderly, in Puerto Rican residents, in&#xD;
      elderly with heart problems, and in women living in institutions for the elderly. In elderly&#xD;
      clinical samples, Cronbach's α ranged from 0.89 to 0.92. BDI is significantly and positively&#xD;
      correlated with CES-D (r = 0.69, p &lt;0.001) and with GDS (r = 0.71, p &lt;0.001). The clinical&#xD;
      utility of BDI-II is proven and high because of its clinical sensitivity and consistency with&#xD;
      the DSM-IV criteria. In addition, it identifies many depressive symptoms and is one of the&#xD;
      most commonly used instruments in the elderly without cognitive decline and also in&#xD;
      non-clinical samples, as it is brief and easily administered and scored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, in another study where BDI-II was applied to elderly people with cognitive&#xD;
      deficits, it was found that this population has symptoms similar to those of young people and&#xD;
      adults, supporting the validity of this instrument in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to reinforce the assessment of the screening ability of the several GDS versions&#xD;
      validated for the Portuguese population, as well as to establish their psychometric&#xD;
      properties, a sample (estimated at about 25%) will be defined, in which the GDS will be&#xD;
      compared with a gold standard, that will consist of a semi-structured interview guide based&#xD;
      on the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) for&#xD;
      depressive disorders. For this sample, a questionnaire will be answered by the professionals&#xD;
      who perform the evaluation, regarding their opinion about which GDS version is more easily&#xD;
      understandable by the participants and the participants' preference regarding the different&#xD;
      versions of GDS, as a means of assessing which version is more discernible for the&#xD;
      participants. All the GDS versions validated for the Portuguese population (GDS-30, GDS-15,&#xD;
      GDS-10 and GDS-5) will be administered to these participants.&#xD;
