  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to answer the questions: 1) Within food supplementation&#xD;
      options, are mailed stock boxes superior to food vouchers in terms of achieving glycemic&#xD;
      control? 2) Is the combination of mailed stock boxes and food vouchers superior to either&#xD;
      food supplementation option alone? 3) Does providing diabetes education in combination with&#xD;
      food supplementation lead to improved clinical outcomes compared to education alone? To&#xD;
      address this gap in the literature, we propose a randomized controlled trial to test the&#xD;
      separate and combined efficacy of monthly food vouchers to farmers market and monthly mailed&#xD;
      food stock boxes layered upon diabetes education in improving glycemic control in low income,&#xD;
      food insecure, AAs with Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) using a 2x2 factorial design.&#xD;

      The overarching aim of this proposal is to conduct a 4-arm RCT to test the separate and&#xD;
      combined efficacy of monthly food vouchers to farmers market and monthly mailed food stock&#xD;
      boxes layered upon diabetes education in improving glycemic control in low income, food&#xD;
      insecure, AAs with T2DM using a 2x2 factorial design. 300 patients will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to four groups of 75 patients each: 1) diabetes education alone; 2) diabetes education plus&#xD;
      food vouchers; 3) diabetes education plus mailed stock boxes; and 4) diabetes education plus&#xD;
      combined food vouchers and mailed stock boxes. Each patient will be followed for 12 months,&#xD;
      with study assessments at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Primary aim is efficacy of separate&#xD;
      and combined interventions on HbA1c at 12 months post-randomization. Secondary aims are&#xD;
      efficacy of separate and combined interventions on BP, LDL and QOL as well as&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness at 12 months post-randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the LIFT-DM Intervention Group 1 - Diabetes Education Only: Individuals&#xD;
      assigned to this group will receive diabetes education and skills training but will not&#xD;
      receive food supplementation. Twelve 30-minute weekly sessions will be delivered via the&#xD;
      telephone, with two 30-minute booster sessions at months 6 and 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 - Diabetes Education Plus Monthly Food Vouchers: Individuals assigned to this group&#xD;
      will receive diabetes education and skills training and monthly food vouchers for use at&#xD;
      local farmer's markets mailed to their home. Vouchers for $50 will be mailed monthly for 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 - Diabetes Education Plus Monthly Stock Boxes: Individuals assigned to this group&#xD;
      will receive diabetes education and skills training and monthly stock boxes with diabetes&#xD;
      appropriate food items mailed to their home. Stock boxes with foods valued at $50 will be&#xD;
      mailed monthly for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4 - Diabetes Education Plus Combination of Monthly Food Vouchers and Stock Boxes:&#xD;
      Individuals assigned to this group will receive diabetes education and skills training,&#xD;
      monthly food vouchers for use at local farmer's markets mailed to their home, and monthly&#xD;
      stock boxes with diabetes appropriate food items mailed to their home. Vouchers for $25 and&#xD;
      stock boxes with food valued at $25 will be mailed monthly for 12 months. In essence, the&#xD;
      combined group will still receive $50 worth of food supplementation monthly as combination of&#xD;
      $25 vouchers and $25 mailed stock boxes.&#xD;
