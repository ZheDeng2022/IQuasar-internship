  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether the presence of a bacterial fluorescent signature&#xD;
      captured by the MolecuLight i:X can predict a skin graft failure. The MolecuLight i:X is a&#xD;
      handheld medical device which enables real-time standard digital imaging and fluorescence&#xD;
      imaging of wounds and surrounding healthy skin of patients. When wounds are illuminated in&#xD;
      fluorescence mode, collagen and other related proteins in the connective tissue matrix may&#xD;
      emit a characteristic green fluorescent signal, while some bacteria may emit a unique red&#xD;
      fluorescence signal due to endogenous porphyrin production and others may emit a unique cyan&#xD;
      fluorescence signal due to the production of pyoverdine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-randomized evaluation for which 20 adult patients will be imaged at University&#xD;
      Hospitals Birmingham who present with a wound which has been previously infected and which&#xD;
      requires a skin graft. The i:X will be used to take standard and fluorescent (FL) images of&#xD;
      each graft site by the study team. The wound will be measured using the measurement&#xD;
      application of the i:X, using WoundStickers. The clinician will be blinded to the results of&#xD;
      these FL images until the end of the study. In this trial, the device is not intended to&#xD;
      guide treatment. The images will be used after a 1-month patient follow up to correlate&#xD;
      presence of bacterial fluorescence signature to graft failure. The hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      presence of a bacterial fluorescence signature increases the likelihood of graft failure. The&#xD;
      ability to predict graft failure would provide clinicians with more information on which to&#xD;
      base a patient's suitability for a graft (e.g. determining if there is a heavy bacterial load&#xD;
      present). This may lead to selection of appropriate therapies before a graft is applied.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized evaluation for which 20 adult patients will be imaged at University&#xD;
      Hospitals Birmingham who present with a wound which has been previously infected and which&#xD;
      requires a skin graft. The MolecuLight i:X Imaging Device will be used to take standard (ST)&#xD;
      and fluorescent (FL) images of each graft site. The MolecuLight i:X will also be used to take&#xD;
      measurements of the wound using the measurement feature of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient has identified as being suitable for the trial, the study will be introduced&#xD;
      to them by a member of their circle of care. They will be provided with an informed consent&#xD;
      form, provided time to consider the study and have any of their questions answered. The&#xD;
      patient will be asked to sign and date the ICF if they choose to participate in the study.The&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited for a period of 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The execution of the full protocol is expected to take approximately 15 minutes during a&#xD;
      single clinic visit for each study subject. During the clinic visit, the clinician will treat&#xD;
      the patient based on their clinical practice. Prior to the application of the skin graft, the&#xD;
      Moleculight i:X will be used to take standard and fluorescent (FL) images of each graft site&#xD;
      by the study team. The wound will be measured using the measurement application of the i:X,&#xD;
      using WoundStickers. Following imaging the skin graft will be applied and treatment will&#xD;
      continue as per the clinician's clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinician will be blinded to the results of these FL images until the end of the study.&#xD;
      In this trial, the device is not intended to guide treatment. There will be a follow-up with&#xD;
      each patient at 1 month after the grafting procedure to ask if the grafting procedure was&#xD;
      successful. There will not be any imaging or sampling required at the time of follow-up. The&#xD;
      information gathered will be used for post-hoc analysis to assess if the presence of a&#xD;
      fluorescence signal at the time of imaging is correlated to graft failure.&#xD;
