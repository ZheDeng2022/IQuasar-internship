  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NVS Therapy is being studied to evaluate the safety and efficacy to facilitate retention&#xD;
      of acute luminal gain, leading to acute hemodynamic improvement in superficial femoral and&#xD;
      popliteal arteries with reference vessel diameters between 4.0 and 7.0 mm and lesion lengths&#xD;
      less than or equal to 56mm.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, open label Phase 1 study to assess the&#xD;
      safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy trends to applying NVS therapy to de&#xD;
      novo lesions in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and the proximal popliteal artery (PPA)&#xD;
      during percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in patients with life-style limiting&#xD;
      claudication due to obstructive SFA and proximal popliteal artery atherosclerosis. Each&#xD;
      investigator will receive supervised training for each procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility to participate in the study is determined during the screening period and prior&#xD;
      to the index procedure with the NVS therapy. Study Data will be analyzed through the Day 365&#xD;
      follow-up visit.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        General Description of Subject Population: Adults with symptoms of claudication and/or rest&#xD;
        pain (Rutherford Classification 2, 3, or 4) (see Appendix 3) and angiographic evidence of&#xD;
        an atherosclerotic lesion of the superficial femoral artery and/or proximal popliteal&#xD;
        artery ≥70% diameter stenosis and &lt; 100% stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must meet all of the following general eligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject is at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject (or legally authorized representative [LAR]) understands the study&#xD;
             requirements and the treatment procedure and provides written informed consent before&#xD;
             any study-specific tests or procedures are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is eligible for PTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is willing to comply with all protocol required follow-up evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has documented Rutherford Classification 2 to 4 (see Appendix 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has laboratory test results that are within clinically acceptable limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. In investigator's opinion, subject is hemodynamically stable at the time of the index&#xD;
             procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject has a life expectancy of ≥ 1 year in the opinion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject is able to tolerate the insertion of a 7F sheath into the common femoral&#xD;
             artery (CFA), as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
