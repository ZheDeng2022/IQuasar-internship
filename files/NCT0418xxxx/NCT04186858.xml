  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-visit, non-randomized, bilateral, cross-sectional study. In a pre-screening&#xD;
      assessment, potential subjects will be invited to complete a web-based questionnaire that is&#xD;
      validated to determine symptomatic vs asymptomatic contact lens wearers. Results of this&#xD;
      questionnaire will be used to determine whether subjects are eligible to proceed to Visit 1.&#xD;
      During Visit 1, cell samples will be collected from the front surface of the subject's eyes.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential subjects must satisfy all of the following criteria to be enrolled in the&#xD;
             study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and&#xD;
                  receive a fully executed copy of the form&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this clinical&#xD;
                  protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Be between 18 and 45 years of age (inclusive) at the time of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. They have worn the same brand of soft contact lenses for at least the previous&#xD;
                  three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. They agree not to participate in other clinical research trials for the duration&#xD;
                  of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. In a pre-study screening assessment, they must have a CLDEQ-8 score of 10 or less&#xD;
                  (asymptomatic group) or 20 or higher (symptomatic group).&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. They possess a wearable pair of distance glasses and agree to bring these to the&#xD;
                  study visit (if needed for distance vision correction).&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. They can attain a high contrast logMAR visual acuity of 0.20 or better in their&#xD;
                  habitual contact lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Their habitual contact lenses fit satisfactorily.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from&#xD;
             participating in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Currently pregnant or lactating&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Any systemic disease (e.g., Sj√∂gren's Syndrome), allergies, infectious disease&#xD;
                  (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis), contagious immunosuppressive diseases (e.g.,&#xD;
                  HIV), autoimmune disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis), or other diseases, by&#xD;
                  self-report, which are known to interfere with contact lens wear and/or&#xD;
                  participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. They have an ocular disorder which would normally contraindicate contact lens&#xD;
                  wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. They have had cataract surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. They have had corneal refractive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. They have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid lens wear&#xD;
                  or have keratoconus.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. They have taken part in any other contact lens or care solution clinical trial&#xD;
                  research, within two weeks prior to starting this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. They are regularly (once per day or more) using oral or inhaled steroids or&#xD;
                  anti-inflammatory medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. They are using any topical medications such as eye drops or ointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. History of allergic reaction to sodium fluorescein or topical anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. Use of systemic medications (e.g., chronic steroid use) that are known to&#xD;
                  interfere with contact lens wear&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. Employee or immediate family member of an employee of clinical site (e.g.,&#xD;
                  Investigator, Coordinator, Technician).&#xD;
&#xD;
              13. They have Grade 3 or greater of any of the following ocular surface signs:&#xD;
                  corneal edema, corneal vascularization, corneal staining (white light&#xD;
                  evaluation), tarsal conjunctival changes or any other abnormality which would&#xD;
                  normally contraindicate contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
              14. Any active ocular infection or inflammation.&#xD;
