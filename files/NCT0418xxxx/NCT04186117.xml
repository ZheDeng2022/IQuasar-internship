      In the light of literature data, it becomes crucial to develop models for studying the&#xD;
      functionality of CTCs. In this context, xenograft models in nude mice have recently been&#xD;
      described9,10. Establishing cell lines to allow CTC amplification to have enough material to&#xD;
      work is an attractive approach. Some recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of&#xD;
      establishing such tools in breast or prostate cancer, 11, 12 but no studies have been done&#xD;
      for colorectal cancer. Thus on the basis of the hypothesis that circulating tumor cells could&#xD;
      be, or at least contain, cancerous stem cells, we propose to isolate them under conditions&#xD;
      that promote their survival in order to characterize them in the particular context of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If CTCs consist at least in part of CSCs, they should survive in an environment favorable to&#xD;
      the culture of these cells. It is for this reason that purified CTCs will be seeded in&#xD;
      plaques that prevent cell adhesion and in a serum-free medium but including growth factors&#xD;
      (M12) under hypoxia conditions to approximate their original context. The ability of these&#xD;
      cells to form spheres will be observed under these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the team of the Institute of Functional Genomics of Montpellier are the&#xD;
      first, to have developed and characterized three lines of CTC from blood samples of patients&#xD;
      with metastatic colon cancer (Grillet F. and al; submitted for publication). In addition to&#xD;
      the characterization of these rare cells and the decryption of some of the mechanisms&#xD;
      involved in tumor dissemination, this tool is very valuable for the clinic. Indeed, it could&#xD;
      help the establishment of personalized medicine to test quickly (less than 3 weeks) on the&#xD;
      CTC of the patient, the effectiveness of conventional treatments but also new drugs included&#xD;
      in clinical protocols. For the basic research part, this line will help us to characterize&#xD;
      these cells because the number is no longer a limiting factor, the main objective now being&#xD;
      to obtain more lines from a blood sample from patients with different profiles by optimizing&#xD;
      cell culture conditions.&#xD;
