    <textblock>
      Another term for myelodysplastic syndrome is bone marrow failure. The bone marrow is where&#xD;
      components of blood such as red cells, platelets and white cells are made. In bone marrow&#xD;
      failure, the ability for bone marrow to make these cells is decreased. In myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndrome, this decreased bone marrow function is believed to result from abnormalities that&#xD;
      prevent the normal maturation process by which bone marrow cells develop into red blood&#xD;
      cells, white blood cells and platelets. In myelodysplastic syndrome, these abnormal bone&#xD;
      marrow cells occupy space in the bone marrow and prevent the function of remaining normal&#xD;
      bone marrow cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One approach to treating the abnormal growth of immature cells is to give chemotherapy which&#xD;
      damages DNA within these cells and causes their death. Unfortunately, such therapy has&#xD;
      side-effects, since even normal cells can be affected by the treatment. Both 5-azacitidine&#xD;
      (5AZA) and decitabine (DEC) are FDA-approved to treat MDS. In this study, 5AZA and DEC will&#xD;
      be administered using an alternating low doses schedule in an attempt to overcome the known&#xD;
      mechanisms of resistance to the administration of 5AZA or DEC as single agents caused by&#xD;
      automatic adaptive shifts in DNA metabolism.&#xD;

      This will be a single arm, open label pilot study of 5AZA-alt-DEC. Participants will be&#xD;
      treated for a minimum of 24 weeks in the absence of clear evidence of progressive disease.&#xD;
      Participants who have any response will be permitted to continue treatment until relapse or&#xD;
      progression of disease that is not sensitive to protocol defined dose escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine Overall Response Rate (ORR) of&#xD;
      5AZA-alt-DEC. The combined response endpoint will include complete response (CR), partial&#xD;
      response (PR), and hematologic improvement (HI), with HI criteria specifically as defined by&#xD;
      IWG criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints of this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cumulative incidence of response for both CR and overall response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of response (DOR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety evaluation by tabulation of adverse events of grade 3 and higher&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlative endpoints include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation of DNMT1 depletion with clinical response criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation of clinical response with disease biological phenotype measured by&#xD;
           morphology and cytogenetics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exploratory measurements of pyrimidine metabolism pre-treatment and on-therapy&#xD;

             or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform the&#xD;
             treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants with known active HIV infection, as this will further increase the risk&#xD;

             viral load by PCR, without opportunistic infection, and on a stable regimen of&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy would be eligible.&#xD;
