      This is an open-label, historically controlled pilot study investigating the immune effect of&#xD;
      Laser Interstitial ThermotHerapy (LITT)+ pembrolizumab in adult patients with a primary&#xD;
      cancer approved by the FDA for treatment with an immune-checkpoint inhibitor who have&#xD;
      recurrent brain metastasis after prior stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).&#xD;

      Adult patients with a primary cancer approved by the FDA for treatment with an&#xD;
      immune-checkpoint inhibitor who have recurrent brain metastasis that have failed stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery treatment will be screened. They will sign consent and complete screening&#xD;
      procedures. Each patient will be scheduled to undergo biopsy and LITT treatment. Within two&#xD;
      weeks of surgery, patients will begin receiving pembrolizumab every three weeks.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab infusions will continue until brain met recurrence per RANO for Brain Mets or&#xD;
      up to two years, whichever comes first. Blood samples will be collected for immune&#xD;
      monitoring. Tumor tissue will be collected for immune and genomic studies. Approximately 21&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled to accrue 15 evaluable subjects. Patients will be followed for&#xD;
      survival data for one year or until death, whichever comes first.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. History of active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 2&#xD;
             years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or&#xD;
             immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or&#xD;
             physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency,&#xD;
             etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.&#xD;

             acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period and for at least 24&#xD;
             weeks after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Known active hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA&#xD;
             [qualitative] is detected) infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Known history of active TB (bacillus tuberculosis).&#xD;
