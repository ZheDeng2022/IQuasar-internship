  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, it has been proposed that the consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners, including&#xD;
      sucralose, it's not harmless and is related with metabolic effects. Some studies have&#xD;
      reported that sucralose produces alterations in glucose homeostasis. In vitro studies&#xD;
      indicate that sucralose is capable of interacting with sweet taste receptors (T1R2 and T1R3)&#xD;
      in the intestine, thus increasing the expression of glucose transporters including the&#xD;
      sodium-glucose cotransporter type 1 (SGLT1) and the glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), increasing&#xD;
      glucose absorption. This interaction with intestinal sweet taste receptors also generates an&#xD;
      increase in the secretion of the incretins glucagon-like peptide type 1 (GLP-1) and the&#xD;
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), which might enhance the postprandial&#xD;
      insulin release. However, these results are preliminary and it's desirable to confirm if&#xD;
      sucralose consumption is associated with glucose metabolism modifications using an&#xD;
      appropriate methodological design and with gold standard methods. The aim of this&#xD;
      triple-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, randomized clinical trial is to confirm the&#xD;
      changes in insulin sensitivity associated with sucralose consumption in humans, to identify&#xD;
      whether these changes are in the liver or skeletal muscle and to investigate the&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms generating these changes. Specifically, we will investigate if&#xD;
      sucralose generates a dysbiosis in the gut microbiota that could be related to insulin&#xD;
      resistance by increasing concentrations of lipopolysaccharide, a toxin present in&#xD;
      Gram-negative bacteria that triggers a low grade inflammation known as metabolic endotoxemia.&#xD;
      In addition, the changes in postprandial concentrations of GLP-1, glucose, insulin and&#xD;
      C-peptide due to the combination of sucralose with a mixed meal will be investigated. The&#xD;
      results of this study will determine if sucralose consumption, frequently used as a&#xD;
      non-nutritive sweetener, is associated to significant changes in glucose homeostasis in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a triple-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated to observe a difference of 15% in insulin sensitivity based on&#xD;
      two outcomes: glucose rate of appearance (Ra) and glucose rate of disappearance (Rd) obtained&#xD;
      from the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp to measure the liver and skeletal muscle&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculation was done considering a probability of type I error (α) of 5%, with a power of&#xD;
      90% and adding an extra 20% for potential losses at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated sample size for the study is 24 subjects, 12 per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups (sucralose or placebo)&#xD;
      using the website Randomization.com (http://www.randomization.com) with a balanced block&#xD;
      design of 4 blocks with 6 subjects each. The random allocation sequence will be done by an&#xD;
      external researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will consist of capsules filled with pure sucralose or placebo (cornstarch)&#xD;
      accordingly to the group assignment. Each capsule will contain 90 mg of sucralose or placebo.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to consume one capsule in each meal (three per day) in order to&#xD;
      achieve an ingestion of 270 mg of sucralose or placebo, this quantity corresponds&#xD;
      approximately to the 30% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of sucralose for a lean person.&#xD;
      This was calculated based on the ADI established by the joint Food and Agriculture&#xD;
      Organization of the United Nations (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) expert committee on&#xD;
      food additives (JECFA) of 15 mg per kg of body weight per day of sucralose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of identical capsules will allow the blinding, the capsules will be deposited in&#xD;
      bottles numbered sequentially according to the enrollment process and neither the&#xD;
      participants nor the researches will know the content of the capsules or the group assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be performed in order to confirm that participants&#xD;
      do not have diabetes or prediabetes. Fasting insulin, lipid profile and glycated hemoglobin&#xD;
      will be measured. Also, anthropometry (weight, height, waist and hip circumference), blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart rate will be documented. Body composition will be evaluated with dual&#xD;
      X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) already available in the Research Unit and bioelectrical&#xD;
      impedance. Physical activity will be registered with the questionnaire from the University of&#xD;
      Laval that measure energy expenditure in Kcal per day. A format for three-day food intake&#xD;
      record will be given to be prospectively registered by participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp (HEGC) will be done in this visit.&#xD;
      Tracers will be administrated during the first 3.5 hours. The first phase of the HEGC will&#xD;
      use an insulin infusion of 14 milliunits (mU)/m2 of BSA/min to evaluate hepatic insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity. The second phase of the HEGC will use an insulin infusion of 50 mU/m2 of body&#xD;
      surface area (BSA)/min to evaluate skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. Each phase has an&#xD;
      approximately duration of two to three hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three-day food record will be requested and reviewed to evaluate food consumption habits.&#xD;
      A mixed meal tolerance test will be performed over two hours. The meal will consist of 523&#xD;
      kcal (49% carbohydrates, 17% protein, 34% lipids). Blood samples will be collected at 0, 30,&#xD;
      60, 90 and 120 minutes to measure glucose, insulin and glucagon-like peptide type 1 (GLP-1)&#xD;
      concentrations. Also, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6&#xD;
      (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) concentrations will be measured at the basal&#xD;
      time. Ten minutes before the test participants will consume a capsule containing either&#xD;
      sucralose or placebo (120 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will proportionate the first stool sample to evaluate gut microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will proportionate the bottle with capsules that each participant will&#xD;
      consume during the intervention period (30 ± 2 days) in this visit. Also, each participant&#xD;
      will be asked to record on the adherence format if they consumed the capsule at breakfast,&#xD;
      lunch and dinner each day of the intervention period and to record any symptom related to&#xD;
      capsules ingestion. Another format to record three-day food consumption again will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second HEGC will be done in this visit following the same procedure as explained in visit&#xD;
      2. Participants will proportionate the second stool sample to evaluate changes in gut&#xD;
      microbiota. Also, the physical activity questionnaire will be applied again and the second&#xD;
      3-day food record will be obtained to evaluate changes in physical activity and food habits,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second mixed meal tolerance test will be performed following the same procedures as visit&#xD;
      3. Participants will be asked to return the empty bottles to quantify adherence to the&#xD;
      intervention. In addition adherence and symptoms formats will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to assist one month after visit 5 to make a final evaluation of&#xD;
      fasting glucose, insulin and lipid profile concentrations. The physical activity&#xD;
      questionnaire will be applied again and a third 3-day food record will be collected to&#xD;
      evaluate changes in physical activity and food habits, respectively.&#xD;
