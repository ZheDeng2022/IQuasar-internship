  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A majority of obese asthmatic children report increased dyspnea on exertion (DOE) as their&#xD;
      primary asthmatic symptom. DOE in obese asthmatic children is typically attributed to&#xD;
      bronchoconstriction, which is a phenomenon of acute airway narrowing that typically occurs&#xD;
      after exercise and responds to treatment with bronchodilators. However, obesity itself can&#xD;
      alter breathing mechanics and increase mechanical ventilatory constraints during exercise,&#xD;
      which can provoke DOE. Unfortunately the role of obesity in causing DOE is underappreciated&#xD;
      during diagnosis/management of DOE in asthmatic children with obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this study is to better understand the respiratory mechanisms&#xD;
      provoking DOE in obese asthmatic children to inform directive management for clinicians. Our&#xD;
      overarching hypothesis is that low lung volume breathing predisposes obese asthmatic children&#xD;
      to mechanical ventilatory constraints in the presence or absence of bronchoconstriction, and&#xD;
      that DOE attributable to bronchoconstriction will respond to bronchodilators while DOE&#xD;
      attributable to obesity-specific mechanical ventilatory constraints will not respond to&#xD;
      bronchodilators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use an exercise-testing model to concurrently assess obesity-related respiratory&#xD;
      limitations and asthma-related bronchoconstriction in 9-17-year-old asthmatic children with&#xD;
      and without obesity. We will use a detailed and comprehensive physiological exercise-testing&#xD;
      approach to uncover respiratory mechanisms for DOE in 9-17-year-old nonobese and obese&#xD;
      asthmatic children who do and do not bronchoconstrict. Presence or absence of&#xD;
      bronchoconstriction will be assessed using a comprehensive measure of airway function change&#xD;
      during exercise (i.e., ≥10% reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1s, FEV1, ≥35% increase&#xD;
      in total airway resistance, R5, or ≥40% increase in peripheral airway resistance, R5-20, will&#xD;
      be indicative of bronchoconstriction). Since bronchodilators are a standard-of-care&#xD;
      pre-exercise prescription to prevent asthma-related bronchoconstriction, we will also&#xD;
      determine the extent to which bronchodilators like albuterol and ipratropium are effective in&#xD;
      reducing DOE, bronchoconstriction, amd mechanical ventilatory constraints in asthmatic&#xD;
      children with and without obesity.&#xD;

        General inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age range: 9-17 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with physician diagnosed asthma and on regular asthma controller therapy&#xD;
             for at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment will be recruited for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             o Objectively Confirmed Asthma Diagnosis: Asthma diagnosis will be confirmed&#xD;
             objectively using spirometry (FEV1 &lt; 80% predicted or FEV1/FVC &lt; lower limit of&#xD;
             normal), bronchodilator reversibility testing (post-bronchodilator improvement of ≥&#xD;
             12% and 200mL in FEV1 or FVC; or a decrease in lung hyperinflation of at least 150 mL;&#xD;
             ATS guidelines on lung function test interpretation), or a methacholine challenge&#xD;
             test. Patients in whom asthma cannot be confirmed objectively will be excluded from&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to communicate in English&#xD;
&#xD;
        Body mass index criteria (BMI): We will study two discrete groups of asthmatic children&#xD;
        based on their BMI percentile:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nonobese: BMI 5th-84th percentile based on norms from the Centers for Disease Control&#xD;
             (CDC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Obese: BMI ≥95th percentile and less than 170% of the 95th BMI percentile based on&#xD;
             norms from the CDC&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criteria for pulmonary function: We will exclude asthmatic children with:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe asthma: Forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) &lt; 50% predicted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Restrictive pulmonary disease: Forced vital capacity (FVC) and total lung capacity&#xD;
             (TLC) &lt; 80% predicted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diffusion limitation: Diffusing capacity relative to alveolar volume (DLCO/VA) &lt; 80%&#xD;
             predicted&#xD;
&#xD;
        Daily activity levels: Children participating in regular vigorous conditioning exercise&#xD;
        such as running, jogging, aerobics, cycling, or swimming for ≥60min/session and ≥five times&#xD;
        per week will be excluded to ensure similarity in physical activity levels between subjects&#xD;
        and to avoid enrolling a potential high-fit, extremely active child. Children who&#xD;
        participate in daily, unorganized physical activity (i.e., majority of children), will not&#xD;
        be excluded. Children who are sedentary or only participate in school physical education&#xD;
        classes will not be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following exclusion criteria will be used in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of oral steroid medications for 4 weeks prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of being admitted to an intensive care unit or being intubated because of&#xD;
             their asthma in the past five years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity to albuterol or ipratropium or history of&#xD;
             narrow-angle glaucoma that could get worse with ipratropium&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of vocal cord dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of obesity hypoventilation syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of untreated sleep apnea&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of heart disease, metabolic disease, or renal disease that, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the PI (or co-I's), would increase the risks of exercise testing or alter the&#xD;
             physiological responses to exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of significant mental illness that in the opinion of the PI (or co-I's) would&#xD;
             interfere with study participation or increase risks to the participant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of musculoskeletal abnormality that would preclude cycling exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or become pregnant during their participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of other significant illnesses that, in the opinion of the PI (or co-I's),&#xD;
             either increase risks of participation or alter the physiological responses to&#xD;
             exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to successfully complete pulmonary function or exercise testing measurements&#xD;
             or difficulty with following instructions during testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to tolerate testing procedures or complications related to testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a participant develops hypoxemia or meets indications for terminating exercise, the&#xD;
             exercise test will be terminated, and the participant will be referred for further&#xD;
             evaluation In general, all participants will be encouraged to follow up with their&#xD;
             asthma care provider or pediatrician for any health concerns that are discovered&#xD;
             during their participation.&#xD;
