  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In daily clinic, the use of treadmills to analyze the gait quality of a patient increases.&#xD;
      The advantages of using a treadmill are that a smaller space is needed compared to a 3D lab&#xD;
      for motion analysis, more steps can be recorded in shorter time period and patients should&#xD;
      not start, stop or rotate during the analyses. One of the systems which can be used to&#xD;
      perform motion analysis on a treadmill is the GRAIL. This GRAIL (Gait Real-time Analysis&#xD;
      Interactive Lab) consists of an advanced treadmill with force sensors. Patients can walk on&#xD;
      this treadmill with an imposed speed (fixed-speed) or at a speed determined by the patient&#xD;
      itself (self-paced). Because not everyone is used to walk on a treadmill it is important to&#xD;
      know if a person's walking pattern is different when he walks over ground compared to walking&#xD;
      on the treadmill. Based on these insights, decisions can be made regarding interventions&#xD;
      including treadmill training or this findings can be taking into account during further&#xD;
      analysis of walking patterns on a treadmill. For this study stroke patients would be invited&#xD;
      for an assessment on the treadmill (1 assessment moment). The movement pattern of these&#xD;
      patients would be compared in different conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (Forward and backward) Walking at comfortable walking speed on the GAITRite&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Walking at comfortable walking speed on the treadmill in fixed speed mode&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Walking at comfortable walking speed +0.2 m/s (faster walking) on the treadmill in fixed&#xD;
           speed mode&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Walking at comfortable walking speed on the treadmill in self-paced mode&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Backward walking at comfortable walking speed on the treadmill in fixed speed mode (only&#xD;
           if patients are eligible to do so)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses based on this study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do stroke patients walk different over ground compared to treadmill walking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do stroke patients walk different during treadmill walking self-paced compared to fixed&#xD;
           speed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do stroke patients walk different during treadmill walking fixed speed comfortable&#xD;
           walking speed compared to fast walking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is there a correlation between upper extremity impairment and arm swing&#xD;
