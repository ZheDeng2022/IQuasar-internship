  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson disease is a progressive neurologic disorder characterized by motor impairments&#xD;
      which alter the walking capacity, and lead to reduced walking speed, decreased stride length&#xD;
      and increased double support time. Physical therapy interventions are an important part of&#xD;
      the non-pharmacological treatment for Parkinson disease. The purpose of this study was to&#xD;
      assess whether there is a different outcome regarding improvement of walking speed, when&#xD;
      applying a physical therapy program in an individual or in a group manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, observational, cohort type study on 60 patients with Parkinson disease was&#xD;
      carried out between November 2014 - July 2017, in the Clinical Rehabilitation Hospital in&#xD;
      Cluj-Napoca, Cluj county, Romania. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups, and were&#xD;
      prescribed either individual (1 patient and 1 physical therapist) or group physical therapy&#xD;
      (6 patients and 1 physical therapist). Treatment protocol included 10 sessions of physical&#xD;
      therapy, in the same room setting and performed the same routine of exercises, except for the&#xD;
      3 breaks during the sessions in the group therapy for informal socialization. Walking speed&#xD;
      was measured by two validated instruments, the 6-minute walk test and the 10-meter walk test,&#xD;
      before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PD could benefit more from a group physical therapy program, as gait speed&#xD;
      increased significantly. The group approach facilitates interactions and is cost-effective,&#xD;
      as it requires only one therapist and more patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The current study was carried out during November 2014 - July 2017, in the Clinical&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Hospital in Cluj-Napoca, Cluj county, Romania. A total of 60 subjects&#xD;
      diagnosed with typical, idiopathic PD participated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients met the following inclusion criteria: (1) stable medication usage; (2) Hoehn and&#xD;
      Yahr stage 2, 3 or 4; (3) ability to walk independently or by using an assistive walking&#xD;
      device; (4) age 50 to 70 years; (5) no severe cognitive impairments (Mini-Mental State&#xD;
      Examination - MMSE score, â‰¥24); (6) no other severe neurologic, cardiopulmonary or orthopedic&#xD;
      disorders; and (7) not having participated in a PT or rehabilitation program in the previous&#xD;
      2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were randomly divided into 2 treatment groups: group physical therapy -GPT&#xD;
      (n=30) and individual physical therapy - IPT (n=30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment protocol for each group included 10 sessions of physical therapy, each 1.5 hour&#xD;
      long, on a daily basis for 2 weeks. All treatment sessions occurred at the same time of day&#xD;
      throughout the study, in the morning, 60-90 minutes after intake of pharmaceutical treatment&#xD;
      for PD. For the GPT, there were groups of 6 patients, supervised by 1 physical therapist. The&#xD;
      group sizes were kept small to promote efficiency and motivation. The patients undertaking&#xD;
      IPT were alone with the physical therapist during the sessions. Both groups had their&#xD;
      encounters in the same physical therapy room setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rehabilitation protocol for the IPT consisted of cardiovascular warm-up activities,&#xD;
      stretching exercises, strengthening exercises, functional, gait and balance training,&#xD;
      recreational games and ended with relaxation exercises. In addition, the GPT protocol&#xD;
      followed the exact same pattern, except for 5-10 minute breaks for informal socialization&#xD;
      between participants, at the beginning of the session, mid-session and at the end of the&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, both groups had access to external cues, which were applied during a variety of tasks&#xD;
      and environmental situations, like gait initiation and termination, heel strike and push-off,&#xD;
      sideways and backwards stepping, walking while dual tasking, and walking over various&#xD;
      surfaces and long distances. There is evidence in the literature to support each of the&#xD;
      components contained in the intervention.19-25 In order to facilitate initiation and speed of&#xD;
      movement, most activities employed visual and auditory cues as triggers. Visual cues were&#xD;
      looking at and follow the therapist's movements in the IPT group or the other group member's&#xD;
      movements in the GPT group. A mirror was also used. Auditory cues were music with regular&#xD;
      rhythm, and verbal suggestions and reinforcement from the therapist, in the IPT group or the&#xD;
      therapist and other participants, in the GPT group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the physical therapy program.&#xD;
      The evaluation included the 6-minute walking test and the 10-meter walking test. Gait speed&#xD;
      for each participant was calculated as the ratio between the walked distance and the time&#xD;
      unit, and it was measured in meters/seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each subject, all assessment sessions were performed in the morning, by the same person&#xD;
      and all tests were performed in the same order, to control for variations in performance&#xD;
      because of medication cycle. All assessments were conducted in the &quot;on&quot; state for the&#xD;
      subjects experiencing motor fluctuations.&#xD;
