        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenoid cystic carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Recurrent/Metastatic disease documented as having shown progression on a scan (CT,&#xD;
             MRI) compared to a previous scan taken at any time in the past. Progression must be&#xD;
             documented according to RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of at least one measurable target lesion for further evaluation according to&#xD;
             RECIST criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Disease that is not amenable to surgery, radiation or combined modality therapy with&#xD;
             curative intent and was previously treated with chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Karnofsky score over 60&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Previous treatment with chemotherapy, targeted agents, loco-regional therapy (e.g.&#xD;
             chemoembolization) are permitted providing that toxicity has resolved to &lt; or = grade&#xD;
             1 at study entry and that last treatment was at least 4 weeks prior to baseline&#xD;
             assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. A patient with the willingness to comply with the study protocol during the study&#xD;
             period and capable of complying with it&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A patient who signed the informed consent prior to the participation of the study and&#xD;

             study at any time without any disadvantages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A patient with no measurable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy or surgery within 4 weeks prior to study entry&#xD;

             entry)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A patient with previous active or passive immunotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;

             psychiatric disorders that are considered clinically significant by the investigator&#xD;

             interfere with the compliance of the administration of the study medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A patient with clinically significant heart disease (e.g. congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             symptomatic coronary artery diseases, cardiac arrhythmia, etc) or myocardial&#xD;
             infarction within past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Ongoing cardiac arrhythmia of grade &gt; or = 2, atrial fibrillation of any grade, or QTc&#xD;
             interval &gt; 450 msec for males or &gt; 470 msec for female.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. A patient with interstitial pneumonia or diffuse symptomatic fibrosis of the lungs&#xD;
&#xD;
