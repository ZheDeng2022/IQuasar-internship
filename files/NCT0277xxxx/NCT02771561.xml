  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a condition which involves episodes of interrupted&#xD;
      breathing during sleep due to repetitive narrowing or collapse of the throat. These episodes&#xD;
      are usually associated with a drop in blood oxygen levels and brief awakenings, which disrupt&#xD;
      the sleep of those affected and can lead to daytime sleepiness. OSA is associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of heart disease and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some individuals, the low oxygen levels in the blood can be made worse by also having a&#xD;
      small hole in the heart, called a patent foramen ovale (PFO). This hole is present at birth&#xD;
      in everyone, but in some people (about 30% of the normal population) it fails to close.&#xD;
      Usually a PFO does not cause any medical problems. However, it may be recommended to have a&#xD;
      PFO closed by key-hole surgery if someone suffers a stroke, severe migraine or if they are&#xD;
      professional divers. There is a higher incidence of PFO in patients with OSA (25-50%)&#xD;
      compared to the wider population and this may account for some of the observed increased risk&#xD;
      of heart disease and stroke in patients with OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the number of patients with OSA who also have a PFO, and whether&#xD;
      closing the PFO can improve the symptoms of OSA (e.g. sleepiness, exercise capacity and&#xD;
      general well-being), thereby enabling the patient to not be reliant on treatment for OSA. If&#xD;
      the study shows that closing the PFO is beneficial then the investigators will assess in a&#xD;
      larger study if this treatment can also reduce heart disease and strokes.&#xD;

      Under normal conditions an interatrial communication allows blood to shunt from left to right&#xD;
      due to a higher pressure in the left atrium than the right atrium and a greater compliance of&#xD;
      the right ventricle than the left ventricle. Right-to-left interatrial shunting (RLS) is&#xD;
      usually associated with spontaneous or induced pulmonary hypertension. RLS may occur&#xD;
      spontaneously during a release phase of a Valsalva manoeuvres that transiently generates a&#xD;
      right to left pressure gradient across the interatrial septum or rarely due to a condition&#xD;
      termed platypnea-orthodeoxia. The latter is characterized by dyspnoea and deoxygenation&#xD;
      accompanying a change to a sitting or standing from a recumbent position.&#xD;
      Platypnea-orthodeoxia is thought to be due to a combination of an interatrial communication&#xD;
      and an anatomical variant e.g. a persistent Eustachian valve and/or stretching and distortion&#xD;
      of atrial septum allowing more streaming of venous blood from inferior vena cava through the&#xD;
      defect when in the upright position. The recommended treatment of platypnea-orthodeoxia is&#xD;
      percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstructive Sleep Apnoea - Hypopnoea Syndrome (OSAHS) is characterised by repetitive upper&#xD;
      airway obstruction during sleep causing apnoea (cessation of breathing) and oxygen&#xD;
      desaturation. It is a significant health burden on the National Health Service (NHS) and&#xD;
      society, affecting approximately 4% middle aged men and 2% middle-aged women. The risk of&#xD;
      OSAHS rises with increasing body weight, active smoking and age. OSAHS is set to reach&#xD;
      epidemic proportions as the Western population ages and the incidence of obesity rises. About&#xD;
      1% of men in the United Kingdom (UK) have severe OSAHS with an apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI;&#xD;
      the average number of episodes of apnoeas and hypopnoeas per hour of sleep) of &gt;20 and oxygen&#xD;
      desaturation index (ODI; the number of desaturation episodes defined as ≥4% drop in oxygen&#xD;
      saturations per hour during sleep) of &gt;20, measured by nocturnal oximetry and respiratory&#xD;
      polygraphy (intermediate sleep study or Embletta™). Patients with untreated severe OSAHS have&#xD;
      a higher incidence of fatal (OR 2.87) and non-fatal (OR 3.17) cardiovascular events compared&#xD;
      to age and sex matched controls. The degree of oxygen desaturation inversely correlates with&#xD;
      survival and the link is thought to be multifactorial; raised blood viscosity due to&#xD;
      increased haematocrit, sympathetic activation leading to arrhythmias and systemic&#xD;
      hypertension are thought to be important. In a Cox model a 1% decrease in average nocturnal&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (SaO2) was associated with a 33% increase in the incident risk of fatal and&#xD;
      nonfatal cardiovascular events. Treatment with continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP)&#xD;
      ventilation at night reduces symptoms (snoring, mood, day time sleepiness and headache) and&#xD;
      cardiovascular event rate, but it is poorly tolerated and refused by up to a fifth of&#xD;
      patients. Improvement in ODI and sleepiness in OSAHS treated by CPAP is transient and when&#xD;
      CPAP is discontinued, measurements return to baseline within 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PFO is found with a higher incidence in patients with OSAHS than controls (69% vs. 17%) and&#xD;
      may exacerbate the oxygen desaturation in OSAHS during apnoeic/ hypopnoeic episodes observed&#xD;
      in some patients. In OSAHS patients with greater ODI to AHI ratio (ODI/AHI&gt;0.67), the&#xD;
      prevalence of large PFO was nine out of 15 (60%) versus two out of 15 (13%) in those with&#xD;
      ODI/AHI &lt;0.33. OSAHS is believed to raise right heart pressures and increase RLS via the&#xD;
      interatrial defect due to repeated nocturnal Valsalva and Muller manoeuvres. Prolonged oxygen&#xD;
      desaturation may further exacerbate sleep apnoea by decreasing central respiratory drive. In&#xD;
      selected populations of OSAHS patients, PFO closure may be beneficial. This has been reported&#xD;
      in a number of case reports but has not been studied in a larger trial population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RLS via a PFO in patients with severe OSAHS: ESS≥11 and ODI≥20 or ODI/AHI &gt;0.67, is&#xD;
      deleterious and closing the PFO will improve oxygen saturation, exercise tolerance, symptoms,&#xD;
      quality of life and will reduce CPAP requirement and, ultimately, will reduce the incidence&#xD;
      of fatal/ non-fatal cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the improvement of symptoms of OSA (e.g. sleepiness, exercise capacity&#xD;
      and general well-being) following PFO closure. Improving symptoms will enable patients to not&#xD;
      be reliant on treatment for OSA. If PFO closure is beneficial the investigator aims to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy of treatment to reduce heart disease and strokes in a larger study.&#xD;
