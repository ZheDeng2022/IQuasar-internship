    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is becoming more common, specifically in the western world. One of the&#xD;
      main features of this disease is weight loss and malnutrition. Although clinically common,&#xD;
      these problems are not well understood. Loss of appetite and symptoms such as tummy aches and&#xD;
      bloating are common causes for weight loss in this group of patients. This problem has a&#xD;
      strong negative effect on the patients' quality of life and significantly increases the cost&#xD;
      of treating CD. Enteroendocrine cells are nutrient sensors in the bowel that relay to the&#xD;
      brain to control food intake. Recent evidence has showed that these cells increase in number&#xD;
      in active CD and secrete more hormones that negatively affect appetite. The increased levels&#xD;
      of these hormones should have an overall negative effect on the brain and thus decrease food&#xD;
      intake, bloating, symptoms of sickness. All these symptoms lead to malnutrition. These are&#xD;
      hypotheses that require further proof. Current technological advances in magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) has enabled the mapping of changes in activity in important areas in the brain&#xD;
      that control food intake. The involvement of the brain in control of food intake is still not&#xD;
      fully understood. This work will be the first step in the right direction to start targeting&#xD;
      the problems of appetite, weight loss and a poor quality of life.&#xD;
