    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the study is to test the effectiveness and sustainability of an&#xD;
      integrated care model for managing cardiovascular risk in individuals with family history of&#xD;
      premature coronary heart disease (CHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This care model involves:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. screening for cardiovascular risk factors,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. providing lifestyle interventions for prevention and management of cardiovascular risk&#xD;
           factors,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. providing a framework for linkage to appropriate primary health care facility and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. active follow-up of intervention adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, a formative qualitative research component will gather information on&#xD;
      understanding of diseases, barriers to care, specific components of the intervention package&#xD;
      (for example, context specific ways to enhance physical activity and to reduce prolonged&#xD;
      sitting time, ways to improve diet etc.) and feedback on the intervention strategies&#xD;
      (lifestyle education, care and linkage coordination). Then a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      involving ~700 families and 1400 participants will be used to determine whether an integrated&#xD;
      care model is effective in reducing or halting the progression of CHD risk factors and risk&#xD;
      factor clustering in families. The sustainability and scalability of this intervention will&#xD;
      be assessed through economic and qualitative lenses to estimate value and acceptability.&#xD;
      Scalability will be informed by cost-effectiveness and acceptability of the integrated&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk reduction approach.&#xD;

      STUDY AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1. To identify barriers to implementing an integrated cardiovascular risk management&#xD;
      program in families of individuals with a positive history CHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2. To assess the effectiveness of an integrated cardiovascular risk management strategy&#xD;
      (consisting of screening for risk factors, lifestyle education and linkage to primary care&#xD;
      for cardiovascular risk factor management) on risk factor clustering in families, and changes&#xD;
      in blood pressure (BP), lipids, glucose, smoking and physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 3. To estimate the scalability of the integrated cardiovascular risk reduction strategy&#xD;
      in families of individuals with a positive history CHD for state- or nation-wide&#xD;
      implementation. Scalability will be informed by cost-effectiveness and acceptability of the&#xD;
      integrated cardiovascular risk reduction approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project uses mixed methods to achieve the study aims, the three design&#xD;
      approaches include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1, formative qualitative research; Aim 2, a randomized controlled trial; and Aim 3, cost&#xD;
      effectiveness and evaluative qualitative research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally a pilot study will be conducted with the aim to understand the practical&#xD;
      feasibility of the study, acceptability among participants, appropriateness of the study&#xD;
      tools and finally to explore the interests of other stakeholders (community health workers&#xD;
      and department of health service, Government of Kerala). The pilot study will include only 30&#xD;
      participants. It is essentially to check the validity of the responses elicited from the&#xD;
      tools. We also plan to conduct two focus group discussions with the potential participants&#xD;
      (individuals with family history of CHD). Additionally, 6 in-depth interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted with community health workers (convenient sampling) to assess their opinion about&#xD;
      the intervention programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formative qualitative research (Aim 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-structured focus group discussions (FGDs) of 6-12 adults with family history of CHD will&#xD;
      gather information on understanding of diseases, barriers to care, and feedback on the&#xD;
      intervention (lifestyle education, care and linkage coordination). In-depth interviews with&#xD;
      stake-holders (frontline community health care workers (FCHW), primary care physicians, and&#xD;
      general practitioners) will be face-to-face and semi-structured and will include questions&#xD;
      regarding integration of cardiovascular risk management at the family level. The intervention&#xD;
      and trial protocols will be modified to incorporate key findings collected from FGDs and&#xD;
      interviews to make the intervention more contextually-relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integrated cardiovascular risk reduction intervention (Aim 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial of families of individuals with a positive history CHD will be&#xD;
      used to address Aim 2. Eligibility criteria: Eligible families include those with at least&#xD;
      one family member with physician confirmed CHD diagnosed before the age of 55 years. If there&#xD;
      are family members who have died from CHD (physician confirmed deaths) before the age of 55&#xD;
      years, such families will be also eligible to participate in the study. The medical records&#xD;
      of CHD patients will be used to confirm the diagnosis and the age of the index case. A&#xD;
      written informed consent to the study randomization plan from the head of the family is a&#xD;
      mandatory eligibility criteria. All participating family members will also be required to&#xD;
      provide individual consent to participate. Family randomization: Each family will randomly be&#xD;
      assigned to participate in either the treatment intervention arm (integrated CVD risk&#xD;
      management) or usual care arm (no interventions other than initial screening). Participants&#xD;
      eligibility criteria: Minimum of two members from each family will be included even if they&#xD;
      reside in separate houses. Potential participants must be either parents, children or&#xD;
      brothers and sisters of the affected person (individual with history of CHD) in order to&#xD;
      enter the study and more than 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bedridden and terminally ill patients will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address Aim 2, several clinical outcomes will be assessed. Primary outcome: proportions in&#xD;
      each group achieving or improving risk factor control status (blood pressure&lt;140/90 mmHg,&#xD;
      fasting blood glucose (FPG)&lt;110 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)&lt;100 mg/dl, abstinence&#xD;
      from smoking/tobacco use: at least 3 out of 4 risk factors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. between group difference in number of optimal CV health indicators (BP&lt;120/80 mmHg,&#xD;
           TC&lt;200 mg/dl, FPG&lt;100 mg/dl, &gt;150 min/week of moderate intensity physical activity,&#xD;
           BMI&lt;25 kg/m2, never used tobacco or quit &gt;6 months ago and a healthy diet score),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. between group mean difference in main risk factors (SBP, DBP, LDL, FPG),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. proportions meeting &gt;80% of recommended process measures (smoking cessation, moderate or&#xD;
           high intensity physical activity, and &lt;5g per person/day salt consumption, &gt;3 daily&#xD;
           servings of fruits and vegetables), and 4) proportions achieving or maintaining ten year&#xD;
           Framingham CVD risk score15/WHO CVD risk score of &lt;10% or the INTERHEART non-laboratory&#xD;
           based score of &lt;5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care arm: The usual care arm will be screened for CVD risk factors. Screening results&#xD;
      plus one time education regarding management of risk factors will be provided to all family&#xD;
      members. Patients with hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia in the control arm will also&#xD;
      be referred to primary health care facility. Treatment arm: The study intervention is&#xD;
      designed to leverage the existing health care infrastructure available at the community&#xD;
      levels. Trained FCHW will be visiting the families to promote lifestyle intervention&#xD;
      strategies at least once in two months during the intervention phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists of three phases: 1) screening and detection of CV risk factors, 2)&#xD;
      lifestyle (nutritional/physical activity education and tobacco cessation) counselling 2) FCHW&#xD;
      assisted linkage to primary care and 3) active follow-up through a mobile phone application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Part 1. Screening for CV risk factors (CONTROL AND TREATMENT ARMS):&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible adults in the selected families will undergo a screening procedure for CVD risk&#xD;
      factors. The families will be randomized to either the treatment or control arm. At the start&#xD;
      of intervention program, high risk patients in the usual care arm will be referred to the&#xD;
      existing primary care system for further management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Part 2. Lifestyle Education (TREATMENT ARM):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lifestyle education intervention: The lifestyle education component of the treatment arm&#xD;
      includes a minimum of 9 nutritional/tobacco/physical activity consultations. All study&#xD;
      participants within the selected families in the treatment arm will participate in the&#xD;
      lifestyle education component. Within 30 days of study enrollment, all participants will&#xD;
      complete culturally specific food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) and tobacco use surveys.&#xD;
      FCHW will receive training from study staff prior to study implementation. Recommended diet&#xD;
      modifications for participants will focus on maintaining a healthy weight via&#xD;
      redistribution/reduction of calories (by avoiding fried foods and sugar-sweetened beverages),&#xD;
      increasing fiber and protein intake via wheat, and sprouted pulses, reducing glycaemic load&#xD;
      by switching from refined white rice and bread to whole wheat, increasing fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables consumption, and reducing salt and sugar intake. Tobacco cessation and strategies&#xD;
      to change the sedentary behaviour will also be discussed in education meetings. Current&#xD;
      tobacco users will complete culturally appropriate cessation action guides that identify&#xD;
      triggers and action steps to promote tobacco-free behaviours. Family consultations will be&#xD;
      repeated after once in every two months to re-assess dietary and tobacco use changes. FCHW&#xD;
      workers will conduct peer-support group education meetings with groups of 10 participants&#xD;
      once in every two months. Support group meetings will review diet modification and tobacco&#xD;
      cessation recommendations and highlight peers' strategies that have led to successful&#xD;
      improvement in diet. All individuals with elevated risk factors of CVD will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in at least 3 such peer-support group education during the period of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Part 3. Linkage to primary care (TREATMENT ARM):&#xD;
&#xD;
      All high risk patients from treatment arm will be linked to appropriate primary care clinics&#xD;
      with assistance from FCHW. FCHW workers will assist high risk patients to identify primary or&#xD;
      secondary care facilities and will help schedule initial appointments. For 24 consecutive&#xD;
      months following initial screening and randomization, participants from intervention arm will&#xD;
      receive quarterly phone interviews to measure primary care clinic utilization and to assess&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factor management activities (lipids examined, smoking cessation&#xD;
      programs, hypertension control, glucose monitoring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care coordination and follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each families, in the treatment arm will be assigned a FCHW. During the intervention phase&#xD;
      FCHW workers will meet with study patients once in two months to assess study progress and&#xD;
      participation in the initial six months. During intermediate-term follow-up (months 7-24)&#xD;
      FCHW will maintain once in three months contact with all families. In addition, questionnaire&#xD;
      data collection and blood draws at home visits after study months 12 and 24 will help to&#xD;
      assess detailed attributes of cardiovascular management (FBG, BP, and LDL measures). An&#xD;
      incentivized (free SMS credits) didactic mobile phone SMS platform will be used to enhance&#xD;
      follow-up. Via SMS, patients will receive study visit reminders and brief surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost effectiveness and acceptability analyses (Aim 3):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention costs will include the resource inputs (e.g., personnel salaries, and&#xD;
      materials) that are required to deliver the intervention (in total and per participant).&#xD;
      Direct and indirect costs incurred by each family will be estimated using questionnaires.&#xD;
      Questionnaires (administered at study visits 0, 12 and 24) will capture direct medical costs,&#xD;
      direct non-medical costs (travel), and indirect costs (missed work time, and lost&#xD;
      productivity). To estimate the cost-effectiveness (cost per one count decrease in clustering&#xD;
      of risk factors), the between trial group difference in intervention delivery and patient&#xD;
      direct costs will be divided by the between group difference in clustering of risk factors or&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk score: [costs treatment arm - costs standard arm]/[ΣΔPrimary&#xD;
      outcome-Treatment arm] - [ΣΔPrimary outcome-usual care arm]. Similarly, incremental cost&#xD;
      utility ratio will be calculated using data from a 12 monthly health utility assessment.&#xD;
      Quality adjusted life years (QALY) will be used as the measure of health utility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acceptability of the interventions will be assessed through qualitative research.&#xD;
      Semi-structured FGDs (6 each in men and women) will be conducted among study participants at&#xD;
      the end of the intervention period. In-depth interviews with FCHW (6 interviews) will be also&#xD;
      conducted to gauge the acceptability of the interventions.&#xD;
