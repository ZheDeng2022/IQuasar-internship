      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the reported enhanced coagulation status&#xD;
      (prothrombotic status) in patients with sickle cell disease using 2 laboratory tests;&#xD;
      thromboelastography (TEG) and Endogenous Thrombin Potential (ETP), and comparing the results&#xD;
      to healthy race matched controls to ascertain if there is a significant difference. Race&#xD;
      matching of the control participants is being carried out due to the well reported racial&#xD;
      differences in coagulation parameters that exist in healthy individuals. The investigators&#xD;
      are aiming to study the clotting state in sickle patients on regular transfusion therapy and&#xD;
      those on hydroxycarbamide, both treatments offered to sickle patients to ameliorate the&#xD;
      condition. The study will assess the reported prothrombotic state using TEG and ETP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickel cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited red cell disorder worldwide, the&#xD;
      genetic mutation in SCD results in the production of abnormal haemoglobin (HbS). This leads&#xD;
      to anaemia and unpredictable painful episodes referred to as a sickle cell crisis. Sickle&#xD;
      cell crises result in significant chronic health problems including stroke, kidney failure,&#xD;
      breathing problems, leg ulcers and chronic and ultimately leads to a decrease in life&#xD;
      expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method by which sickling results in the above issues is recognised as very complex and it&#xD;
      is thought these patients may have enhanced blood clotting which may play a role in the&#xD;
      complications they get. Sickle cell patients are reported to have higher risk of blood clots&#xD;
      such as deep vein thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim in this study is to investigate the reported enhanced coagulation status in&#xD;
      sickle cell adult sickle cell patients using 2 laboratory tests, thromboelastography (TEG)&#xD;
      and Endogenous Thrombin Potential (ETP) , the investigators will compare the results in&#xD;
      sickle participants to healthy race matched control participants to show if there is a&#xD;
      significant difference. The investigators also aim to study the coagulation status in sickle&#xD;
      participants on a variety of treatments such as transfusion and hydroxycarbamide, both&#xD;
      treatments offered to sickle patients. Many trials have shown the benefits of both&#xD;
      transfusions and hydroxycarbamide in SCD, they reduce the risk of stroke and frequency with&#xD;
      which patients get crises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of teh investigators knowledge this will be the first study evaluating the&#xD;
      clinical utility of TEG and ETP in adult patients with SCD&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      and the principles of Good Clinical Practice. It has been submitted for approval to the&#xD;
      London NHS Research Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design &amp; Flowchart This is a cross sectional case controlled clinical study in patients&#xD;
      with sickle cell disease. Control participants will be race and age matched participants&#xD;
      without sickle cell disease. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants.&#xD;
      The samples will be taken as part of the usual clinic or inpatient procedure with 10 extra&#xD;
      millilitres of blood venesected at a phlebotomist or nurse scheduled to venesect participants&#xD;
      as part of their usual medical care. Healthy controls will be asked to provide a 10ml blood&#xD;
      sample which will be taken by a qualified member of staff. The investigators are aiming to&#xD;
      collect samples from 100 patients in total and 20 healthy controls for comparison&#xD;
