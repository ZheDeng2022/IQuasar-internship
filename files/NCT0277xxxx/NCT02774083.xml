      Background: The Feuerstein Instrumental Enrichment Program was designed to prevent mental&#xD;
      deterioration and preserve cognitive abilities among people aged 60 and above. The program is&#xD;
      an applied practicable program based on the theories of Structural Cognitive Modifiability as&#xD;
      well as on a Mediated Learning Experience. The program takes into consideration the unique&#xD;
      characteristics and requirements of the older population. The program is composed of a&#xD;
      variety of cognitive tasks that offer systematic activities intended to stimulate mental and&#xD;
      cognitive development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To examine the influence of the Feuerstein Program on the cognitive function and&#xD;
      well-being of participants suffering from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The Feuerstein Program will improve cognitive abilities and functional well-being&#xD;
      of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Residents of retirement homes will be offered to participate in the research.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo cognitive and functional assessments that will be carried out on&#xD;
      four specific dates. The participants of the Intervention Group will participate in the&#xD;
      Feuerstein program using a method of mediated learning while the Control Group will&#xD;
      participate in a program of the Adler Institute involving activities aimed at social and&#xD;
      emotional development without specific cognitive skill training.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent decades, with the increase in life expectancy, the number of older people and their&#xD;
      relative rate within the population have risen dramatically. This trend led to increased&#xD;
      rates of people suffering from a mild cognitive disorder and dementia in developed countries.&#xD;
      Mild Neurocognitive Disorder or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is defined as a transition&#xD;
      state between successful aging and a state of dementia. This state is characterized by&#xD;
      cognitive impairment and a decline in memory skills while daily functioning is maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older people diagnosed with MCI are at increased risk of developing dementia, particularly&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. This risk is ranked at about 12% every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this is a pre-dementia stage, great importance lies in finding methods that could have&#xD;
      prevented or at least decelerated the progress of MCI to dementia. Among the few effective&#xD;
      programs are physical and cognitive activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Feuerstein Program&#xD;
&#xD;
      This program is designated to prevent mental deterioration and preserve cognitive abilities&#xD;
      among people aged 60 and above (hereinafter &quot;The Feuerstein Program&quot;). The program is the&#xD;
      initiative and brainchild of Professor Reuven Feuerstein - Israel Prize Laureate, founder and&#xD;
      President of the Feuerstein Institute for the Enhancement of Learning Potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program is an applied practicable program based on the theories of Structural Cognitive&#xD;
      Modifiability as well as on Mediated Learning Experience. For the needs of this program, the&#xD;
      tools were suited to the unique characteristics and requirements of the elderly population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program is composed of a variety of tools (hereinafter: instrumental enrichment) that&#xD;
      offer systematic activities intended to stimulate mental and cognitive development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrumental enrichment is a set of tools dealing with required thinking skills and it is&#xD;
      designated to significantly promote learning and thinking processes. The tasks of the various&#xD;
      tools are free of educational content and they engage in pure learning and thinking&#xD;
      processes. The tools are delivered through special mediation processes, for which teachers&#xD;
      and supervisors are trained in specialized courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the Feuerstein Program&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective: to enhance the transformation (variability) capacity of a human being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sub-objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Correction and development of defective thinking skills, that are responsible for&#xD;
           learning difficulties and the absence of transformation (variability).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Equipping the learner with literal and conceptual content that he requires during his&#xD;
           learning processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Creating and establishing proper sound thinking and working habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Creating insight and awareness regarding the processes involved in learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Creating internal motivation for carrying out tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Learning Process&#xD;
&#xD;
      The instrumental enrichment tools are distributed to the participant as work sheets. The&#xD;
      teacher creates a &quot;mediating&quot; dialogue between himself and the participants, thus enabling&#xD;
      them to construct learning skills and essential thinking strategies. In addition, the teacher&#xD;
      bridges the learning skills that were studied to the daily life of the elderly participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Products&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Creating within them awareness to their learning and thinking processes (Metacognition)&#xD;
           while introducing an optimistic and positive attitude towards the ability to effect a&#xD;
           significant change in these areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Instill the elderly person with control over his thinking skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Enhancing the sense of capability of the elderly person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Intervention Focuses of the Instrumental Enrichment Tools that will be utilized in the&#xD;
      Program&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Methodical information gathering.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Orientation and function in space and time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparison and sorting capabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Raising hypotheses and their examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Perspicuousness (clear wording) and naming capabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Control Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Control Group will participate in a program of the Adler Institute involving activities&#xD;
      aimed at social and emotional development without specific cognitive skill training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the influence of the Feuerstein Program on the cognitive condition of participants&#xD;
      suffering from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Feuerstein Program will improve the cognitive and functional condition of the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised controlled intervention study involving subjects with Mild Neurocognitive&#xD;
      Disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Assessment Tools&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cognitive screening by means of the MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Instrumental daily function assessed by the Lawton and Brody's Instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Depression screening based on the following question: &quot;Are you feeling sad or&#xD;
           depressed?&quot;. A positive response to this question has been found to be an efficient&#xD;
           screening tool for depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Will to live based on the following question: If you could describe your will to live on&#xD;
           a scale between 0 and 5, would you say that it is: 5 = very strong and 0 = no will to&#xD;
           live.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. CogSym (Cognitive Symptom) Meta-cognition questionnaire composed of ten items related to&#xD;
           the cognitive ability of the examinee during his daily functioning. The examinee is&#xD;
           asked to assess for each item, what is his ability level for the function being&#xD;
           described, on a 5 levels scale (1 = excellent, 5 = inferior).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. World Health Organization well-being index questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The Neurotrax computerized cognitive assessment battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to an Intervention Group using the Feuerstein Program&#xD;
      and a Control Group of the Adler Institute involving 30 twice weekly sessions each lasting 90&#xD;
      minutes over 15 weeks. Assessments will be performed at baseline, after session 15 and&#xD;
      session 30, and finally at 6 months following study commencement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis The statistical analysis will be conducted as is customary in clinical research&#xD;
      within the field.&#xD;
