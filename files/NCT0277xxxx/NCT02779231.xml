    <textblock>
      Hypertension remains one of the most important preventable contributors to disease and death.&#xD;
      It is the most common risk factor for strokes and myocardial infarctions in the U.S., and is&#xD;
      associated with the greatest attributable risk for mortality among all modifiable risk&#xD;
      factors for cardiovascular events. Over 50 million people are living with hypertension in the&#xD;
      United States, and hypertension is one of the most common reasons for visits to a healthcare&#xD;
      provider. Abundant evidence from randomized controlled trials has shown benefit of&#xD;
      antihypertensive drug treatment in reducing important health outcomes in persons with&#xD;
      hypertension. Yet, approximately 20% of U.S. adults are unaware that they have the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension is more difficult to diagnose than other common medical illnesses. In most&#xD;
      cases, hypertension is asymptomatic; and accordingly patients do not seek care for it as they&#xD;
      do for other common symptomatic illness. Patients are frequently diagnosed after presenting&#xD;
      with end organ disease (e.g., myocardial infarctions, congestive heart failure, strokes, or&#xD;
      renal failure). Another complicating aspect related to diagnosing uncontrolled hypertension&#xD;
      is that multiple blood pressure measurements are needed to establish a diagnosis. Blood&#xD;
      pressure readings can be falsely elevated in clinic due to the presence of an observer or the&#xD;
      clinical surrounding (e.g., white coat hypertension). Even if an elevated blood pressure&#xD;
      reading is identified in a clinic setting, more readings are needed in order to make it&#xD;
      possible for physicians to decide about the next appropriate medical intervention. This need&#xD;
      for multiple BP measurements over time often delays both initiating and modifying medical&#xD;
      therapy for uncontrolled hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having patients take their BP at home facilitates the more timely diagnosis of uncontrolled&#xD;
      hypertension by reducing diagnostic uncertainty. In fact, home measurements are better&#xD;
      diagnostic indicators of stroke and cardiovascular mortality than clinic readings, are more&#xD;
      closely correlated with end-organ damage, and are cost effective and well-tolerated by&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are frequently asked to record their BP after clinic visits. Historically, patients&#xD;
      used a hand-written log, but more recently, patients are instructed to use an Internet-based&#xD;
      web portal that uploads values to the patient's electronic medical record. Compliance with&#xD;
      either approach relies on effective patient and provider followup, and in many settings,&#xD;
      nurses or pharmacists will need to call patients to prompt them for their blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements, which is both a costly and time consuming approach. Therefore, researchers need&#xD;
      to develop effective, yet low cost alternatives to monitoring home blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes such a solution. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a simple&#xD;
      m-health intervention to increase the ease and efficacy of diagnosing uncontrolled&#xD;
      hypertension and achieve better blood pressure control in hypertensive patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Half of the participants will be randomized to a &quot;text-messaging&quot; protocol, and the other&#xD;
      half will be randomized to a &quot;standard of care&quot; protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Text messaging protocol: A trained research personnel (student, pharmacist, physician or&#xD;
      research assistant) will record the patient's cell phone number. Participants will select 7&#xD;
      morning and 7 evening times that are convenient for them to check and send blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements. (The literature recommends that 12-14 measurements should be taken over one to&#xD;
      weeks with morning and evening readings before making a diagnosis of hypertension).&#xD;
      Participants will use a home blood pressure monitor that will be provided to them after given&#xD;
      instruction of how to use it. This visit should take around 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the participant leaves the clinic, at the pre-specified times and dates, an automated&#xD;
      server side script running on the investigators' server will check the application database&#xD;
      at a given time interval and at the appropriate times send the participant a text message&#xD;
      with specific, simple instructions. An example of the message is as follows: &quot;Please remember&#xD;
      to check your blood pressure this morning at 7am! Reply to this message with your blood&#xD;
      pressure and time it was taken.&quot; The participant will return a short text with his/her blood&#xD;
      pressure measurements and the time they were taken: &quot;150/90 and 145/88 7am&quot;. The&#xD;
      investigators' software will identify the cell phone number associated with each message and&#xD;
      will enter the blood pressure measurement, the time the blood pressure was recorded, and the&#xD;
      time the message was received into an account associated with that participant in our secure&#xD;
      database. If the participant does not complete the blood pressure homework assignment, a&#xD;
      pre-specified number of reminders will be sent to the patient until 2 weeks have elapsed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the pre-specified number of measurements (seven days' worth of measurements) has been&#xD;
      received by the website, an email alert will be sent to the study personnel and a generated&#xD;
      document with blood pressure numbers will be sent to the treating physician e.g. physician's&#xD;
      clinical mailbox.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care protocol: participants who are randomized to the &quot;Standard of Care&quot; group&#xD;
      will be instructed to obtain 7 morning and 7 evening blood pressure measurements.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to choose a method of communication to reply their blood pressure&#xD;
      numbers back to their physician. These include &quot;MyChart&quot; which is Internet-based web-portal&#xD;
      connected to the participant's electronic medical record, calling back the clinic with their&#xD;
      numbers, mailing, or faxing blood pressure log to their physician. The type of method each&#xD;
      participant chooses will be recorded. Participants will use a home blood pressure monitor&#xD;
      that will be provided to them after given instruction on how to use it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will be asked to return the blood pressure cuff to Iowa River&#xD;
      Landing Internal Medicine clinic. This can be done at any time that is convenient to them&#xD;
      after finishing the blood pressure assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, investigators will access the participants' medical record to obtain the&#xD;
      following information: latest blood pressure measurement, blood pressure medications, latest&#xD;
      cholesterol measurements, cholesterol medications, latest glucose measurement, other chronic&#xD;
      medical conditions, other medications, insurance, race, age, gender, marital status, height&#xD;
      and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical records will also be accessed 3-6 months later to identify any change in medical&#xD;
      management that occurred after sending blood pressure readings. Time and type of intervention&#xD;
      will be recorded whether it is adding a new medication or increasing a current medication&#xD;
      dose. Also blood pressure readings during the next clinic visit (3-6 months after the study)&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
