      1. To understand the components of PBMC in MAC-LD patients, including T cells, B cells,&#xD;
           nature killer cells, and monocyte.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To confirm the phenomenon of reduced PBMC response in MAC-LD patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the proportion of apoptosis and PD-1 expression in T cells among MAC-LD&#xD;
           patients, MAC colonizers, patients with tuberculosis, and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To study the apoptosis and PD-1/PD-L1 expression in T cells/macrophage from bronchial&#xD;
           lavage among MAC-LD patients, MAC colonizers, patients with tuberculosis,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To examine the PD-1 gene polymorphism and the correlation with MAC-LD.&#xD;

      Background: Nontuberculous mycobacteria Lung disease (NTM-LD) becomes an important clinical&#xD;
      concern, because its incidence has increased over the last decade. Mycobacterium avium&#xD;
      complex (MAC) is the most common responsible species for NTM-LD in Taiwan. The clinical&#xD;
      relevance of MAC in sputum is, however, only 35~42% because it exists in the environment&#xD;
      ubiquitously. According to the guideline of the American Thoracic Society, the diagnosis of&#xD;
      MAC-LD is based on clinical, radiographic, and mycobacteriology criteria which require two or&#xD;
      more positive sputum cultures for MAC. The major limitation of mycobacterial culture is the&#xD;
      long turn-around-time, usually 2-4 weeks. In addition, both mycobacterial culture and nucleic&#xD;
      acid amplification test cannot discriminate true MAC infection and colonization because&#xD;
      airway colonization of MAC is not uncommon. Therefore, diagnosis of MAC-LD remains a big&#xD;
      challenge in clinical practice, and rapid and accurate diagnostic test should be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond the contemporary diagnostic criteria, the host immune response in NTM disease has&#xD;
      recently been proposed to help diagnosis. Inflammatory markers may represent host response&#xD;
      and discriminate MAC infection from colonization. But inflammatory markers can be influenced&#xD;
      by infection other than MAC infection. By contrast, lymphocyte response to antigen&#xD;
      stimulation may be more specific in diagnosis. In our preliminary results, in-vitro response&#xD;
      of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) is lower in MAC-LD than healthy controls. The&#xD;
      underlying mechanism responsible for the reduced PBMC response in MAC-LD is not fully&#xD;
      understood. In previous studies conducted in tuberculosis patients, interaction between&#xD;
      programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) from dendritic cells and programmed cell death-1&#xD;
      (PD-1) in T cells leads to apoptosis or anergy of T lymphocyte and thus suppresses cellular&#xD;
      immunity. Therefore, it is possible that similar alteration in immune response also occurs in&#xD;
      patients with MAC-LD and correlates with the PBMC response as well as disease severity.&#xD;
