  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pasireotide binds to somatostatin receptors sst2 and sst5, which can lead to significant&#xD;
      hyperglycemia. The investigators would like to administer pasireotide as a treatment for&#xD;
      refractory hypoglycemia in the setting of metastatic insulin-producing pancreatic&#xD;
      neuro-endocrine tumor.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Is not eligible for participation in any of the IMP's ongoing clinical trials or has&#xD;
             recently completed a clinical trial that has been terminated and, after considering&#xD;
             other options (e.g., trial extensions, amendments, etc.), the clinical team has&#xD;
             determined that treatment is necessary and there are no other feasible alternatives&#xD;
             for the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Meets any other relevant medical criteria for compassionate use of the investigational&#xD;
             product&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Is not being transferred from an ongoing clinical trial for which they are still&#xD;
             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
