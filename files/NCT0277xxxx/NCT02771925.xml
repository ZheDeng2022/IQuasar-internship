  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorders are present across medical specialties, with alcohol-related deaths&#xD;
      particularly prevalent in the categories of injury, liver cirrhosis, cancer, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, disorders of the peripheral nerves and of the central nervous system. Alcohol&#xD;
      dependence, also referred to as alcohol use disorder, is a chronic, relapsing disorder marked&#xD;
      by compulsive alcohol use, an inability to stop drinking despite harmful consequences, and&#xD;
      the emergence of a withdrawal syndrome upon cessation of use. Early abstinence is associated&#xD;
      with activation of brain stress systems in the extended amygdala. Clinically, protracted&#xD;
      abstinence involves symptoms of craving, mood and sleep disturbance, all of which have been&#xD;
      identified as risk factors for relapse. Nonetheless, implementation of alcohol-specific&#xD;
      medications remains limited across most medical specialties. Medications for treating alcohol&#xD;
      dependence primarily have been adjunctive interventions, and only three&#xD;
      medications-disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate-are approved for this indication by the&#xD;
      United States Food and Drug Administration. Baclofen, an inhibitor of synaptic transmission&#xD;
      through spinal reflex arcs via hyper polarization of primary afferent fiber terminals, was&#xD;
      originally approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1977 for use in spasticity&#xD;
      associated with neurologic conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord lesions.&#xD;
      However, due to its pharmacologic properties it has also been investigated for the treatment&#xD;
      of alcohol dependence. But in the clinical practice of study physicians, it was observed that&#xD;
      most of the patients who were prescribed baclofen for alcohol dependence hit back to alcohol&#xD;
      very soon despite being on the drug. Therefore there is a need to search for an alternative&#xD;
      drug which could be beneficial for this population of patients. Gabapentin is Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration-approved for the management of epileptic seizures and neuropathic pain. It is&#xD;
      believed to act by blocking a specific alpha-2d subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel&#xD;
      at selective presynaptic sites and, as a result, to indirectly modulate Gamma Butyric Acid&#xD;
      neurotransmission. Pre-clinical findings indicate that gabapentin normalizes the&#xD;
      stress-induced Gamma Butyric Acid activation in the amygdala that is associated with alcohol&#xD;
      dependence, and provide an excellent pre-clinical rationale for evaluating gabapentin as a&#xD;
      treatment for alcohol dependence. Earlier studies of gabapentin in alcohol dependent&#xD;
      subjects, attempting to abstain following withdrawal support the safety and potential&#xD;
      efficacy of gabapentin in alcohol dependent patients, but definitive conclusions were limited&#xD;
      by either small sample size, methodological, or dosing issues.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted on patients with alcohol dependence admitted or coming to the out&#xD;
      patient department. The enrolled subjects will be divided into two groups randomly using&#xD;
      computer generated randomization system. Informed consent shall be taken from the&#xD;
      patient/nearest relative of the patient for enrollment in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 2 independent groups in the ratio of 1:1 (each consisting of&#xD;
      100 patients). By taking the rate of sustained abstinence of 4.1% in placebo and 17% in 1800&#xD;
      mg arm and an odd's ratio of 4.8, the sample size needed is 88 patients in each arm. at 80%&#xD;
      power and an alpha level of 0.05. Investigators will use an uncorrected chi-squared statistic&#xD;
      to evaluate this null hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment of patients, assessing eligibility and obtaining informed consent will be carried&#xD;
      out by one of the study investigators. Breath Test analyzer will be use for detecting the&#xD;
      blood alcohol content from the breath sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized to either&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A, Total subjects 100 (Alcoholic liver disease:Alcoholics with no liver disease= 1:1)&#xD;
      each will receive Gabapentin 2000mg/day divided in two doses for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive standard of care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      or&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B, Total subjects 100 (Alcoholic liver disease: Alcoholics with no liver disease= 1:1))&#xD;
      each will receive Placebo 2000mg/day divided in two doses for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive standard of care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concurrent with study medication, study clinicians will provide participants with 20 minutes&#xD;
      of weekly manual-guided counseling designed to increase motivation, abstinence, and&#xD;
      medication compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemogram, biochemical tests including blood glucose, liver function tests, prothrombin time,&#xD;
      serum electrolytes, blood urea and serum creatinine will be done at baseline and subsequently&#xD;
      at the end of 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alcohol Breath Test&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants will undergoing alcohol breath-testing at monthly for 6 months. A&#xD;
      breath-test will be considered positive if a participant submits a test greater than 0.01%&#xD;
      Blood Alcohol Concentration. If a result greater than 0.01% Blood Alcohol Concentration is&#xD;
      returned the test will be re-administered (the second testing) 15 minutes after the initial&#xD;
      test. A proforma including the date, time of breath-test, breath-test reading and signature&#xD;
      and name of person administering the breath-test will be maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up to 6 months or until death. The status alive or dead will be&#xD;
      assessed by telephoning a family member or by contacting the death registry at the patient's&#xD;
      birth place or place of residence.&#xD;
