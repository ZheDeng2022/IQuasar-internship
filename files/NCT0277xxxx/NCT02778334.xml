      Introduction and literature review With 130 000 cases per year in France in 2010, stroke is&#xD;
      one of the most common neurological diseases, often leaving many disabling sequelae physical&#xD;
      and cognitive levels (currently live 500 000 disabled following a stroke) and leading and a&#xD;
      loss of significant autonomy in these patients. However, many stroke survivors soon find a&#xD;
      range comparable to their previous state. Investigators can then ask ourselves about the&#xD;
      impact of this life event in these people who apparently do not show visible effects: what&#xD;
      about the psychological repercussions of stroke in these patients healthy; what is changed in&#xD;
      their daily lives, particularly in their mental functioning after this brutal confrontation&#xD;
      with their own mortality?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Our project aims to better understand the psychological repercussions of stroke in&#xD;
      patients who quickly find a health and autonomy comparable to their previous state. The&#xD;
      objective will be to investigate the relationship between depressive symptoms and anxiety,&#xD;
      coping strategies and quality of life from the acute phase and during the first months after&#xD;
      the onset of stroke. This period is particularly demanding for these patients must therefore&#xD;
      adapt and readjust continuously: shock stroke, hospitalization in several services (intensive&#xD;
      care, neurology, rehabilitation), back home, &quot;new&quot; life with the changes related stroke,&#xD;
      resumption of a professional activity, etc ...&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our methodology will combine tools conventionally used (standardized interview, validated&#xD;
      questionnaires) to newer, ecological and true methods (Experience Sampling Method applied by&#xD;
      the use of a smarphone application) to assess different variables studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initially be determined whether the various symptoms of the depression on the one hand&#xD;
      and anxiety on the other hand, depending on their mode of expression (vs. outsourced&#xD;
      internalized; ie emotional, cognitive, somatic), observed from the acute phase of stroke, are&#xD;
      related and predict the quality of life, depression and anxiety in the longer term (four&#xD;
      months after the stroke).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, our study will observe if the individual coping strategies (coping) daily and&#xD;
      evolution influence the psychological status and quality of life during the months following&#xD;
      the stroke.&#xD;

      Introduction and literature review With 130 000 cases per year in France in 2010, stroke is&#xD;
      one of the most common neurological diseases, often leaving many disabling sequelae physical&#xD;
      and cognitive levels (currently live 500 000 disabled following a stroke) and leading and a&#xD;
      loss of significant autonomy in these patients. However, many stroke survivors soon find a&#xD;
      range comparable to their previous state. Investigators can then ask ourselves about the&#xD;
      impact of this life event in these people who apparently do not show visible effects: what&#xD;
      about the psychological repercussions of stroke in these patients healthy; what is changed in&#xD;
      their daily lives, particularly in their mental functioning after this brutal confrontation&#xD;
      with their own mortality? Research on psychology and psychiatric disorders post-stroke&#xD;
      indicate a frequency of occurrence of depression in 30-40% of patients, while the occurrence&#xD;
      of anxiety disorders in 20% to 30% of patients. Depression and anxiety after stroke is&#xD;
      influenced by the presence of sequels, but in a preliminary study (see Psycho-stroke current&#xD;
      study) with patients with no impairment of their independence three months after stroke&#xD;
      Investigators observed the presence of depressive and anxious symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychological health influences the patient's quality of life overall. Recent results&#xD;
      have thus demonstrated that post-stroke depression increased the risk of short- and long-term&#xD;
      mortality. It therefore seems essential to identify risk factors and influence of depression&#xD;
      and anxiety after stroke, particularly in patients rapidly and almost completely recovering&#xD;
      from the aftermath of their accident, to prevent the emergence and to support them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the scientific literature, individual coping strategies or coping strategies, and their&#xD;
      development are identified as a factor of influence of post-stroke psychological health.&#xD;
      Thus, an active coping centered on the problem would be associated with better mental health&#xD;
      status, while a passive coping centered on managing emotions would instead be a poor&#xD;
      prognostic factor. However, the clinical understanding of the everyday process of adaptation&#xD;
      among survivors of stroke is limited by the assessment methods conventionally used in the&#xD;
      research, which questioned the memory &quot;in general&quot; of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modern techniques and increasingly used, as Experiences Sampling Method (ESM) or the&#xD;
      Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) allow the assessment of individual functioning in more&#xD;
      ecologically being carried out in the natural environment of the subject and greatly limit&#xD;
      through retrospective recall. The application of these methods to a population of stroke&#xD;
      survivors has already been validated and one study also shows that the active behaviors&#xD;
      (work, sport) would be a post-stroke depression risk factor, whereas the presence of a social&#xD;
      environment (among friends, relatives) would be a protective factor. However, this study is&#xD;
      only interested in certain types of behavior, comparable to some coping strategies (active&#xD;
      coping, social support research) but not representative of a whole, while other studies&#xD;
      specifically interested in the evaluation of coping with this method but not with stroke&#xD;
      patients. It seems interesting to use a similar methodology to observe in vivo finer and more&#xD;
      accurate adaptation strategies in stroke survivors, and thus have an ecological&#xD;
      representation of their coping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other factor of influence that Investigators chose to investigate in our study relates to&#xD;
      the symptomatic forms of depression and anxiety. It is important first to note that the&#xD;
      somatic and cognitive consequences of stroke are close to some depression and anxiety&#xD;
      manifestations. This symptomatic overlap makes it difficult locating and diagnosing these&#xD;
      disorders. Determine their specific seems necessary, and would involve the identification of&#xD;
      symptoms of these psychopathological that would significantly associated with depression and&#xD;
      anxiety lasting and intense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of post-stroke depression reveal that symptoms related to mood, thoughts and&#xD;
      depressive emotions are more durable and predict diagnosis and depression intensity in the&#xD;
      longer term, then somatic symptoms (fatigue) during the acute phase of stroke showed no&#xD;
      significant association with long-term mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators found no published studies indicating the results on this subject regarding&#xD;
      post-stroke anxiety. However, in the Psycho-stroke current study, initial results show that&#xD;
      the psychic symptoms of anxiety three months after the stroke predicted anxiety in six&#xD;
      months. Investigators would like to deepen these results by focusing on these shorter-term&#xD;
      variables, that is to say from the first days after the occurrence of the accident, and study&#xD;
      their links with the mental health status and quality life during the first months following&#xD;
      the stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Again, the use of modern evaluation methods (ESM / EMA) will capture the emotional and&#xD;
      psychological phenomena almost instantaneously, and thus promote the clinical understanding&#xD;
      of mental disorders after stroke. This approach, already applied in the context of&#xD;
      post-stroke depression, however, was not used in the study of anxiety in this population,&#xD;
      although research with d other populations are interested in anxiety as assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our project aims to better understand the psychological repercussions of stroke in patients&#xD;
      who quickly find a health and autonomy comparable to their previous state. The objective will&#xD;
      be to investigate the relationship between depressive symptoms and anxiety, coping strategies&#xD;
      and quality of life from the acute phase and during the first months after the onset of&#xD;
      stroke. This period is particularly demanding for these patients must therefore adapt and&#xD;
      readjust continuously: shock stroke, hospitalization in several services (intensive care,&#xD;
      neurology, rehabilitation), back home, &quot;new&quot; life with the changes related stroke, resumption&#xD;
      of a professional activity, etc ...&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our methodology will combine tools conventionally used (standardized interview, validated&#xD;
      questionnaires) to newer, ecological and true methods (Experience Sampling Method applied by&#xD;
      the use of a smarphone application) to assess different variables studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initially be determined whether the various symptoms of the depression on the one hand&#xD;
      and anxiety on the other hand, depending on their mode of expression (vs. outsourced&#xD;
      internalized; ie emotional, cognitive, somatic), observed from the acute phase of stroke, are&#xD;
      related and predict the quality of life, depression and anxiety in the longer term (four&#xD;
      months after the stroke).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, our study will observe if the individual coping strategies (coping) daily and&#xD;
      evolution influence the psychological status and quality of life during the months following&#xD;
      the stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      N waited 75 patients. Recruitment Location: Neuro-Vascular Unit at St. Joseph Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: 18 to 24 months depending on the pace of inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      After submission and approval of the project by the Patient Protection Committee will be&#xD;
      proposed to patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria to participate in the study after&#xD;
      being informed of its progress and its objectives (note (cf. . Annexes) and meeting with the&#xD;
      psychologist). Camille Vansimaeys, psychologist and principal investigator of this study will&#xD;
      also be the only one to see patients and to conduct interviews as part of this research.&#xD;
      Patients who accept will be seen in maintenance during hospitalization in Neuro-Vascular Unit&#xD;
      (T0 = 4 to 7 days post-stroke) to assess depression and anxiety (hetero-evaluation).&#xD;
      Socio-demographic and medical data will be collected in files and anonymous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of the release of the UNV (T1 = 12 day average hospitalization), patients will be&#xD;
      divided into two groups: 1) patients who return home and 2) patients who continued&#xD;
      hospitalization in rehabilitation. Depression, anxiety, quality of life and coping strategies&#xD;
      will be assessed by self-administered questionnaires. A first phase of ambulatory (ESM / EMA)&#xD;
      will also take place following the UNV output: 5 times a day for 7 days patients will respond&#xD;
      to questions evaluating depression, anxiety and coping strategies. Patients will answer these&#xD;
      questions via a smartphone app (issues ESM). The application will be directly installed on&#xD;
      personal smartphones patients who have them. For patients who do not own a smartphone&#xD;
      configured only to be used for the application will be lent their time to the study by the&#xD;
      University Paris Descartes. Patients who will be entrusted these smartphones will sign an&#xD;
      additional form framing the terms of the loan. An explanation of the operation of the&#xD;
      application and smartphones will be made at the time of the first interview in hospital, a&#xD;
      training phase is then performed during hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During phase measurements by smartphones, patients will be contacted three days after the&#xD;
      first evaluation, to address and resolve any difficulties of use, and to remind people with a&#xD;
      smartphone lent loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another ambulatory phase on the same model as that performed at T1 (5 times daily for 7 days)&#xD;
      accompanied by a self-assessment of depression, anxiety, coping strategies and quality of&#xD;
      life will made 2 months post-stroke (T2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last time the study will take place 4 months after stroke onset (T3). Patients will be&#xD;
      reviewed in interview to assess depression and anxiety (hetero and self assessments) as well&#xD;
      as coping strategies and quality of life (self-questionnaires). Ambulatory measurement phase&#xD;
      (for 1 week, 5 times a day) also accompanied this evaluation. It will be made before the&#xD;
      interview to half our population, and then the other half to control a possible parasitic&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ethical implications The intervention of this research with vulnerable patients by the&#xD;
      occurrence of a stroke, and therefore may have a certain psychic and emotional vulnerability&#xD;
      in a particularly challenging time for them, implies that Investigators are attentive to many&#xD;
      ethical considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, it is important to emphasize that proper monitoring will be offered to patients whose&#xD;
      psychic suffering is manifest in the different assessments. Investigators will verify if they&#xD;
      have followed up to these difficulties, and if so Investigators redirect to health&#xD;
      professionals so that they can be supported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, patients who simply express a follow-up request will be directed to an appropriate&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will also be checked that each patient and willing to participate in this research has&#xD;
      understood the objectives and conduct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will also be specified clearly that their participation, their refusal to participate or&#xD;
      withdrawal during the study in no case affect the management or the relationship with the&#xD;
      medical and nursing teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tools&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tools used were validated their French version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ‚Ä¢ Straight-evaluation The hetero-evaluative tools involve the identification of semiotic&#xD;
      elements in a semi-structured clinical interview conducted by an experienced evaluator and&#xD;
      trained in the award of these tools (in this case the clinical psychologist in charge of the&#xD;
      study). They are not filled by patients, it is the investigator (psychologist) who asks&#xD;
      questions based on these questionnaires, but that can be formulated differently in different&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MINI (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Inventory) (Sheehan et al., 1998; Lecrubier et al.,&#xD;
      1998). This is a must-semi-structured interview guide in psychological research, the use of&#xD;
      which is part of the professional practice of psychologist. This inventory is to gather&#xD;
      information and semiotic elements to assist in the diagnosis of certain psychiatric disorders&#xD;
      according to DSM-IV. Modules A (major depressive disorder), B (dysthymia), I (post-traumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder), O (GAD) and L (psychotic disorders) MINI will be used to assess the&#xD;
      presence or absence of disorders mood (major depression, dysthymia), anxiety disorders&#xD;
      (generalized anxiety or post-traumatic stress, assess relevant in our study by the&#xD;
      traumatogenic dimension of Stroke) and identify subjects which present a psychotic disorder&#xD;
      to not to include in the study, mainly because of their altered perception of reality. In&#xD;
      addition, the module for psychotic disorders is introduced to the patient by telling him that&#xD;
      now the invastigator will ask him questions about some unusual or bizarre experiments that&#xD;
      can occur in some people. &quot;Thereby depersonalize maintenance reassurance on the fact that&#xD;
      these issues are part of a standard valuation method and they are not raised in order to&#xD;
      argue a diagnostic hypothesis concerning him .&#xD;
&#xD;
      MADRS (10 items) (Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale) (Montgomery and Asberg,&#xD;
      1979; Lemp√©ri√®re, 1984) will be used to assess the intensity of depressive symptoms. This&#xD;
      scale is the reference scale in this area, it includes ten items that assess different&#xD;
      aspects of depressive symptomatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HAM-A (14 items) (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale) (Hamilton, 1959 Pichot, 1959) is a scale for&#xD;
      measuring state anxiety. This scale have an intensity score of general anxiety, consisting of&#xD;
      two sub-scores for somatic anxiety one hand, and on the other psychic anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ‚Ä¢ Self evaluation These tools are questionnaires that are completed by the person who&#xD;
      self-evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BDI-II (21 items) (Beck Depression Inventory 2nd ed) assesses the severity of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms. Twenty-one groups of statements on the different symptoms of depression are&#xD;
      available, the patient selects the one that best matches how he feels. The advantage of&#xD;
      choosing this tool is that it assesses different aspects of depression both in terms of&#xD;
      physical symptoms that cognitive and emotional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HADS (14 items) (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale). This scale assesses the severity of&#xD;
      depressive and anxious symptomatology. This is the most used tool in all somatic diseases and&#xD;
      neurological particular. This survey presents the advantage of being very short, while&#xD;
      assessing symptoms both somatic and psychological symptomatology of these.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief-COPE (28 items):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This questionnaire assesses 14 separate dimensions of coping (two items per dimensions):&#xD;
      active coping, planning, instrumental support, emotional support, expression of feelings,&#xD;
      positive reinterpretation, acceptance, denial, blame, humor, religion, entertainment,&#xD;
      substance use and disengagement behavioral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHOQOL BREF is a scale assessing the quality of life using 26 items, including two related to&#xD;
      the overall quality of life. This questionnaire allows us to understand dimensionally the&#xD;
      subjective perception of the person's life, in the different fields that can compose.&#xD;
      Physical health: including aspects such as pain, fatigue or working abilities; mental health:&#xD;
      composed among others by the positive and negative emotions and self-esteem; social&#xD;
      relations: including personal, private life or the available social support; and finally the&#xD;
      living environment with elements such as financial resources, access to information&#xD;
      resources, recreation, etc ...&#xD;
&#xD;
      ‚Ä¢ Ambulatory Measures: ESM / EMA These measures will be carried out via a smartphone app. The&#xD;
      selected items are from previous studies that measured these variables, or built specifically&#xD;
      for the study on the basis of validated tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of depression and anxiety: the symptoms of depression and anxiety present in the&#xD;
      DSM-IV-TR and show a variability in a day will be assessed dimensionally on a Likert scale 7&#xD;
      points. Eg for depression: sad mood, anhedonia, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, negative /&#xD;
      pessimistic thoughts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Life events: questions will focus on the occurrence in the last three hours of events that&#xD;
      have a positive impact on one hand, and negative on the other. Participants should indicate&#xD;
      the specific areas of life for these events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      strategies to adapt to stressful events: coping strategies will be evaluated by adapting the&#xD;
      questions brief-COPE. Participants will indicate how they reacted to the negative event&#xD;
      previously identified by selecting from a list of statements those that match their response,&#xD;
      for example: &quot;I turned (e) to work or other activities to take my mind. &quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation methods used at different times of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preservation and analysis of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A basic anonymous data will be created. Only the investigator will have access to the&#xD;
      concordance table to link the questionnaires completed by patients with data in the database&#xD;
      is created.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical study will be conducted by the investigator himself locally in the hospital&#xD;
      Saint Joseph group. There will be no exchange of data. Different statistical tests will be&#xD;
      used to analyze the data: analyzes of variances, correlations, regressions. Investigators&#xD;
      will try and update significant associations between depressive and anxious symptoms, coping&#xD;
      and quality of life during the first months after stroke, controlling the influence variables&#xD;
      effect (neurological status, level autonomy, hospital stay and time of return home, etc ...).&#xD;
      Investigators will compare the evolution of different dimensions between the two subgroups of&#xD;
      patients (back home or inpatient rehabilitation T1 service).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical information on stroke and data on the effects (cognitive and motor functions&#xD;
      affected, severity of sequelae, areas in which autonomy would eventually be reduced, type and&#xD;
      location of stroke, etc ...) will be account when analyzing the results to investigate the&#xD;
      possible existence of links between and anxiety and depression levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data stored on smartphones will be transferred directly to the smartphone to the computer&#xD;
      that will store the data; is hosted on a secure server certified. In this case, the server&#xD;
      will either already obtained the necessary authorizations CNIL; or an application will be&#xD;
      made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general clinical significance of this project is to determine the elements for&#xD;
      identifying, at the time of initial hospitalization following a stroke, patients at risk of&#xD;
      adversely psychological evolution as physical and medical condition allows them to quickly&#xD;
      return home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will have an interest in both the assessment on the management of post-stroke&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders: distinguishing characteristics of depression and anxiety consecutive&#xD;
      in this event in order to facilitate the diagnosis from the acute phase stroke and direct&#xD;
      support. The symptomatological risk profiles can thus be detected and specific therapies on&#xD;
      the prominent symptoms such disorders in the field of stroke may be proposed and / or&#xD;
      developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the results will enable a greener and more detailed understanding of the process&#xD;
      connecting the individual coping strategies, post-stroke psychological problems and quality&#xD;
      of life in various important time of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      project interests Our project has several interests. First, it provides a longitudinal study&#xD;
      tracking over the first months post-stroke, combining several complementary assessment&#xD;
      methods that will enable a more comprehensive representation of psychological manifestations:&#xD;
      standardized tools traditionally used and more environmentally friendly methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This design study should provide a better understanding of psychic and their development at&#xD;
      key stages of life process for patients after stroke (hospitalization in another service,&#xD;
      return home).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several clinical implications are expected: develop prevention of post-stroke psychological&#xD;
      problems by allowing the specific identification of depression and anxiety from the acute&#xD;
      phase; identify targeted supported on the specifics of these disorders in the field of&#xD;
      stroke; improve Supported favoring the development of coping strategies associated with&#xD;
      long-term mental health and to reduce those associated with negative development; understand&#xD;
      how these healthy patients after stroke and quickly return home, live these important steps&#xD;
      to provide support tailored to suit their specific needs.&#xD;

    <description>These measures will be carried out via a smartphone app. Symptoms of depression and anxiety: the symptoms of depression and anxiety present in the DSM-IV-TR and show a variability in a day will be assessed dimensionally on a Likert scale 7 points. Eg for depression: sad mood, anhedonia, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, negative / pessimistic thoughts.&#xD;
Life events: questions will focus on the occurrence in the last three hours of events that have a positive impact on one hand, and negative on the other. Participants should indicate the specific areas of life for these events .&#xD;
strategies to adapt to stressful events: coping strategies will be evaluated by adapting the questions brief-COPE. Participants will indicate how they reacted to the negative event previously identified by selecting from a list of st</description>

    <description>Patients who accept will be seen in maintenance during hospitalization in Neuro-Vascular Unit (UNV) (T0 = 4 to 7 days post-stroke)&#xD;
At the time of the release of the UNV two groups:&#xD;
patients who return home and&#xD;
patients who continued hospitalization in rehabilitation. Depression, anxiety, quality of life and coping strategies will be assessed by self-administered questionnaires. A first phase of ambulatory (ESM / EMA) will also take place following the (UNV) output: 5 times a day for 7 days patients will respond to questions evaluating depression, anxiety and coping strategies. Patients will answer these questions via a smartphone app (issues ESM).&#xD;
Another ambulatory phase on the same model as that performed at T1 (5 times daily for 7 days) accompanied by a self-assessment of depression, anxiety, coping strategies and quality of life will made 2 months post-stroke (T2).&#xD;
The last time the study will take place 4 months after stroke onset (T3).</description>
