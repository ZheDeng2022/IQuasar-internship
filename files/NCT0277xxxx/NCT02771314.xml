    <textblock>
      Based on the possibilities that both plasma and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) (the &quot;liquid&#xD;
      biopsy&quot;) may offer, we consider that it could be feasible to longitudinally monitor the&#xD;
      genetic evolution and the biologic characteristics of CTCs, by using Circulating tumor DNA&#xD;
      (ctDNA) and CTCs as a source of biologic material. This approach could provide information&#xD;
      regarding the genetic/molecular changes associated with primary and acquired resistance to&#xD;
      AZD9291 and, thus, to facilitate to more appropriately adapt the tailored treatment in this&#xD;
      particular group of NSCLC patients. It has been recently reported that the detection of&#xD;
      resistant clones, based on the tumor-associated genetic aberrations in the blood, can&#xD;
      identify treatment resistance up to 10 months earlier than the radiological methods&#xD;
      providing, thus, the potential for an early switch to a non cross-resistant therapy in order&#xD;
      to improve patients' outcome.&#xD;

      Lung cancer is among the most common tumor types representing 13% of the newly diagnosed&#xD;
      cancers worldwide. Both the absolute and relative frequency of lung cancer has risen&#xD;
      dramatically. Unfortunately, lung cancer remains by far the leading cause of cancer-related&#xD;
      deaths, accounting for 18% of the total number of deaths. Non Small Lung Cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
      accounts for 85% of all cases of lung cancer and is further classified in several subtypes&#xD;
      based on various molecular and histological features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial dose of 80 mg AZD9291 administered once daily orally in the fasted state can be&#xD;
      reduced to 40 mg AZD9291 once daily under circumstances&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single arm, open-label, phase II, multicenter study. NSCLC patients with activating EGFR&#xD;
      mutations, who are under front line treatment with first generation EGFR TKIs according to&#xD;
      the physicians' choice and present disease progression, will be treated with single agent&#xD;
      AZD9291. The patients will be followed every 3 months for the detection of mutations (T790M),&#xD;
      (C797S), (L858R), del 19 EGFR mutations as well as the mutations [(KRAS)/(NRAS), (BRAF),&#xD;
      (PI3K)] in the serum/plasma, the determination of the serum levels of Hepatocyte Growth&#xD;
      Factor (HGF), the presence of T790M (+) and C797S(+) CTCs as well as the molecular (c-MET)&#xD;
      and (HER2 amplification) and phenotypic characterization of CTCs using the filtration&#xD;
      platform (ISET). The elimination or the emergence of each of these circulating tumor&#xD;
      biomarkers will be correlated with patients' clinical outcome [objective response to&#xD;
      treatment (ORR), (PFS) and (OS)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no specific control group in this study. Biomarkers profile at baseline will be used&#xD;
      as internal control for each patient to monitor changes throughout treatment.&#xD;
