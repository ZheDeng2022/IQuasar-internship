  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test experimental human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines&#xD;
      that use an adenovirus vector. The adenovirus vector may help the vaccines stimulate an&#xD;
      immune response. Researchers want to see how the immune system will respond to these vaccines&#xD;
      as well as if they are safe to give to people. Participants cannot get HIV from these&#xD;
      vaccines. However, researchers also want to see if the vaccine's adenovirus is contagious.&#xD;
      Adenoviruses cause cold symptoms or mild eye infections, therefore household and intimate&#xD;
      contacts will be asked to participate as well.&#xD;

         36. Seizure disorder: History of seizure(s) within past three years. Also exclude if&#xD;
             volunteer has used medications in order to prevent or treat seizure(s) at any time&#xD;
