  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) often take several medicines to control HIV.&#xD;
      Dolutegravir and darunavir boosted with cobicistat are HIV medicines that people may take.&#xD;
      They may also need to take medicines for an infection called latent tuberculosis (TB).&#xD;
      Researchers think a once-weekly treatment for latent TB would be easier for people with HIV&#xD;
      to take. This once weekly treatment consists of two drugs: rifapentine and isoniazid.&#xD;
      However, they need to see how TB drugs and HIV drugs interact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn how anti-HIV and anti-TB drugs affect each other so that people taking these drugs&#xD;
      together can be treated safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18 65.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will have vital&#xD;
      signs taken and give a blood sample. Women will have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants cannot take any other medicines during the study, including vitamins. Only&#xD;
      occasional, infrequent use of acetaminophen (Tylenol , max 2000 mg/day), ibuprofen (Motrin or&#xD;
      Advil ), naproxen (Aleve ), loperamide (Imodium ), and/or antihistamines (such as Benadryl ,&#xD;
      Zyrtec , Claritin , etc.) will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to one of three groups. Each group will take a different study&#xD;
      drug, once or twice a day, for 19 23 days. At the baseline study visit, they will get a&#xD;
      supply of the study drug tablets and instructions for taking them. Participants will keep a&#xD;
      medicine diary to serve as a memory aid for taking medicine and reporting any side effects&#xD;
      that they may experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 8 or 9 study visits over about 40 days. The number of visits depends&#xD;
      on which group the person is assigned to. All visits will take place at the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center. Participants will fast before study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline visit will last about 2 3 hours. There will be 3-4 long visits that will last&#xD;
      for about 12 hours. The other 4-5 visits will last about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During all study visits, screening procedures will be repeated. During long visits, an&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) line will be inserted into an arm vein with a needle. It will be used to&#xD;
      take blood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rifapentine (RPT) is a long-acting rifamycin that can be used weekly with isoniazid (INH) as&#xD;
      a first-line regimen in the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Although this&#xD;
      regimen offers several potential benefits, the use of weekly RPT plus INH is not currently&#xD;
      recommended in adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (ART) due to limited evidence on drug interactions with antiretrovirals&#xD;
      (ARVs).1Darunavir boosted with cobicistat (DRV/c) comprises part of alternative treatment&#xD;
      regimens recommended for the treatment of HIV.2However, drug interactions between these ARV&#xD;
      agents and RPT are of concern. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of&#xD;
      concomitant RPT and INH administration on the steady state PK of DRV/c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, fixed sequence, intrasubject drug-drug interaction study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the steady state PK of DRV/c with coadministration of once weekly RPT and INH given&#xD;
      at doses used to treat LTBI. Arm B will be comprised of two phases: (1) DRV/c once daily&#xD;
      alone (days 1-4) and (2) DRV/c once daily + (RPT and INH) once weekly (days 5-19).&#xD;
      Participants in Arm B will undergo periodic serial ARV PK blood draws on days 4, 14, and 19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DRV/c PK parameters will be determined using non-compartmental methods. Cobicistat levels&#xD;
      will only be assessed if DRV concentrations are significantly decreased. The following PK&#xD;
      parameters will be compared between phases: area under the curve over the dosing interval,&#xD;
      maximum plasma concentration, time to maximum plasma concentration, terminal half-life,&#xD;
      apparent oral clearance, and minimum plasma concentration. Adverse events will be graded and&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
