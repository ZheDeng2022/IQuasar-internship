  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is increasing in all parts of the&#xD;
      world. Despite introduction of new antifungal agents for prophylaxis and treatment of IPA in&#xD;
      the last decade, the outcome of patients with IPA is still unsatisfactory and needs&#xD;
      improvement. Particularly, recent developments in diagnostic imaging, including introduction&#xD;
      of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) into standard procedures, made a place for&#xD;
      improvement of diagnosis of IPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed tomography of the chest is the optimal, recommended imaging procedure for diagnosis&#xD;
      of pneumonia in febrile neutropenic patients and it is significantly superior to conventional&#xD;
      chest X-ray. However, the method is associated with some difficulties mostly due to the broad&#xD;
      spectrum of pathological findings in patients with IPA and their evolution over time. This&#xD;
      has been described in retrospective studies on relatively small groups of patients.&#xD;
      Prospective studies on larger populations are still missing, as well as studies on&#xD;
      combination of different diagnostic modalities e.g. diagnostic imaging and microbiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently published the results of the clinical trial: &quot;A Phase II Dose Escalation Study of&#xD;
      Caspofungin in Patients with Invasive Aspergillosis&quot; which used caspofungin doses of 70 to&#xD;
      200 mg daily for the first line treatment of IPA. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached,&#xD;
      but response rates were impressive with complete plus partial responses accounting for 54.3%&#xD;
      and overall mortality at 12-week follow-up as low as 28.3%. There was a tendency towards&#xD;
      higher doses yielding higher response rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the majority of these patients we obtained serial chest CT. So, for the first time a&#xD;
      patient population is at hand, in which the kinetics of infiltrates over time can be&#xD;
      described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to describe the pathological findings in chest CT performed&#xD;
      sequentially in IPA patients while receiving effective antifungal therapy. The specific&#xD;
      objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characteristics of pathological findings in sequential chest CTs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To describe the pathological findings (e.g. halo sign, air crescent sign and air&#xD;
                consolidation) in sequential high resolution computed tomogrphy (HRCT) examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To calculate the incidence of individual pathological findings in sequential CT&#xD;
                examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To calculate a total volume of fungal infiltrates in sequential CT examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Correlation of pathological findings in sequential CT with corresponding white blood&#xD;
           count (WBC) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To correlate the appearance or disappearance of individual pathological findings&#xD;
                with WBC and ANC&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To correlate the volume of fungal infiltrates in sequential CT examinations with&#xD;
                WBC and absolute neutrophil count&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Correlation of pathological findings in sequential CT with the serum galactomannan index&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To correlate the appearance or disappearance of individual pathological findings&#xD;
                with the serum galactomannan index&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To correlate the volume of fungal infiltrates in sequential HRCT examinations with&#xD;
                the serum galactomannan index&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Correlation of pathological findings in sequential HRCT with outcome of IFI&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To correlate the appearance or disappearance of individual pathological findings&#xD;
                with outcome of IFI&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To correlate the volume of fungal infiltrates in sequential HRCT examinations with&#xD;
                outcome of IFI&#xD;
