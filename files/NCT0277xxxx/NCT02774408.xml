  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this 2-phase cross-over study the investigators test the hypothesis that automated&#xD;
      adjustment of the inspired oxygen with the combined use of synchronized noninvasive&#xD;
      SpO2-sensitive and apnea-sensitive backup-ventilation (S-NIPPV) increases the time within the&#xD;
      intended oxygen saturation range as compared to automated FiO2 adjustment alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized-controlled clinical study with cross-over design of two&#xD;
      treatment phases of 24h duration each (1. Automated FiO2-adjustment (SPO2C), 2. combined use&#xD;
      of automated FiO2-adjustment and SpO2-sensitive/apnea-sensitive S-NIPPV (SPO2C + BU), see&#xD;
      Figures 1 and 2). The investigators will study two patient groups of premature infants&#xD;
      depending on the type of respiratory support at study time: One group, where the infants are&#xD;
      on CPAP at study time, and another group of preterm infants who are already supported by&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal IPPV at study time. Both studies will be sufficiently powered to show a&#xD;
      significant treatment effect if it is present. Study infants will be recruited in the&#xD;
      neonatal ICU of the children's hospital, University of Ulm and the neonatal ICU, University&#xD;
      of Munich. Both NICU team have participated previously in clinical trials investigated new&#xD;
      modes of mechanical ventilation using automated ventilation adjustment in the target&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of the sequence of the two study phases will be carried out using sealed&#xD;
      envelopes. Infants will be changed to a specific ventilator device approved for clinical use&#xD;
      in neonates in Germany (Sophie®-Respirator, Stephan Medizintechnik GmbH, Gackenbach,&#xD;
      Germany), which is capable to automatically adjust the FiO2 (called &quot;SPO2C&quot;) and to apply&#xD;
      noninvasive backup-ventilation (using a noninvasive trigger device (S-NIPPV) or&#xD;
      non-synchronized nasal IPPV (NIPPV) based on readings of an incorporated SpO2 monitoring&#xD;
      device (Masimo® Radical 7, averaging time 2 sec). Synchronization of NIPPV and detection of&#xD;
      apnea is achieved by using the Graseby capsule (Stephan, Vio Healthcare Ltd, Ref. 103560103),&#xD;
      which will be secured onto the anterior abdominal wall near to the right costal margin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants on CPAP (first group) will be exposed to the first study phase (SPO2C, or SPO2C + BU,&#xD;
      Figure 1) for 24h and then will be switched to the alternate mode for 24h each. Infants, who&#xD;
      are already on nasal IPPV (SIPPV or NIPPV) as chosen by the clinical team will be exposed to&#xD;
      NIPPV with a standardized inflation rate of 40 breaths/min (nonsynchronized, because this&#xD;
      seems to be the current standard of care according to the available literature) and SPO2C, or&#xD;
      to SPO2C plus synchronized BU (starting with a rate of 80 inflations/min with stepwise&#xD;
      weaning) and then will be switched to the alternate mode for 24h each.&#xD;
