  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to investigate the effectiveness of cannabidiol for&#xD;
      reducing marijuana seeking in non-treatment seeking volunteers. Cannabidiol is a cannabinoid&#xD;
      (similar to cannabis, or marijuana) present in marijuana that alters some of the effects of&#xD;
      marijuana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the ability of acute smoked CBD pretreatment to reduce marijuana-seeking behavior and&#xD;
      increase price-elasticity of marijuana demand.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be asked to participate in a total of three choice sessions over two weeks&#xD;
      with each session day separated by at least two days. Each session day will last&#xD;
      approximately 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each study session participants will be asked to smoke a cigarette. Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to smoke from a marijuana cigarette. These cigarettes may contain cannabidiol or&#xD;
      they may not (placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to answer questions about how the drugs make them feel. Vitals&#xD;
      signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation) will be measured using a&#xD;
      non-invasive (external) vitals monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six samples will be taken in each of the three sessions. Blood samples will be obtained via&#xD;
      butterfly catheter placed in a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to remain in the laboratory until all marijuana-related subjective&#xD;
      and physiological effects have returned to the original levels recorded this morning before&#xD;
      they smoked the first marijuana cigarette.&#xD;

             cervical cap combined with a spermicide) are not eligible. Women who are breastfeeding&#xD;
             will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Individuals currently in, intending to seek, or court mandated for substance abuse&#xD;
             treatment will be excluded. Finally, participants may be withdrawn from study if they&#xD;
             do not comply with the study protocol, test positive for drugs of abuse other than&#xD;
             marijuana on the routine urine screen or decide not to participate in the study.&#xD;
