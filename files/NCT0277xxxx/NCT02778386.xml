  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I evaluation of N-MCT in normal volunteers requires sequentially increased doses.&#xD;
      At each dose level, the safety and pharmacokinetic will be measured. This Phase I trial will&#xD;
      have the dose range of N-MCT from 200mg - 1200mg per patient.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 trial evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of N-MCT administered&#xD;
      orally as a single ascending dose. Healthy male and female (non-pregnant, non-lactating)&#xD;
      subjects ages 18-45, will be consented and allowed to participate in the study if upon&#xD;
      screening they meet the inclusion / exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled into one of four cohort groups sequentially. Each of the six&#xD;
      subjects in each group will receive doses sequentially within 48 hours between each dose&#xD;
      increase (ie, the second subject in a group will not receive a dose until 48 hours after the&#xD;
      first subject received a dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 (6 subjects, male &amp; female) will receive 200 mg, Cohort 2 (6 subjects, male &amp;&#xD;
      female) will receive 400 mg, Cohort 3 (8 subjects, males and females, 2 placebo, 6 treated)&#xD;
      will receive 800 mg and Cohort 4 (8 subjects, males and females, 2 placebo, 6 treated) will&#xD;
      receive 1200 mg of N-MCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cohort will be completed and the safety data evaluated prior to initiating the next&#xD;
      cohort. All subjects will have plasma and urine samples evaluated for N-MCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI of the protocol and the IDMC will review safety data (AEs), safety labs, vital signs,&#xD;
      and findings through Day 7 for Cohort 1 before enrolling subjects in Cohort 2. Cohort 2 data&#xD;
      through Day 7 will be reviewed accordingly by the PI and IDMC before enrolling subjects in&#xD;
      Cohort 3. Cohort 3 data through Day 7 will be reviewed by the PI and the IDMC before&#xD;
      enrolling subjects in Cohort 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, prior to dose escalation to a new cohort as described above, GHUCCTS IRB will review&#xD;
      and approve, in expedited review, the IDMC report upon which the decision to escalate the&#xD;
      dose to a new cohort is based.&#xD;
