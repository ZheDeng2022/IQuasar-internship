  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the potential effect of hepatic impairment&#xD;
      on the systemic pharmacokinetics of RX0041-002 following single dose intranasal&#xD;
      administration. The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      intranasal RX0041-002 in subjects with normal hepatic function and hepatic impairment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single dose, open-label study comparing the plasma pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      safety of RX0041-002 between subjects with hepatic impairment and age/gender/BMI-matched&#xD;
      subjects with normal hepatic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSAGE&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive a single treatment consisting of four (4) ml of a 4% solution of&#xD;
      RX0041-002 (corresponding to 160 mg cocaine HCl) applied for 20 minutes to both nostrils&#xD;
      using cotton pledgets. RX0041-002 Topical Solution (4%) will be provided by the Sponsor,&#xD;
      supplied in 4 mL bottles. RX0041-002 Topical Solution contains citric acid, D&amp;C Yellow No.&#xD;
      10, FD&amp;C Green No. 3, sodium benzoate, and water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION OF STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of study participation for each subject will be approximately 23 days not&#xD;
      counting the variable 30 days for adverse event follow-up and resolution, if required. During&#xD;
      that time, subjects will be screened for a maximum of 21 days and then confined to the study&#xD;
      unit for approximately 45 hours for Day -1 evaluations, dosing (Day 1), blood sampling and&#xD;
      safety assessments (Day 1-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sufficient number of subjects will be enrolled to complete 12 subjects with hepatic&#xD;
      impairment, male or female volunteers ≥ 18 years of age. An additional 12 healthy,&#xD;
      non-hepatically impaired, male or female volunteers will be enrolled as the comparator group.&#xD;
      These subjects will be approximately age, body mass index (BMI) &amp; gender-matched to the&#xD;
      subjects with hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment will be classified as moderate or severe&#xD;
      and each grade/class will be defined according to Child-Pugh classification (Class B or C) .&#xD;
      The liver impairment will be identified by a typical medical history, physical examination,&#xD;
      coagulation and abnormal liver function tests (including bilirubin and albumin) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY PARAMETERS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrollment (screening) and at the completion of the study, or at premature&#xD;
      discontinuation, each subject will undergo a complete physical examination plus vital signs,&#xD;
      clinical laboratory testing (serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), and coagulation.&#xD;
      In addition, subjects will be screened for inclusion with a 12-lead electrocardiogram, a&#xD;
      urinary screen for drugs of abuse and blood tests for alcohol, serology tests for HIV&#xD;
      antibody. Breath alcohol and urine drug screens will be repeated at check-in on Day -1 of the&#xD;
      study. Females of child bearing potential will also be screened for inclusion with a serum&#xD;
      pregnancy test. Urine pregnancy tests will also be performed at check-in on Day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be queried for the occurrence of adverse experiences following dosing and&#xD;
      during blood sampling. Vital sign monitoring and recordings, will be obtained at baseline&#xD;
      (pre-dose) (Day 1). Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oral temperature will be&#xD;
      taken and recorded every 15 minutes beginning immediately prior to dosing and for every 15&#xD;
      minutes for the first 60 minutes following pledget insertion. For the next 120 minutes (up to&#xD;
      180 minutes' post pledget insertion) vital sign recordings to include blood pressure, heart&#xD;
      rate, respiratory rate and oral temperature measurements will be taken and recorded every 30&#xD;
      minutes to the 180 minute (3 Hour) post pledget insertion time point. Vital sign recordings&#xD;
      to include blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oral temperature measurements&#xD;
      will continue to be taken and recorded at hour 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32 hours&#xD;
      from time of pledget insertion or if necessary until the patient is clinically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nasal exam will be conducted, visually, pre-dose (Day 1) and at the end of study (Day 2) to&#xD;
      determine if irritation is present at the application site following drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHARMACOKINETIC BLOOD SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be drawn at the following times relative to the initiation&#xD;
      of RX0041-002 dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be dosed and blood pharmacokinetic sampling will be conducted at 0 hour&#xD;
      (pre-dose), and post dose at: 7 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, (immediately after pledget&#xD;
      removal) 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 60 minutes, 75 minutes, 90 minutes, 105 minutes, and 2, 3,&#xD;
      4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 28 and 32 hours, based upon the beginning of dose application. For each&#xD;
      time point, a minimum of 8 ml of blood will be sampled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total concentrations of cocaine and it major metabolites will be determined in all samples.&#xD;
