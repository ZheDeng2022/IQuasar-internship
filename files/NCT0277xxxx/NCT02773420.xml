      Purpose: The current study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the HETâ„¢ Bipolar&#xD;
      System (Medtronic, Boulder, CO) for the treatment of grade I-II hemorrhoids in a prospective&#xD;
      pilot study. This device was evaluated retrospectively in a limited cohort of 23 patients&#xD;
      previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients seen at a colorectal clinic in a single institution with grade I-II&#xD;
      hemorrhoids are offered to participate in a prospective pilot trial. The HET device is a&#xD;
      modified anoscope equipped with LED lighting, a tissue clamping mechanism and a bipolar&#xD;
      energy source used to treat multiple hemorrhoidal columns in one sitting. Three columns of&#xD;
      hemorrhoids are treated with 2 heat energy applications per column. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      the treatment effect on hemorrhoid symptoms of bleeding, pain, prolapse, itching, and&#xD;
      soiling. This is measured with a patient completed questionnaire documenting each symptom's&#xD;
      frequency from 0 to 3 (i.e. 0 is &lt; 1x/month; 3 is daily) before therapy and at 3 weeks and 6&#xD;
      month follow-up. Post-treatment pain scores were recorded using the visual analog scale&#xD;
      (VAS).&#xD;

      HET Bipolar System: Validation of Outpatient Hemorrhoid Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction: This study will evaluate the effectiveness of treatment of Grade I-II&#xD;
      hemorrhoids with the novel HET Bipolar System (Medtronic, Boulder, Co.). This device is a&#xD;
      modified anoscope equipped with LED lighting, tissue clamping mechanism and bipolar energy&#xD;
      device. It is inserted in the anus under direct vision targeting the tissue proximal to the&#xD;
      hemorrhoid, which is placed within the treatment window and clamped. The bipolar energy&#xD;
      device is activated to ligate the feeding hemorrhoidal vessels, essentially disrupting the&#xD;
      blood supply to the hemorrhoid. The only published evaluation of this device to date is a&#xD;
      retrospective analysis of the safety and efficacy of the device in 23 patients (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no prospective study of this device and its effectiveness in the literature. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy of this device, defined as decrease in symptoms&#xD;
      and/or recurrence, of Grade I-II hemorrhoids through a prospective study consisting of 30&#xD;
      patients. Other non invasive means of treating hemorrhoids range from sclerotherapy to rubber&#xD;
      band ligation, which often requires multiple treatments and can cause some discomfort. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to study HET Bipolar treatment of hemorrhoids to offer another validated&#xD;
      minimally invasive option for the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids in the outpatient&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Method: The investigators will enroll a total of 30 subjects.&#xD;
      Participating patients,18 years of age and older, will be undergoing treatment with the HET&#xD;
      bipolar system for symptomatic Grade I and II hemorrhoids. Please note that the HET bipolar&#xD;
      system is used as part of standard of care and participants will receive the treatment&#xD;
      regardless of this research. The subjects will be identified and recruited by University of&#xD;
      Illinois at Chicago Department of Colorectal Surgery faculty via clinic appointments in the&#xD;
      Outpatient Care Center, 1801 W. Taylor St, Suite 3F, Chicago, Il 60612. Informed consent will&#xD;
      be provided at the clinic in regards to participation in the study. Refusal to participate&#xD;
      will not influence treatment options presented or deemed necessary for the subject's&#xD;
      condition. A pretreatment hemorrhoid symptom questionnaire will be completed by each patient.&#xD;
      In developing our questionnaire the investigators examined the only validated hemorrhoidal&#xD;
      symptom questionnaire in the literature, the Sodergren Score (2) and also various others (3).&#xD;
      The Sodergren score offers a theoretical basis, however the investigators chose to develop a&#xD;
      questionnaire secondary to the need for inclusion of bleeding symptoms of hemorrhoids. While&#xD;
      subjects are undergoing treatment, the investigators will record timing of treatment, number&#xD;
      of hemorrhoids treated, and energy application timing. Immediately after the treatment, the&#xD;
      patients will describe how painful the procedure was using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The&#xD;
      questionnaire will take 5-10 minutes to complete. Patients will be seen for follow up&#xD;
      outpatient clinic visits at 2-3 weeks and at 8-12 weeks post procedure. At follow up, the&#xD;
      patients will be given a post-treatment questionnaire regarding symptoms of hemorrhoids (this&#xD;
      is the same questionnaire as the pre-treatment questionnaire). The questionnaire assigns each&#xD;
      of the five cardinal symptoms of hemorrhoids with a number from 0 to 3 with 3 being the most&#xD;
      severe symptom. After tallying the five symptom scores, a total from 0 (no symptoms) to 15&#xD;
      (severe symptoms) will be assigned to each patient's overall symptoms. In addition, patients&#xD;
      will be given a journal to record their daily pain for 14 consecutive days, day 21 and day 56&#xD;
      using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). This is to more accurately record pain, as the&#xD;
      questionnaire does not include a VAS score component. Patients who are unable to come for&#xD;
      follow up visits will be interviewed over the phone by one of the investigators and the&#xD;
      relevant data, i.e. the questionnaire and pain score, will be obtained during this phone&#xD;
      conversation. For patients following up over the phone, a phone script will be created in&#xD;
      addition to the questionnaire. The total number of visits/encounters is 3 and will take place&#xD;
      during regular clinic visit appointments. The difference between pre treatment and post&#xD;
      treatment scores will be representative of the treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Section:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to describing the distribution of data. The Wilcoxon&#xD;
      signed rank test will be used to examine the pre- and post- treatment symptom score&#xD;
      difference. Paired two-sample t-test and McNemar's test will also be used to examine the pre-&#xD;
      and post-treatment difference for other variables of interests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used to test the significant difference between&#xD;
      pre- and post- treatment scores, the power calculation is based on the Wilcoxon signed rank&#xD;
      test. At 80% power level, assuming correlation 0.2 between pre- and post- treatment scores,&#xD;
      the sample size of 18 ensure minimum detectable difference in symptom score between pre- and&#xD;
      post-treatment scores of 3. Thus, our sample size of 30 is appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Example: At 80% power level, assuming correlation 0.2 between pre- and post- treatment&#xD;
      scores, the sample size of 18 ensure minimum detectable difference in symptom score between&#xD;
      pre- and post-treatment scores of 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results/Conclusions: The investigators anticipate a significant decrease of&#xD;
      hemorrhoidal symptoms, defined in this study as pain, pruritis, prolapse, soiling, and&#xD;
      bleeding with the HET bipolar system, providing a validated outpatient minimally invasive&#xD;
      treatment option for symptomatic hemorrhoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits/Risks: There is no direct benefit to the subjects of this study. The main risk of&#xD;
      this research is loss of confidentiality of information. The patient may experience mild&#xD;
      anxiety or discomfort in providing information about their health and well-being. Records&#xD;
      will be stored in an electronic data file on a password protected computer in a locked&#xD;
      office. Master key will be kept in a separate file accessible only by the primary&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be provided at the clinic in regards to participation in the study.&#xD;
      Refusal to participate will not influence treatment options presented or deemed necessary for&#xD;
      the subject's condition. Consent will be obtained by the primary investigator and/or research&#xD;
      fellows who have experience and training in the explanation of the procedure, potential risks&#xD;
      and benefits. The informed consent document will be stored in the subject's electronic&#xD;
      medical record. If non-English speaking subjects are encountered, the informed consent will&#xD;
      be translated by interpretation in the language of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and Safety Monitoring Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study poses minimal risk, the main risk being mild anxiety or loss of confidentiality of&#xD;
      information. If problems arise they will be handled according to Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Management Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data procurement will be done electronically and incorporated in password protected encrypted&#xD;
      server in a locked office. The master key will be kept in a separate file accessible only by&#xD;
      the primary investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting Unanticipated Problems:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any unanticipated problems arise they will be reported to University of Illinois at&#xD;
      Chicago's Insitutional Review Board per defined protocol.&#xD;
