      The goal of this study is to determine how effective repeated fasting over 26 weeks (6&#xD;
      months) is at improving risk parameters that are surrogate endpoints for cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases, metabolic dysregulation and cognitive impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to water-only fasting or to their ad libitum usual diet, with&#xD;
      randomization performed within strata based on fasting history (≤180 hours or 181-720 hours&#xD;
      of total fasting for &gt;12 consecutive hours per episode in the previous two years). Subjects&#xD;
      will be assessed at 4, 13 and 26 weeks following randomization.&#xD;

Shannon's diversity index will be used because it measures the uncertainty in finding a specific type of microbe from one that is randomly selected from a stool sample. The index ranges from 0 to infinity. A higher value indicates that more diversity in species exists in the stool sample. It is calculated as negative one multiplied by the sum across each species of the proportion of the whole that the species constitutes in the stool multiplied by the natural log of that proportion. The change score will be the value at week 26 minus the value at baseline.</description>

                  untreated fasting glucose &gt; 100 mg/dL within 6 months of screening) and are not&#xD;
                  taking medications to control diabetes OR diagnosed, diet-controlled type 2&#xD;
                  diabetes but do not require medications to control diabetes OR one or more of the&#xD;
                  components of the metabolic syndrome measured within 6 months of screening (other&#xD;

             beginning of the next annual observance, as long as they do not fast routinely outside&#xD;
