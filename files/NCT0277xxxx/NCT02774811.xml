  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A debate continues concerning best first-line therapy for African primary open angle&#xD;
      glaucoma. Most African practitioners advocate first line trabeculectomy surgery yet most&#xD;
      frequently practice first line drug therapy because of patient acceptance and other issues.&#xD;
      In the developed world a range of first line therapies including drug, SLT, cyclodiode&#xD;
      ciliary body ablation, trabeculectomy surgery, drainage tube surgery and other drainage&#xD;
      procedures (viscocanalostomy, non-penetrating surgery etc) have been advocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a paucity of good evidence concerning the relative merits of these approaches in an&#xD;
      African context. The purpose of this study is to compare two approaches to first line therapy&#xD;
      of primary open angle glaucoma in an African population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design A two centre randomised prospective trial of SLT vs. prostaglandin analogue first line&#xD;
      therapy for primary open angle glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods African patients with established or newly diagnosed primary open angle glaucoma or&#xD;
      patients with POAG currently on single drug therapy (excluding prostaglandin analogues) and&#xD;
      elevated IOP are recruited in Innovation Eye Centre in Kisii, Kenya and McCord Hospital,&#xD;
      University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa. While if clinically indicated both eyes&#xD;
      will be treated, one eye per patient to be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent all patients undergo a standardised examination to establish baseline&#xD;
      ocular function and findings. All patients receive counselling in glaucoma, the disease, what&#xD;
      it means and the therapy. The patient is then randomised (randomisation in London, contained&#xD;
      in sealed opaque envelopes) to receive SLT or prostaglandin analogue therapy. Every effort is&#xD;
      made to follow all patients according to a standardised protocol at a minimum of month 3,&#xD;
      month 6 and month 12. All therapeutic failures are followed closely to ascertain further&#xD;
      management plans and subsequent therapeutic compliance. Follow-up is offered beyond 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical therapy Those randomised to medical therapy patients receive free Prostaglandin&#xD;
      analogue in KZN or in Innovation Eye Centre with counselling on drop instillation and&#xD;
      instructions for renewal of their prescription. Prescription renewal is to be free of&#xD;
      charge.. An appointment is given for review in 3 months. Considerable attention is being paid&#xD;
      to estimating compliance including the use of bottle weighing and questionnaires already&#xD;
      developed and used locally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SLT THERAPY Those randomised to SLT will receive counseling on the effects and management of&#xD;
      SLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      System: Selecta II (Lumenis) - Frequency doubled Nd: YAG (532nm) Pre-Laser Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Topical anesthesia (e.g. proxymetacaine hydrochloride)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prophylactic application of alpha agonist or equivalent agent (e.g. brimonidine) to&#xD;
           avoid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-op pressure spike&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser Treatment parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Duration 3ns (preset)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Spot size 400µ (preset)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Number of applications: 100&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Extent of angle: 360 degree&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Power (dependent on angle pigmentation)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If pigmentation is 1 or 2. start at 0.8 mJ and adjust power in 0.1 mJ increments&#xD;
                until visible response (cavitation bubbles - colloquially referred to as &quot;champagne&#xD;
                bubbles&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If pigment grade is 3 or 4, start at lower energy 0.4 mJ and adjust power in 0.1 mJ&#xD;
                increments until visible response&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  When reaching the treatment endpoint (cavitation bubbles), scale down the energy&#xD;
                level by 0.1 mJ and remain on that threshold throughout treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  It is recommended to re-evaluate threshold following the treatment of each&#xD;
                quadrant, due to variations in TM pigmentation to reach treatment endpoint&#xD;
                (cavitation bubbles) Post-Laser Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient's IOP follow up - one hour post treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  NSAIDS up to 2-3 days post-op, or depending on the level of patient discomfort&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  It is not recommended to prescribe steroidal medication as it may potentially&#xD;
                interfere with the SLT mechanism of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up At 3 months Patients will have a structured questionnaire relating to any adverse&#xD;
      effects from the therapeutic interventions. They will receive an examination of visual&#xD;
      function, external ocular structures and intraocular pressure in addition to the optic nerve&#xD;
      head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those with unacceptable topical/systemic side effects and those with partial or complete&#xD;
      failure of IOP control (see outcomes) will have secondary therapy commenced in the form of&#xD;
      timolol 0.5% or, if contraindicated, either brimonidine or oral acetazolamide)). The&#xD;
      secondary therapy will either replace or be additive to the primary therapy depending on the&#xD;
      initial response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 months Patients will have a structured questionnaire relating to any adverse effects&#xD;
      from therapeutic interventions. They will receive and examination of visual function,&#xD;
      external ocular stuctures and intraocular pressure in addition to the optic nerve head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those with unacceptable topical/systemic side effects and those with partial or complete&#xD;
      failure of IOP control (see outcomes) will have secondary or tertiary therapy commenced in&#xD;
      the form of timolol 0.5% or, if contraindicated, either brimonidine or oral acetazolamide))&#xD;
      or surgical intervention in the form of a trabeculectomy with cytotoxic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 12 months Patients will have a structured questionnaire relating to any adverse effects&#xD;
      from therapeutic interventions. This questionnaire will also include questions relating to&#xD;
      their acceptance of the therapy and view of the therapy. They will receive a detailed&#xD;
      examination of visual function and ocular parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those with unacceptable topical/systemic side effects and those with partial or complete&#xD;
      failure of IOP control (see outcomes) and those with evidence of glaucoma progression will&#xD;
      have secondary or tertiary therapy commenced in the form of timolol 0.5% or, if&#xD;
      contraindicated, either brimonidine or oral acetazolamide)) or surgical intervention in the&#xD;
      form of a trabeculectomy with cytotoxic.&#xD;
