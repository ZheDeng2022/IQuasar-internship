      Development of a new mass spectrography-based biomarker for the early and sensitive diagnosis&#xD;
      of Fabry disease from the blood&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fabry disease is a progressive, inherited, multisystemic lysosomal storage disease&#xD;
      characterized by specific neurological, cutaneous, renal, cardiovascular, cochleo-vestibular&#xD;
      and cerebrovascular manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annual incidence is reported to be 1 in 80,000 live births but this figure may underestimate&#xD;
      disease prevalence. When late-onset variants of the disease are considered, a prevalence of&#xD;
      approximately 1 in 3,000 has been suggested. Fabry disease is pan-ethnic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fabry disease is a disorder of glycosphingolipid metabolism caused by deficient or absent&#xD;
      lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A activity related to mutations in the GLA gene (Xq21.3-q22)&#xD;
      encoding the alpha-galactosidase A enzyme. Deficient activity results in accumulation of&#xD;
      globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) within lysosomes, believed to trigger a cascade of cellular&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fabry disease is transmitted as an X-linked trait. The existence of atypical, late-onset,&#xD;
      variants and the availability of specific therapy complicate genetic counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical picture covers a wide spectrum ranging from mild cases in heterozygous females,&#xD;
      to severe cases in classically affected hemizygous males with no residual alpha-galactosidase&#xD;
      A activity. These patients may have all the characteristic neurological (pain), cutaneous&#xD;
      (angiokeratoma), renal (proteinuria, kidney failure), cardiovascular (cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
      arrhythmia), cochleo-vestibular (hearing loss and vertigo) and cerebrovascular (transient&#xD;
      ischemic attacks, strokes) symptoms of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female patients may have very mild to severe symptoms. Pain is a common early symptom of&#xD;
      Fabry disease (chronic pain characterized by burning and tingling paresthesia and occasional&#xD;
      episodic crises characterized by agonizing burning pain). Pain may resolve in adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anhidrosis or hypohidrosis may occur causing heat and exercise intolerance. Other signs&#xD;
      include corneal changes (&quot;cornea verticilata&quot;), Definitive laboratory diagnosis involves&#xD;
      demonstration of marked enzyme deficiency in hemizygous males. Enzyme analysis may&#xD;
      occasionally help to detect heterozygotes but is often inconclusive due to random&#xD;
      X-chromosomal inactivation, making molecular testing (genotyping) of females mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With age, progressive damage to vital organ systems develops, possibly leading to organ&#xD;
      failure. End-stage renal disease and life-threatening cardiovascular or cerebrovascular&#xD;
      complications limit the life-expectancy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic&#xD;
      alterations in the blood of affected patients that allow diagnosing in the future the disease&#xD;
      earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore it is the goal of the study to identify and validate a new biochemical marker from&#xD;
      the blood of the affected patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose and&#xD;
      thereby with an earlier treatment.&#xD;

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of Mass-spectrometry, a blood&#xD;
      sample will be taken via using a dry blood spot filter card. To proof the correct Fab-ry&#xD;
      diagnosis in those patients where up to the enrollment in the study no genetic testing has&#xD;
      been done, sequencing of Fabry disease will be done.The analyses will done at:&#xD;
