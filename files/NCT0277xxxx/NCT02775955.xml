      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the potential effect of renal impairment&#xD;
      on the systemic pharmacokinetics of acute Intranasal RX0041-002. The secondary objective is&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety and tolerability of acute intranasal RX0041-002 in subjects with&#xD;
      normal renal function and severe renal impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 INVESTIGATOR/STUDY SITE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at Comprehensive Clinical Research in Berlin, New Jersey. The&#xD;
      principal investigator will be Dr. David Hassman. Institutional review will be performed by&#xD;
      Chesapeake Institutional Review Board..&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cocaine Hydrochloride Topical Solution (4%) is currently available for the induction of local&#xD;
      (topical) anesthesia of accessible mucous membranes of the oral, laryngeal and nasal cavities&#xD;
      (DESI product). Pennsylvania Pain Specialists (PPS) are seeking FDA approval for RX0041-002&#xD;
      as a topical anesthetic for diagnostic and surgical procedures in the nasal cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cocaine is a naturally-derived local anesthetic with a long history of use. Like other&#xD;
      structurally-related local anesthetics, cocaine produces direct effects on cell membranes.&#xD;
      Cocaine blocks sodium channel activity and thus prevents the generation and conduction of&#xD;
      nerve impulses in electrically active cells. Cocaine also has vasoconstriction properties&#xD;
      which for surgical or diagnostic procedures of the mucous membranes of the nasal cavities&#xD;
      decreases operative bleeding and improves surgical visualization. The therapeutic use of&#xD;
      cocaine hydrochloride, 4% solution topically applied to the nasal septum for local anesthesia&#xD;
      is reported in the public clinical literature but has never received official FDA approval&#xD;
      for this indication. It has been used in surgical procedures involving the nose, throat,&#xD;
      larynx and lower respiratory passages because blood loss from these highly vascularized areas&#xD;
      can be considerable and may also obscure the operative field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetics of cocaine administered via nasal absorption has been reported in the&#xD;
      literature. However, regardless of the route of administration, several studies have shown&#xD;
      that cocaine has a plasma half-life of 0.5-1.5 h, an apparent volume of distribution of 2-3&#xD;
      L/kg, and an apparent systemic clearance of ≈2 L/min. Only 1-5% of cocaine is cleared&#xD;
      unmetabolized in urine, where it may be detected for only 3-6 h after use. The primary&#xD;
      pathway of cocaine elimination is by hydrolysis of its two ester groups to form the two major&#xD;
      inactive metabolites, ecgonine methyl ester (EME) and benzoylecgonine (BE), with half-lives&#xD;
      of approximately 4 and 6 h, respectively. These compounds constitute over 80% of cocaine's&#xD;
      metabolites and are detected in urine for 14-60 h after cocaine administration. Norcocaine, a&#xD;
      minor but active metabolite, is formed by cytochrome P450 (CYP 3A4) mediated N-demethylation&#xD;
      of cocaine. However, only 2% - 6% of cocaine is metabolized to norcocaine in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is being conducted to evaluate the potential effects of renal impairment on&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics of cocaine, its major metabolites and the active metabolite (norcocaine)&#xD;
      after (4%) intranasal cocaine HCl topical administration, at the typical clinical dose of 160&#xD;
      mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 SUMMARY OF DRUG INFORMATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      RX0041-002 (Cocaine HCl, USP) is a crystalline, granular, or powder substance having a&#xD;
      saline, slightly bitter taste that numbs tongue and lips. Each mL of RX0041-002 Topical&#xD;
      Solution contains Cocaine HCl 40 mg (4%) as an aqueous solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 SUBJECT POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject population for this study will include male and female adults (≥ 18 years). A&#xD;
      sufficient number of subjects will be enrolled to complete 8 subjects with severe renal&#xD;
      impairment and 8 subjects with normal renal function. The subjects with normal renal function&#xD;
      will be selected in order to match the subjects with renal impairment in terms of age, sex&#xD;
      and BMI. For assignment to the treatment groups, severe renal impairment will be defined as&#xD;
      an eGFR of 15-29 mL/min/1.73m2. Normal renal function will be defined as an eGFR ≥ 90&#xD;
      mL/min/1.73m2.&#xD;
