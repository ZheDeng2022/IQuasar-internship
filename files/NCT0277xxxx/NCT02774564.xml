  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to the effect of three single oral doses of nebicapone (50 mg,&#xD;
      100 mg and 200 mg) on the levodopa pharmacokinetics when administered in combination with a&#xD;
      single-dose of controlled release levodopa 200 mg/carbidopa 50 mg (Sinemet CR 200/50).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover study with four&#xD;
      single-dose treatment periods. The washout period between doses was 5 days or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: Subjects will be screened for eligibility within 28 and 7 days of first admission.&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained before any study procedure is performed. The&#xD;
      screening will consist of: medical history; physical examination, vital signs; complete&#xD;
      neurological examination; 12-lead ECG; hematology, coagulation, plasma biochemistry and&#xD;
      urinalysis tests; HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C serology; drugs of abuse and alcohol&#xD;
      screen; urine pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential; and review of the selection&#xD;
      criteria. The results of screening must be known to the investigator prior to the subject's&#xD;
      first admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment periods: In each of the four consecutive treatment periods, eligible subjects will&#xD;
      be admitted to the UFH on the day prior to receiving the study medication for: vital signs;&#xD;
      medical history and physical examination updates; 12-lead ECG; hematology and plasma&#xD;
      biochemistry; drugs of abuse and alcohol screen; and urine pregnancy test in women of&#xD;
      childbearing potential. On the first admission the subjects will have a review of the&#xD;
      selection criteria and will be randomized to one of the treatment sequences. On the morning&#xD;
      of the dosing day, subjects will receive a dose of BIA 3-202 / Placebo concomitantly with a&#xD;
      dose of Sinemet CR 200/50 in fasting conditions (at least 8 hours) and will remain in the UFH&#xD;
      until at least 24 h post-dose; then, they will be discharged and will return for the next&#xD;
      period or the follow-up visit. At given time-points between pre-dose and discharge, subjects&#xD;
      will be submitted to vital signs recording, brief neurological examinations, 12-lead ECG, and&#xD;
      blood sampling for plasma drug assays and erythrocyte S-COMT activity. At discharge, vital&#xD;
      signs and ECG will be recorded, and hematology and plasma biochemistry tests will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: A follow-up visit will occur approximately 7-10 days after discharge of the last&#xD;
      treatment period or early discontinuation for: medical history and physical examination&#xD;
      updates; vital signs; 12-lead ECG; hematology, plasma biochemistry and urinalysis tests; and&#xD;
      pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential.&#xD;
