    <textblock>
      When women with rheumatoid arthritis become pregnant 75% of them will go into remission,&#xD;
      despite stopping medication. This phenomenon is not well understood and is not seen in other&#xD;
      inflammatory conditions. Once they give birth they often relapse. Bacteria in the stool and&#xD;
      inside the gut have the ability to effect the immune system and some beneficial bacteria are&#xD;
      known to down regulate inflammatory components of the immune system. Gut bacteria are also&#xD;
      known to alter significantly during pregnancy and in other inflammatory conditions there are&#xD;
      low levels of beneficial bacteria associated with diseases like ulcerative colitis. There is&#xD;
      significant crossover between rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease with&#xD;
      similar arthritic symptoms and mechanisms of inflammation. There is very limited&#xD;
      investigation of gut bacteria and rheumatoid arthritis, but some animal work has shown that&#xD;
      treatment with probiotics and prebiotics can improve the condition. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to examine the bacteria in the stool of women who are pregnant with rheumatoid arthritis and&#xD;
      identify any significant bacteria changes that might be used to direct future research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy has an interesting and different impact on inflammatory conditions that have much&#xD;
      in common immunologically. In inflammatory bowel disease 33% will deteriorate, 33% will&#xD;
      remain stable and 33% will improve. In rheumatoid arthritis 75% of women will improve. Gut&#xD;
      microbiota alters significantly in pregnancy as do predominant immunological pathways and&#xD;
      relapse post-partum is swift. Research on intestinal microbiota in women with inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions is scant. The high remission rate in pregnancy gives us a unique opportunity to&#xD;
      study the microbiota for changing patterns that could be identified in the future as&#xD;
      potential therapeutic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to identify any bacterial changes from pre-conception through pregnancy to&#xD;
      post-partum and comparing women who relapse with rheumatoid arthritis to those who remain in&#xD;
      remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical condition will be assessed and stool and serum samples will be obtained from women&#xD;
      during each trimester during pregnancy for analysis of serum and fecal biomarkers and for&#xD;
      microbiota 16S rRNA (ribosomal ribonucleic acid) techniques. Group-specific 16S rRNA-targeted&#xD;
      oligonucleotide probes labeled with the fluorescent dye Cy3 will be used for enumerating&#xD;
      bacteria. The probes used will determine bifidobacteria, bacteroides, clostridia (Clostridium&#xD;
      perfringens/histolyticum sub. Grp.), eubacterium recale-C histolyticum sub gp., agrobacterium&#xD;
      rimae - Collinsella-Eggerthella lenta sub. Gp., Lactobacillus/Enterococcus spp.,&#xD;
      desulfovibrio spp., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Escherichia coli, interferon-gamma and&#xD;
      Interleukin 10 (IL-10). Total bacteria will be enumerated using flow cytometry techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of this project would help identify microbiota patterns and bacteria species&#xD;
      that are beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis and could be targets for potential gut&#xD;
      immunomodulation therapy in the future to prolong periods of remissions.&#xD;

        Pregnant women are the basis of this study, both with and without IBD to be able to meet&#xD;
        the primary objective. As a feasibility study, there is no data on what levels are to be&#xD;
        expected in pregnant women and if those results may vary at different stage of pregnancy.&#xD;
        The investigators have chosen a small population size that reflects their anticipated&#xD;
        recruitment levels of pregnant IBD patients over 2 years in the West Midlands. The&#xD;
        investigators would expect to see 2-3 pregnant IBD patients per annum. Across 7 identified&#xD;
        collaborating sites to take part the investigators anticipate there to be between 30-42&#xD;
        patients eligible over a 2 year period.&#xD;
