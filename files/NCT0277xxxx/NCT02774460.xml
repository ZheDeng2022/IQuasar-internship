      The PHYSIC study aims to investigate the potential for precision medicine in the treatment of&#xD;
      high blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a double-blind, randomized, repeated cross-over trial with six treatment periods: four&#xD;
      classes of blood pressure-lowering drugs where treatment with two classes are repeated for&#xD;
      each patient. The classes of blood pressure-lowering drugs to be tested are a diuretic, a&#xD;
      calcium channel blocker, an ACE-inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is unknown if there is a clinically relevant between-person difference in blood pressure&#xD;
      response to a given drug, i.e. if there are responders and non-responders to the drug. If&#xD;
      there is no major between-person variation in blood pressure response or side effects of a&#xD;
      drug, then there is no potential for precision medicine. It is also unknown if between-&#xD;
      person differences in blood pressure response are different for different drugs, and&#xD;
      magnitudes of within- and between-person variations in side effects are particularly unknown.&#xD;
      Resolving these issues are imperative for the possibilities of precision blood&#xD;
      pressure-lowering treatment, and this study aims to initially answer those questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this study proves that there is potential for personalized blood pressure-lowering&#xD;
      treatment, investigators will explore the most promising predictors of blood pressure and&#xD;
      side effect response to the four major first-line classes of blood pressure-lowering drugs,&#xD;
      using several modalities of -omics methods in combination with clinical data. Using these&#xD;
      data, investigators will develop and evaluate a point-of-care biomarker panel which will rank&#xD;
      the suitability of each of the blood pressure-lowering drug classes for the individual&#xD;
      patient in terms of both anticipated blood pressure effect and side effects, thereby&#xD;
      providing a suggestion of the priority of the drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PHYSIC study is a double-blind, randomized, repeated cross-over trial with six treatment&#xD;
      periods: four classes of blood pressure-lowering drugs where treatment with two classes are&#xD;
      repeated for each patient. The classes of blood pressure-lowering drugs to be tested are a&#xD;
      diuretic, a calcium channel blocker, an ACE-inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker.&#xD;
      The repeated treatment periods allow investigators to assess whether there is consistent&#xD;
      preference of one treatment over another within a blinded patient under different treatment&#xD;
      periods. This is a key but often overlooked element in the exploration of the potential for&#xD;
      precision medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence-based titration and target doses have been chosen for all four drug classes&#xD;
      included. The suggested treatment duration of 7-9 weeks per treatment arm is based on recent&#xD;
      guidelines. Patients will be assigned a treatment order based on block randomization ensuring&#xD;
      that the same number of patients will repeat each pair of treatments. The study tests several&#xD;
      pre-defined hypotheses, which will not be adjusted for multiple testing. The main outcome&#xD;
      variable will be variation in daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure assessed in a&#xD;
      blinded fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening visit (visit 1) will occur at least two weeks before randomization (visit 2).&#xD;
      At screening, consenting patients are assessed to ensure that they meet eligibility criteria&#xD;
      initially. Patients who do not meet these criteria must not be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
      Patients who do meet these criteria are allocated an enrolment number. The amount of&#xD;
      assessment made at this visit includes consent procedures, weight, height, waist, and hip&#xD;
      circumference, physical examination, concomitant medication, blood pressure, and blood&#xD;
      sampling for safety assessment and DNA genetics. The patient will fill out two questionnaires&#xD;
      covering medical history and beliefs about medicine. In order to be introduced to&#xD;
      self-reporting symptoms and quality of life collected in electronic diary and get a baseline&#xD;
      measurement patients will be asked to log in to and fill the diary under supervision of study&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the screening visit, the patient stops taking any blood pressure-lowering drugs and&#xD;
      starts on an unblinded placebo treatment run-in period of two weeks to establish an untreated&#xD;
      baseline to be used for characterization of the study sample. During this placebo run-in&#xD;
      patients will have access to the electronic diary for reporting symptoms and quality of life.&#xD;
      Patients will also be prompted via sms to fill out this diary at home once during this&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 2, eligibility criteria will be checked once again. Concomitant medication will be&#xD;
      checked and blood pressure measured. Other blood pressure-lowering drugs are not allowed as&#xD;
      concomitant medication. Baseline assessments made at this visit includes venous blood&#xD;
      sampling (DNA methylation, RNA, proteins and metabolites), capillary blood sampling, safety&#xD;
      sampling, pulse wave analysis, initiation of the 24h blood pressure and ECG measurement. The&#xD;
      study staff will also collect AE ́s via open question and observations. Furthermore patients&#xD;
      will also fill out a validated questionnaire to measure perceived symptoms associated with&#xD;
      antihypertensive drugs (PERSYVE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If all criteria are met, the patient will be randomized to the consecutive randomization&#xD;
      number and given the first investigational product (IP). The IP will be taken once daily.&#xD;
      Each treatment period will be 7-9 weeks (titration dose 2 weeks + target dose 5-7 weeks) and&#xD;
      dosing will take place at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day after visit 2 patients will return the 24 h blood pressure and ECG equipment to the&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between visit 2 and 3 patients are dosing at home. Throughout the study, patients will have&#xD;
      access to an electronic diary for reporting symptoms and quality of life, using a validated&#xD;
      questionnaire, PERSYVE (only section 2.1 in questionnaire will be used in this study).&#xD;
      Patients will also be prompted via sms to fill out these this questionnaire at home at&#xD;
      specific time points - at week 3, week 5 and week 7 of each treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 3 of each treatment period the patient will come fasting to the clinic for venous&#xD;
      blood sampling (DNA methylation, RNA, proteins and metabolites), capillary blood sampling,&#xD;
      pulse wave analysis, concomitant medication check, blood pressure measurement, and initiation&#xD;
      of the 24h blood pressure and ECG measurement. The study staff will also collect adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs) via open question and observations. All AEs will be assessed by the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator. Furthermore, patients will also fill out two paper questionnaires; PERSYVE&#xD;
      section 2.1 (identical to questionnaire in electronic diary) and a treatment preference&#xD;
      rating questionnaire. The patient will return all unused IP to site, except for 1 capsule&#xD;
      which will be taken the following day. The study personnel will give the patient the next&#xD;
      treatment and the patient will undergo a batch, which starts with a 7- day placebo washout&#xD;
      period before the next active drug treatment period starts. Lastly, blood samples are&#xD;
      obtained and analyzed for safety parameters at visit 3 in the last treatment period only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At visit 4 (the Week 8 visit) the 24h blood pressure and ECG measurement will end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week after visit 4 in the last treatment period, the patient comes to the clinic for a&#xD;
      last visit. During this visit the patient will be asked to do an overall treatment preference&#xD;
      rating including all treatment periods. An independent and unblinded study physician will be&#xD;
      delegated to break the blind for each completed patient and prescribe the preferred IP for&#xD;
      continuous use.&#xD;
