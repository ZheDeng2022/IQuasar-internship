      With the project Smart Muscle for Incontinence Treatment (SMIT) a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      consortium consisting of representatives ranging from clinical medicine via microelectronics&#xD;
      towards biomaterial science aims to develop a novel implant to treat faecal incontinence. The&#xD;
      aim of this campaign includes development of implantable prototype devices acting as&#xD;
      artificial continence muscles using low-voltage electrically activated polymers (EAPs)&#xD;
      controlled by implemented pressure sensors and the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the knowledge of the anatomical and biomechanical properties of the anal&#xD;
      sphincter complex are of cardinal importance. Most of the existing data on anatomy and&#xD;
      physiology results is based on old studies and almost no data on biomechanical properties are&#xD;
      available. However, new technologies or even merging data from different examination methods&#xD;
      might provide new information in this field.&#xD;

      Background Fecal incontinence (FI) is affecting self-confidence and can lead to social&#xD;
      isolation and even loss of employment Often conservative treatment as the first option is&#xD;
      ineffective and surgical interventions follow conservative are necessary. Small defects of&#xD;
      the anal sphincter muscles might be treated with sphincter repair and sacral neuromodulation&#xD;
      (SNM) However, patients rarely become fully continent or short-term results deteriorate in&#xD;
      the long term. Those patients and patients with large defects are candidates for a&#xD;
      neosphincter procedure (artificial bowel sphincter or graciloplasty). However, the success&#xD;
      rate of these methods is limited and the explantation rate is high. A permanent colostomy&#xD;
      associated with massive psychosocial impairment remains as ultimate treatment option With the&#xD;
      project Smart Muscle for Incontinence Treatment (SMIT) a multidisciplinary consortium&#xD;
      consisting of representatives ranging from clinical medicine via microelectronics towards&#xD;
      biomaterial science aims to develop a novel implant to treat faecal incontinence. The aim of&#xD;
      this campaign includes development of implantable prototype devices acting as artificial&#xD;
      continence muscles using low-voltage electrically activated polymers (EAPs) controlled by&#xD;
      implemented pressure sensors and the patient. Subsequently, the knowledge of the anatomical&#xD;
      and biomechanical properties of the anal sphincter complex are of cardinal importance. Most&#xD;
      of the existing data on anatomy and physiology results is based on old studies and almost no&#xD;
      data on biomechanical properties are available. However, new technologies or even merging&#xD;
      data from different examination methods might provide new information in this field. Accurate&#xD;
      imaging data on the pelvic floor region is crucial for the development of a new, implantable&#xD;
      device for restoration of fecal continence. Optimal size (inner, outer diameter, length) and&#xD;
      geometrical shape (cylinder, cone, torus) adapted to different functional states (rest,&#xD;
      squeezing, defecation) will improve function and prevent erosion and consequent infection of&#xD;
      such a prosthesis. With this study, the investigators aim to correlate three-dimensional&#xD;
      endoanal ultrasonographic images with MRI images. The combination of different imaging&#xD;
      techniques has been demonstrated to eliminate individual drawbacks of the examination methods&#xD;
      and therefore would allow a precise description of the tissue. The registered data with their&#xD;
      complementary information would permit the distinct segmentation and three-dimensional&#xD;
      presentations of the anatomical structures in the pelvic area. This information has a great&#xD;
      potential to facilitate diagnostics and surgical planning in this region. High-resolution&#xD;
      anal manometry (HRAM) provides intra-anal pressure during rest or maximum pressure with high&#xD;
      spatial and time resolution. However Biomechanical properties of the anal canal as elasticity&#xD;
      or stiffness (compliance or flexibility) of the tissue representing important parameters for&#xD;
      a continence organ are not routinely evaluated in daily clinical practice. Functional Lumen&#xD;
      Imaging Probe (FLIP) allows the measurement of a cross sectional area (CSA) with respect to&#xD;
      applied luminal pressure, respectively. FLIP has the potential to be useful in order to&#xD;
      assess the biomechanical properties of the sphincter region. Such information potentially&#xD;
      gives new insights in physiology and pathophysiology of the continence process. With this&#xD;
      pilot study, the investigators aim to acquire anatomical and biomechanical data using&#xD;
      established (manometry) and novel technologies (merging endoanal ultrasound and MRI data) in&#xD;
      50 patients suffering from Fecal Incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective Primary objective is to collect anatomical, physiological and biomechanical&#xD;
      characteristics of the continence organ (sphincters and pelvic floor) in patients suffering&#xD;
      from fecal incontinence and to compare this data with data gathered in an earlier study&#xD;
      (NCT02263170) on healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are: test feasibility of FLIP in measuring the biomechanical properties&#xD;
      of the anal canal and test feasibility of merging 3D US data and MR images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods For the assessment of the morphology ultra sound and MRI will be used, whereas FLIP&#xD;
      (functional luminance imaging probe) and HRAM (high resolution anal manometry) are the&#xD;
      modality of choice to investigate the biomechanical properties of the sphincter complex.&#xD;
