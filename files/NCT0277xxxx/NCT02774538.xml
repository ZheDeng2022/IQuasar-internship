  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the most common of sexually transmitted viral agents and&#xD;
      they are associated with genital and oral diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Agreement between cervical and oral HPV infection has been described from a small group of&#xD;
      patient. Our study, performed on a greater number of patients, will provide a good estimation&#xD;
      of this link, between cervical and oral infection, in a French population of women with a&#xD;
      primary cervical HPV infection.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Agreement between oral and cervical HPV infection</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Agreement between oral and cervical HPV infection is defined by the presence of at least one identical genotype HPV in both sites in the same wife. All genotypes found in the oral and cervical area will be considered.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Agreement between full and partial oral and cervical HPV genotypes</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Agreement between oral and cervical HPV genotypes is considered as complete if the same HPV genotypes were detected on both sites. Agreement between oral and cervical HPV genotypes is considered as partial when at least one but not all HPV genotypes were detected at both sites.</description>

    <measure>Oral HPV risk factors</measure>

    <description>The following oral HPV risk factors will be analyzed: smoking, regular alcohol consumption, number of sexual partners, sexual risk behaviors.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Persistence and clearance of oral HPV infection</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The persistence of HPV infection will be defined by the detection of the same genotype of oral HPV between the two tests.&#xD;
The clearance of HPV infection will be defined by a positive oral HPV infection at baseline and a negative oral HPV infection up to 18 months.</description>

    <description>A total of 165 women will have a Pap test and an oral brushing performed on the day of inclusion. Risk factors for oral HPV infection will be defined using a self-administered survey summarizing the demographics and sexual behaviors.&#xD;
A second oral brushing up to 18 months will be performed during a standard follow-up visit.</description>
