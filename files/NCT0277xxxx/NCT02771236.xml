      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genes are the basic units of heredity. When genes are changed, certain cells don t work like&#xD;
      they should. Researchers want to try to better understand the genetic conditions that are&#xD;
      linked with inherited eye diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To try to identify the genes linked to the development of inherited eye diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 4 and older who have or have a family member with an inherited eye disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history and medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have one visit that will take 3 4 hours. This will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and family history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye exam: This includes the pupil being dilated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroretinography: A small electrode is taped to the forehead. Participants sit in the&#xD;
&#xD;
      dark with their eyes patched for 30 minutes. Then numbing drops and contact lenses are put in&#xD;
&#xD;
      the eyes. They will watch flashing lights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva sample: They will spit into a container or have the inside of their cheek swabbed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic testing will be done on participants blood or saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may meet with the researchers to discuss their genetic tests.&#xD;

      Objective: This project, Clinical and Molecular Studies in Families with Inherited Eye&#xD;
      Disease will study inherited eye diseases, both Mendelian and complex age related inherited&#xD;
      eye diseases, in families of many nationalities and ethnic backgrounds in order to identify&#xD;
      the genes that, when mutated, cause inherited eye diseases and the pathophysiology through&#xD;
      which they act. Among the diseases studied will be cataracts, corneal dystrophies and other&#xD;
      corneal diseases, retinal degenerations, myopia and other anterior chamber defects, and&#xD;
      glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Families and individuals of many nationalities and ethnic backgrounds. We&#xD;
      will study a maximum of 5,000 patients and family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The study consists of ascertaining individuals and especially families with multiple&#xD;
      individuals, affected by both congenital and age related inherited eye diseases. These&#xD;
      participants and their families will undergo detailed ophthalmological examinations to&#xD;
      characterize their visual system and determine their affectation status. A blood sample will&#xD;
      be collected from each individual for isolation of DNA and in some individuals for&#xD;
      lymphoblastoid transformation to establish a renewable source of DNA. Linkage analysis,&#xD;
      association analysis, physical mapping, and mutational screening will be carried out to&#xD;
      identify the specific gene and the mutations in it that are associated with inherited eye&#xD;
      disease in the family. Mutation screening may involve Sanger sequencing if a small number of&#xD;
      candidate genes are identified, or whole genome or whole exome sequencing if more genes&#xD;
      remain as viable candidates after the initial analysis. If necessary, the gene product will&#xD;
      be characterized biochemically. Blood samples may also be used to complete analyses such as:&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, and glucose tolerance tests. The study will&#xD;
      enroll participants at NEI and collaborating institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Linkage will be determined using the lod score method, association will be&#xD;
      determined using standard statistical procedures to estimate p values, and mutations in&#xD;
      specific genes will be assessed using a combination of residue conservation, blosum score,&#xD;
      bioinformatic prediction of structural damage to the protein, and molecular modeling.&#xD;
      Assessment of biochemical, metabolic, and physiological effects of these mutations will be&#xD;
      individualized to the specific case.&#xD;
