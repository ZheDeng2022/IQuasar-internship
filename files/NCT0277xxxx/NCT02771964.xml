    <textblock>
      This study will compare two commonly-used methods for assessing patient-reported quality of&#xD;
      life. The first is to assess quality of life before surgery and again after surgery using the&#xD;
      same validated scale (ie Veterans Rand 12). The second is simply to ask patients whether or&#xD;
      not they think their post-operative quality of life is better, worse, or the same. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the second method may be inaccurate due to cognitive bias.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All preoperative and postoperative quality of life data comes from the SATISFY-SOS&#xD;
      (NCT02032030) surveys, which are administered to patients at the preoperative assessment&#xD;
      visit and then approximately 30 days after surgery. To maximize the follow-up survey response&#xD;
      rate, patients are emailed the survey (once), mailed hard copy surveys (two times), and&#xD;
      phoned (up to five times).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The twelve items comprising the Veterans RAND 12 (VR-12) are items 24 through 35 on the&#xD;
      survey, while the self-reported global quality of life question is item 1. The VR-12 is made&#xD;
      up of two components: a physical component score (PCS), and a mental component score (MCS).&#xD;
      Both scores are continuous on a scale from 0 to 100 (where higher is greater quality of&#xD;
      life), and they are calibrated so that a score of 50 represents the US population mean (Kazis&#xD;
      2006, Selim 2009). The 30-day follow-up questionnaires also ask patients to self-report their&#xD;
      change in quality of life. The question asks, &quot;How would you rate your quality of life now?&quot;&#xD;
      with answer choices including &quot;Better than before your procedure,&quot; &quot;The same as before your&#xD;
      procedure,&quot; and &quot;Worse than before your procedure.&quot; Surgical specialty for the procedure is&#xD;
      obtained from the electronic medical record. Using queries in MetaVision (iMDsoft, Needham,&#xD;
      MA), the informaticist will provide the requested survey and medical record data to the&#xD;
      investigators. He performs rigorous data validation on each queried variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SATISFY-SOS databases are hosted on a firewall-secured network server managed by the&#xD;
      Department of Anesthesiology. The server is securely housed behind two locked doors within&#xD;
      the departmental office suite and maintained and managed by the departmental IT team. Only&#xD;
      the project Informaticist, Data Manager, and Director(s) have full access to these databases,&#xD;
      which are also password-protected and encrypted for additional protection. Hardcopies of the&#xD;
      baseline surveys are collected daily from the CPAP clinic and securely stored behind two&#xD;
      locked doors within the Department of Anesthesiology. Baseline completed paper surveys are&#xD;
      scanned into a digital image format (compressed TIFF). The digital image files are indexed&#xD;
      and stored on a research file server that is attached to a private network with no public&#xD;
      access. Survey email, mail and call lists are generated at Washington University in a similar&#xD;
      manner to mailing lists for billing services. For each patient and date of service, a unique&#xD;
      ID is generated and never duplicated. This unique ID is a nonsensical only meaningful to the&#xD;
      research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline surveys are processed by Solutions Data Systems. The digital image files are&#xD;
      transmitted to Solutions Data Systems via secure file transfer protocol. When data entry has&#xD;
      been confirmed, Solutions Data Systems deletes the digital image file from their servers.&#xD;
      Press Ganey, a vendor specializing in patient survey distribution and collection,&#xD;
      disseminates, collects, and processes 30-day and 1-year surveys. Paper surveys processed&#xD;
      through automated scanning are all manually checked, and a manager listens to 10% of&#xD;
      telephone surveys. All telephone surveys are recorded and available for future quality checks&#xD;
      for performance improvement. Press Ganey stores the survey hardcopies for 90 days while the&#xD;
      study team conducts spot-check quality assessments of the scanned data. The company then&#xD;
      shreds the paper copies. Similarly, Press Ganey will hold copies of the electronic files and&#xD;
      electronic recordings for 90 days, after which the electronic files are removed permanently&#xD;
      from their system (and then only maintained by Washington University). During this 90-day&#xD;
      period, the study team conducts additional quality assessments of the converted data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size considerations for this study were based on the primary outcome. The first&#xD;
      component of the primary endpoint is comparing the median quality of life scores among the&#xD;
      three self-reported change groups (better/same/worse). Using a minimum important difference&#xD;
      of five points (Norman 2003), two tails, alpha of 0.05, and 80% power, the required sample&#xD;
      size is 77 patients per group, or 231 total patients among the three groups. The second&#xD;
      component of the primary outcome is the agreement between the two quality of life measures,&#xD;
      as reflected by the kappa statistic. Kappa does not have sample size requirements beyond lack&#xD;
      of sparse cells. The third component of the primary outcome is comparing the percentage&#xD;
      agreement across the three different self-reported change groups. Since no studies have&#xD;
      performed this type of comparison previously, the investigators pre-specified a 10% change as&#xD;
      the minimum important change. Estimating 80% agreement, and using two tails, alpha=0.05, and&#xD;
      80% power, the required total sample size is 311 per group, or 933 total patients. Therefore,&#xD;
      this study has adequate power for all of these endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following statistical analyses will be performed, using alpha=0.05 and 95 percent&#xD;
      confidence intervals, where appropriate. All analyses will be performed twice, once for VR-12&#xD;
      physical quality of life, and again for the VR-12 mental quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare change in VR-12 QOL scores for those answering better/same/worse&#xD;
           (Kruskal-Wallis). If significant, will use Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests to compare each of&#xD;
           the three groups, using a Bonferroni correction of alpha=0.017.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calculate overall agreement between the self-reported and validated quality of life&#xD;
           measures (using weighted kappa, which penalizes disagreements in proportion to their&#xD;
           seriousness).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calculate the overall percent of patients whose self-reported and validated quality of&#xD;
           life scores matched (descriptive), including stratification by self-reported global&#xD;
           change better/same/worse (compared using chi-square).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calculate the quality of life where an equal proportion of patients reported better and&#xD;
           same quality of life (MCID for improvement), or same and worse quality of life (MCID for&#xD;
           deterioration). This is an anchor-based approach (Wright 2012)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the change in VR-12 score and percent of patients reporting better, same, and&#xD;
           worse quality of life for each of the following surgical specialties: neurosurgery,&#xD;
           orthopedic, plastic, ophthalmologic, general, cardiac, gynecologic, otolaryngology,&#xD;
           gastrointestinal/hepatobiliary, urologic, and &quot;other.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only those answering both the self-reported quality of life question and at least ten out of&#xD;
      twelve VR-12 questions at baseline and 30 days will be included. The investigators will&#xD;
      describe the characteristics of those with and without missing data. Multiple imputation will&#xD;
      be used to fill in missing measurements for those missing two or fewer items on the VR-12&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
