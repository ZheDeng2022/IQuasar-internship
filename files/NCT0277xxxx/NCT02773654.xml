  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of a mobile clinical application to&#xD;
      reliably and accurately track scapular motion in people with asymptomatic and symptomatic&#xD;
      shoulders. The ability to accurately and reliably measure shoulder position clinically is an&#xD;
      important first step in choosing the best treatment techniques to treat shoulder movement&#xD;
      dysfunction. Therefore, the primary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the inter- and intra-rater reliability of shoulder joint position&#xD;
           measurements in symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects, by using a mobile application,&#xD;
           with and without use of a handle for a smartphone&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the validity of the shoulder joint position measurements measurements as&#xD;
           described above.&#xD;

      Subjects will be asked to provide demographic and background information such as age, height,&#xD;
      history of pain or injury, and descriptions of their physical activity levels. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive a clinical screening exam by a licensed physical therapist to determine the type of&#xD;
      movement abnormalities present, the severity of their symptoms and to screen for inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect scapular position measurement reliability data, subjects will stand through out&#xD;
      data collection. Measurements of the scapula will be taken with the mobile application for&#xD;
      the arm at rest and in two elevated position. Subjects will wear an off-the-shelf elbow brace&#xD;
      when asked to hold their arm in the two elevated positions. These elevated positions will be&#xD;
      maintained by having subjects maintain contact of their forearm against a guide. For&#xD;
      intra-rater reliability, position measurements will be repeated twice for each of three&#xD;
      planes of elevation. Additionally, for inter-rater reliability each measurement will be&#xD;
      repeated once by two other examiners. This process will repeated twice when using the&#xD;
      application with and without the handle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the validation portion of the study, a subgroup of subjects will have the same position&#xD;
      measurements performed by a single examiner with additional motion sensors taped to the skin&#xD;
      of their scapula and breast bone and a sensor attached to an arm brace strapped to their arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, the subject will be asked to raise and hold their arm for approximately 5 sec, 36&#xD;
      times during the testing within ranges of motion typically performed during daily activities.&#xD;
