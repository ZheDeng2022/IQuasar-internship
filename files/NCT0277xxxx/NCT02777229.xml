  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several reports indicate that treatment failure due to HIV resistance or to adverse&#xD;
      event-related discontinuation could compromise the effectiveness of scaling-up antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment (ART), especially when lack of access to viral load is a concern. Combined with&#xD;
      other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, Dolutegravir (DTG) is a very promising&#xD;
      alternative to the current first-line non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based&#xD;
      regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial evaluations of DTG conducted in high income countries showed excellent efficacy and&#xD;
      safety and indicated high genetic barrier thus preserving second line treatment. As a&#xD;
      consequence, DTG-based regimens have been recently included in the first-line options in the&#xD;
      national guidelines for ART of several high-income countries. However, the clinical trials&#xD;
      evaluating DTG-based regimens have been conducted in highly controlled conditions, including&#xD;
      baseline resistance testing and regular viral load monitoring. Moreover, these trials&#xD;
      included a high proportion of men with rare co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is need to evaluate how a DTG-based regimen will perform in real-world conditions&#xD;
      within resources-constrained settings, where viral load monitoring is limited, and where the&#xD;
      majority of HIV patients are women with important family planning consideration and NAMSAL&#xD;
      trial is a randomized clinical trial which aims to evaluate efficacy and safety over 48, 96&#xD;
      and 192 weeks of DTG + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine versus Efavirenz (EFV) +&#xD;
      tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine in 606 ART-na√Øve HIV-1-infected adults in Cameroon.&#xD;
      A set of efficacy and safety endpoints will be compared over 48, 96 and 192 weeks between the&#xD;
      two arms including the proportion of patients with viral load &lt;50 copies/mL and incidence of&#xD;
      severe adverse events.&#xD;
