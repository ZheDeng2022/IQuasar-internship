      Pediatric ACL: Understanding Treatment Outcomes (PLUTO) is a multi-center, prospective cohort&#xD;
      study. Specific aims of PLUTO are to evaluate the safety and comparative effectiveness of&#xD;
      non-operative treatment, as well as four operative treatments including (1) transphyseal ACL&#xD;
      reconstruction (2) partial transphyseal ACL reconstruction, (3) physeal-sparing epiphyseal&#xD;
      ACL reconstruction using the Anderson technique, and (4) physeal-sparing ACL reconstruction&#xD;
      using the Micheli/Kocher technique in prepubescent and pubescent skeletally immature&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries are being seen with increased frequency in&#xD;
      pediatric and adolescent patients. The management of these injuries is controversial and&#xD;
      includes nonoperative treatment and operative treatment with various surgical techniques.&#xD;

      patients. Accrual will take place over eight years at 9 pediatric sports medicine centers.&#xD;
      Post-treatment outcome assessment will be performed at 6-9 months, 1 year, and 2, 5, and 10&#xD;
      years after treatment , including functional outcome, activity level, health-related quality&#xD;
      of life, graft survivorship, knee stability, knee motion, and growth disturbance.&#xD;
