    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works when given together with letrozole&#xD;
      and palbociclib in treating postmenopausal patients with newly diagnosed stage IV estrogen&#xD;
      receptor positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic).&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such as&#xD;
      letrozole, may lessen the amount of estrogen made by the body. Palbociclib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, letrozole, and palbociclib may be an effective treatment for patients with&#xD;
      stage IV estrogen receptor positive breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR), based on Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors [RECIST], version 1.1), of pembrolizumab in combination with letrozole and&#xD;
      palbociclib in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic estrogen receptor (ER)+human&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2- breast cancer, and determine if the addition of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab to letrozole and palbociclib combination can achieve an improved response rate&#xD;
      (ORR = complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) measured from the study baseline,&#xD;
      based on RECIST version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of adding pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) to&#xD;
      letrozole (2.5 mg) and palbociclib (125 mg 3 weeks on, one week off) in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic ER+HER2- breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the CR rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate duration of response (DOR) using RECIST version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate clinical benefit rate (CBR) using RECIST version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To evaluate toxicities (using the National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for adverse Events [CTCAE], version 4.0) associated with the triple drug combination&#xD;
      (pembrolizumab, letrozole, and palbociclib) in patients with metastatic ER+HER2- breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To evaluate CR, PR, ORR, PFS, DOR, and CBR using immune-related Response Criteria In&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (irRECIST); time to treatment failure will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To study cellular/humoral immune response by analyzing immune and stromal cell&#xD;
      characteristics before and after treatment that correlate with clinical response; this&#xD;
      includes programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To study the peripheral serum thymidine kinase (TK) level and its association with&#xD;
      treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To study circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) and the effect of&#xD;
      combining pembrolizumab, letrozole, and palbociclib on ctDNA profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate genomic and phenotypic status of breast tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive letrozole orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and palbociclib PO QD for&#xD;
      3 weeks. Cycless with letrozole and palbociclib repeat every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive pembrolizumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles with pembrolizumab repeat every 21 days&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 6 months for&#xD;
      3 years, and then every 12 months for 1 year.&#xD;
