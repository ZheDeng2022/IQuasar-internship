  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being performed to assess how certain chronic disabilities - stroke, upper&#xD;
      extremity (UE) amputation, spinal cord injuries (SCI), cerebral palsy (CP) - differ from&#xD;
      healthy subjects in their ability to perform ADLs. By studying the kinematics of the&#xD;
      respective cohort of study participants as they are assessed performing common activities of&#xD;
      daily living (ADLS), the investigators research team aims to better understand how impaired&#xD;
      neural pathways, and pathways that have been impaired at various points along the pathway,&#xD;
      deleteriously affect ADLs in patients with differing long-term disabilities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cross-sectional study comparing bilateral ADL activities for stroke survivors, SCI&#xD;
      paraplegics, UE amputees, adults with CP, and healthy controls. The study participants will&#xD;
      perform 4 ADL tasks with the BiAS passive robots. From these tasks, the BiAS robots will&#xD;
      provide information regarding position, velocity, distance, displacement, etc. This, along&#xD;
      with video information provided by the 3D Kinect and EEG neuroheadset, will be used as the&#xD;
      basis of the investigators data and aid in informing members of the research team on how the&#xD;
      respective impairments affected upper limb kinematics on ADL tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will include the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Informed Consent: After arrival, subjects will review and sign the consent form with&#xD;
           study personnel present.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-Assessments: A member of the research team will evaluate the subjects' upper&#xD;
           extremity and assess their ability to use it. Subjects will be evaluated using a battery&#xD;
           of assessments such as, but not limited to, the Box and Block, Pin and Prick, and grip&#xD;
           strength using a dynamometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Break: Subjects will be given a 15 minute break.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. BiAS passive robot system: Subjects will be introduced to the device and each wrist will&#xD;
           be placed on to the end of each robot. As common therapy tasks are performed by the&#xD;
           subject, the BiAS devices will collect the data along with the video from 3D Kinect, ECG&#xD;
           gelled electrodes, and the EEG neuroheadset. After each of the 4 ADL activities,&#xD;
           subjects will be asked about their level of exercise and discomfort, if any. After&#xD;
           subjects finish all exercises with the BiAS, they will be thanked for their&#xD;
           participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Video and photos may be collected to determine subject quality of ADL movement.&#xD;
