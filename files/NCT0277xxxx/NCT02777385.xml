  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study regimen consists of cisplatin and radiation for all patients, the standard&#xD;
      treatment for head and neck cancer. All patients will also receive pembrolizumab (the study&#xD;
      drug), and will be randomized to two treatment schedules: either pembrolizumab with&#xD;
      cisplatin-radiation, or pembrolizumab after completing cisplatin-radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this research study is to learn which therapy order (adding pembrolizumab during&#xD;
      vs. after cisplatin and radiation) may be more effective in treating head and neck cancer, as&#xD;
      well as learn the side effects of these combinations.Pembrolizumab is an immune therapy, a&#xD;
      drug that stimulates the immune system to fight cancer, and is FDA approved in lung cancer&#xD;
      and melanoma. It is not currently FDA approved for head and neck cancer.&#xD;
