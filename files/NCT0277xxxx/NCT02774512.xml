      This is a monocentric prospective non randomized phase 0 clinical trial targeting patients&#xD;
      with colon cancer for whom an upfront surgery has been advised by the pluridisciplinary team.&#xD;
      The surgical management should not be changed or delayed. The patient is seen in consultation&#xD;
      by one of the two surgeons. The patient receives information and consents to participate to&#xD;
      the study. A specific colonoscopy is performed in order to take biopsy for biological&#xD;
      studies. According to the expression level of ZAK-0, the patient is included in the&#xD;
      corresponding arm: ZAK-0 expressor or ZAK-0 non-expressor. Then the patient receives&#xD;
      nilotinib orally at the dose of 800 mg/day (400 mg twice a day) for 7 days. The patient is&#xD;
      scheduled for surgery the morning after the last take of the nilotinib (12 hours). When the&#xD;
      colectomy is performed, the surgeon collects different tumoral samples which are immediately&#xD;
      delivered to the laboratory. There are no additional changes in the clinical follow up.&#xD;
