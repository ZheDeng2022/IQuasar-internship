    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of romiplostim administered once&#xD;
      weekly to Aplastic Anemia (AA) patients with thrombocytopenia refractory to or ineligible for&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy in Japan and Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and pharmacokinetics of romiplostim after repeated administration will also be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
