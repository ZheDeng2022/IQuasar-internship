      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cadisurf (goat lung&#xD;
      surfactant extract) as compared to Survanta (beractant) in the treatment of respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome in preterm neonates (with gestation of 26 to 32 weeks).&#xD;

      Title: Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of an Innovative and Affordable Lung Surfactant for&#xD;
      the treatment of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) in preterm neonates: a multi-site&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase of Development: Phase II/ III&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication: Respiratory Distress Syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To compare the incidence of survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia&#xD;
      (BPD) at 36 weeks postmenstrual age in preterm neonates (≤32 wk) with RDS randomized to&#xD;
      receive intratracheal administration (100 mg/kg) of either goat lung surfactant extract&#xD;
      (GLSE) or the standard preparation (Beractant; Survanta; Abbott, USA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: 1 To compare area under curve (AUC) for oxygen requirement (FiO2)&#xD;
      requirement in first 48 h of surfactant administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 To compare incidence of safety outcomes namely air leaks, pulmonary hemorrhage,&#xD;
      intraventricular hemorrhage, neonatal mortality, sepsis and retinopathy of prematurity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A multicentric, non-inferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT) in preterm&#xD;
      infants with RDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Centers: The study would be conducted at 12-14 academic centers of India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: A total of approximately 900 eligible preterm neonates will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned No. of subjects: N~900 to be enrolled by 12-14 centers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Product : GLSE (Lung Surfactant Extract) Cadisurf 25&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage and site of administration: Dosage: Neonates in the intervention group will be&#xD;
      administered 100 mg/kg of GLSE. Those in the control group will be administered 100 mg/kg of&#xD;
      Beractant (Survanta®, Abbott, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site of Administration: Intratracheal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Duration of Participation of each Subject: 4-10 Weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected duration of study 3 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology The study would be conducted at 12-14 study sites. The dedicated study teams&#xD;
      under the leadership of site Principal Investigator (PI) at each site would implement the&#xD;
      study protocol as per uniform standard operating procedures (SOPs). Written informed consent&#xD;
      will be taken from the legally authorized representative (LAR) of the subject. Subjects will&#xD;
      be enrolled based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria depicted in the institute ethics&#xD;
      committee (IEC) &amp; Central drugs standard control organization (CDSCO) approved protocol.&#xD;
      After satisfying inclusion/exclusion criteria subjects will be randomized either GLSE arm or&#xD;
      Beractant (Survanta®, Abbott, USA) arm. The duration of the hospitalization would be 4-10&#xD;
      weeks. Enrolled infants would be monitored by the study team round the clock as per standard&#xD;
      procedures. The study infants would be followed up until death or 36 weeks of postmenstrual&#xD;
      age (PMA). Adverse events &amp; serious adverse events will be recorded &amp; reported as per the&#xD;
      regulatory guidelines of India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study infants would be followed up until 36 weeks of PMA. The study would be conducted at&#xD;
      12-14 study sites. The study will be conducted in a highly supervised clinical setting with&#xD;
      immediate availability of clinicians experienced with intubation, ventilator management and&#xD;
      general care of premature infants. Infants receiving surfactant will be frequently monitored&#xD;
      with arterial or transcutaneous measurement of systemic O2 and CO2. The dedicated study teams&#xD;
      at each site would implement the study protocol as per uniform standard operating procedures&#xD;
      (SOPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Study Endpoint • BPD free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Random sequence The random sequence will be generated using web based algorithm for 1:1&#xD;
           allocation and stratification by site and gestation (&lt;28 and 28-32 weeks) in permuted&#xD;
           blocks of random sizes. The block sizes will be blinded to the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Allocation concealment The vials of two surfactant products would be packaged in&#xD;
           identical cardboard boxes (by CDSA) and sequentially numbered as per the allocation&#xD;
           sequence for two gestation strata (8 mL vials for strata 26-27 weeks and 28-32 weeks,&#xD;
           respectively) for each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Implementation The randomization sequence would be generated by an independent&#xD;
           statistician and will be kept in safe custody and undisclosed to investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dedicated research teams would track, ascertain the eligibility and randomize the&#xD;
           infants and measure the outcomes. The clinical team would administer surfactant blinded&#xD;
           to research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blinding Clinicians would be aware of the type of surfactant product received by the&#xD;
           neonate given the different physical appearance of the product and the vial of Cadisurf®&#xD;
           and Survanta®. Clinicians would administer the surfactant to the baby while the baby's&#xD;
           bed is cordoned off from rest of NICU by cloth screen. The parents and the research&#xD;
           staff responsible for outcome assessment would be kept blinded to the interventions. The&#xD;
           allocation would be concealed in the dataset so that the researchers can analyse data&#xD;
           without information of the allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analysis Interim analyses, if desired by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), are&#xD;
      proposed at enrolment of 5%, 33% and 66% of the target sample size. The DSMB would only have&#xD;
      access to the results of such analyses. Interim analysis will be conducted using&#xD;
      O'Brien-Fleming spending function and a type I error rate of 5%.&#xD;

    <description>Cadisurf Intratracheal suspension is a sterile, non-pyrogenic pulmonary surfactant intended for intratracheal use only. It is a natural lung extract containing phospholipids and surfactant-associated proteins. The resulting composition provides 25 mg/mL phospholipids and less than 1.0 mg/ml protein. It is suspended in 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Cadisurf contains no preservatives. Each ml of Cadisurf contains 25 mg of phospholipids. It is a creamy white suspension supplied in single-use glass vials containing 8 mL (200 mg phospholipids).</description>
