      The purpose of this study is to determine the proportion of children presenting to a&#xD;
      pediatric emergency department with an acute mental health/behavioral crisis or clinical drug&#xD;
      toxicity who have a &quot;match&quot; or &quot;mismatch&quot; between the genes for drug metabolizing enzymes and&#xD;
      their current or recent drug therapy. The investigators will utilize a readily available and&#xD;
      FDA-approved cheek swab DNA test --GeneSight®--in these children that categorizes patients&#xD;
      into 3 different type of groups - RED, YELLOW, and GREEN based on individuals' abilities to&#xD;
      metabolize psychotropic drugs . Specific objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The relationship of genomic mismatch to serum drug concentrations, either low or high&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The proportion of children with a genomic mismatch who present to PED with intentional&#xD;
           self-injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The relationship between match versus mismatch and self- and caregiver-reported outcomes&#xD;
           of functioning, drug efficacy, and drug tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the proportion of children/adolescents who present to PED with an adverse drug&#xD;
           reaction to one or more psychotropic with a genomic mismatch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantify the specific adverse reactions related to a mismatch of genotypes.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 13-20% of children living in the&#xD;
      United States experience a mental disorder in a given year and an estimated $247 billion is&#xD;
      spent each year on childhood mental disorders. In the last 5 years, emergency departments&#xD;
      (ED) have been facing dramatic increases in the volume of pediatric patients presenting for&#xD;
      evaluation and treatment of mental and behavioral disorders, to the point where it has been&#xD;
      termed a national pediatric mental health crisis. Coincident with this increase has been the&#xD;
      exponential increase in the number of children, both children as young as 2 years of age and&#xD;
      adolescents, being prescribed 1 or more psychotropic medications-antidepressants (AD),&#xD;
      antipsychotics (AP), and medications for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)--&#xD;
      for various mental and behavioral disorders in the last 10 years. More intentional overdoses,&#xD;
      therapeutic errors, and/or adverse drug reactions (ADR) to these classes of medications are&#xD;
      being evaluated in our pediatric emergency department (PED), potentially attributable to the&#xD;
      increased number of children taking these medications. National Poison Data System (NPDS)&#xD;
      -reported exposures to these medication classes continue to increase in both children and&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numbers and rates of adverse drug event (ADE) emergency department visits involving&#xD;
      psychiatric medications among US adults are significant, although the numbers in children are&#xD;
      less well defined. The development of adverse medical conditions related to antipsychotic and&#xD;
      other psychotropic medication use in children and adolescents has been found to be&#xD;
      significantly associated with higher total costs of health care and to higher utilization of&#xD;
      outpatient, emergency, and inpatient services over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interindividual differences of people's clinical responses to psychotropic drugs and adverse&#xD;
      drug reactions despite identical disease severity or etiology may be better explained by&#xD;
      genetic variation among patients than other various factors. We will determine if genetic&#xD;
      polymorphisms for genes coding for CYP450 drug metabolizing enzymes are associated with&#xD;
      therapeutic failures and/or toxicity using the GeneSight® buccal swab test. Multiple&#xD;
      published adult clinical studies have demonstrated that this combinatorial, multi-gene test&#xD;
      better predicts antidepressant treatment outcomes for patients with depression and their use&#xD;
      of health care resources, than any of the individual genes that comprise the test. One study&#xD;
      demonstrated 70% greater improvement in depressive symptoms when GeneSight® guided&#xD;
      physicians' treatment compared to unguided treatment, while another demonstrated a 67%&#xD;
      increase in total healthcare visits when medication plans did not match their genetic&#xD;
      profiles, contributing to significant increase in healthcare costs.19,20 Recent&#xD;
      recommendations from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium of the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health Pharmacogenomics Research Network suggest that current data indicate&#xD;
      that genotypes for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 can lead to specific treatment recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators knowledge, this study is one of the first to propose the use of&#xD;
      pharmacogenomic tests to study toxicity or treatment failure in pediatric patients using&#xD;
      psychotropic medications and assess its clinical utility in patients presenting in crises to&#xD;
      an ED. The results of this study are very likely to change clinical practice leading to&#xD;
      increased pharmacogenomic testing of children and adolescents at their point of care in&#xD;
      outpatient clinics, inpatient services, or PEDs. If successful, this project will lay the&#xD;
      groundwork for future prospective analyses of genotypic &quot;match&quot; versus &quot;mismatch&quot; and either&#xD;
      symptomatic or toxic adverse outcomes in this cohort presenting to a PED compared to a&#xD;
      control population in an outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Inclusion criteria: Two categories of PED patients on psychotropic&#xD;
      medications will be included in this trial: (1) Children/adolescents who present with&#xD;
      psychiatric/behavioral crisis or intentional overdose. This would include those referred for&#xD;
      psychiatric evaluation, who may have behavioral problems (aggressive behavior, violent&#xD;
      behavior), suicidal or homicidal thoughts, recent history of self-injury (with or without&#xD;
      suicidal intent), depression, psychosis, anxiety, altered mental status, or violence. 2)&#xD;
      Children/adolescents who present to the PED with a suspected adverse drug reaction to any of&#xD;
      the psychotropic/ADHD medications (toxicity)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: (1) Patients on the aforementioned medications who present to the PED&#xD;
      with a chief complaint other than those listed above. (2) Participants who present with acute&#xD;
      intoxication with alcohol or drugs of abuse. (3) Patients in Alabama Department of Human&#xD;
      Resources (DHR) custody. (4) Those with medical conditions that preclude participation. (5)&#xD;
      Those with previous pharmacogenomic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 100 patients 3-18 years of age who are taking 1 or more AD, AP,&#xD;
      and/or ADHD medication presenting to the PED at Children's of Alabama with mental&#xD;
      health/behavioral crisis and/or adverse drug reaction to one of these drugs. This would&#xD;
      include those referred for psychiatric evaluation, who may have behavioral problems, suicidal&#xD;
      or homicidal thoughts, recent history of self-injury (with or without suicidal intent),&#xD;
      depression, psychosis, anxiety, altered mental status, or violence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The informed consent process will take place before any study-specific procedures are&#xD;
      initiated. Signed and dated written informed consent must be obtained from each&#xD;
      patient/parent/legal caregiver prior to enrollment into the study. Assent for patients 7-13&#xD;
      years of age will be obtained unless criteria for waiver is met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Buccal Swab: GeneSight uses a combinatorial psychiatric pharmacogenomics (CPGx) multi-gene&#xD;
      approach to produce a personalized interpretive report that categorizes psychotropic&#xD;
      medications into three groups (RED [use with increased caution and with more frequent&#xD;
      monitoring], YELLOW[use with caution], GREEN[use as directed) based on objective,&#xD;
      evidence-based gene-drug interactions. This decision support tool helps clinicians to make&#xD;
      informed, evidence-based decisions about proper drug selection, based on the testing for&#xD;
      clinically important genetic variants in multiple pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic genes&#xD;
      that affect a patient's ability to tolerate or respond to medications. It consists of a&#xD;
      cotton swab. GeneSight Psychotropic provides information on 38 FDA-approved antidepressant&#xD;
      and antipsychotic drugs. GeneSight® ADHD provides information on 100% of the FDA-approved&#xD;
      medications for ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Sampling: Blood for measuring serum concentrations of the medications that the patient&#xD;
      is taking will be obtained (15-20 ml depending on how many medications the child is taking,&#xD;
      10 ml if the patient is &lt; 14 kg). A small portion of this blood (5 ml) will also be banked&#xD;
      for future DNA genomic analyses. These blood volumes are all within accepted volumes for&#xD;
      patients in this age range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Blood samples are normally obtained in patients with drug overdose, suspected drug&#xD;
      toxicity as part of their standard evaluation as well as many patients being admitted to an&#xD;
      inpatient psychiatric facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12-lead Electrocardiogram: Rate, rhythm, QRS interval, QT, corrected QT interval (QTc),&#xD;
      terminal R wave in lead aVR will be recorded. The ECG is usually a standard part of the&#xD;
      evaluation for ingestions/overdose/suspected drug toxicity and sometimes for patients being&#xD;
      admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to these tests we will also collect: (1) Demographics: age, sex/gender,&#xD;
      race/ethnicity, living situation, educational attainment. (2) Medication History: list of&#xD;
      current and past psychotropic medication treatments including name, doses, start and stop&#xD;
      dates, and estimated response. (3) All other medications. (4) Socioeconomic information,&#xD;
      including third party reimbursement. (5) Recall of healthcare utilization over the previous&#xD;
      12 months including hospitalization or ED visits. (6) Indication for psychotropic medication&#xD;
      (note that formal diagnostic interviewing will not be performed because of constraints of the&#xD;
      ED setting). (7) Reason for the current ED visit (e.g., anxiety, panic attack, intentional&#xD;
      self-injury including suicide attempt, suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, medication&#xD;
      overdose, harm to persons or property, other aggression, psychosis, severe depression, other&#xD;
      psychiatric cause, adverse drug reaction). (8) Global Assessment of Function (GAF) scale,&#xD;
      Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI-I), and Clinical Global Efficacy Index (CGI-E), all&#xD;
      validated scales used extensively in psychiatric research and (9) Clinical toxicity/adverse&#xD;
      drug reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note that the scales delineated in #8 ask for information that is usually part of the&#xD;
      physician's history and patient assessment: - self-assessment or the parent/caregiver's&#xD;
      assessment of the patient's overall functioning, drug tolerability, drug efficacy. This&#xD;
      information has been developed into validated scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process is designed to be relatively brief to allow the study to proceed within the&#xD;
      workflow of the PED. Some information will be obtained from the electronic medical record&#xD;
      (drug names, duration of therapy, previous psychiatric diagnoses) if the patient, parent,&#xD;
      and/or caregiver is unsure or doesn't know.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive statistics, specifically proportions, will be calculated for: Mismatch of&#xD;
           proportion of children presenting to PED with GeneSight RED or YELLOW categories and i.)&#xD;
           acute psychiatric/behavioral crisis ED visits; ii.) serum drug concentrations, high or&#xD;
           low; and iii.) overdose of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of self-reported/caregiver-reported negative scores on GAF (score 5,6,7),&#xD;
           CGI-I (score 5,6,7), CGI-E scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relationship between Mismatch(RED,YELLOW) and Match (GREEN) and self- and/or&#xD;
           care-reported GAF, CGI-I, CGI-E scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive statistics, specifically proportions will be calculated for: Mismatch of&#xD;
           proportion of children presenting to PED with GeneSight genotype RED or YELLOW&#xD;
           categories and adverse drug reactions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of GeneSight genotype mismatch RED or YELLOW categories and specific adverse&#xD;
           reactions/clinical toxicity&#xD;
