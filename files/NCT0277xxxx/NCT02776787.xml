  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Half of all Americans over 60 years of age have diverticulitis of the colon. Over the last&#xD;
      decade, the use of elective colon resection has increased by more than 50%, and&#xD;
      diverticulitis is now the leading reason for elective colectomy. Surgeons and patients alike&#xD;
      have a difficult time deciding if surgery is the best choice to treat diverticulitis. The&#xD;
      goal of the DEBUT study is to improve the understanding about how doctors and patients make&#xD;
      decisions to have elective surgery for diverticulitis, and the global impact of&#xD;
      diverticulitis on patients' lives.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine both clinical and non-clinical reasons for pursuing surgery, taking&#xD;
      into account previously unexplored areas in surgical decision-making including the&#xD;
      comprehensive impact of this disease, as well as factors that impact a surgeon's willingness&#xD;
      to recommend surgery. Ultimately, this patient-centered research approach will help us&#xD;
      understand the impact of treatment decisions on a patient's quality of life, work, and&#xD;
      clinical symptoms, and will ultimately help to inform our recommendations for the treatment&#xD;
      of patients with diverticulitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DEBUT study was developed from questions raised by our Washington State Surgical&#xD;
      Collaborative, (SCOAP Colon and Rectal Surgery Work Group) and will be carried out in clinics&#xD;
      and hospitals across Washington State, Oregon, and California. The investigators invite&#xD;
      patients to participate in research activities designed to identify the impact of&#xD;
      diverticulitis and treatment options, in order to better understand the outcomes that matter&#xD;
      most to patients. Patients who are considering surgery or who have received treatment for&#xD;
      their diverticulitis will be recruited for study participation. Participants will complete a&#xD;
      baseline survey via a convenient electronic platform, and follow-up surveys will be sent&#xD;
      quarterly for up to four years. These surveys will examine quality of life, overall health,&#xD;
      and clinical symptoms to understand what drives patients and surgeons to an operation, as&#xD;
      well as how that decision impacts quality of life and recurrent events in patients that&#xD;
      choose to have surgery compared to those that do not have surgery. Participating surgeons&#xD;
      will complete surveys that examine their indications for surgery and surgical outcomes.&#xD;
