      The objective of this randomized phase III study is to test the superiority of Kypho-IORT&#xD;
      compared to EBRT with regard of time to pain reduction in patients with painful vertebral&#xD;
      metastases. Therefore patients will receive intraoperative radiotherapy (8 Gy with Intrabeam&#xD;
      System/Carl Zeiss) during kyphoplasty (Arm A) or external beam radiotherapy with 30 Gy, added&#xD;
      in 3 Gy per fraction on a conventional linear accelerator or 8 Gy single dose (only for&#xD;
      international study centers, not permitted in Germany) (Arm B).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Due to optimized therapies life expectancy of patients with metastasizing cancer increases.&#xD;
      Bone metastases affect 10% - 30% of all cancer patients, especially located in the vertebral&#xD;
      column. The main clinical problems are back pain and an increased risk of pathological&#xD;
      fracture. Therefore optimized palliative treatments to improve quality of life are necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is a well-established treatment option for patients with&#xD;
      spinal metastases. EBRT often results in an adequate pain relief with good local tumor&#xD;
      control . Of the retrospective series that described pain outcome mentioned in the systematic&#xD;
      review by Gerszten et al., a mean of 70% of patients had improvement in pain after radiation&#xD;
      therapy. The mean rate of local control was 77%. Although EBRT is the standard treatment for&#xD;
      painful vertebral metastases, the optimal dose fraction schedule or the optimal standard dose&#xD;
      has not been established. Different fractionation schedules of EBRT are discussed in a&#xD;
      recently published review. Literature data confirm time to pain reduction of about 8-10 days&#xD;
      after EBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balloon kyphoplasty is another valuable treatment option for patients with painful and&#xD;
      instable metastases to the vertebral column. In the recent published trial by Berenson et al.&#xD;
      134 patients with vertebral compression fractures were enrolled and randomly assigned to&#xD;
      kyphoplasty or non-surgical management. The study found that patients treated with&#xD;
      kyphoplasty had a significant reduction of back pain after seven days. Nevertheless&#xD;
      kyphoplasty has no direct anticancer effect and external beam radiotherapy has to follow to&#xD;
      avoid early regrowth. But EBRT after kyphoplasty or EBRT alone takes up to 2-4 weeks. This&#xD;
      long treatment period can often be a mental and physical strain. Moreover patients with&#xD;
      simultaneous visceral metastases often need chemotherapy which cannot be applied concurrently&#xD;
      to radiotherapy due to the risk of potentiated toxicity. To reduce treatment time and&#xD;
      increase quality of life novel techniques like kyphoplasty combined with other physical&#xD;
      methods are under development. Recently published trials showed good results relating to pain&#xD;
      relief and local tumor control in patients with spinal metastases treated with kyphoplasty&#xD;
      combined with intravertebral administration of 153Samarium or interstitial implantation of&#xD;
      125I seeds. Therefore we developed a novel approach to deliver intraoperative radiotherapy&#xD;
      during kyphoplasty (Kypho-IORT). Based on our recently published reports Kypho-IORT is a&#xD;
      technical feasible new treatment option without severe side effects. We observed an excellent&#xD;
      pain relief. At the first postoperative day improvement of pain was observed in 11 of 16&#xD;
      (69%) patients and no change in 5 of 16 (31%) patients. During further follow-up, improvement&#xD;
      of pain was seen in 75% - 83% of the patients compared to the preoperative status. According&#xD;
      to these results a dose escalation study has been initiated, which has been completed (NCT&#xD;
      01280032). According to the results of this study a dose of 8 Gy in 10 mm depth from the&#xD;
      applicator surface (correlates to a dose prescription from the isocenter of the radiation&#xD;
      source of 8 Gy in 13 mm) is recommended for further Kypho-IORTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to this the aim of this planned phase III study is to test the superiority of&#xD;
      kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty + IORT (in the following abbreviated as Kypho-IORT) compared to&#xD;
      EBRT with regard to time to pain reduction at defined points in time (day 1, week 2, 6 weeks&#xD;
      after start of treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We assume a pain reduction of VAS-3 points at day one (first day after Kypho-IORT, one day&#xD;
      after the first EBRT) for 40% of the patients after Kypho-IORT vs. 5% of the patients after&#xD;
      EBRT under standard pain medication (no change of the pretherapeutic pain medication 12 h&#xD;
      after Kypho-IORT or rather 24 h after the first EBRT). Each study arm needs 22 patients, to&#xD;
      reach an alpha of 0, 05 and a power of 0,817. Plus a dropout rate of 20% at least 54 patients&#xD;
      have to be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with spinal metastases who present for treatment will be given, if these have&#xD;
      not been done in advance: a MRI and a CT of the total spine and a clinical examination,&#xD;
      especially a neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kypho-IORT will be carried out under general anaesthesia like the standard procedure with&#xD;
      minor modifications. All patients will be placed in prone position on a radiolucent table.&#xD;
      For intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) the Intrabeam System (Carl Zeiss Surgical, Oberkochen,&#xD;
      Germany) will be used. In order to carry out the intraoperative radiation therapy, working&#xD;
      cannulas are inserted into the affected vertebral body in a normal bipedicular procedure,&#xD;
      special sleeves are inserted monopedicularly. These serve as guides for the radiation&#xD;
      applicator. After checking the correct positioning of the working cannulas using fluoroscopic&#xD;
      guidance, the specially designed applicator is placed precisely in the vertebral body.&#xD;
      Documentation of the location of the tip of the INTRABEAM System should be performed whenever&#xD;
      possible using bi-planar X-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After verification the selected dose of 8 Gy in a depth of 13 mm from the isocenter of the&#xD;
      radiation source is applied for a period of approximately 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the radiation therapy, the radiation unit including the applicator is&#xD;
      removed and the operation is concluded in accordance with standard procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The external beam radiotherapy will be usually carried out as an outpatient procedure. All&#xD;
      patients will receive a planning CT before the first irradiation. EBRT will be performed with&#xD;
      30 Gy, added in 3 Gy per fraction or 8 Gy single dose (only for international study centers,&#xD;
      not permitted in Germany) on a conventional linear accelerator (LINAC). During EBRT, patients&#xD;
      are routinely seen once weekly by physicians and evaluated for adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment the registration form has to be filled out including the following items:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of inclusion and exclusion criteria,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anamnesis (size, weight, Karnofsky Index, standard pain medication, concomitant&#xD;
           illnesses),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  objectification of the patient's current pain situation using the Visual Analog Scale&#xD;
           (VAS) local and in general,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  primary tumor,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  localization and size of the vertebral body metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quality of life assessment (EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-BM22). Moreover all patients&#xD;
           receive an MRI and a CT of the spine and a neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will be scheduled after 6 weeks, then after 3 months, then every 6 months up&#xD;
      to 5 years. At each follow-up the following information will be documented:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  weight,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Karnofsky Index,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  general progress/regress of underlying illness,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  standard pain medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pain level based on the VAS (in general, local).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, an inspection of the surgical scar to exclude wound healing problems and a&#xD;
      neurological examination to document any functional impairment due to spinal cord or nerve&#xD;
      damage will be carried out. To assess skin toxicity, photographic documentation of the&#xD;
      surgical scar/irradiation field will be carried out. For documentation of osteoradionecrosis,&#xD;
      pathological fractures and relapses a MRI or CT examinations will be carried out. The&#xD;
      evaluation of the MRI or CT examinations will be performed by the radiologists of the&#xD;
      respective participating clinic, or in the case of externally prepared images, by the&#xD;
      radiologists of the medical practice. To document Quality of Life, the patients will be&#xD;
      requested to complete two questionnaires of the European Organization for Research and&#xD;
      Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-BM22) before Kypho-IORT/EBRT and during the&#xD;
      follow-up examinations. Answering the questions will take approximately 10 minutes. The&#xD;
      follow-up and documentation of patient specific data will end 5 years after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classification and graduating of side effects are rated by &quot;Common Toxicity Criteria&quot;&#xD;
      (CTCv4.0) of the National Cancer Institute. To document acute toxicities after Kypho-IORT, a&#xD;
      physical examination including in particular an inspection of the surgical scar and an&#xD;
      evaluation of the current pain level (VAS) will be performed one day and 2 weeks after&#xD;
      Kypho-IORT. Moreover a conventional X-ray of the affected section of the spine will be&#xD;
      performed one day after Kypho-IORT. One day after the first EBRT and after the last EBRT,&#xD;
      same-day, a physical examination and an evaluation of the current pain level (VAS) will be&#xD;
      performed to document acute toxicities. Moreover during EBRT, patients are routinely seen&#xD;
      once weekly by physicians and evaluated for adverse reactions. If necessary, any occurring&#xD;
      acute reactions will be documented upon discharge from the hospital and checked at the&#xD;
      follow-up appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acquisition of late toxicities will be done based on the LENT SOMA score. To document the&#xD;
      late toxicities, follow-up examinations with magnetic resonance imaging or computer&#xD;
      tomography, as well as another physical examination will be performed. Moreover a&#xD;
      photographic documentation of the surgical scar/irradiation field will be carried out to&#xD;
      assess skin toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse events (SAEs) are defined as any event that is fatal, life threatening,&#xD;
      causes or prolongs hospitalization; causes disability or incapacity or requires medical&#xD;
      intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage, or any grade 4 toxicity. Only&#xD;
      radiation or surgery related SAEs should be reported. Hospitalization for performing&#xD;
      protocol-required procedures is not classified as an SAE. Hospitalization for disease-related&#xD;
      procedures (surgery, imaging, laboratory tests) or any procedures planned before entry into&#xD;
      the study are not considered SAEs. Hospitalizations for social reasons in the absence of an&#xD;
      adverse event are not classified as SAEs either. Furthermore radiation or surgery related&#xD;
      SAEs requiring therapy should be documented (e.g. antibiotics, re-surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of death an autopsy should be done to clarify the cause of death. The trial will be&#xD;
      carried out in compliance with the protocol, the principles laid down in the declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki, version as of October 1996 (as long as local laws do not require to follow other&#xD;
      versions), in accordance with the ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice (GCP), the harmonized standards for Medical Devices (ISO 14155) and all other&#xD;
      applicable regulatory requirements (local, regional and global). Standard medical care&#xD;
      (prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures) remains in the responsibility of the&#xD;
      treating physician of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is approved by the local ethics committee and the Federal Office of Radiation&#xD;
      Protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The informed consent is performed written and verbally by the responsible physician. The&#xD;
      informed consent is done at least 24 h before treatment. During the education the physician&#xD;
      has to indicate that a withdrawal is possible at each time and does not result in&#xD;
      disadvantages for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of the patient must be discontinued if one or more of the following criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  revocation of the patient's declaration of informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lack of compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  discontinuation of the therapy for other reasons deemed necessary by the responsible&#xD;
           physician (unfavorable intraoperative geometry)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade IV skin toxicity, i.e. skin necroses that require surgical intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade IV bone toxicity, i.e. aseptic bone necroses that require surgical intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade IV nervous system toxicity, i.e. paresis When therapy is discontinued, the reasons&#xD;
           for discontinuing patient participation in the study must be listed in the patient's&#xD;
           file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The steering committee is allowed to close the study ahead of schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other termination criteria include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  insufficient patient recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  unexpectedly severe toxicities (second Grade IV toxicity within the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  unexpected findings which prevent the continuation of the study for ethical and/or&#xD;
           medical reasons (new benefit/risk analysis)&#xD;
