      The investigators will collect a range of physiological, behavioural and environmental data&#xD;
      using current mHealth and home-monitoring systems, environmental databases and patient&#xD;
      characteristics, to determine to what extent asthma control and the occurrence of asthma&#xD;
      exacerbations can be predicted.&#xD;

      This observational study occurs alongside participants' normal asthma care. Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to attend their normal GP and hospital appointments, and to continue to take their&#xD;
      medication as determined by their usual healthcare team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to their normal care, participants will attend an induction visit and complete a&#xD;
      12-month home-monitoring period with 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1: one-month period of daily monitoring of asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2: eleven-month period of weekly monitoring of asthma. Patients will be invited&#xD;
           for a further 2-week period of daily monitoring between 2-9 months of Phase 2. The&#xD;
           purpose of the second phase of daily monitoring is to assess the influence of&#xD;
           seasonality (different seasons) on the patient's asthma.&#xD;

&#xD;
      A variety of measurements will be made at an induction visit and over the 12-month&#xD;
      home-monitoring period, as detailed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics - Age (yr), gender, nationality, ethnicity, body mass (kg), height (cm), body&#xD;

&#xD;
      (If a patient's atopic status is unknown, a standard skin-prick test or blood test will be&#xD;
      conducted).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The diagnosis of asthma will be verified via a previous test result, using one of the&#xD;
           following; a bronchodilator reversibility test, one-week peak flow monitoring or a&#xD;
           bronchial challenge test. (If a patient's asthma diagnosis has not been verified from&#xD;
           one of the tests listed above, they may be performed at screening visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung function (spirometry) will be conducted according to ERS guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Airways inflammation will be determined by the level of Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide&#xD;

    <description>Severe asthma exacerbations are events that require urgent action on the part of the patient and physician to prevent a serious outcome, such as hospitalization or death from asthma. The occurrence of severe asthma exacerbations is an important marker of poor asthma control. Severe asthma exacerbations are defined by the occurrence of at least one of the following:&#xD;
Use of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection), or an increase from a stable maintenance dose, for at least 3 days. For consistency, courses of corticosteroids separated by 1 week or more should be treated as separate severe exacerbations.&#xD;
A hospitalisation or ER visit because of asthma, requiring systemic corticosteroids.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Moderate asthma exacerbations</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year &amp; preliminary analysis after 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>A moderate asthma exacerbation is an event that, when recognized, should result in a temporary change in treatment, in an effort to prevent the exacerbation from becoming severe. Moderate asthma exacerbations are defined by occurrence of at least one or more of the following:&#xD;
deterioration in symptoms,&#xD;
deterioration in lung function,&#xD;
and increased rescue bronchodilator use. These features should last for 2 days or more, but not be severe enough to warrant systemic corticosteroid use and/or hospitalization. ER visits for asthma (e.g., for routine sick care), not requiring systemic corticosteroids, are also classified as moderate exacerbations</description>
