  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With aging population, total knee arthroplasty is performed with increasing frequency.&#xD;
      Although the surgery is successful in general, significant number of patients suffers&#xD;
      persistent pain and disability. Traditional risk assessment tool have been focused on single&#xD;
      organ systems. Our investigators have found that mobility, assessed by the Mobility&#xD;
      Assessment Tool short form (MAT-sf), is a simple and accurate method to predict postoperative&#xD;
      outcome, including length of stay, postoperative complications, and nursing home placement&#xD;
      for older patients. Prehabilitation is the process of enhancing a person's functional&#xD;
      capacity to withstand an incoming stressor. Although multiple studies have tested&#xD;
      prehabilitation before joint replacement surgery, results have been mixed. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that patients with limited mobility are most likely to benefit from&#xD;
      prehabilitation. The investigators plan to use individualized aquatic exercise as a&#xD;
      prehabilitation tool to enhance compliance; the resistance of water strengthen muscle and&#xD;
      increasing energy expenditure; the buoyancy of water provides environment where the joints&#xD;
      are not weight bearing. The aims of the study are: 1) To evaluate the feasibility of&#xD;
      prehabilitation using 6-8 weeks of aquatic exercise in 40 geriatric patients who are&#xD;
      scheduled for total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis; 2) To examine the effects of 6-8&#xD;
      weeks of aquatic exercise on mobility, pain, stiffness, physical function, cognitive function&#xD;
      and depression; inflammatory markers and 3) To estimate the effect of prehabilitation on&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes. The investigators plan to enroll 40 patients age &gt;50, who are&#xD;
      scheduled for elective primary total knee replacement. Investigators will screen patients in&#xD;
      the Preoperative Assessment Clinic and enroll patients who have decreased mobility, measured&#xD;
      by MAT-sf. Patients will be randomized into either a prehabilitation group or a usual care&#xD;
      group. All the participants will undergo extensive assessment on their pain, stiffness, and&#xD;
      physical function, depression, balance and cognitive function using the Western Ontario and&#xD;
      McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), the expanded Short Physical Performance&#xD;
      Battery (eSPPB), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Serum inflammatory markers will be&#xD;
      assessed at the baseline. The prehabilitation group will undergo 6-8 weeks of individualized&#xD;
      aquatic exercise in a heated pool (60 min/session, 3 times per week). Aquatic equipment maybe&#xD;
      used to challenge balance and trunk stabilization. All participants will be reassessed&#xD;
      immediately before surgery and 4 weeks after the surgery using WOMAC, eSPPB, MoCA and MAT-sf.&#xD;
      Serum inflammatory markers and body composition will be reassessed at the same time points.&#xD;
      The primary outcome of interest is will be postoperative complications, length of stay,&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit length of stay, and institutionalization. If successful, investigators&#xD;
      will have sound pilot data for several critical health outcomes with which to support an&#xD;
      external proposal for a larger-scale study.&#xD;
