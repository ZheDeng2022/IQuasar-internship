  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many women with breast cancer now live for decades after their breast cancer treatment. In&#xD;
      view of this, modern breast reconstruction surgery after mastectomy for breast cancer aims to&#xD;
      reproduce as natural a breast shape as possible. Keeping a natural breast appearance has been&#xD;
      shown to be very important to a woman's emotional and psychological recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer treatment often includes a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy,&#xD;
      anticancer tablets such as Tamoxifen, and newer targeted drugs such as Herceptin.&#xD;
      Radiotherapy is usually given after surgery. However, radiotherapy after mastectomy and&#xD;
      breast reconstruction can damage the 'new' breast giving a less good breast shape and&#xD;
      appearance in the longer term. Also, if recovery is slow following surgery, the radiotherapy&#xD;
      is delayed which may reduce its effectiveness. Changing the order of treatments has been&#xD;
      shown to be safe and effective for chemotherapy, Herceptin and anticancer tablets but we have&#xD;
      very little information on giving radiotherapy before breast cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to find out if giving radiotherapy before mastectomy and&#xD;
      reconstruction alters surgical complication rates and they want to evaluate the appearance of&#xD;
      the reconstructed breast when radiotherapy is given before surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer outcomes are equivalent regardless of the order of systemic treatments and surgery&#xD;
      with a trend towards improved overall survival in women age &lt;50 years receiving chemotherapy&#xD;
      before surgery. Adjuvant post-mastectomy chest wall RT has been shown to have both a local&#xD;
      and survival benefit particularly in high risk patients. Accordingly, patients with T3/T4&#xD;
      breast cancer and/or with a significant burden of axillary disease commonly now receive a&#xD;
      treatment sequence comprising primary chemotherapy followed by mastectomy and immediate&#xD;
      autologous reconstruction, increasingly using abdominal fat (DIEP reconstruction), and&#xD;
      finally adjuvant radiotherapy to the affected chest wall +/- supraclavicular fossa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are precedents for the use of upfront (neoadjuvant) radiotherapy (NART) followed by&#xD;
      complex cancer surgery. For example, in rectal cancer, there is substantial evidence for the&#xD;
      use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by aggressive surgical excision as&#xD;
      the standard of care in patients with a threatened or involved circumferential margin.&#xD;
      Short-course preoperative radiotherapy has been tested in multiple trials in rectal cancer,&#xD;
      including the Swedish Rectal Cancer Trial, Dutch Colorectal Cancer Group Study and more&#xD;
      recently the Medical Research Council CR07 trial. All three studies demonstrated better local&#xD;
      control and improved disease-free and overall survival. Flap reconstruction of the perineum&#xD;
      at the time of abdomino-perineal resection is well described as a method to reduce perineal&#xD;
      morbidity and is indicated when primary closure cannot be achieved after wide local&#xD;
      resection. By transferring a bulk of vascularized soft tissue into the irradiated pelvis,&#xD;
      flap reconstruction has been shown to reduce infection rates, fill pelvic dead space, prevent&#xD;
      wound dehiscence, and reduce time to healing. 'Short course' pre-operative rectal&#xD;
      radiotherapy: surgery is generally undertaken 7-10 days after completion of radiotherapy with&#xD;
      an acceptable impact on post-operative complication rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is one published series of NART in breast cancer reporting an acceptable post-operative&#xD;
      complication rate. Following on from this, surgeons and clinical oncologists from Imperial&#xD;
      College and the Royal Marsden have begun to develop a limited experience of mastectomy and&#xD;
      DIEP reconstruction 14 days following completion of radiotherapy (10 cases, no significant&#xD;
      post-operative complications). This non-randomised phase II study sets out to formally&#xD;
      evaluate the safety of reversing the order of mastectomy plus immediate DIEP flap&#xD;
      reconstruction and adjuvant radiotherapy, with a view to a subsequent randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial testing local control and cosmetic outcomes.&#xD;
