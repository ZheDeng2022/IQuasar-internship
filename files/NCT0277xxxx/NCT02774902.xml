      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of multiple oral doses of clarithromycin&#xD;
      on the pharmacokinetics of TAK-438 and its metabolites in healthy male adult participants&#xD;
      following a single oral dose of TAK-438.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-438. TAK 438 is being tested to assess the&#xD;
      effect of multiple oral doses of clarithromycin on the pharmacokinetics of TAK-438.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 16 healthy adult male participants of non-Japanese&#xD;
      origin. Participants will be assigned:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-438 40 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clarithromycin 500 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to take 2 tablet of TAK-438 20 mg orally, once on Days 1 and 8&#xD;
      along with Clarithromycin 500 mg, tablets, orally twice daily from Days 3 to 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single center trial will be conducted in Europe. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is maximum of 44 days. Participants will be confined to site for 10 days, and a final&#xD;
      visit after 4 days after discharge from the unit for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;
