    <textblock>
      When elderly patients need help caring for wounds, physicians may refer patients to home&#xD;
      health care providers. The home health provider sees the patient in the patient's home and&#xD;
      assists the patient with wound care. Working with the patient's physician, the home health&#xD;
      provider will use the appropriate wound covering (&quot;dressing&quot; or &quot;bandage&quot;) to cover the&#xD;
      wound. The goal of the home health provider is to ensure that the wound stays clean and&#xD;
      progresses toward closure. The home health provider will conduct in-home patient visits at&#xD;
      appropriate intervals to assess the status of the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extensive resources are required to see patients in their own homes. If a dressing could&#xD;
      effectively manage wounds and allow longer time between in-home visits (without affecting&#xD;
      patient safety or progress of the wound toward closure), then resources could be saved. Thus,&#xD;
      newer dressings are designed for longer wear times, using advanced foam pads and adhesives&#xD;
      that help keep the dressing in place. The hypothesis of this study is that the use of Allevyn&#xD;
      Life will decrease the number of in-home visits by home health providers without sacrificing&#xD;
      patient safety.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The informed consent document must be read, signed, and dated by the subject or the&#xD;
        subject's legally authorized representative before conducting any study procedures or&#xD;
        exams. 2. Subjects sixty-five (65) years of age or older. Subjects may be of either sex and&#xD;
        of any race.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Willing and able to allow home health clinician to conduct all required study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The subject (or caregiver) must be able to follow instructions, including the ability to&#xD;
        have regular contact with the home health clinician between study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Are covered by traditional Medicare. 6. Have a wound that is suitable for treatment with&#xD;
        a foam dressing and can be appropriately covered by a single piece of ALLEVYN Life or the&#xD;
        comparator dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. At Screening, wound exudate must be moderate to heavy, as determined by the home health&#xD;
        clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Target wound may be a trauma wound, chronic wound, or post-surgical wound. 9. Wound care&#xD;
        is the primary reason for the home health clinician visits and determines the frequency of&#xD;
        home health visits. Subjects may have other comorbidities, but these cannot be the&#xD;
        determining factor in scheduling the frequency of the home health visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Contraindications or hypersensitivity to the use of the study dressings or their&#xD;
             components (e.g., adhesive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any wound that requires an additional covering (e.g., compression dressing, cast,&#xD;
             etc.) over the study dressing that prevents daily visualization of the dressing under&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Target wound that requires daily dressing changes due to topical wound treatment&#xD;
             (e.g., daily applications of ointments, creams, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Target wound and dressing that cannot be visualized by the subject or subject's&#xD;
             caregiver.&#xD;
