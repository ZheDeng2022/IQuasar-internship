  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Texas Christian University (TCU) Disease Risk Reduction (DRR2) Project is&#xD;
      to develop and test a self-administered tablet computer app, StaySafe, for probationers under&#xD;
      community supervision that is designed to improve decision-making skills around health risk&#xD;
      behaviors, especially involving HIV and hepatitis B &amp; C risks. StaySafe utilizes materials&#xD;
      and concepts adapted from an earlier, group-based curriculum, WaySafe, designed to increase&#xD;
      positive decision-making skills for offenders in the last phase of their prison-based&#xD;
      substance abuse treatment before transitioning back to the community.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of the TCU DRR2 project is to adapt ideas and concepts from an in-prison,&#xD;
      group-based curriculum designed to improved decision-making skills around health risk&#xD;
      behaviors for incarcerated offenders in the last phase of substance abuse treatment for a&#xD;
      self-administered computer app that targets probationers under community supervision.&#xD;
      Programming for HIV in probation settings is limited and this project aims to address needs&#xD;
      with an easy to use computer app that is designed to improve decision-making about health&#xD;
      risks among probationers in the community. The computer app utilizes an evidence-based schema&#xD;
      called WORKIT and is based on a dual processing model of judgment and decision-making that&#xD;
      includes vicarious and virtual learning approaches and repetition in order to learn and&#xD;
      practice the schema and move it from slower analytical processing to faster experiential&#xD;
      processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      StaySafe includes 12 brief sessions, each of which takes about 10 minutes to complete. Nine&#xD;
      of the sessions utilize the WORKIT model and three session use a participant choice activity&#xD;
      in which probationers can choose from among several informational activities designed to&#xD;
      reinforce lessons learned and provide some variation to completing WORKIT sessions. The first&#xD;
      session includes an introduction to using the app on the tablet and guides the participant&#xD;
      through a WORKIT session. In each subsequent WORKIT session, the participant chooses a&#xD;
      relevant problem to work on during that session from a list of problems. A brief video is&#xD;
      then shown in which two people are having a conversation around the problem and make a&#xD;
      decision. The participant rates the decision before working through the WORKIT process around&#xD;
      the chosen problem. This involves determining what the problem is, who is affected by the&#xD;
      problem and who can help with the problem, then identifying options to address the problem,&#xD;
      rating the options, knowing what option to choose, imagining the steps to carry out the&#xD;
      option, and then testing the results. Sessions are typically scheduled about every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are recruited by research staff for the study from probation offices where&#xD;
      substance abuse groups are conducted. All assessment and StaySafe sessions are administered&#xD;
      by research staff at the probation facility when probationers otherwise report for meetings&#xD;
      or groups. Compensation for time involved in the study is provided in terms of payments&#xD;
      toward probation fees. After an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved consent procedure,&#xD;
      participants are scheduled for a baseline survey that takes about 30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
      After the baseline survey is completed, participants are randomly assigned to either the&#xD;
      StaySafe condition or a comparison condition. Participants in the StaySafe condition are then&#xD;
      scheduled for their first StaySafe session typically within a week and are asked to complete&#xD;
      twelve sessions within the next 6 months, followed by 6-month and 12-month follow-up surveys.&#xD;
      Participants randomly assigned to a comparison condition are informed that they will be&#xD;
      contacted in about 6 months to schedule a 6-month survey and again for a 12-month survey.&#xD;
