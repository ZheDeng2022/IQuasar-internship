  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Countries throughout the world are facing a growing non-communicable disease (NCD) burden. In&#xD;
      developing countries, medicines to treat NCDs are often difficult to access or too expensive&#xD;
      for many households. Novartis/Sandoz has recently launched Novartis Access, an initiative to&#xD;
      subsidize a basket of NCD medicines sold to purchasers in program countries and delivered&#xD;
      through the public and non-profit health sectors. This study will evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      Novartis Access on the availability and price of NCD medicines at health facilities and&#xD;
      households in Kenya, the first country to receive the program.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants, interventions, and outcomes: Eight counties have been non-randomly selected for&#xD;
      inclusion in the study. Initially, Novartis Access medicines will be sold solely to the&#xD;
      Mission for Essential Drugs and Supplies (MEDS), the main supplier for the large network of&#xD;
      private (often faith-based) non-profit health facilities in the country, and also a key&#xD;
      supplier for public facilities in several counties. Of the 47 total counties in Kenya, 17&#xD;
      counties were excluded because they do not purchase medicines from MEDS, and an additional 15&#xD;
      counties were excluded that had not purchased at least 10 million KES worth of medicines&#xD;
      through MEDS in the previous year. Three counties were excluded due to security concerns, and&#xD;
      four additional counties were excluded to eliminate shared borders in the final sample, to&#xD;
      minimize the risk of contamination between intervention and control counties. When&#xD;
      considering counties with shared borders, those with the lower volume of MEDS purchases in&#xD;
      the previous year were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Kenya, NCD services are provided in the public and private non-profit sectors at level 2&#xD;
      dispensaries up through level 6 hospitals. Not all counties have a level 6 hospital, and for&#xD;
      this reason they are excluded from the study. Counties have on average: five public and&#xD;
      private non-profit level 5 county referral hospitals; three public level 4 sub-county&#xD;
      hospitals; 15 public and private non-profit level 3 health centers; and 85 public and private&#xD;
      non-profit level 2 dispensaries. All 184 eligible level 3-5 facilities will be included in&#xD;
      the study, and 200 level 2 dispensaries will be randomly selected for inclusion. For each&#xD;
      facility included in the study, one private drug seller identified as the main alternative&#xD;
      for that facility will be identified and included. Private drug sellers include pharmacies,&#xD;
      drug stores, and dispensing doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total sample of 800 households will be randomly selected from the eight study counties (400&#xD;
      from Novartis Access counties; 400 from control counties) using a two-stage sampling&#xD;
      procedure. In the first stage, 10 enumeration areas (EAs) will be selected in each county&#xD;
      with probability proportional to size based on data from the most recent census. Then, in the&#xD;
      second stage, 10 eligible households will be randomly selected in each EA and recruited into&#xD;
      the study. All households in the EA will be listed in a random order, and enumerators will&#xD;
      proceed down the list until 10 eligible households are identified. Households will be&#xD;
      eligible if at least one member at least 18 years old has been previously diagnosed and&#xD;
      prescribed medicine for NCDs addressed by Novartis Access, including diabetes, hypertension,&#xD;
      breast cancer, and asthma. All members of the household who fit that criterion will be&#xD;
      recruited for the study. Based on the prevalence of the relevant NCD conditions in Kenya, 20%&#xD;
      of all households will meet the inclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In intervention counties, public and private non-profit health facilities will be allowed to&#xD;
      purchase subsidized Novartis Access NCD medicines through MEDS. The Novartis Access portfolio&#xD;
      includes 15 medicines to treat diabetes, hypertension, breast cancer, and asthma. While the&#xD;
      portfolio includes patented medicines usually marketed and sold under the Novartis brand and&#xD;
      generics under the Sandoz brand, all medicines sold through the initiative will be packaged&#xD;
      with the new Novartis Access brand. The medicines will be sold directly to MEDS at an average&#xD;
      cost of 150 Kenyan Shillings (KES), around US$1.50, per monthly dose. Facility-level&#xD;
      administrative data on NCD medicine purchases obtained from MEDS will be used to monitor the&#xD;
      implementation of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes of interest are medicine availability and price at health facilities,&#xD;
      and medicine availability, price, and expenditures at patients' households. Availability at&#xD;
      facilities is defined as the proportion of Novartis Access medicines and equivalents in stock&#xD;
      on the day of data collection. Availability at households is defined as the proportion of&#xD;
      prescribed Novartis Access medicines and equivalents in the home on the day of data&#xD;
      collection. The price of NCD medicines sold by private for-profit drug sellers is an&#xD;
      important secondary outcome. Patient perceptions of NCD medicine access will also be&#xD;
      explored. Data will be collected at facilities and households using a structured&#xD;
      questionnaire at baseline prior to the implementation of Novartis Access, at midline after&#xD;
      one year, and at end line after two years. At each of these interviews, a subsample of&#xD;
      facilities and households will also be administered a qualitative interview. Additional data&#xD;
      will be collected quarterly from facilities and a randomly selected subsample of households&#xD;
      using a structured questionnaire administered over the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is powered to detect a 10 percentage point increase in household availability of&#xD;
      medicines due to Novartis Access at Î± = 0.05, assuming an intracluster correlation&#xD;
      coefficient of 0.05, 10% loss to follow-up, and a proportion available in the control group&#xD;
      of 33%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment of the intervention: In Kenya, county health offices are responsible for bulk&#xD;
      purchasing of medicines for their health facilities, allowing for random allocation of&#xD;
      Novartis Access at the county-level. The eight counties selected for inclusion in the trial&#xD;
      will be randomized to the intervention or control group using a covariate constrained&#xD;
      randomization method to maximize balance on nine demographic and health variables: total&#xD;
      population; population density; proportion of the population in urban areas; poverty rate;&#xD;
      number of health facilities; physicians per capita; health spending per capita; overall value&#xD;
      ordered through MEDS in previous year; and proportion of value ordered through MEDS in&#xD;
      previous year by private non-profit versus public health facilities. Allocation will be&#xD;
      masked from data collectors. However, it will not be possible to mask the intervention from&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection, management, and analysis: Data will be collected from health facilities and&#xD;
      households at baseline, midline, and end line using a structured questionnaire. The health&#xD;
      facility questionnaire has been adapted from an instrument developed by the World Health&#xD;
      Organization and Health Action International and previously used in Kenya, and captures&#xD;
      information on medicine availability and medicine price. The household questionnaire includes&#xD;
      information on demographics, household assets, and key information on medicines, including&#xD;
      whether prescribed NCD medicines are currently at the home, locations where medicines are&#xD;
      most often purchased, prices paid, and overall household expenditures on medicines (and on&#xD;
      other goods).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subsample of health facilities and subsample of households will also be administered a&#xD;
      qualitative interview during baseline, midline, and end line visits. A purposeful subsample&#xD;
      of five level 2 dispensaries and five level 3-5 facilities will be selected in each county&#xD;
      (80 facilities in total), and one staff member will be randomly selected for the interview. A&#xD;
      purposeful subsample of 10 households in each county (80 households in total) will be&#xD;
      selected for qualitative interviews, which will be administered to one individual in the&#xD;
      household who also completes the general household survey. Facilities and households will be&#xD;
      selected for qualitative interviews to maximize variation in the viewpoints represented. The&#xD;
      qualitative instrument has been designed to explore in depth key issues related to medicine&#xD;
      access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance data will be collected quarterly from all health facilities and a subsample of&#xD;
      households. For health facility surveillance, a shortened version of the structured&#xD;
      questionnaire with basic information on medicine availability and price will be administered&#xD;
      over the phone each month to a rotating one-third sample of health facilities, such that all&#xD;
      facilities are surveilled once per quarter. For household surveillance, a random sample of&#xD;
      half of all study households will be selected; half of study households will not be&#xD;
      surveilled at all, to allow for an analysis of the potential effect of surveillance on&#xD;
      household behavior. Those households selected for surveillance will be administered a&#xD;
      shortened version of the structured questionnaire with basic information on medicine&#xD;
      availability and price over the phone. As with health facilities, a rotating one-third sample&#xD;
      of households selected for surveillance will be surveyed by phone each month, such that all&#xD;
      surveilled households are surveyed once per quarter. A 5% subsample of surveilled health&#xD;
      facilities and households will be visited in person to audit phone responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) will be a partner on the study and will manage research&#xD;
      fieldwork. IPA specializes in the design and implementation of randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      to test policy interventions in developing country settings, and has partnered on several&#xD;
      rigorous evaluations in Kenya in recent years. Data will be collected electronically using&#xD;
      SurveyCTO software on tablets and managed using Microsoft Access software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on baseline characteristics of health facilities and households will be compared across&#xD;
      groups to assess balance. Impacts of Novartis Access will be estimated using intention to&#xD;
      treat analysis. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) methods will be used to control for potential&#xD;
      baseline differences between groups. All analyses will be conducted using Stata statistical&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
