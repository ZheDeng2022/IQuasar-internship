    <textblock>
      In summary, there is a high medical need for patients suffering from recurrent/progressive&#xD;
      PCNSL. Targeting the PD-1 pathway may represent a very promising novel approach for the&#xD;
      treatment of these patients.&#xD;

      The objective of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the Overall Response Rate (CR/PR) in patients treated with pembrolizumab for&#xD;
           relapsed PCNSL after MTX-based first-line therapy&#xD;
&#xD;

           pembrolizumab for relapsed PCNSL after MTX-based first-line therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe individual duration of response over time&#xD;
&#xD;

             other corticosteroids or control of brain edema, which has been stable or decreased&#xD;
             for at least 1 week prior to inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;

             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course&#xD;

             might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation&#xD;
             for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to&#xD;
             participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
