      This study is a pilot, safety, and pharmacokinetic study of MB-102 versus iohexol and the use&#xD;
      of the non-invasive optical renal function monitor (ORFM) device in normal and compromised&#xD;
      renal function participants with different skin color types.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and&#xD;
      multiple doses of MB-102 in participants with normal and impaired kidney function; to&#xD;
      determine plasma pharmacokinetics of MB-102 compared to the pharmacokinetics of iohexol in&#xD;
      participants with normal and impaired kidney function; to demonstrate that&#xD;
      MB-102-transdermal-fluorescence-measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the optical&#xD;
      renal function monitor (ORFM) Brilliance device is aligned with MB-102 plasma GFR; to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the ORFM investigational medical device prototypes&#xD;
      QuantumLeap, Radiance, and Brilliance for the non-invasive transdermal fluorescent detection&#xD;
      of MB-102 in participants with a range of skin color types; and to determine the optimal dose&#xD;
      of MB-102 for non-invasive measurement.&#xD;
