      Justification Smoking is a major factor for mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. The&#xD;
      electronic cigarette, sometimes presented as smoking cessation &quot;classic&quot; is expanding but its&#xD;
      safety has not been established to date. The smoke from the electronic cigarette is mainly&#xD;
      composed of propylene glycol, some adverse effects were observed in animals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Type interventional study assessing the effect of the electronic cigarette Inclusion&#xD;

      I. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the acute cardiovascular effects of electronic&#xD;
      cigarette in young patients by non-invasive methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. State of the question and justification for the research&#xD;
&#xD;
      State of the question&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary artery disease is the death rate cause, responsible for around 7 million deaths each&#xD;
      year, or 12.8% of causes of death. Myocardial infarction has an incidence of 66/100 000&#xD;
      inhabitants per year. It is now undoubtedly recognized that smoking is a major independent&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factor and tobacco is responsible for over 5 million deaths per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhaled tobacco is harmful because it contains several components: nicotine, tar derivatives,&#xD;
      derived free radicals nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. The acute effects of smoking on the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system are complex. The effects on the coronary circulation are characterized&#xD;
      by decreased blood flow intracoronary, particularly in patients with underlying coronary&#xD;
      artery disease, exacerbating myocardial ischemia. There is also a detrimental effect on&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic function of the left ventricle, from the first flashes. Tobacco alters&#xD;
      peripheral resistance and promotes the secretion of adrenergic catecholamines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking cessation is naturally a public health priority but remains difficult because of the&#xD;
      addictive nature of nicotine. Thus several substitutes for the cessation assistance were&#xD;
      developed, among them the electronic cigarette is a recent option, more and more fashionable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of the electronic cigarette is not established yet. There are only rare small&#xD;
      number of studies comparing mostly acute cardiovascular effects of electronic cigarette to&#xD;
      those of the conventional cigarette without analyzing all the potential consequences of the&#xD;
      electronic cigarette.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The smoke from the electronic cigarette is mainly composed of propylene glycol, also with&#xD;
      nicotine in varying concentrations. Propylene glycol is used as a filling liquid of&#xD;
      electronic cigarettes and is usually considered harmless if inhaled, despite having been&#xD;
      cause asystole, shock and decreased renal and pulmonary arterial flow after intravenous&#xD;
      injection in calves. It is also used by the food industry as an emulsifier or as a solvent&#xD;
      for certain liquid aromas. Its cardiovascular effects are clearly not been studied in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interest of our study was to evaluate the acute cardiovascular effects of electronic&#xD;
      cigarette, with simple, non-invasive means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. population concerned&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defined in th eligibility section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Study Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment is expected from H1 2015. Patients will be recruited during the Heart Rhythm&#xD;
      consultation for a cardiovascular evaluation. We plan to include a minimum of 20 subjects.&#xD;
      After this first phase of recruitment, data analysis will be conducted to determine if there&#xD;
      instead of increasing the number of subjects to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cardiovascular evaluation will be conducted at baseline, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A compendium of history, a general physical examination (weight, height) and&#xD;
           cardiovascular with measurement of oxygen saturation, an assessment of past and current&#xD;
           smoking (with documentation of the concentration of nicotine in the electronic cigarette&#xD;
           and the product brand used)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. measurement of blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. An electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A Holter-ECG 10 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A transthoracic echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
           The ECG will analyze heart rate, time of conduction and repolarization (QT interval in&#xD;
           particular).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Holter ECG will study the heart rate variability in a short time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Echocardiography (15) will assess o cardiac output: measurement of sub aortic Integral&#xD;
           time speed ITS o diastolic function of the left ventricle: measurement of peak E wave&#xD;
           'and the wave in tissue Doppler to the mitral annulus; mitral profile measurement with&#xD;
           the peak of the E wave, the deceleration time, the peak of the A wave and the E / A&#xD;
           ratio; measuring the peaks of the S wave and D, pulmonary S / D ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
           o end-systolic and end-diastolic volume of the left ventricle with assessment of&#xD;
           systolic left ventricular function (LVEF)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  systolic function of the right ventricle: the measurement wave S tricuspid annulus&#xD;
                and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) section 4 cavities,&#xD;
                measuring SPSP&#xD;
&#xD;
           A recent study showed that a significant level of nicotine in the blood was reached&#xD;
           after 10 puffs right from the 10th minute after the first puff. This rate is then&#xD;
           growing for one hour, when the inhalation continues. For practical reasons, we will ask&#xD;
           the subjects to smoke for 15 minutes at their usual pace.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cardiac evaluations described above will be repeated. The duration of this review is&#xD;
           about two hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To minimize bias, ECG, Holter-ECG and echocardiography will be stored anonymously and&#xD;
           interpreted retrospectively by a physician blinded to the patient's identity and time of&#xD;
           completion (before or after inhalation) for each examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           V. Data Privacy&#xD;
&#xD;
           Written information will be given about. Her signed consent will be collected and&#xD;
           stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For each subject an identifier will be given for exams before inhalation and another&#xD;
           identifier will be given for the examinations after inhalation. These identifiers will&#xD;
           be graded on a handwritten sheet without data entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The anonymous data will then be entered on a computer file which will be sent to the&#xD;
           statistician in charge of the analysis. There will be no exchange of personal data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           VI. Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quantitative variables are expressed by their mean, standard deviations, their minimum&#xD;
           and maximum values as appropriate. The variables will be expressed in numbers and&#xD;
           percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The purpose of statistical analysis will determine if there is a significant difference&#xD;
           of the variables collected from pre and post-inhalation inhalation of cigarette smoke&#xD;
           electronic period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           VII. Vigilance&#xD;
&#xD;
           at. definitions&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. adverse Event&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a person who is ready to biomedical research&#xD;
      that this event is related or not to research or (x) product (s) on the (s) is (s) door this&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serious event is an event:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The evolution of which is fatal; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which endangers the life of the person undergoing research; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which causes a disability or a significant or lasting disability; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Causing hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which results in an abnormality or birth defect; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any other event does not meet the qualifications listed above, but can be regarded as&#xD;
           &quot;potentially serious&quot; including some laboratory abnormalities; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medically relevant event in the judgment of the investigator; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Events requiring medical intervention to prevent progression to one of the&#xD;
           aforementioned states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term &quot;life-threatening&quot; is reserved for immediate life-threatening at the time of the&#xD;
      adverse event, regardless of the consequences of corrective or palliative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain circumstances requiring hospitalization are not within the gravity standard&#xD;
      &quot;inpatient / hospitalization extension&quot; as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      admission for social or administrative reasons; hospitalization predefined by the protocol;&#xD;
      hospitalization for medical or surgical treatment scheduled prior research; passing day&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. detection methods and collection of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events should be investigated, reported and recorded, processed and evaluated the&#xD;
      first visit (inclusion D0) until the end of the study until their resolution. Adverse events&#xD;
      are collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In clinical, biological and other planned and systematic examination by the&#xD;
           investigator;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By spontaneous reporting by the participants, who will be instructed to contact the&#xD;
           investigating doctor in case of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events will be recorded on forms on adverse events of case report form (see&#xD;
      Appendix 2). Each observed adverse events will be recorded individually. The intensity of&#xD;
      adverse events will be determined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild (grade 1): no interference on the daily activity of the patient;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate (grade 2): Moderate interference on the patient's daily activities but still&#xD;
           acceptable;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe (grade 3) significant interference on the patient's daily activity and&#xD;
           unacceptable;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Threat of life-threatening (grade 4);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death (Grade 5). All adverse events must be graded. Responsibilities of the&#xD;
           investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Declaration of SAEs&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator evaluates each adverse event in relation to its severity. The investigator&#xD;
      must notify by fax (01 44 12 31 40) to the sponsor (CRC GHPSJ) without delay after the day he&#xD;
      heard, all serious adverse events in the trial, except from those identified in the protocol&#xD;
      as not requiring immediate reporting. This initial notification is the subject of a written&#xD;
      report must be followed if necessary by one or the report (s) Additional (s) writing (s) Main&#xD;
      (s) within 8 days of the first declaration (Declaration Form in Annex 3 of the Protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator must document the best event (thanks to copies of laboratory results or&#xD;
      reports of examinations or hospitalization accounts informing the serious event, including&#xD;
      relevant negative results, not forgetting to make these documents and anonymous to register&#xD;
      number and the patient's code), medical diagnosis and a causal link between serious adverse&#xD;
      events and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statement is sent to the developer with the serious adverse event reporting form signed&#xD;
      and dated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator should follow the patient with an SAE to its resolution, stabilization at a&#xD;
      level deemed acceptable by the investigator or return to the previous state, even if the&#xD;
      patient is out of the test and inform the promoter (CRC GHPSJ) by fax on 01 44 31 December 40&#xD;
      with the form (check: monitoring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Assessment of causality&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator should assess causality of adverse events with research. The causal link is&#xD;
      binary (connected / not connected).&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Reporting period and followed the terms of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator should report serious adverse events from the inclusion of the patient until&#xD;
      the end of the experimental procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator should monitor adverse events until resolution or stabilization even if the&#xD;
      patient is out of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. Special cases&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4.1 Serious Events not immediately declare To the extent it is expected no serious adverse&#xD;
      event related to the participation of patients in this study and that only certain serious&#xD;
      adverse events known to be associated with the patient's usual care may arise, these will&#xD;
      therefore not require immediate declaration in accordance with the health authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Responsibilities promoter&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Promoter will declare to ANSM (French Health Authorities) and the CPP (patients&#xD;
      protection committee) in accordance with the law of 9 August 2004:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • all unexpected serious adverse reactions without delay and at the latest within seven&#xD;
      calendar days from the day when the sponsor becomes aware of, and within 7 days for&#xD;
      monitoring,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  developments without delay safety and at the latest within 7 calendar days, and within 7&#xD;
           days for monitoring,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  annual safety reports within 60 calendar days of the anniversary date of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           d. Establishment of an independent oversight committee&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the extent it is expected no serious adverse event related to the participation of&#xD;
      patients in this study, we do not want to establish an independent monitoring committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Funding&#xD;
&#xD;
      No external funding GHPSJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. Conflicts of interest&#xD;
&#xD;
      No conflict of interest&#xD;
