      The main aim of this study is to determine the trans-laminal cribrosa pressure difference&#xD;
      (TLCPD) for normal tension glaucoma (NTG) patients from the brain and the eye in supine,&#xD;
      upright and minor head down tilt positions. It is also to investigate the venous drainage&#xD;
      system in the same body positions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trans-lamina cribrosa pressure difference (TLCPD), i.e. the difference between the&#xD;
      intraocular pressure (IOP) and the intracranial pressure (ICP) has been suggested as a&#xD;
      pathophysiological component in glaucoma. The theory is that high TLCPD, either due to&#xD;
      elevated IOP or reduced ICP, can cause glaucomatous damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal tension glaucoma (NTG) patients has been found to have a slightly reduced ICP when&#xD;
      measured in horizontal position. However, in a previous study in healthy adult volunteers the&#xD;
      investigators have measured TLCPD at supine, sitting and 9 degree head down tilt positions&#xD;
      and found that the TLCPD was posture dependent, with the largest difference in the upright&#xD;
      position. Since humans are upright approximately two thirds of the day, one can expect that&#xD;
      TLCPD in a diurnal perspective is primarily influenced by the ICP in the upright position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the TLCPD in different positions in patients with NTG will therefore be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in three parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. TLCPD will be investigated by simultaneous measurements of IOP and ICP. For IOP the&#xD;
           Applanation resonance tonometer (ART), developed by our research group, will be used.&#xD;
           ART is independent of gravitation and possible to use in all body postures. In this&#xD;
           study measurements will be performed in supine, sitting and head down tilt positions.&#xD;
           ICP is measured continuously during the period of body position changes with a CELDA&#xD;
           lumbar pressure measurement apparatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Brain and eye MRI investigation will be performed at a 3 Tesla GE scanner with a new&#xD;
           generation 32-channels head coil. The images will be used to measure the cross-section&#xD;
           area, the blood flow velocity and the flow direction in the jugular veins, as well as&#xD;
           the structural properties of the optic nerve and optic nerve head.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ultrasound imaging, using a high-resolution apparatus, will be performed to study the&#xD;
           effects of postural changes on the blood flow velocity and the cross-section area of the&#xD;
           right and left internal jugular veins and external jugular veins.&#xD;
