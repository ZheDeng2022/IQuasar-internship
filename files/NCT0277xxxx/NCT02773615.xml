      Background In the differential diagnosis of unstable angina versus non-anginal chest pain, an&#xD;
      exercise test is often the modality of choice for further investigation. However, in a&#xD;
      substantial number of patients exercise testing is less informative, because of insufficient&#xD;
      exercise capacity or pre-existing ECG-abnormalities. In patients with low pretest probability&#xD;
      of coronary artery disease (CAD), Coronary CT angiography (CTA) has an excellent negative&#xD;
      predictive value, but in patients with an intermediate or high pretest probability of CAD&#xD;
      estimation of the hemodynamic significance of a stenosis has only limited specificity. CT&#xD;
      perfusion (CTP) is a new method looking at myocardial perfusion during vasodilative stress&#xD;
      with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of&#xD;
      respectively 81%, 93%, 87% and 88%, whereas radiation is limited to a maximum of 5&#xD;
      millisievert (mSv).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim It is the aim of this pilot study to investigate whether the addition of CTP to CTA is a&#xD;
      feasible and safe investigational workflow in patients with unstable angina or nonanginal&#xD;
      chest pain in the emergency department.&#xD;

      It is the aim of this pilot study to investigate whether the addition of CTP to CTA is a&#xD;
      feasible and safe investigational workflow in patients with unstable angina or nonanginal&#xD;
      chest pain in the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Patients presenting in the emergency department with thoracic pain or other symptoms&#xD;
      suggestive of angina, will be eligible for the study if there are no ECG-signs of acute&#xD;
      ischemia (no STEMI or NSTEMI) and if 2 serial high sensitivity Troponin T measurements with&#xD;
      an interval of 1 hour are not conclusive for the diagnosis of ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are a history of a STEMI or a NSTEMI with residual functional&#xD;
      abnormalities, atrial fibrillation, renal insufficiency with glomerular filtration rate (GFR)&#xD;
      &lt; 60 ml/min or known contrast allergy. A number of 100 patients in one year is targeted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pretest-probability score is calculated based on age, gender and type of angina of the&#xD;
      patient. Typical angina is defined as substernal chest pain or discomfort provoked by&#xD;
      exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitrates within minutes, atypical angina&#xD;
      meets 2 of the 3 characteristics and nonanginal pain meets one or none of the&#xD;
      characteristics. The time point of admission in the emergency department is recorded.(cf.&#xD;
      Figure 1) Patients will undergo a CT (Siemens Somatom Force) with calcium-scoring and CT&#xD;
      angiography (CTA). The amount of contrast used is about 60 ml, and the radiation varies&#xD;
      between 0.5 and 1.5 mSv. If the CTA is completely normal and Ca-scoring is low (&lt; 100), no&#xD;
      further investigations are performed and the diagnosis of nonanginal pain is probable.&#xD;
      Patients are dismissed from the emergency ward with follow-up organized for one year. Cf.&#xD;
      Figure 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are abnormalities on CTA, or if there is a elevated Ca-scoring (&gt; 300), even in the&#xD;
      absence of stenosis on CTA, a CT perfusion sequence is added during dipyridamole stress. The&#xD;
      amount of contrast used for CTP is about 50 ml and the radiation used for CTP varies between&#xD;
      3 to 4 mSv, resulting in a total radiation dose of less than 5 mSv. Dipyridamole is&#xD;
      administered in a dose of 140 µg/kg body weight/minute during 6 minutes through a peripheral&#xD;
      vein. CTP is performed 2 minutes after completion of the dipyridamole infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If CTP is suggestive of cardiac ischemia, defined as a visual perfusion defect, an invasive&#xD;
      coronary angiography, with fractional flow measurement if needed, will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If CTP is negative, defined as no visual perfusion defect, no further investigations are&#xD;
      performed and the diagnosis of nonanginal pain is probable. Patients are dismissed from the&#xD;
      emergency ward with follow-up for one year. Cf. Figure 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At dismissal, patients are asked to fill in an angina-questionnaire (short form Seattle&#xD;
      Angina Questionnaire, SAQ) , a quality of life (SF-12 Health Survey) , and a satisfaction&#xD;
      questionnaire about the hospital stay and investigational flow). The time point of dismissal&#xD;
      is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After dismissal, patients are contacted after 3 months to ask for hospitalizations or&#xD;
      investigations that might have occurred in the mean time, and to fill in the same SAQ and&#xD;
      SF-12. At 12 months after the initial presentation, patients are invited to a cardiac&#xD;
      consultation and questionnaires are completed for the last time.&#xD;
