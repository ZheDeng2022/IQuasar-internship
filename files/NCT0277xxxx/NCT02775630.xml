  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchoscopy is an examination performed routinely in pulmonology. This exam is considered as&#xD;
      uncomfortable by nearly 60% of patients, especially due to respiratory blocking sensation,&#xD;
      cough and nausea it causes, despite the use of a local anesthetic. Conversely, this&#xD;
      examination is rarely performed under general anesthesia in hospitals in France, because it&#xD;
      lengthens the duration of the procedure, increases its cost and can be dangerous for the&#xD;
      respiratory failure patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypnosis is an altered state of consciousness between wakefulness and sleep, which can cause&#xD;
      the patient to ignore the reality in which he is focusing his attention on his imagination,&#xD;
      reducing his anxiety, his painful or unpleasant perceptions and their memorization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypnosis benefit has already been evaluated in the control of pain and anxiety in many&#xD;
      medical situations, surgical, obstetric and dental. In endoscopy, the results are mixed. In&#xD;
      bronchoscopy, hypnosis has, to our knowledge, not been evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a preliminary study in the endoscopy unit of the Hospital Saint Joseph, involving 66&#xD;
      patients, investigators showed that bronchoscopy was poorly tolerated in more than half of&#xD;
      patients and that this poor tolerance was correlated to the level anxiety of patients, but&#xD;
      75% of patients surveyed would prefer the waning redo the examination in the same conditions&#xD;
      if their health required it, rather than using a general anesthetic. Investigators then&#xD;
      hypothesized that hypnosis would improve tolerance bronchoscopy under local anesthesia,&#xD;
      without the need for general anesthesia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the safety of bronchoscopy performed under local anesthesia and hypnosis to that&#xD;
      performed under local anesthesia alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-assessment of pain, difficulty breathing, coughing and sensation of nausea&#xD;
           experienced by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Straight-tolerance assessment of the review by the endoscopist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the quality of implementation of the review by the endoscopist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the amount of local anesthetic used during the examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure the length of the review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the eligibility criteria are present, it will be proposed to the patient to participate in&#xD;
      a study to assess the tolerance of Examination under hypnosis. A fact sheet will be handed to&#xD;
      him explaining the purpose of the study and the place of examination. If he agrees to&#xD;
      participate, consent will be obtained in writing and will be randomized into one of two&#xD;
      groups. He will fill a questionnaire clinical information and Anxiety Questionnaire HAD&#xD;
      (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). The examination is then conducted in endoscopy room.&#xD;
      In the hypnosis group, the patient will benefit from an induction technique of hypnosis by a&#xD;
      doctor trained in hypnosis and local anesthesia performed by the endoscopist. In the control&#xD;
      group, only local anesthesia is practiced by the endoscopist. The waning, it will ask the&#xD;
      patient and endoscopist to complete an evaluation of the tolerance of the examination&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects required: 126&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of poor tolerance of the examination in this population was 52% (numeric scale&#xD;
      of the overall tolerance&gt; 3) and the expected objective in the intervention group under&#xD;
      hypnosis is a halving of the number of patients with EN &gt; 3 to the overall safety, the number&#xD;
      of subjects to be included is 63 per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time study: baseline in January 2015 for an expected period of eight months depending on the&#xD;
      pace of inclusion estimated to average 4 per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization in the 2 groups will be made by day of the week carries the hypnotherapist&#xD;
      (Monday or Tuesday with a random alternation between these 2 days). The list of days will be&#xD;
      balanced by randomly alternating blocks. The team of bronchoscopy and prescribers of the&#xD;
      bronchoscopy will not be informed of the first schedule to avoid selection bias of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acquisition of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender, age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  respiratory history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bronchial endoscopy antecedent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission Status (external or hospitalized)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analgesic and anxiolytic Processing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anxiety Questionnaire HAD (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-medication received&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vital parameters before and after the examination: heart rate, oxygen saturation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Way passage of the endoscope (nose or mouth)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of endoscopy (between the input and the output of the endoscopy suite)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantity Xylocaine used during the exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sampled&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Score cough, pain and overall tolerance of the digital scale review (self-evaluation by&#xD;
           the patient)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptance or not the patient to repeat the examination under the same conditions if his&#xD;
           health required in the future&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Straight-evaluation by the physician endoscopist of the overall tolerance of the review&#xD;
           by the patient (digital scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Easy to complete the review by the endoscopist (digital scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Summary of potential adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find and test differences, univariate analyzes will use the test t-Student for continuous&#xD;
      variables and the chi of 2 for categorical variables or their nonparametric equivalents. The&#xD;
      significance level was set at p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serious event is an event:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The evolution of which is fatal; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which endangers the life of the person undergoing research; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which causes a disability or a significant or lasting disability; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Causing hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which results in an abnormality or birth defect; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any other event does not meet the qualifications listed above, but can be regarded as&#xD;
           &quot;potentially serious&quot; including some laboratory abnormalities; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medically relevant event in the judgment of the investigator; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Events requiring medical intervention to prevent progression to one of the&#xD;
           aforementioned states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term &quot;life-threatening&quot; is reserved for immediate life-threatening at the time of the&#xD;
      adverse event, regardless of the consequences of corrective or palliative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain circumstances requiring hospitalization are not within the gravity standard&#xD;
      &quot;inpatient / hospitalization extension&quot; as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      admission for social or administrative reasons; hospitalization predefined by the protocol;&#xD;
      hospitalization for medical or surgical treatment scheduled prior research; passing day&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. detection methods and collection of adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events should be investigated, reported and recorded, processed and evaluated the&#xD;
      first visit (inclusion Day 0) until the end of the study until their resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events are collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In clinical, biological and other planned and systematic examination by the&#xD;
           investigator;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By spontaneous reporting by the participants, who will be instructed to contact the&#xD;
           investigating doctor in case of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events will be recorded on forms on adverse events of case report form (see&#xD;
      Appendix 6). Each observed adverse events will be recorded individually. The intensity of&#xD;
      adverse events will be determined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild (grade 1): no interference on the patient's daily activities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate (grade 2): Moderate interference on the patient's daily activities but still&#xD;
           acceptable;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe (grade 3) significant interference on the patient's daily activity and&#xD;
           unacceptable;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Threat of life-threatening (grade 4);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death (Grade 5). All adverse events must be graded. Responsibilities of the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Statement of SAEs&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator evaluates each adverse event in relation to its severity. The investigator&#xD;
      must notify by fax (01 44 12 32 52) to the sponsor (CRC GHPSJ) without delay after the day he&#xD;
      heard, all serious adverse events in the trial, except from those identified in the protocol&#xD;
      as not requiring immediate reporting. This initial notification is the subject of a written&#xD;
      report must be followed if necessary by one or the report (s) Additional (s) writing (s) Main&#xD;
      (s) within 8 days of the first declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator must document the best event (thanks to copies of laboratory results or&#xD;
      reports of examinations or hospitalization accounts informing the serious event, including&#xD;
      relevant negative results, not forgetting to make these documents and anonymous to register&#xD;
      number and the patient's code), medical diagnosis and a causal link between serious adverse&#xD;
      events and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statement is sent to the developer with the serious adverse event reporting form signed&#xD;
      and dated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator should follow the patient with an SAE to its resolution, stabilization at a&#xD;
      level deemed acceptable by the investigator or return to the previous state, even if the&#xD;
      patient is out of the test and inform the promoter (CRC GHPSJ) fax: 01 44 12 32 52 using the&#xD;
      form (check: monitoring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Assessment of causality&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator should assess causality of adverse events with research. The causal link is&#xD;
      binary (connected / not connected).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Reporting period and followed the terms of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator should report serious adverse events from the inclusion of the patient until&#xD;
      the end of the experimental procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator should monitor adverse events until resolution or stabilization even if the&#xD;
      patient is out of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Special Cases&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4.1 Serious Events not immediately declare&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the extent it is expected no serious adverse event related to the participation of&#xD;
      patients in this study and that only certain serious adverse events known to be associated&#xD;
      with bronchoscopy (hemoptysis, asthma, respiratory distress, allergic xylocaine etc.) may&#xD;
      occur, they do not require immediate notification in accordance with the health authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Responsibilities of the promoter&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Promoter will declare to ANSM and the CPP in accordance with the law of 9 August 2004:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  all unexpected serious adverse reactions without delay and at the latest within seven&#xD;
           calendar days from the day when the sponsor becomes aware of, and within 7 days for&#xD;
           monitoring,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  developments without delay safety and at the latest within 7 calendar days, and within 7&#xD;
           days for monitoring,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  annual safety reports within 60 calendar days of the anniversary date of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4. Appointment of an independent monitoring committee&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the extent it is expected no serious adverse event related to the participation of&#xD;
      patients in this study, Investigators do not want to establish an independent monitoring&#xD;
      committee.&#xD;
