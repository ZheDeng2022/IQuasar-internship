  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory failure is frequent during rhythmology procedure under light sedation in&#xD;
      high risks selected patients. Non invasive ventilation (NIV) is recommended for acute&#xD;
      cardiogenic pulmonary oedema and sleep apnea. The investigators will perform a monocentric,&#xD;
      prospective, randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of NIV which associated&#xD;
      pressure support ventilation (PSV: 5 to 15 cmH2O) and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP:&#xD;
      5 to 10 cmH2O) with standard oxygen therapy in prevention of peroperative respiratory event.&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that peroperative use of NIV should reduce the incidence of apnea and&#xD;
      hypoxia during procedure in rhythmology under light sedation.&#xD;

      This study is an investigator-initiated, monocentric, two-arm parallel-group trial with&#xD;
      electronic system based randomization. The study protocol was approved by a Central Ethics&#xD;
      Committee (France) according to French law. Our teaching hospital have a long experience with&#xD;
      peroperative use of NIV during light sedation and acute respiratory failure. This study is&#xD;
      designed as a PROBE study (Prospective Randomized Open with Blinded Evaluation) : the&#xD;
      investigators will provide a blinded analysis of peroperative computer collected data.&#xD;
