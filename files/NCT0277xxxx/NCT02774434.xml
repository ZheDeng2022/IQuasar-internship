  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Canadian Pediatric Society recently published guidelines to monitor bilirubin levels and&#xD;
      as part of standard of care all hospitalized newborns are routinely monitored for the&#xD;
      development of high bilirubin or jaundice every 8-12 hours. One device approved and used in&#xD;
      both Canada and the United States is the Draeger Jaundice Meter JM-103, a non-invasive&#xD;
      medical device. It has been proven to be effective in patients &gt;35 weeks gestational age.&#xD;
      Recently the JM-103 has been upgraded to include a bigger touch screen, greater storage and&#xD;
      functionality. The rest of the features of the JM-103 and JM-105 are identical. In order to&#xD;
      test the accuracy of the JM-105 neonates from ≥ 24 weeks gestational age who have or have not&#xD;
      undergone phototherapy will be prospectively monitored for transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB)&#xD;
      using the JM-105. The measurements will be compared to a physician-ordered total serum&#xD;
      bilirubin (TSB).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperbilirubinemia is a condition that occurs in newborns when there is too much bilirubin in&#xD;
      the blood. It is the most common cause of newborns being readmitted to the hospital. It may&#xD;
      be harmless or harmful depending on what the cause is and how bad it is. The serum level of&#xD;
      bilirubin required for jaundice varies with infants skin tones and body region, however&#xD;
      jaundice usually becomes visible in the white part of the eye at smaller levels. Although&#xD;
      jaundice in newborn is generally not harmful, it is important to monitor newborns to identify&#xD;
      those that are at risk of developing a neurological dysfunction from high bilirubin levels.&#xD;
      As part of standard of care all hospitalized newborns are routinely monitored for the&#xD;
      development of jaundice by nursing staff and physicians every 8-12 hours. Although jaundice&#xD;
      in newborns can usually be detected by lightening/whitening in the skin with digital&#xD;
      pressure, this method of visual estimation is very inaccurate and unreliable. Transcutaneous&#xD;
      bilirubin measurements are non-invasive and has proven to be equivalent to total serum&#xD;
      bilirubin measurements. The JM-103 has been proven to be an effective TcB measure in&#xD;
      ethnically diverse populations for patients &gt;35 weeks gestational age. The JM-105 has been&#xD;
      upgraded from the JM-103 with greater efficiency and accuracy. The basic function is the same&#xD;
      but has been improved with a larger touch screen, data storage and transmission&#xD;
      functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective multi-centre study will be conducted to determine the diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
      and performance of the use of the JM-105 in providing transcutaneous bilirubin measurements&#xD;
      to estimate serum total bilirubin in neonates ≥ 24 weeks of gestational age who have or have&#xD;
      not undergone phototherapy. The study will compare each of the measurements of transcutaneous&#xD;
      bilirubin (TcB) obtained for 10 days via the JM-105 device with a neonatology team-ordered&#xD;
      series of serum total bilirubin (TSB) measured by high-performance liquid chromatography.&#xD;
