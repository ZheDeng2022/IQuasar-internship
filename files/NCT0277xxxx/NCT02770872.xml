      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in developed nations and a major&#xD;
      health issue in Veterans. Despite a number of different treatments, cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      remains a major health burden, thus further treatments are needed. Individuals with obesity&#xD;
      and/or diabetes are at particularly high risk for cardiovascular disease, and research&#xD;
      suggests that elevated levels of serum amyloid A (SAA) may contribute to cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, particularly atherosclerosis. In preliminary studies in both mouse and human the&#xD;
      investigators have identified that SAA appears to shift between lipid particles. SAA is&#xD;
      mainly found on high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles; however, the investigators have&#xD;
      found that in both mice and humans with obesity and/or diabetes SAA is found on low density&#xD;
      lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, and the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the presence of SAA on LDL or VLDL makes these particles more likely to&#xD;
      cause cardiovascular disease. To determine what leads SAA to shift between lipid particles,&#xD;
      SAA knockout mice will be injected with HDL containing SAA then blood collected at several&#xD;
      time points over 24 hours, and the lipid particles will be isolated to measure SAA. In some&#xD;
      experiments the investigators will compare different isoforms of SAA, different types of HDL&#xD;
      particles, or induce expression of enzymes likely involved in shifting SAA between particles.&#xD;
      To determine if the presence of SAA makes lipid particles bind vascular matrix more strongly,&#xD;
      the investigators will collect carotid arteries and compare the extent of lipid particles&#xD;
      bound to the vascular matrix in the vessel wall when the particles have or do not have SAA&#xD;
      present. If this research confirms this hypothesis then the presence of SAA on LDL or VLDL&#xD;
      may 1) be a new marker indicating humans at highest risk for cardiovascular disease and 2) be&#xD;
      a new target of therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

      Clinical burden of CVD: CVD is the leading cause of death in developed nations and the VA&#xD;
      population is no exception. Despite decades of research, technical, and pharmacological&#xD;
      advances, CVD remains a major public health problem. This is partly due to our impaired&#xD;
      ability to identify subjects at greatest risk for CVD events and thus the best candidates for&#xD;
      pharmacological risk reducing therapies, and partly due to incomplete use or efficacy of&#xD;
      currently available therapies. Epidemiological studies have identified major risk factors for&#xD;
      CVD including elevated LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, hypertension, smoking and&#xD;
      diabetes. However, despite targeting individuals with these risk factors with aggressive&#xD;
      pharmacological interventions, CVD remains a major public health problem. Furthermore, even&#xD;
      in individuals with risk factors who are treated with pharmacological or lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions the CVD event rates are higher than in those who never had the risk factors.&#xD;
      Recent epidemiologic data evaluating the American Heart Association-identified cardiovascular&#xD;
      health metrics reported that the prevalence of having CVD risk factors at ideal levels is &lt;&#xD;
      2%10; implying that &gt;98% of the population are candidates for risk reduction. Clearly, health&#xD;
      systems cannot cope with pharmacological interventions for such enormous target populations.&#xD;
      Thus, additional risk stratifying markers are needed to identify those at highest risk for&#xD;
      events and thus at greatest likelihood of benefit. Several biomarkers, including the acute&#xD;
      phase reactants C reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) have been studied for&#xD;
      their role in predicting CVD events. Both CRP and SAA are chronically elevated in individuals&#xD;
      with obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS), diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and other&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory conditions associated with increased CVD rates, raising the question of&#xD;
      whether these biomarkers merely reflect underlying risk or play a causative role in CVD.&#xD;
      Although emerging evidence has cast doubt on the role of CRP as a causative factor the&#xD;
      investigators and others recently demonstrated that SAA is directly atherogenic in animal&#xD;
      models. Thus, in addition to its role as a biomarker for CVD, SAA may play a causal role in&#xD;
      CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAA: SAA is a family of acute phase proteins synthesized primarily in the liver. In healthy&#xD;
      individuals SAA concentrations are &lt; 5 mg/L but during an acute phase response SAA can&#xD;
      increase up to 1000 mg/L for a few days, then it rapidly returns to baseline levels. However,&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory states such as obesity, MetS, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis etc, are&#xD;
      associated with persistently and significantly elevated SAA concentrations of 30-100 mg/L.&#xD;
      Acute elevations in SAA are proposed to play a major role in response to injury and&#xD;
      inflammation, participating in cholesterol delivery to injured tissues, recruitment of&#xD;
      inflammatory cells, and induction of tissue repair cytokines. However, the chronic elevations&#xD;
      of SAA now prevalent in modern society likely reflect a maladaptive response and numerous&#xD;
      studies are now examining potential roles of SAA in disease pathology. Using murine models in&#xD;
      which acute phase SAA is over-expressed, the investigators and others demonstrated direct&#xD;
      increases in atherosclerosis development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAA and apolipoprotein B (apoB) containing lipoproteins: SAA is a lipid binding&#xD;
      apolipoprotein and lipid-free SAA has not been found in vivo. The dogma is that SAA is&#xD;
      exclusively an HDL associated lipoprotein; however, the investigators and others have&#xD;
      reported SAA on apoB-containing lipoproteins in both mice and humans. Several studies have&#xD;
      reported on a complex termed SAA-LDL associated with components of MetS, remnant like&#xD;
      particle cholesterol, smoking status, lifestyle interventions, and statin treatment. These&#xD;
      studies suggest that SAA-LDL is a risk factor for CVD. In new preliminary studies the&#xD;
      investigators demonstrate that SAA has a differential lipoprotein association in diabetes,&#xD;
      and in post-prandial lipoprotein metabolism, and the investigators demonstrate that the&#xD;
      presence of SAA on apoB-lipoproteins augments their proteoglycan binding, a key step in&#xD;
      atherosclerosis development. Thus, emerging evidence suggests that the presence of SAA on&#xD;
      apoB-lipoproteins may be a novel CVD risk factor, play a causal role in atherosclerosis, and&#xD;
      thus be a therapeutic target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-prandial apoB-lipoprotein metabolism: The various lipoproteins are defined based on size&#xD;
      and density criteria, as well as by their protein constituents. However, even within each&#xD;
      lipoprotein class there is considerable heterogeneity, as the particles undergo continuous&#xD;
      remodeling. Briefly, lipids consumed in the diet associate with apoB-48 to form chylomicrons,&#xD;
      which are transported in intestinal lymphatics before entering the bloodstream. Various&#xD;
      enzymes act on newly formed chylomicrons shifting lipids and proteins between chylomicrons&#xD;
      and HDLs before the chylomicron remnants are taken up by the liver. The liver re-packages the&#xD;
      lipids into VLDL particles containing apoB-100. The hydrolysis of VLDL results in smaller&#xD;
      apoB-100 particles called VLDL remnants or intermediate density lipoproteins (IDLs).&#xD;
      Collectively, these particles are termed triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TGRLs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ongoing remodeling of TGRLs by various lipases leads to the formation of LDL. LDL can be&#xD;
      taken up by peripheral tissues, including the vasculature, or by the liver. The&#xD;
      sub-endothelial retention of apoB-containing particles initiates atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-prandial lipoproteins and CVD: Elevated levels of LDL cholesterol and low levels of HDL&#xD;
      cholesterol are documented risk factors for CVD and contribute causally to atherogenesis.&#xD;
      However, individuals with obesity, MetS and diabetes do not typically have elevated LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol; their dyslipidemia is characterized by elevated triglycerides and low HDL&#xD;
      cholesterol. The role of triglycerides as a CVD risk factor remains controversial; however,&#xD;
      post-prandial triglycerides may be a more significant risk factor than fasting triglycerides.&#xD;
      As humans spend most of their lives in the post-prandial state, there is ongoing interest in&#xD;
      the role of post-prandial lipoprotein metabolism in CVD risk. However, most studies have&#xD;
      relied on fasting lipoprotein samples; triglycerides are the lipoprotein component most&#xD;
      affected by food consumption. The mechanisms accounting for the excess prevalence of CVD in&#xD;
      MetS and diabetic subjects beyond that predicted by the traditional CVD risk factors remain&#xD;
      unclear; however, insulin resistant states are characterized by increased intestinal apoB48&#xD;
      production, increased TGRL production and delayed lipoprotein clearance, which may contribute&#xD;
      to CVD prevalence. Retention of apoB- containing lipoproteins in the vascular wall by the&#xD;
      ionic interaction between apoB and proteoglycans, leads to the initiation of atherosclerosis.&#xD;
      Lipolysis of VLDL more than doubles its ability to cross the endothelium and deposit lipids&#xD;
      in the subendothelial space. TGRLs have proportionately more triglyceride than cholesterol:&#xD;
      however, their size means that they can deposit 5-20 times more cholesterol per particle in&#xD;
      the subendothelial space compared to an LDL particle. Increased TGRL production and delayed&#xD;
      particle clearance increases the likelihood of particle retention and cholesterol deposition&#xD;
      in the subendothelial space. The investigators have novel preliminary data demonstrating that&#xD;
      the presence of SAA on apoB-containing lipoproteins increases their proteoglycan binding. The&#xD;
      investigators propose that the increased presence of SAA on apoB-containing post-prandial&#xD;
      lipoproteins in insulin resistant states increases the atherogenicity of these particles and&#xD;
      could be a mechanism accounting for the increased CVD prevalence in insulin resistant states&#xD;
      such as MetS and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HDL metabolism: Like VLDL and LDL, HDL comprises a range of particles; however, HDL does not&#xD;
      contain apoB, instead containing apoA-I. HDL is often separated into two major classes by&#xD;
      size and density: the large HDL2 and the smaller HDL3. As discussed above, HDL undergoes&#xD;
      continuous lipid interchange with various apoB-containing lipoprotein particles. A change in&#xD;
      lipoprotein structure or composition by various enzymes is termed remodeling. HDL is&#xD;
      typically thought to be an atheroprotective lipoprotein due to its ability to transport&#xD;
      cholesterol away from the periphery back to the liver. In addition, HDL has a number of other&#xD;
      beneficial properties including anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative functions. In insulin&#xD;
      resistant states HDL levels tend to be low, and some studies suggest its beneficial&#xD;
      properties are reduced. Remodeling of lipoproteins affects their functionality and half-life;&#xD;
      for example, the remodeling of HDL by CETP (which transfers triglycerides from TGRL to HDL&#xD;
      and cholesterol ester from HDL to TGRL) predisposes HDL to enhanced catabolism and is thought&#xD;
      to contribute to the lower levels of HDL seen in insulin resistant states. Although the&#xD;
      paradigm is that SAA is a HDL associated lipoprotein, in preliminary studies the&#xD;
      investigators have found SAA on apoB particles in insulin resistant persons in the&#xD;
      post-prandial period. However, it is not clear how SAA associates with either HDL or&#xD;
      apoB-lipoprotein particles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAA lipoprotein association: In the setting of an acute phase response SAA levels can&#xD;
      increase up to 1000-fold; however, even at these highly elevated levels SAA remains&#xD;
      exclusively found on HDL particles. Thus, there is no evidence of a &quot;maximum capacity&quot; of HDL&#xD;
      for SAA. How SAA associates with either HDL or apoB-lipoprotein particles is not fully&#xD;
      understood. SAA is thought to be produced by the liver in a lipid-free form and bind&#xD;
      lipoproteins extracellularly, or in plasma SAA has been shown to induce HDL biogenesis via&#xD;
      ATP binding cassette 1 (ABCA1), which may be a major mechanism by which SAA associates with&#xD;
      HDL. Murine studies using knockout mice demonstrated that in the absence of HDL, SAA was&#xD;
      found on apoB-particles. However, the investigators and others have reported SAA on apoB&#xD;
      particles despite the presence of HDL. In new preliminary studies the investigators found&#xD;
      that the remodeling of HDL led to the liberation of both lipid-poor apoA-I and lipid-poor&#xD;
      SAA, and that lipid-poor SAA associates with apoB particles. Thus, the remodeling of HDL,&#xD;
      particularly in the post-prandial period, may lead to SAA shifting from HDL to apoB&#xD;
      particles; alternately, SAA could associate with apoB particles during their hepatic&#xD;
      secretion. Both HDL remodeling and hepatic apoB- particle secretion are increased in insulin&#xD;
      resistant conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of lipoprotein-proteoglycan interactions in atherogenesis: There are several hypotheses&#xD;
      as to what triggers the initiation of atherosclerosis, with the &quot;Response to Retention&quot;&#xD;
      hypothesis well supported by biomedical evidence. As outlined in this theory, early fatty&#xD;
      streak lesions are initiated by deposition of atherogenic lipoproteins (LDLs and TGRLs) in&#xD;
      the subendothelial matrix by their retention by extra cellular matrix proteoglycans. Studies&#xD;
      show that lipoproteins migrate in and out of the subendothelial space, but once bound to&#xD;
      proteoglycans these lipoproteins are retained in this region, become more susceptible to&#xD;
      oxidation and other modifications, and are taken up by macrophages leading to the formation&#xD;
      of foam cells. TGRLs may be even more atherogenic than LDLs as they don't need modification&#xD;
      to be taken up by macrophages, and deliver 5-20 times more cholesterol than LDL on per&#xD;
      particle basis. The investigators have demonstrated the presence of SAA on apoB-containing&#xD;
      lipoprotein particles in mice, and recently confirmed this in humans. In preliminary studies&#xD;
      the investigators demonstrate that the presence of SAA on apoB-lipoproteins enhances their&#xD;
      proteoglycan binding. The investigators propose that the presence of SAA on apoB-containing&#xD;
      lipoproteins enhances their retention increasing atherogenesis.&#xD;
