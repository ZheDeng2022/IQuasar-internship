  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot phase 1b study to investigate the safety and side effects of combining the&#xD;
      ROR1-targeting monoclonal antibody, cirmtuzumab, with paclitaxel for patients with HER2&#xD;
      negative, metastatic breast cancer. Cirmtuzumab is a type of drug called a monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody. This drug is designed to attach to a protein called receptor-tyrosine-kinase like&#xD;
      orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) on the surface of breast cancer cells. Cirmtuzumab blocks the growth&#xD;
      and survival of the breast cancer cells in laboratory tests. ROR1 is rarely expressed on&#xD;
      healthy cells. Cirmtuzumab is considered experimental and is not approved by United States&#xD;
      (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This is a phase 1b, open-label, non-randomized, fixed dose study in patients with HER2&#xD;
           negative metastatic, or locally advanced, unresectable breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cirmtuzumab and paclitaxel will be administered until disease progression or&#xD;
           unacceptable toxicity. Cirmtuzumab or paclitaxel may be continued alone if the other&#xD;
           drug is discontinued due to toxicity, as long as the subject is tolerating the drug and&#xD;
           does not exhibit disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and tissue samples will be collected at pre-specified times to enable&#xD;
           pharmacokinetic and correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events (AE) will be monitored throughout the trial. Reporting of AEs will be in&#xD;
           accordance with CTCAE version 4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of tumor response will be performed by physical examination and/or by&#xD;
           radiographic imaging and according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
           (RECIST) v.1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be assessed at 28 days following the last dose of cirmtuzumab to assess&#xD;
           tumor response and at 56 days following the last dose of cirmtuzumab to assess any&#xD;
           adverse events and to document any concomitant cancer therapy.&#xD;
