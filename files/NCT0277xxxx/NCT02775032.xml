  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      End-of-life care often fails in providing optimal patient-centred care and quality of life.&#xD;
      Patients frequently suffer from inadequate control of pain, from a lack of communication&#xD;
      about their illness and options for treatment, and from poor psychosocial and spiritual&#xD;
      support. Advance care planning (ACP) can tackle these problems by providing patients with an&#xD;
      opportunity to formulate their wishes and plan their future care, should they become&#xD;
      incapable of participating in medical treatment decisions. Previous studies show that ACP&#xD;
      improves concordance between patient's preferences and end-of-life care received and quality&#xD;
      of care at the end-of-life. However, ACP is yet to be embedded in routine clinical practice&#xD;
      and public consciousness. General practitioners (GPs) are in an ideal position to discuss ACP&#xD;
      with their patients. By introducing ACP during a routine office visit, GPs can facilitate a&#xD;
      structured discussion of the patient's wishes for end-of-life care. However, no ACP models&#xD;
      have been systematically developed and tested in general practice. We developed a complex&#xD;
      intervention to improve the initiation of ACP in general practice following the steps of an&#xD;
      international guidance for development and evaluation of complex interventions. Before&#xD;
      performing a full-scale intervention trial to study the effectiveness of this intervention on&#xD;
      quality of care and quality of life, this model needs to be validated and tested in a pilot&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) to conduct the Phase II trial with GPs who will facilitate a structured ACP session with&#xD;
      patients with a serious or life-threatening illness versus usual care and 2) to evaluate and&#xD;
      validate the ACP intervention in terms of feasibility, acceptance to GPs and patients with a&#xD;
      serious or life-threatening illness, and preliminary proof of effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation and preliminary evaluation of this intervention will be done by following&#xD;
      the steps of the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework on complex intervention designs.&#xD;
      This framework proposes a stepwise approach going from phase 0 to phase IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 0-I were previously conducted by the research team and comprised the development of the&#xD;
      intervention. This project proposal comprises phase II (exploratory trial) in which the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be evaluated.&#xD;
