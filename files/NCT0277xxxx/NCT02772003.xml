      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#xD;
      vaccine therapy in treating patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection that persists or&#xD;
      progresses over a long period of time. Vaccines made from DNA may help the body build an&#xD;
      effective immune response to kill cancer cells that express HCV infection.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety profile of the HCV DNA vaccine, consisting of INO-8000 (HCV&#xD;
      antigen DNA) alone or co-administered with INO-9012 (interleukin [IL]-12 adjuvant DNA) (DNA&#xD;
      plasmid encoding interleukin-12 INO-9012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To identify a dose of INO-9012 (IL-12 adjuvant DNA) for co-administration with INO-8000&#xD;
      (HCV antigen DNA) based on induction of HCV-specific interferon (IFN)-gamma production by&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells at 26 weeks compared to baseline in HCV-infected&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the rate at which INO-8000 with different doses of INO-9012 induces a &gt; 1 log&#xD;
      decrease (or undetectable) in HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) level at weeks 14 and 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the rate at which INO-8000 with different doses of INO-9012 induces an&#xD;
      end-of-treatment undetectable HCV RNA (end-of-treatment virologic response - EVR) at 26 weeks&#xD;
      and a sustained virologic response (SVR) at 36 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the rate at which INO-8000 with different doses of INO-9012 induces other&#xD;
      parameters of cluster of differentiation (CD)8 and CD4 T lymphocyte responses as measured by&#xD;
      flow cytometry, and antibody responses to HCV antigen at weeks 14 and 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of INO-9012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive INO-8000 intramuscularly (IM) and DNA plasmid encoding interleukin-12&#xD;
      INO-9012 IM (dose levels 2-4) followed by electroporation (EP) at day 0 and at weeks 4, 12,&#xD;
      and 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 48 and 76.&#xD;

    <measure>Incidence of dose-limiting toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will be defined as an adverse event occurring after the initial vaccine administration, based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. The percentage of participants who experience grade 3 or worse adverse events and administration-site reactions following each dose will be summarized using descriptive statistics across each dose level.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change of interferon-gamma production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in production of interferon-gamma by peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be based on a one-way analysis of variance model using data from all dose levels at the 2-sided 5% level. Mean change (and % change) and the associated 95% confidence intervals in the production of IFN-gamma by peripheral blood mononuclear cells for all evaluable participants enrolled at each dose level will be computed, and compared across the dose levels in an exploratory fashion using graphical approaches, one-way analysis of variance models etc. to ascertain a dose-response curve.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with &gt; 1 log decrease (or undetectable) in hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid level</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The point estimate (and the associated 95% confidence intervals) for primary immune response endpoint will be estimated within each arm and formally compared using a chi-squared test (or Fisher's exact test, if the data warrant). A logistic regression analysis will also be utilized to adjust for potential baseline covariates considered critical for this population.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with end-of-treatment undetectable hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid for the dose levels determined to be safe</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The immune response comparisons will be made using descriptive statistics and graphical methods for both phases of the study. Descriptive statistics and simple scatter plots will be generated to review the continuous immune response data. For continuous immune response values, the actual and % change in the level of each of the biomarkers from baseline to post-baseline time points will be explored within each dose level/arm using Wilcoxon signed rank tests, and paired sample t-tests.</description>
