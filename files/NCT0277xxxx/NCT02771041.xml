  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arthroplastic hip surgery &quot;fast-track&quot; the subject of increasing interest and reduces the&#xD;
      average length of stay and improve patient satisfaction. This fast circuit implemented in&#xD;
      many schools uses dedicated inpatient units, preoperative patient education in&#xD;
      multidisciplinary groups (including physiotherapists, nurses, rehabilitation doctors and&#xD;
      surgeons), an analgesia protocol multimodal and a network dedicated to the outlet (1.2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators working hypothesis is that the mere realization of a preoperative visit a&#xD;
      week before the intervention would reduce the average length of stay for all patients with a&#xD;
      target of two nights (instead of 7.5 days currently) (3) to reduce the use of SSR during&#xD;
      hospitalization. This consultation would serve to explain to the patient the early course of&#xD;
      care, give advice and help to anticipate acts for its release &quot;post-operative&quot; as, for&#xD;
      example, contact a physical therapist and a nurse or check to their community pharmacy if&#xD;
      their heparin stock is enough and to answer any questions (Appendix 2: early information&#xD;
      given to the patient consultation J-8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators protocol is inspired by the one already in place for outpatient PTH and PTH&#xD;
      1 night but invariably apply to all patients for whom a home is considered output.&#xD;

      2. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Objective Influence of preoperative consultation to &quot;D-8&quot; on the average length&#xD;
           of stay of a randomized series multi-operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Evaluation of patient satisfaction and clinical status 2. Evaluation of the analgesic&#xD;
      consumption 3. Evaluation of complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Population concerned&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inclusion Criteria All patients undergoing total hip replacement&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Patient choosing immediately a supported SSR in postoperative 2. Geographical remoteness&#xD;
      3. Social isolation 4. Medical pathology requiring special monitoring (phlebitis history,&#xD;
      coagulation disorders, anticoagulant therapy ...) 5. psychiatric pathology 6. Patients opting&#xD;
      for the protocol &quot;overnight&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Methodology and duration of the research This will be a prospective mono-centric&#xD;
      multi-operator on the assessment of the management of patients in the surgical practice&#xD;
      referred to above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion of patients will take place over a period of 12 months, the goal is to include&#xD;
      90 patients (Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of Sample Size In 2013, for patients operated in a planned way, and with&#xD;
      degenerative osteoarthritis, the length of stay was 7.5 days with a standard deviation of 3&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With such a length of stay, a staff of 2 to 45 subjects will detect a difference in length of&#xD;
      stay of at least 1.8 days (significance level of 5%, 80% power). Such a difference is&#xD;
      reasonably possible with the proposed organizational intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early preoperative consultation will be proposed to the randomized patient. When the patient&#xD;
      is included in the group studied, it will be presented during the preoperative consultation&#xD;
      early an information document with advice and guidance for patients to anticipate acts&#xD;
      provided for its release &quot;post-operative&quot; (cf. . Appendix 2: patient information delivered&#xD;
      early consultation J-8). This consultation will educate patients about what will happen when&#xD;
      they leave, specifying concretely how their articulation with the city and the various&#xD;
      professionals involved will have been planned and respond to all the issues raised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Clinical data will be collected anonymously by an internal orthopedic surgery&#xD;
      service for all patients included in the study by the realization of the Oxford hip score&#xD;
      before the intervention (J-1), an assessment of pain through verbal validated scale (VAS), of&#xD;
      St Joseph satisfaction questionnaire (validated questionnaire Saphora) accompanied by a&#xD;
      verbal scale patient discharge and a telephone call 30 days after surgery to achieve again&#xD;
      the Oxford hip score, evaluation of pain by VAS and patient satisfaction by simple verbal&#xD;
      scale (see Annex 1) (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria for hospital discharge are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinically: clean dressing, no fever, no comorbidity decompensation, EVA &lt;4 with&#xD;
           analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biologically: Hemoglobin&gt; 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functionally: 3 steps climbing ability, ability to walk twenty meters and to go to the&#xD;
           bathroom alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment criteria will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Average length of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criterion of secondary judgments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Score Oxford Hip before and after the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction (verbal scale: 0 to 10) before and after the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  St. Joseph Satisfaction Questionnaire (validated questionnaire Saphora)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of pain by VAS before and after the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Morbidity and mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      randomization: Randomization in the 2 groups (usual care without consultation with J-8 versus&#xD;
      consultation with J-8) will be carried by the patient. The patient list will be balanced by&#xD;
      randomly alternating blocks. orthopedic service personnel will not be notified in advance of&#xD;
      schedule to avoid a bias in the management of patients with the service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing :&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each subject will be awarded an identifier (original name and surname - year of birth)&#xD;
      and the data will be entered on a computer file which will be sent to the statistician in&#xD;
      charge of analyzing the GHPSJ site. There will be no exchange of personal data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find and test differences, univariate analyzes will use the test t-Student for continuous&#xD;
      variables and the chi of 2 for categorical variables or their nonparametric equivalents. The&#xD;
      significance level was set at p &lt;0.05. If imbalance groups, a multivariate model is developed&#xD;
