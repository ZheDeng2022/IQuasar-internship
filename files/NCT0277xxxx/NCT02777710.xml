  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are the most common&#xD;
      gastrointestinal cancers in Western countries and are both associated with significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. An intriguing similarity between CRC and PDAC is the fact that the&#xD;
      newly developed immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially PD1/PDL1 inhibitors, seem to have&#xD;
      limited efficacy as single agents in both of these tumor types. Recent preclinical studies&#xD;
      point towards alternatively activated (M2-type) macrophages as possible culprits in inducing&#xD;
      local immune protection from cytotoxic T cells and resistance to PD1/PD-L1 targeted agents.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that CSF1R blockade will deplete the tumor microenvironment of M2 macrophages,&#xD;
      thus favoring the induction of a cytotoxic anti-tumor T-cell response following PD-L1&#xD;
      blockade with an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody. So we propose to conduct a Phase I dose&#xD;
      escalation study in order to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of a combined&#xD;
      treatment associating an anti-CSF1R (PEXIDARTINIB) with an anti-PD-L1 (DURVALUMAB) in&#xD;
      patients with advanced/metastatic colorectal or pancreatic cancers. Dose escalation part will&#xD;
      determine the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      Pexidartinib given in combination with Durvalumab. Extension part will evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      activity of the combination at the RP2D.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a 2-part Phase I study comprising a dose-finding escalation part (to&#xD;
      determine MTD/RP2D, safety and PK) followed by an extension part at RP2D. In the&#xD;
      dose-escalation part, successive cohorts of 3 patients will receive Pexidartinib (given&#xD;
      orally every day at escalating doses, five dose levels possible, Plexxikon), in combination&#xD;
      with Durvalumab (given IV every 4 weeks at a fixed dose of 1500mg, AstraZeneca). The dose&#xD;
      escalation scheme will be done using a Likelihood Continual Reassessment Method (CRML). After&#xD;
      each new cohort of 3 patients is evaluated, model will be fitted and results will be&#xD;
      discussed in a teleconference between the investigators, the sponsor, representatives of&#xD;
      AstraZeneca and Plexxikon, and the statistician who will decide of the next dose to be&#xD;
      assigned to the next cohort (Dose Escalation Meetings). In both parts, patients will continue&#xD;
      to receive study drugs as long as they experience clinical benefit in the opinion of the&#xD;
      investigator or until unacceptable toxicity including DLTs or symptomatic deterioration&#xD;
      attributed to disease progression as determined by the investigator after an integrated&#xD;
      assessment of radiographic data and clinical status or withdrawal of consent. If a DLT or a&#xD;
      toxicity meeting the DLT definition but occurring outside of the DLT period, resolves to&#xD;
      Grade ≤2 or the patient's baseline level within 14 days after toxicity onset, dosing may be&#xD;
      resumed if agreed by the Sponsor at the same DL. The extension part will comprise two&#xD;
      independent cohorts of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC cohort) or colorectal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma (CRC cohort) and biopsiable disease, and will allow the assessment of&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity based on a Gehan design allowing to quickly identify treatments with low&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
