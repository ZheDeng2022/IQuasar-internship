    <textblock>
      This is a randomized crossover study testing the efficacy of the Fault Detection algorithms&#xD;
      using the Zone MPC algorithm and DiAs artificial pancreas platform in adult patients with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes. The trial will last for 6 weeks for each individual subject, with three&#xD;
      weeks using the AP algorithm and three weeks using sensor augmented pump in a randomized&#xD;
      order&#xD;

      Investigational Device:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Artificial Pancreas System with Fault Detection Algorithms: Roche Accu-Check Spirit Combo&#xD;
      Insulin Pump, Dexcom G4P System with Share, Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) on Android phone, DiAs&#xD;
      Web Monitoring (DWM)&#xD;
&#xD;
      - referred to as Remote Monitoring Server, MPC control algorithm, Health Monitoring System&#xD;
      (HMS) algorithm. Sensor and infusion set fault detection algorithms will be applied offline&#xD;
      with data obtained from server and notifications will be sent to the clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy: Subject will use their personal insulin pump and&#xD;
      Dexcom G4P System with Share.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the efficacy of the fault detection algorithm. The primary outcome is based on&#xD;
      the amount of time the sensor glucose is &gt;250 mg/dL in the 4 hours preceding detection of the&#xD;
      infusion set failure during sensor augmented pump therapy vs. closed-loop control with fault&#xD;
      detection alerts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effectiveness of the sensor fault detection algorithm. To determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of the Zone MPC controller by evaluating glycemic outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 20 subjects recruited: 10 at Stanford and 10 at Denver (up to 36 subjects will&#xD;
      be enrolled to reach 20 subjects completing the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult subjects between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This outpatient study will be conducted over 6 weeks as shown in the figure below. The 6-week&#xD;
      period will consist of two 2-week blocks of prolonged infusion set wear with a 1-week sensor&#xD;
      run-in period preceding each block. In each block, subjects will wear an infusion set for up&#xD;
      to 7 days. A new infusion set will be inserted at the start of each week in the block.&#xD;
      Following enrollment procedures, subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1 to either use&#xD;
      the AP system with fault detection algorithms (intervention) or sensor-augmented pump therapy&#xD;
      (control) in the first block.&#xD;
