  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind placebo controlled one-site proof-of-concept study in&#xD;
      subjects with erosive osteoarthritis (OA) of interphalangeal (IP) finger joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 100 subjects will be enrolled into the study: 48 weeks placebo controlled&#xD;
      double-blind phase with denosumab 60mg every 12 weeks, followed by a 48-week open-label phase&#xD;
      in which all subjects will receive denosumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigational therapy: denosumab 60mg subcutaneous injection every 12 weeks. All subjects&#xD;
      will receive Calcium/vit D supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the effect of denosumab on the reduction of radiographic&#xD;
      erosive progression using GUSS (Ghent University Score System).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess the effect of denosumab on the reduction of radiographic&#xD;
      erosive progression as defined by diminishing the appearance of new erosive IP finger joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory objective is mainly to assess the effect of denosumab on clinical variables,&#xD;
      as well as ultrasonography and DEXA (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) parameters.&#xD;

    <description>A quantitative radiographic scoring system, the Ghent University Scoring System, GUSS, is a reliable method to score radiographic change over time in erosive IP OA and detects more progression over a shorter period of time than scored by indicating the proportions of normal subchondral bone, subchondral plate and joint space over time.</description>
