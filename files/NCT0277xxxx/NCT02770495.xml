  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is assumed that gut inflammation and lesions characterizing flares of Crohn's disease (CD)&#xD;
      result from an aberrant T-cell mediated immune responses characterized by a complex balance&#xD;
      between peripheral and lamina propria regulatory and effector T cell subsets. Because most of&#xD;
      CD patients who undergo a surgery experienced a postoperative endoscopic recurrence of the&#xD;
      disease (70 % at one year) leading to a clinical recurrence (10 % per year), the &quot;model&quot; of&#xD;
      postoperative recurrence in CD represents a privileged situation that mimicks what happens in&#xD;
      the gut of CD patients in clinical remission before the occurrence of further flares. It is&#xD;
      likely that the same factors which underlie the immunopathogenesis of CD at its early stages&#xD;
      also contribute to disease recurrence in the postoperative setting. Indeed, the postoperative&#xD;
      state is performed for intent of disease remission and this situation represents probably an&#xD;
      ideal setting to investigate the dynamics of most of T cell subsets in the peripheral and&#xD;
      mucosal compartments because one may argue that removal of the diseased segment of bowel&#xD;
      resets the disease to its earliest phases, providing an interesting window to better&#xD;
      understand which T cell subsets predispose to disease recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That is the reason why this model will be used in the present project i) to understand better&#xD;
      the immunopathogenesis of CD relapse; ii) to identify novel and promising immune&#xD;
      cell-associated biomarkers capable to predict relapse of the disease and finally iii) to&#xD;
      identify potential specific therapeutic target associated with T cell subsets involved in the&#xD;
      initiation of disease.&#xD;
