      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of laboratory-treated (central memory/naive)&#xD;
      cluster of differentiation 8+ T cells (autologous Wilms tumor [WT]1-T cell receptor [TCRc]4&#xD;
      gene-transduced CD8-positive central memory T-cells [TCM]/naive T cells [TN] lymphocytes) and&#xD;
      how well it works in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that is newly diagnosed or&#xD;
      has come back. Genetically modified therapies, such as autologous WT1-TCRc4 gene-transduced&#xD;
      CD8-positive TCM/TN lymphocytes, are taken from a patient's blood, modified in the laboratory&#xD;
      so they specifically may kill cancer cells with a protein called WT1, and safely given back&#xD;
      to the patient. The &quot;genetically modified&quot; T-cells have genes added in the laboratory to&#xD;
      allow them to recognize leukemia cells that express WT1 and kill them.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety/potential toxicities associated with treating high-risk acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML) patients with autologous CD8+ T cells (polyclonal Tn and Tcm cells;&#xD;
      Epstein-Barr virus-specific T cells [Tebv cells]) that have been genetically-modified to&#xD;
      express a high affinity WT1-specific TCR (TCRC4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the feasibility of reproducibly treating high-risk AML patients with autologous&#xD;
      CD8+ T cells (polyclonal TN and TCM cells; Tebv cells) that have been genetically-modified to&#xD;
      express a high affinity WT1-specific TCR (TCRC4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine and compare the in vivo persistence in blood and at the primary tumor site&#xD;
      (e.g. bone marrow, chloroma) of transferred autologous CD8+ T cells (polyclonal TN and TCM&#xD;
      cells; TEBV cells) that have been genetically-modified to express a high affinity&#xD;
      WT1-specific TCR (TCRC4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine whether adoptively transferred autologous TCRC4-transduced CD8+ cells have&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. In patients with measurable minimal residual disease (MRD) at the time of infusion of&#xD;
      TCRC4-transduced CD8+ cells, changes in leukemic tumor burden will be measured by morphology,&#xD;
      flow cytometry, cytogenetics/fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or molecular&#xD;
      testing at baseline and after infusion of T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ib. In all patients (those with or without measurable tumor burden prior to T cell transfer,&#xD;
      including patients who convert to MRD-negative status during consolidation), the probability&#xD;
      of relapse, disease-free survival and overall survival of patients receiving TCRC4-transduced&#xD;
      CD8+ cells will be compared with patients in the observation arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine and compare the migration to the primary tumor site of subsets of the&#xD;
      adoptively transferred autologous TCRC4-transduced CD8+ T cells (polyclonal TN and TCM cells;&#xD;
      TEBV cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine and compare the in vivo functional capacity of transferred polyclonal&#xD;
      autologous TCRC4-transduced CD8+ TCM, TN cells and TEBV CD8+ cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning 4 weeks after completion of last course of consolidation chemotherapy, patients&#xD;
      receive autologous WT1-TCRc4 gene-transduced CD8+ TCM/TN lymphocytes intravenously (IV) over&#xD;
      1-4 hours on day 0 and again after a minimum of 3 weeks. Beginning 6 hours after the second&#xD;
      infusion of T cells, patients also receive aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID)&#xD;
      for 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who have&#xD;
      clinically benefitted from T cell therapy may receive additional infusions of T cells and&#xD;
      aldesleukin at the discretion of the principal investigator (PI) and the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 4 weeks, at 2, 3, 6,&#xD;
      and 12 months, and then annually for 14 years thereafter.&#xD;

             potential will be defined as being postmenopausal greater than one year or who have&#xD;
             had a bilateral tubal ligation or hysterectomy; all recipients of WT1-specific T cells&#xD;

                  C or less) for 24 hours without a documented infection, T cells may be&#xD;
                  administered&#xD;

               -  ln patients with a documented new infection within 24 hours of planned T cell&#xD;
                  infusion, they may go on to receive T cells after administration of directed&#xD;
                  antibiotic therapy and if they subsequently remain afebrile (38.2 degrees C or&#xD;
                  less) for at least 24 hours, and if it is deemed clinically appropriate by the Pl&#xD;

               -  Pre-existing infections requiring chronic maintenance therapy (e.g. chronic&#xD;
                  hepatitis B virus [HBV] or treated bacterial infections) are not an exclusion for&#xD;
                  T cell infusion as long as patients are on appropriate antimicrobial therapy for&#xD;
                  at least 1 month (e.g. for chronic hepatitis B or C viral infection) and who&#xD;
                  remain afebrile and without symptomatic evidence for uncontrolled chronic&#xD;
                  infection within 24 hours of T cell infusion; patients should also have a&#xD;
