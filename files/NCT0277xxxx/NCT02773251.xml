      Methods This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind, parallel-group study&#xD;
      using HA/CMC (marketed as Guardix-sol®, Hanmi Medicare, Seoul, Korea) in patients who&#xD;
      underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy between November 2011 and June 2014. All the&#xD;
      patients were informed in detail about the aims and the procedures of the study and they&#xD;
      signed a written informed consent prior inclusion into the study. The protocol and the&#xD;
      written informed consent were approved by the local ethical committee (Catholic Medical&#xD;
      Center, Clinical Research Coordinator Center; approval number XC11DIMI10098H).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Men who were 50-75 years old and diagnosed with prostate cancer were eligible if&#xD;
      they were scheduled to undergo laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      included any history of abdominal or pelvic surgery, hypersensitivity or an allergic reaction&#xD;
      to the study material, pelvic lymph node dissection at the same time as prostatectomy, the&#xD;
      presence of surgical site infection or contamination, a history of a medical disease causing&#xD;
      bowel adhesion, or a history of severe drug allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and protocol The laparoscopic radical prostatectomy was performed in same&#xD;
      surgical procedures and steps by two surgeons (USH and JSK) who have experienced over 150&#xD;
      cases of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. The laparoscopic radical prostatectomy was&#xD;
      performed using the five-port fan-shaped transperitoneal approach. After the introducing the&#xD;
      peritoneal cavity, incising the parietal peritoneum between the medial umbilical ligaments&#xD;
      are incised and dissection is carried through the fatty alveolar tissue to develop the space&#xD;
      of Retzius. After that, the surgical steps are following order (1) incision of the endopelvic&#xD;
      fascia; (2) ligation of the dorsal vein complex; (3) division of the bladder neck; (4)&#xD;
      dissection of the seminal vesicles; (5) incision of the Denonvillier fascia and control of&#xD;
      the lateral pedicles with antegrade neurovascular bundle dissection; (8) apical dissection&#xD;
      and division of the dorsal vein and the urethra; (9) urethrovesical anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering about 30% of dropout rate (under the assumption of 40% difference between HA/CMC&#xD;
      treatment group and the control group based on previous similar study, by which the target&#xD;
      enrollment for this trial was 60 subjects (30 subjects per group). The sample size was&#xD;
      determined assuming a level of significance of α=0.05 (two-side) and a 80% statistical power&#xD;
      of test. All patients were randomly assigned to either the HA/CMC treatment group (n=30) or&#xD;
      the control group (n=30) using a computer-generated randomization table. The surgeon was&#xD;
      blinded to treatment assignments before randomization. Patients were also blinded to their&#xD;
      treatment group throughout the study. HA/CMC was applied in all port sites and the peritoneal&#xD;
      incision line of the medial umbilical ligament with a single-use applicator attached to a&#xD;
      sprayer that allowed for the precise application to the required sites. The amount of HA/CMC&#xD;
      applied was 5 ml. Information regarding the duration of illness and medical history were&#xD;
      collected at the time of enrollment (V0). Viscera slide ultrasound and plain X-ray were&#xD;
      recorded at the time of the operation (V0) and 12 (V1) and 24 week (V2) after the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point was the difference in excursion distance on viscera slide ultrasound&#xD;
      between V0 and V2. The secondary end point was excursion distance on viscera slide ultrasound&#xD;
      at V2 and the presence of restriction of viscera slide on ultrasound at V2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of efficacy and safety Twelve and 24 weeks after the operation, bowel adhesion to&#xD;
      the abdominal wall was evaluated by ultrasound and plain X-rays. We performed viscera slide&#xD;
      ultrasound according to a technique that has been previously described. By dividing the&#xD;
      abdomen into 5 segments and examining the viscera slide in each segment, a prediction of the&#xD;
      extent of the adhesions was made for each patient. At the time of the viscera slide&#xD;
      ultrasound, data were also collected on the location of the scars on the abdomen. The main&#xD;
      point of interest was the distance of the longitudinal excursion of the selected area in&#xD;
      relation to the fixed abdominal wall. Normal viscera sliding movement was defined as equal to&#xD;
      or greater than 1 cm of longitudinal movement. Restricted viscera slide was defined as less&#xD;
      than 1 cm of longitudinal movement during both normal and exaggerated respiration. The&#xD;
      ultrasound was performed by two sonographers who had been well instructed for study&#xD;
      assessment. The assessment by ultrasound was double-checked. The sonographer, radiologist and&#xD;
      all accessor was blind to the randomization during the all study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The data for this study are expressed as mean ± standard deviation of&#xD;
      the mean. The comparisons of the 2 groups were made using a chi-test, an independent&#xD;
      Student's t test, or repeated measure ANOVA. P-values &lt;0.05 were considered significant.&#xD;
      Statistical calculations were carried out with IBM SPSS statistics, Version 21 (IBM Corp,&#xD;
      Armonk, NY).&#xD;
