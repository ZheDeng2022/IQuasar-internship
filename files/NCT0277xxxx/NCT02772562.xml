  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how well PROSTVAC -V/F works in stopping prostate cancer&#xD;
      from coming back or relapsing. This study will also look at the safety of PROSTVAC-V/F.&#xD;

      This study is for adult male patients who have recently undergone radical prostatectomy and&#xD;
      are at high risk for relapse. The purpose of this study is to look at the effect PROSTVAC-V/F&#xD;
      has in preventing or prolonging relapse after surgery. PROSTVAC-V/F is an investigational&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
