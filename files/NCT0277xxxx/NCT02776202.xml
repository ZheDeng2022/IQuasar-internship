  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited blood disorder in Saudi Arabia . Its&#xD;
      clinical severity is widely heterogeneous among patients who share the same genetic mutation&#xD;
      . Severe frequent pain crisis, recurrent acute chest syndrome and stroke are features of&#xD;
      severe SCD. Hydroxyurea is an effective treatment of SCD as it ameliorates the severity and&#xD;
      frequency of pain crisis and acute chest syndrome and decreases mortality, however, it is&#xD;
      less effective in the prevention and treatment of stroke and other end organ dysfunctions .&#xD;
      The only readily available cure of SCD is by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) .&#xD;
      Most children with SCD who are treated by HSCT receive myeloablative conditioning with&#xD;
      excellent results. The application of reduced intensity (RIC) and non-myeloablative (NMA)&#xD;
      conditioning regimens are reserved for patients older than 16 years of age because of the&#xD;
      increased risks of morbidity and mortality after HSCT6. However, infertility and gonadal&#xD;
      failure after myeloablative conditioning are important barriers to the willingness of&#xD;
      patients and their families to undergo HSCT . The development of an effective RIC HSCT in SCD&#xD;
      that might spare the fertility of SCD patients would have obvious merit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the ultimate goal of expanding this curative therapy to SCD patients, we propose to&#xD;
      investigate HSCT with a RIC conditioning regimen. We will carry out a pilot study of HSCT&#xD;
      from HLA matched sibling donors using thymoglobulin/fludarabine/melphalan conditioning and&#xD;
      sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as GVHD prophylaxis in SCD patients with severe&#xD;
      complications such as stroke and other severe complications. We hypothesize that HSCT from&#xD;
      HLA matched sibling using thymoglobulin/fludarabine/melphalan conditioning in SCD will&#xD;
      maintain a level of stable donor chimerism that is sufficient to cure SCD with minimal&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;

      Busulfan-based myeloablative allogeneic HSCT from an HLA-matched related donor in children is&#xD;
      associated with high cure rate ranging from 80-90% in different trials, reviewed in 6.&#xD;
      Lessons learned from these trials include; rabbit ATG significantly contributes to a lower&#xD;
      graft rejection rate, the presence of stable mixed chimerism is sufficient to cure SCD, and&#xD;
      the risk of neurological toxicities was minimized by maintaining platelet count greater than&#xD;
      50,000/uL and hemoglobin level between 9-11g/dL, adding phenytoin prophylaxis, and preventing&#xD;
      hypertension and hypomagnesemia . We will not present results of these trials here, as the&#xD;
      focus of this proposal is to investigate the use of NMA/RIC HSCT in SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 RIC/NMA HSCT in SCD:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Van Besien et al 8 reported transplant results in two adults with SCD who underwent&#xD;
           allogeneic transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling donor after conditioning with&#xD;
           fludarabine/melphalan and ATG. One patient was a 40-year-old female who had significant&#xD;
           end-organ dysfunction related to SCD (renal failure treated by dialysis, pulmonary&#xD;
           diffusion capacity was reduced by 25% and ischemic stroke) and was heavily transfused&#xD;
           prior to transplant. She also had RBC alloantibodies and was receiving hydroxyurea and&#xD;
           erythropoietin. She was conditioned with ATG 30 mg/kg for 4 consecutive days (day -5 to&#xD;
           day -2), fludarabine 30 mg/m2 i.v. for 4 consecutive days (day -5 to day -2) and&#xD;
           melphalan 140 mg/m2 i.v. on day -1. The patient had hemodialysis performed on day -5,&#xD;
           day -3 and day -1 after chemotherapy was administered. On day 0, the patient received an&#xD;
           infusion of cryopreserved G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). GVHD&#xD;
           prophylaxis consisted of daily tacrolimus and mini methotrexate regimen (5 mg/m2 given&#xD;
           on days 1, 3 and 6). There was successful neutrophil and platelet engraftment and 100%&#xD;
           stable chimerism. She developed interstitial pneumonia, possibly secondary to GVHD, 140&#xD;
           days after transplantation and progressed to respiratory failure leading to her death on&#xD;
           day 355. The second patient was a 56 year old with SC disease who was heavily&#xD;
           pretransfused and had multiple SCD complications. She received the same conditioning,&#xD;
           GVHD prophylaxis, and PBSC source as the first patient. She had 100% donor chimerism but&#xD;
           died on day 142 secondary to TTP and severe gut GVHD with CNS infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Iannone et al 9 described 6 pediatric patients with SCD who underwent bone marrow&#xD;
           transplant from their HLA matched siblings after conditioning with fludarabine&#xD;
           50mg/m2/day for 3-5 days and 200 cGy TBI in addition to horse ATG in one patient. GVHD&#xD;
           prophylaxis included MMF and tacrolimus or cyclosporine with various taper schedules.&#xD;
           There was minimal toxicity, however, all patients developed graft rejection upon taper&#xD;
           of immunosuppressive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Horan et al 10 described three SCD patients who were heavily transfused prior to&#xD;
           transplant and underwent HLA matched sibling transplant after conditioning with&#xD;
           fludarabine 25mg/m2 on 5 consecutive days before transplantation (days -6 to -2), rabbit&#xD;
           ATG (Thymoglobulin) on 4 consecutive days before transplantation (days -6 to -2) with&#xD;
           age adjusted dose, and single dose TBI 200 cGy. GVHD prophylaxis included MMF in the&#xD;
           first three months and CSA for at least six months. All had graft rejection except one&#xD;
           when the immunosuppression was tapered. There was no GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Horwitz et al 11 reported the outcome in two adult SCD patients who underwent HLA&#xD;
           matched sibling transplant and PBSC was the source of graft in both cases. Conditioning&#xD;
           was TBI 200 cGy followed by fludrabine 24-30 mg/m2 for 4 days and cyclophosphamide 500&#xD;
           mg/m2 for four days and alemtuzumab 100mg for five days. MMF was given in the first 100&#xD;
           days post transplant. Both engrafted successfully with no GVHD and a follow up of 20&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Krishnamurti et al described the use of RIC in seven SCD patients, age range 6-16 years.&#xD;
           The conditioning was busulfan 3.2 mg/kg on day -8 and -7, fludarabine 35mg/m2 on days -6&#xD;
           to -2, equine ATG 30mg/kg on days -5 to -1, and total lymphoid irradiation. GVHD&#xD;
           prophylaxis was CSA and MMF. CSA was tapered starting day +180 and MMF taper varied from&#xD;
           +45 to +220 day. Six patients had stable mixed chimerism after stopping CSA and MMF. One&#xD;
           patient had late graft failure. There was a low rate of GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Hsieh et al reported the use of non-myeloablative conditioning in SCD patients older&#xD;
           than 16 years of age. Graft source was GCSF mobilized PBSC from HLA matched siblings&#xD;
           with at least 10 X106 CD34/kg of recipient weight. Conditioning was alemtuzumab (total&#xD;
           1mg/kg divided on days -7 to -3) and single dose TBI 300 cGy on day -2. Presence of&#xD;
           major ABO incompatibility was one of the exclusion criteria for this study. Sirolimus&#xD;
           was used as GVHD prophylaxis and to prevent graft rejection. Nine of 10 patients&#xD;
           engrafted successfully and had stable chimerism, however, all patients continue to be on&#xD;
           sirolimus. None of patients had GVHD. They recently updated these promising results in a&#xD;
           total of 30 patients and were able to taper off sirolimus in 15 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Rationale for using thymoglobulin/fludarabine/melphalan conditioning RIC is a feasible&#xD;
      option for patients with SCD and can successfully cure the disease. A pre-transplant backbone&#xD;
      regimen consisting of Alemtuzumab or ATG, fludarabine, and melphalan has been applied&#xD;
      successfully in SCD patients as described above. We anticipate that the toxicity risk is&#xD;
      lower than the full myeloablative conditioning using busulfan and cyclophosphamide (BU/CY).&#xD;
      Melphalan was reported to cause infertility, mostly when we used with other chemotherapy&#xD;
      agents. The use of melphalan alone in the conditioning regimen was reported before to&#xD;
      potentially preserve fertility in women. So our regimen could potentially preserve fertility&#xD;
      at higher rate compared to BU/CY.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Rationale for pre-transplant immunosuppression therapy with hydroxyurea Individuals with&#xD;
      hemoglobinopathies have in general adequate T cell function and active bone marrow that can&#xD;
      lead to higher risk of graft rejection especially among patients who are heavily transfused.&#xD;
      Experience with class 3 thalassemia patients showed that pretreatment with hydroxyurea,&#xD;
      azathioprine, and fludarabine decreased the risk of graft rejection and allowed the use of&#xD;
      lower dose cyclophosphamide . So we will use hydroxyurea prior to transplant to minimize the&#xD;
      risk of graft rejection associated with RIC in sickle cell anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Rationale for using sirolimus and MMF as GVHD prophylaxis: Post-grafting&#xD;
      immunosuppression appears crucial to ensuring stable engraftment; an early taper appears to&#xD;
      contribute to late graft rejection in several of the series. Sirolimus is an inhibitor of the&#xD;
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and it induces immune tolerance and was used&#xD;
      successfully as GVHD prophylaxis in adult SCA patients who underwent RIC/ NMA. Sirolimus in&#xD;
      combination with calcineurin inhibitors or MMF was utilized effectively in pediatric patients&#xD;
      19-21. However, studies showed increased risk of veno-occlusive disease with the combination&#xD;
      of sirolimus and MMF and increased risk of transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy&#xD;
      when combined with tacrolimus especially among patients who received busulfan-based&#xD;
      conditioning 22-24. We will be using a RIC regimen so we do not anticipate that the&#xD;
      combination of sirolimus and MMF will cause excess toxicity.&#xD;
