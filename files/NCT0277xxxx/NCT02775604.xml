  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and potential impact of video analysis&#xD;
      of footage taken with a GoPro camera video in comparison to a homeowner checklist or gold&#xD;
      standard home assessment as a means of detecting home fall hazards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that the assessment of homes for fall hazards with a GoPro camera&#xD;
      will be better than a homeowner paper checklist in hazard identification.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      80 community-dwelling adults (50-75 years of age) will be recruited from clinics and the&#xD;
      community through posters and advertising (n = 40 in the Healthy Group; n = 40 in the Distal&#xD;
      Radius Fracture (DRF) Group (adults with 3-12 months post-DRF)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to a homeowner paper checklist or a GoPro video&#xD;
      assessment and then cross-over to the opposite intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess accuracy, a gold standard home assessment will be completed by a trained evaluator,&#xD;
      after the homeowner checklist and GoPro video assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the data collection, the evaluator will conduct their assessment (gold&#xD;
      standard); review the findings from the GoPro &quot;playback&quot; with the participant, and conduct a&#xD;
      semi-structured interview on their prior awareness of fall hazards, perceptions about the&#xD;
      different methods of detecting fall hazards in their home; and intentions to remediate&#xD;
      identified hazards.&#xD;

    <description>Fall hazard scores will be calculated based on the number and severity of hazards identified from the paper checklist, the GoPro assessment, and the independent evaluation. The extent of agreement on fall-hazard score and time taken to complete the evaluations (home-based video, paper/print checklist; professional home assessment) will be assessed.</description>

    <description>Semi-structured phone interviews will be conducted to collect participant feedback on the feasibility, usability, usefulness, acceptance, barriers, facilitators, respondent burden and preference for using GoPro video-technology vs. pp-CHFHC vs. professional assessment. During the interview, participants will also be asked about their prior awareness of fall hazards and experiences about the different methods of detecting fall hazards in their home.</description>

They will navigate through their home wearing the GoPro camera, recording images about their home and their usual activities and use a talk-aloud approach to describe what they are doing and seeing. The evaluator will provide no feedback during the assessments.</description>
