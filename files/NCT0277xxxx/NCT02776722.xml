      Despite advances in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes, its prevalence continues&#xD;
      to rise worldwide. There is a need for new modalities to improve metabolic control in&#xD;
      individuals with type 2 diabetes and those who are overweight or obese and at risk for type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. Contrary to the concerns raised about the adverse role of fructose in metabolic&#xD;
      health, various lines of evidence suggest that fructose and its epimers may improve the&#xD;
      metabolic handling of glucose through inducing glycogen synthesis. Recent small trials in&#xD;
      humans suggest that catalytic doses (=&lt;10g/meal) of fructose and its epimers (allulose,&#xD;
      tagatose, and sorbose) may reduce postprandial glycemic responses to carbohydrate loads&#xD;
      (i.e., oral glucose tolerance test or a starch load) in people with and without type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. There is also limited evidence that these acute effects may manifest as longer term&#xD;
      improvements in glycemic control. There is an urgent need to synthesize the evidence of the&#xD;
      effects of fructose and its epimers on postprandial carbohydrate metabolism.&#xD;

      Background: Despite advances in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes, its&#xD;
      prevalence continues to rise worldwide. There is a need for new modalities to improve&#xD;
      glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes and those who are overweight or obese&#xD;
      and at risk for type 2 diabetes. Contrary to the concerns raised about the adverse role of&#xD;
      fructose in metabolic health, there may be a role for fructose and its epimers, the rare non&#xD;
      caloric sugars allulose (C-3 epimer of fructose), tagatose (C-4 epimer of fructose), and&#xD;
      D-sorbose (C-3 and C-4 diastereomer of fructose). All are naturally found in small quantities&#xD;
      in dried fruits and maple syrup. Bother allulose and tagatose are generally recognized as&#xD;
      safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration in the US and are marketed as low-calorie&#xD;
      sugar substitutes that have anti-hyperglycemic effects. Various lines of evidence suggest&#xD;
      that fructose and its epimers may improve the metabolic handling of glucose through inducing&#xD;
      glycogen synthesis. Recent small trials in humans suggest that 'catalytic' doses (=&lt;10g/meal)&#xD;
      of fructose and its epimers (allulose, tagatose, and sorbose) may reduce postprandial&#xD;
      glycemic responses to carbohydrate loads (i.e., oral glucose tolerance test or a starch load)&#xD;
      in people with and without type 2 diabetes. These acute effects have been shown to be&#xD;
      sustainable over the longer term in several controlled trials of fructose and tagatose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for a review: There is an urgent need to synthesize the evidence of the effects of&#xD;
      fructose and its epimers on acute postprandial carbohydrate metabolism and longterm glycemic&#xD;
      control. There remains uncertainty in regards to the minimum effective dose (range studied,&#xD;
      2-25g) and the extent to which these benefits translate into meaningful longterm improvements&#xD;
      in glycemic control. A systematic review and meta-analysis remains the &quot;Gold Standard&quot; of&#xD;
      evidence to support health claims development. It will map the available evidence and, by&#xD;
      pooling the totality of that evidence, provide the most precise estimate of the true effect&#xD;
      of fructose and its epimers on carbohydrate metabolism and longterm glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The investigators will conduct two systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the&#xD;
      effect of small 'catalytic' doses of fructose and its epimers. The objective of the first&#xD;
      systematic review and meta-analysis will be to assess their effect on the postprandial&#xD;
      glycemic and insulinemic responses to other carbohydrates in acute feeding trials, while the&#xD;
      objective of the second systematic review and meta-analysis will be to update and expand on&#xD;
      our previous systematic review and meta-analysis of small catalytic doses of fructose to&#xD;
      assess the effect of small catalytic doses of fructose and its epimers on glycemic control in&#xD;
      chronic feeding trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The planning and conduct of the two proposed systematic reviews and meta-analyses&#xD;
      will follow the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. The reporting will&#xD;
      follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be&#xD;
      searched using appropriate search terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: The first systematic review and meta-analysis will include single-bolus&#xD;
      feeding trials assessing the effect of small 'catalytic doses (=&lt;10g/meal) of fructose and&#xD;
      its epimers on the acute postprandial glycemic and insulinemic responses to other&#xD;
      carbohydrates. The second systematic review and meta-analysis will include controlled feeding&#xD;
      trials of &gt;=1-week diet duration investigating the effect of small 'catalytic doses&#xD;
      (=&lt;50g/day or =&lt;10% energy/day) of fructose and its epimers on markers of glycemic control.&#xD;
      The 50g/day =&lt;10% energy/day dose threshold for chronic feeding allows for the intake of&#xD;
      fructose and its epimers as part of 3 main meals (=&lt;10g/meal) and 3 snacks (=&lt;5g/meal) per&#xD;
      day and aligns with current guidelines not to exceed 10% energy from free or added sugars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: Two or more investigators will independently extract relevant data and&#xD;
      assess risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. All disagreements will be resolved&#xD;
      by consensus. Mean values and SEs will be extracted for all outcomes. Standard computations&#xD;
      and imputations will be used to derive missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Acute glycemic outcomes (incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for blood glucose&#xD;
      and insulin, Matsuda insulin sensitivity index, and the early insulin secretion index) will&#xD;
      be assessed in the first systematic review and meta-analysis while chronic glycemic outcomes&#xD;
      (HbA1c, fasting glucose, and fasting insulin) will be assessed in the second systematic&#xD;
      review and meta-analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis: Ratios of means will be pooled for the acute glycemic outcomes and mean&#xD;
      differences will be pooled for the chronic glycemic outcomes using the Generic Inverse&#xD;
      Variance method with random effects models. Random-effects models will be used even in the&#xD;
      absence of statistically significant between-study heterogeneity, as they yield more&#xD;
      conservative summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity.&#xD;
      Fixed-effects models will only be used where there is &lt;5 included studies. Paired analyses&#xD;
      will be applied for crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be tested (Cochran Q statistic) and&#xD;
      quantified (I2 statistic). To explore sources of heterogeneity, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct sensitivity analyses, in which each study is systematically removed. If there are&#xD;
      &gt;=10 studies, then the investigators will also explore sources of heterogeneity by a priori&#xD;
      subgroup analyses by participant phenotype, dose, comparator, baseline measurements, risk of&#xD;
      bias, study design (parallel, crossover), energy balance (positive, neutral, negative), and&#xD;
      duration of follow-up. Metaregression will assess the significance of categorical subgroup&#xD;
      analyses and model continuous dose response relationships. Where no evidence of a linear&#xD;
      relationship is observed, meta-regression spline curve modeling will be undertaken (the&#xD;
      MKSPLINE procedure) to assess a dose threshold by characterizing segments of the&#xD;
      dose-response curve where separate linear approximations may best describe the data. If there&#xD;
      are more than 10 trial comparisons, then Publication publication bias will be assessed by&#xD;
      inspection of funnel plot and the Egger and Begg tests. If publication bias is suspected,&#xD;
      then an adjustment for funnel plot asymmetry will be attempted by imputing the missing study&#xD;
      data using the Duval and Tweedie trim-and-fill method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence Assessment: The strength of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: Results will be disseminated through traditional means such as&#xD;
      interactive presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and&#xD;
      publication in high impact factor journals. Innovative means such as webcasts with e-mail&#xD;
      feedback mechanisms will also be used. Knowledge Users will act as knowledge brokers&#xD;
      networking among opinion leaders and different adopter groups to increase awareness at each&#xD;
      stage. Four Knowledge Users will also participate directly as members of nutrition guidelines&#xD;
      committees. Target adopters will include industry and research communities. Feedback will be&#xD;
      incorporated and used to guide analyses and improve key messages at each stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the effects&#xD;
      of fructose and its epimers on postprandial carbohydrate metabolism. This project aims to&#xD;
      inform future design of single-meal feeding trials on fructose and its epimers by&#xD;
      establishing the dose range for their effects on postprandial carbohydrate metabolism.&#xD;
