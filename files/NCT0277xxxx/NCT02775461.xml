      The purpose of this study is to establish a registry of patients with pancreatic diseases.&#xD;
      Patients included in the registry may include those with: pancreatic cancer, precancerous&#xD;
      lesions of the pancreas, inflammatory lesions of the pancreas, cystic lesions of the&#xD;
      pancreas, and patients at high-risk of pancreatic cancer such as those with a family history&#xD;
      of pancreatic cancer or with a family history of a syndrome known to be associated with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of death from cancer in the&#xD;
      United States. However, little is known about the development of pancreatic cancer and&#xD;
      pancreatic diseases in individuals with the above conditions. Knowledge of how family&#xD;
      history, environmental exposures, and inflammatory lesion of the pancreas contribute to the&#xD;
      development of pancreatic cancer and pancreatic diseases is essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may qualify to take part in this research study because you have inflammation in the&#xD;
      pancreas, a pancreatic cyst, pre-cancerous lesions of the pancreas, pancreatic cancer, a&#xD;
      family history of pancreatic cancer, or a family history of a syndrome known to be associated&#xD;
      with pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also be collecting a blood sample from all participants for DNA isolation. Sometimes&#xD;
      we are born with genes or DNA that give us an increased or decreased chance of developing an&#xD;
      illness later in life. Genetic material will be isolated from your blood for further study.&#xD;
      You may also choose to provide additional blood samples for serum and plasma extraction.&#xD;
      Serum and plasma are components of the blood which can be used to measure indicators of&#xD;
      disease in the blood, called biomarkers,for pancreatic diseases. Clinical data and biological&#xD;
      specimens contained in this study may be used for a wide variety of future related studies to&#xD;
      the cause, diagnosis, outcome and treatment of pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funds for conducting this research are provided by Mount Sinai.&#xD;

      The overall purpose of this research project is to establish a registry of patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic diseases. Patients included in the registry may include those with: pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer, precancerous lesions of the pancreas such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms&#xD;
      (IPMNs) and cystic lesions, inflammatory lesions and inflammation of the pancreas, and&#xD;
      patients at high-risk of pancreatic cancer such as those with a family history of pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer or with a family history of a syndrome known to be associated with pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
      The data contained in this registry will be used to conduct research related to the risk of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer and pancreatic diseases. As this is a registry protocol, no specific&#xD;
      hypotheses are to be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish and maintain a registry of individuals and their family members who have&#xD;
           pancreatic diseases and may be at increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer over&#xD;
           normal population risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Collect data and review existing data on personal and family histories, demographics,&#xD;
           risk factors, and health behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Use the data in the registry to conduct studies related to disease risk, prevention, and&#xD;
           prognosis of pancreatic cancer and other pancreatic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of death from malignancy in the United States.&#xD;
      With near equivalent incidence and mortality, cure can only be achieved with surgical&#xD;
      resection of an early stage lesion. Premalignant disease stages, such as IPMN, may be&#xD;
      detected with noninvasive and minimally invasive techniques, providing an opportunity for&#xD;
      screening and surveillance of at-risk populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge of the etiology of pancreatic cancer is incomplete. Approximately 10% of pancreatic&#xD;
      ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a hereditary component, and screening this population has&#xD;
      the potential to have an impact on disease mortality. Certain patient populations, such as&#xD;
      those with hereditary pancreatitis, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, familial atypical multiple mole&#xD;
      melanoma (FAMMM syndrome), Lynch syndrome, and the breast ovarian cancer syndrome (BRCA1 and&#xD;
      BRCA2 mutations) are at the highest risk of PDAC. BRCA2 mutations are the most commonly&#xD;
      identified germline mutations in families with PDAC. Even a family history of PDAC without&#xD;
      the above described syndromes has been shown to increase risk, suggesting a unique familial&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer syndrome which may be related to the partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2)&#xD;
      gene or other PDAC susceptibility genes. Environmental risk factors, such as cigarette&#xD;
      smoking, diabetes, obesity and dietary risk factors have been implicated in the development&#xD;
      of PDAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sequential model of acquisition of somatic mutations via a Pancreatic Intraepithelial&#xD;
      Neoplasia (PanIN) has been proposed for the development of PDAC and subsequent metastases.&#xD;
      However, others have proposed that the metastatic process may be initiated earlier in the&#xD;
      disease process during the pre-malignant cyst or PanIN phase. This may in part account for&#xD;
      the fact that the overwhelming majority of patients diagnosed with PDAC are diagnosed when&#xD;
      the lesion is already metastatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several groups have instituted PDAC screening for individuals at high-risk of PDAC. These&#xD;
      groups have demonstrated the feasibility of detection of PDAC and pre-malignant lesions in&#xD;
      certain high-risk individuals. Given the large gaps in knowledge, recruitment of patients&#xD;
      with preneoplastic pancreatic diseases to registries is essential in the development of&#xD;
      effective PDAC screening and prevention programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an increasing number of patients undergo cross-sectional imaging with the abdomen with cat&#xD;
      scan (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an increasing number of patients are found to&#xD;
      have pancreatic disease and pancreatic cysts. While there is an increased risk of pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer with these lesions, the studies to date are small and retrospective.&#xD;
