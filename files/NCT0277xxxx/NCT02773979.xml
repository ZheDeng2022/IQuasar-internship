      This phase I trial of the replication-intact PfSPZ Challenge vaccine given under CQ cover&#xD;
      will enroll 28 healthy volunteers to receive PfSPZ or placebo, as well as suppressive doses&#xD;
      of chloroquine (CQ)on varying schedules. 10 weeks post 3rd immunization subjects will be&#xD;
      subjected to controlled human malarial infection. The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge&#xD;
      administered by DVI on varying schedules to healthy malaria-na誰ve adults taking suppressive&#xD;
      doses of CQ (PfSPZ-CVac).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This phase I trial of the replication-intact PfSPZ Challenge vaccine given under CQ&#xD;
      (PfSPZ-CVac) cover will randomize 28 healthy adult participants to one of three cohorts.&#xD;
      Group 1 (n=12) will be randomized to receive PfSPZ Challenge vaccine at a dose of 51,200&#xD;
      sporozoites or 0.5 mL of sterile normal saline placebo by DVI on Days 3, 10 and 17. Group 2&#xD;
      (n=4) will be randomized to receive PfSPZ Challenge vaccine at a dose of 102,400 sporozoites&#xD;
      or 0.5 mL of sterile normal saline placebo by DVI on Days 3, 10, and 17. Within both groups,&#xD;
      placebo will be assigned 1:3, with blinded allocation to the two treatments within each&#xD;
      group. All subjects in Study Groups 1 and 2 will receive, by directly observed treatment&#xD;
      (DOT), oral chloroquine (CQ) on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 at a suppressive dose of 600 mg base on&#xD;
      Day 1 and 300 mg base on Days 8, 15 and 22. All subjects in Group 3 (n=9) will receive PfSPZ&#xD;
      Challenge vaccine at a dose of 102,400 sporozoites per administration, with vaccine given on&#xD;
      a Day 1, 6, and 11 schedule. Subjects in Group 3 will also receive, by DOT, oral CQ, with a&#xD;
      suppressive dose of 600 mg base on Day 1 and a dose of 300 mg base on Days 6, 11, and 16. At&#xD;
      10 weeks after the third administration of study vaccine or placebo, all subjects within the&#xD;
      three groups will receive the PfSPZ Challenge by direct venous injection at a dose of 3,200&#xD;
      P. falciparum sporozoites to assess vaccine efficacy against controlled human malarial&#xD;
      infection (CHMI). The primary objective of this study is to 1) evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of escalating doses of Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge administered by DVI on varying&#xD;
      schedules to healthy malaria-na誰ve adults taking suppressive doses of CQ (PfSPZ-CVac).&#xD;
