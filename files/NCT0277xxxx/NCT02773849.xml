  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous multi-dose Phase I and Phase II clinical studies have demonstrated that INSTILADRIN&#xD;
      (nadofaragene firadenovec) is a safe and effective treatment for BCG-refractory and recurrent&#xD;
      NMIBC. This Phase III study is designed to expand those observations using a high dose of&#xD;
      INSTILADRIN in patients that are &quot;BCG Unresponsive&quot; which refers to patients with high-grade&#xD;
      NMIBC who are unlikely to benefit from and should not receive further intravesical BCG.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recombinant IFN alpha2b has pleiotropic effects that contribute to antitumor activity in&#xD;
      Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC). INSTILADRIN is a non-replicating adenovirus&#xD;
      vector harboring the human IFN alpha2b gene. When combined with the excipient Syn3,&#xD;
      intravesical administration of the rAd-IFN results in transduction of the virus into the&#xD;
      epithelial cell lining in the bladder. The IFN alpha2b gene is incorporated into the cellular&#xD;
      DNA resulting in the synthesis and expression of large amounts of IFN alpha2b protein.&#xD;
      Clinical studies have confirmed that IFN alpha2b protein can be measured in the urine of&#xD;
      patients treated with INSTILADRIN within 24 hours after dosing.&#xD;
