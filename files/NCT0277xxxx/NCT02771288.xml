  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the safety and long-term vascular remodeling after bioresorbable vascular&#xD;
      scaffold (BVS) implantation for stenotic or occluded lesion in children or young adults with&#xD;
      Kawasaki disease (KD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: KD occurs worldwide, most prevalent in Japan and East Asian countries. Coronary&#xD;
      artery lesion is the predominant determinant of KD outcome in the long-term. Children with KD&#xD;
      with aneurysms at least 6 mm in maximal diameter had a greater than 50% chance of developing&#xD;
      a clinically significant stenotic lesion during follow-up. They are at risk of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction-related sudden death or congestive heart failure as young adults. Bypass surgery&#xD;
      could be the reasonable strategy but the long-term patency of the graft remains&#xD;
      unsatisfactory. Percutaneous angioplasty with drug-eluting stents (DES) implantation is the&#xD;
      alternative. However, metallic stenting remains problematic in several aspects mainly due to&#xD;
      the restriction of vessel expansive remodeling. The novel BVS has the potential to be free&#xD;
      from the limitation due to scaffold degradation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      we will conduct a single-center, single-group prospective study with safety and imaging&#xD;
      endpoints. A total of 10 KD children or young adults with indication of revascularization are&#xD;
      enrolled, and BVS will be implanted for stenotic or occluded lesions. QCA and optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (OCT) are used to evaluate the baseline lumen area, plaque&#xD;
      characteristics, and BVS expansion or eccentricity after deployment. At 12 months, scaffold&#xD;
      restenosis is evaluated by multislice computed tomography. At 30 months, patients will&#xD;
      receive follow-up by angiography and OCT to evaluate lumen area, neoplaque characteristics,&#xD;
      and side branch conditions. Otherwise, the composite endpoint including cardiac death,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, and ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularisation are assessed at&#xD;
      30 days, 6 and 9 months, and 1, 2, 3 years.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. In the single-group prospective study with safety and imaging endpoints, a total of 10&#xD;
             KD patients &lt; 18 years will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The diagnosis of KD was made based on clinical criteria for KD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients presenting with an acute myocardial infarction or unstable arrhythmias, or those&#xD;
        who has severe left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction less than 35%), intrastent&#xD;
        restenotic lesions, lesions located in the left main coronary artery, and tight lesions&#xD;
        which could not be well dilated even after rotational atherectomy are excluded. Those with&#xD;
        chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dl) are also excluded due to the limitation&#xD;
        of OCT (optical coherence tomography) use.&#xD;
