    <textblock>
      The present study has been designed to assess the efficacy and safety of Stellate Ganglion&#xD;
      Block (SGB) in relieving symptomatic cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal clipping. The&#xD;
      effect was assessed by both Digital Subtraction Angiography(DSA) and Transcranial Doppler&#xD;
      (TCD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesiologist was informed about the patients (Post clipping for cerebral aneurysm) having&#xD;
      neurological deterioration (hemiparesis, aphasia, apraxia, hemianopia, or neglect), or a&#xD;
      decrease of ≥ 2 points on the Glasgow Coma Scale(GCS) and in whom the duration of symptoms&#xD;
      lasted for at least 1 hour. Anesthesiologist was also informed if increased cerebral blood&#xD;
      flow velocity was found on routine daily Transcranial Doppler(TCD) evaluation of such&#xD;
      patients. A cerebral Computed tomography(CT) scan was performed at this time to rule out&#xD;
      ventricular dilation or any other focal brain lesion explaining the clinical symptoms. In&#xD;
      such patient Central venous pressure(CVP) was maintained at 8-10 mm of Hg and systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure was maintained between 160-200 mm Hg (using infusion of vasopressors such as&#xD;
      phenylephrine or dopamine if required). Oral/ nasogastric nimodipine (60 mg 4 hourly) was&#xD;
      continued and hemoglobin was maintained at ≥ 10 gm/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis Of Vasospasm By Transcranial Doppler A 2 megahertz (MHz) transcranial Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasound probe was used to insonate vessels through the temporal acoustic window.&#xD;
      Extracranial Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) was insonated in the neck using a linear probe of&#xD;
      8- 13 MHz. Using Transcranial Doppler (TCD) probe, a tracing of waveform of Middle Cerebral&#xD;
      Artery (MCA) was identified and confirmed using standard criteria. Peak Systolic Velocity and&#xD;
      Mean Flow Velocity were assessed. Pulsatility Index and Resistivity Index were assessed.&#xD;
      LINDEGAARD ratio was calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis Of Vasospasm By Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) Patients were shifted to&#xD;
      Digital subtraction Angiography room and an emergency cerebral angiographic study was&#xD;
      performed using Philips Allura Xper FD20/10 machine. Vasospasm was diagnosed on DSA and the&#xD;
      vessel diameter was measured at the mid A1 segment of Anterior cerebral artery(ACA) and mid&#xD;
      M1 segment of Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA). Vasospasm was classified as mild (&lt;25%), moderate&#xD;
      (25% to 50%), or severe (&gt;50%) with respect to two - dimensional diameter at the mid A1 and&#xD;
      mid M1 segment of ACA and MCA respectively. Location of vasospasm was classified as&#xD;
      unilateral vs bilateral, single vessel involvement vs multiple vessel involvement or diffuse&#xD;
      vasospasm (bilateral with multiple vessel involvement). Parenchymal filling time was&#xD;
      calculated as the time delay between initiation of contrast injection till the appearance of&#xD;
      parenchymal blush. Venous sinus filling time was calculated as the time delay between the&#xD;
      initiation of contrast injection till the appearance of superior sagittal sinus. After&#xD;
      diagnosis of vasospasm patients were administered ultrasound guided Stellate Ganglion block&#xD;
      using 10 ml of 0.5% Injection Bupivacaine on the same side of vasospasm or the side&#xD;
      contralateral to the focal neurological deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound Guided Stellate Ganglion Block - Technique Patients were kept supine with the neck&#xD;
      in slight hyperextension. Under aseptic conditions, transducer is placed on the surface of&#xD;
      the neck at the level of Cervical (C6) vertebrae. The internal jugular vein, carotid artery,&#xD;
      thyroid gland, trachea, C6 vertebrae, transverse process of C6, esophagus, longus colli with&#xD;
      its covering prevertebral fascia and esophagus are visualized. The transducer was pressed&#xD;
      between the trachea and the carotid artery to retract the artery laterally as well as to&#xD;
      position the transducer near the longus colli. A 25-gauge Quincke spinal needle was inserted&#xD;
      paratracheal towards the middle of the longus colli muscle. The endpoint of the injection was&#xD;
      the ultrasound image of the tip of the needle as it penetrates the prevertebral fascia&#xD;
      covering the longus colli muscle. The drug is then injected and spread of drug is visualized&#xD;
      as distension of prevertebral fascia around the longus colli muscle in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Block Assessment-&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Development of ipsilateral Horner Syndrome at 5 minutes interval till 30 minutes after&#xD;
      block to confirm successful Stellate Ganglion Block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At thirty minutes after the block the following parameters are assessed:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological condition (GCS score, motor deficits, aphasia, apraxia, hemianopia or&#xD;
           neglect). Assessment was done by a blinded neurosurgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic parameters: heart rate, blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcranial doppler measurement of flow velocity in MCA, Pulsatility index(PI),&#xD;
           Resistivity Index(RI) and LINDEGAARD ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Digital subtraction angiography was repeated to measure diameter of the vessels affected&#xD;
           by vasospasm, change in grading of vasospasm, any increase in vessel diameter,&#xD;
           parenchymal filling time and venous sinus filling time. Any increase or decrease in&#xD;
           parenchymal and venous sinus filling time was noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block Failure- Block was considered a failure if no signs of Horner's syndrome appeared after&#xD;
      30 minutes of SGB block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ineffective Stellate ganglion block- Block was considered ineffective after 30 minutes of&#xD;
      Stellate ganglion block&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there was no neurological improvement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No improvement in Transcranial doppler findings to normal level or no significant change&#xD;
           in affected vessel diameter, grading of vasospasm, parenchymal filling time and venous&#xD;
           sinus filling time in second Digital subtraction angiography Rescue Management In case&#xD;
           of ineffective block, patients were given intra-arterial nimodipine at rate of 0.1&#xD;
           milligram / minute for a maximum dose of 3 milligram /artery as a rescue measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this improvement, these patients were monitored in Intensive care unit(ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management Of Patient In Intensive Care Unit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Avoidance of hypotension. Maintenance of Systolic Blood Pressure(SBP) at 160-200 mm of&#xD;
           Hg using vasopressor {(phenylephrine 2-17microgram/Kg/min) and/or (dopamine-5-10&#xD;
           microgram/kg/min)}&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Avoidance of hypovolemia, maintain Central venous pressure at 8-10 mm of Hg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance of Hemoglobin ≥ 9gram/decilitre&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral/nasogastric Nimodipine 60mg 4 hourly. Clinical course of patients was followed.&#xD;
           Baseline neurological, hemodynamic and TCD parameters were reassessed by the&#xD;
           anesthesiologist at 30 minutes . Patients with effective block were reassessed for&#xD;
           neurological status and flow velocity measurements by Transcranial Doppler at 6 hours,&#xD;
           12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours and 48 hours after Stellate ganglion block. Patients with&#xD;
           ineffective block who received rescue management were not reassessed for neurological&#xD;
           status and flow velocity measurements using Transcranial Doppler at various intervals by&#xD;
           the anesthesiologist. However the complications occurring in them, the duration of their&#xD;
           stay in the hospital and the final outcome in the form of discharge or death was noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications Of Stellate ganglion block Procedure and drug-related complications were noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications During Hospital Stay Complications occurring in the post Stellate Ganglion&#xD;
      Block period during the entire hospital stay other than those due to the stellate ganglion&#xD;
      block per se were noted. Duration of hospital stay was also noted.&#xD;

    <description>The principle on which the TCD works is that with arterial narrowing, the blood flow velocity within the vessel increases. A good correlation has been found between the TCD blood flow velocities and vasospasm. The MCA velocity greater than 120 cm/sec indicates mild vasospasm , velocity greater than 130 cm/sec indicates moderate vasospasm and velocity greater than 200 cm/sec indicates severe vasospasm.</description>
