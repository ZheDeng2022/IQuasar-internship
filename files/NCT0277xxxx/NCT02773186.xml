  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the present study was to evaluate whether cerebral oxygen saturation is&#xD;
      associated with an increase of NPOBC in pediatric patients undergoing major surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective and observational study involved consecutive patients aged between 2 and 12&#xD;
      years undergoing a major surgery using general anesthesia. Cerebral oxygen saturation,&#xD;
      non-invasive arterial pressure, pulse oximetry, and heart rate were recorded at the following&#xD;
      stages of the surgical intervention: baseline, induction, intubation, surgical incision, end&#xD;
      of surgery, and extubation. Preoperative anxiety was evaluated by using the modified Yale&#xD;
      Preoperative Anxiety Scale, and NPOBC was determined by using the Post-Hospital Behaviour&#xD;
      Questionnaire on 7th and 28th postoperative days. A logistic regression was created to&#xD;
      identify factors associated with the development of NPOBC&#xD;

Anesthetic induction was achieved with high concentration sevoflurane 6-8% (Sevorane®, Abbvie) and oxygen 50%. Anesthetic maintenance was done with sevoflurane 2-3%, 50% O2/air mixture, fentanyl 1 µg.kg.-1 iv, and rocuronium 0.3 µg.kg.-1 iv if required. Electrocardiogram (ECG), non-invasive arterial pressure, pulse oximetry, end-tidal carbon dioxide and cerebral NIRS oximetry was monitoring by using an INVOSTM5100 (Somanetics Corporation, Troy, MI, USA).</description>
