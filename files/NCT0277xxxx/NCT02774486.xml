  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary cause of being overweight is an imbalance in calories consumed and energy&#xD;
      expenditure. A surplus in energy intake might result in body fat deposition and thereby body&#xD;
      weight gain. Therefore, food intake regulation is crucial to control the body weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appetite regulation plays an important role in determining the food intake, which is a&#xD;
      complex process influenced by the individual (physiology and psychology) and environment.&#xD;
      Satiation (process that leads to the termination of eating) and satiety (decline in hunger,&#xD;
      increase in fullness after a meal has finished) are the precursors of appetite regulation,&#xD;
      which may be induced by various food components such as macronutrients, water, alcohol and&#xD;
      non-digestible polysaccharides. High viscosity and swellable/bulking food components such as&#xD;
      dietary fibre are expected to elicit stronger satiation/satiety than the macronutrients or&#xD;
      clear liquid. Due to its unique physicochemical properties, dietary fibre has been recognized&#xD;
      as potential ingredient that helps to enhance the sensation of satiety in the upper gut by&#xD;
      increasing gastric distension and delaying gastric emptying, which subsequently reduces the&#xD;
      food intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IQP-AK-102 comprises of a proprietary blend of dietary fibres known to promote a feeling a&#xD;
      fullness. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IQP-AK-102&#xD;
      on appetite reduction in overweight subjects during a 4-weeks interval.&#xD;
