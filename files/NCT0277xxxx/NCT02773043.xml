      The proposed study is to validate a non-invasive imaging technique to evaluate the myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion reserve in comparison with a validated invasive technique, the measure of coronary&#xD;
      flow reserve (CRF) with thermodilution.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease is a public health problem. The measurement of myocardial perfusion&#xD;
      reserve is a prognostic factor supplemental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its measure should influence the treatment and the follow up of the patients. The measurement&#xD;
      of CRF by by one pressure-temperature sensor-tipped guide wire is a validated technique to&#xD;
      evaluate the myocardial perfusion reserve but it is an invasive technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will compare this method with a non-invasive method:&#xD;
      completely automated analysis and quantification of myocardial blood flow from DICOM files&#xD;
      corresponding to stress and rest images was developed with a new camera CZT SPECT.&#xD;
