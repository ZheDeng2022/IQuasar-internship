  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to test an investigational drug (Not FDA approved), Apalutamide&#xD;
      given in combination with Leuprolide acetate (FDA approved) in men diagnosed with high-risk&#xD;
      prostate cancer who have already selected to have surgery to remove their prostate gland as&#xD;
      part of their treatment plan. The main purpose of this study is to determine how tumors make&#xD;
      androgens (male hormones), which makes these tumors more aggressive and resistant to hormonal&#xD;
      therapy and how a short period of treatment with Apalutamide and leuprolide acetate prior to&#xD;
      surgery can affect the production of these hormones in normal and malignant prostate tissue.&#xD;

      Primary Objective: To evaluate the differential effect of neo-adjuvant leuprolide and&#xD;
      Apalutamide on dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentration in benign prostate tissue based on&#xD;
      HSD3B1 genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s): To evaluate the differential effect of neoadjuvant leuprolide and&#xD;
      Apalutamide on other androgen (testosterone (T), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA),&#xD;
      androstenediol, 5α-androstanedione (5α-dione), androstenedione (AD), androsterone and&#xD;
      5α-androstanediol) concentrations in benign and malignant prostate tissue based on HSD3B1&#xD;
      genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the level of DHT, T, DHEA, androstenediol, 5α-dione, AD, androsterone and&#xD;
      5α-androstanediol between normal and malignant prostate tissue after neoadjuvant treatment&#xD;
      with leuprolide and Apalutamide&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety of the combination of Leuprolide and Apalutamide administered prior&#xD;
      to radical prostatectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate prostatic specific antigen (PSA), FKBP5, TMPRSS2, EZH2, H3K27 and UBE2C tissue&#xD;
      expression (via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR))&#xD;
      in benign and malignant prostate tissue after treatment with Leuprolide and Apalutamide.&#xD;
