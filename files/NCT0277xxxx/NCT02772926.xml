  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several mechanisms have been implicated in the pathophysiology of the complications of&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (DM), one of them is the formation and accumulation of a heterogeneous&#xD;
      group of compounds called advanced glycation end products (AGEs). The interaction of these&#xD;
      compounds with their receptor, the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)&#xD;
      triggers several signalling pathways which will lead to increase in inflammatory molecules&#xD;
      and enhanced reactive oxygen species. In addition, to the membrane receptor RAGE, there are&#xD;
      two soluble forms, the soluble RAGE (sRAGE) and the endogenous secretory RAGE (esRAGE), these&#xD;
      soluble receptors are capable to bind AGEs and block the AGE-RAGE axis. It has been observed&#xD;
      that in diabetes the needs of thiamine are increased, and it could be an inhibition of the&#xD;
      pentose phosphate pathway (thiamine is an essential cofactor in this pathway) and activation&#xD;
      of other metabolic pathways among them AGEs formation. It has been proposed that&#xD;
      supplementation of benfotiamine could decreased the risk of micro and macrovascular&#xD;
      complications, and this could be in part because a decreased in the formation of AGEs. For&#xD;
      this reason, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of benfotiamine on AGEs&#xD;
      and its soluble receptors (sRAGE) in patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives in the current study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate and compare clinical and anthropometric characteristics in type 2 DM&#xD;
           patients with and without benfotiamine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate and compare in type 2 DM patients with and without benfotiamine treatment&#xD;
           the following biochemical parameters: total AGEs, Carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), sRAGE,&#xD;
           glucose, hemoglobin A1c, lipids (total cholesterol, C-HDL, C-LDL, and triglycerides).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate and compare dietary data such as dietary AGEs and macro and macronutrients&#xD;
           in type 2 DM patients with and without benfotiamine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods 34 patients will be recruited, 17 per group. After signing the inform consent&#xD;
      subjects will be assessed for inclusion criteria. Subjects meeting the inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      those whom accept to participate will be randomized to receive either a placebo or&#xD;
      benfotiamine treatment for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 12 weeks all the basal assessments will be repeated.&#xD;

      Diabetes mellitus (DM) and its related complications are an increasing health burden all over&#xD;
      the world. Insulin deficiency or the insulin resistance in patients with diabetes triggers&#xD;
      hyperglycemia which is the main responsible for the micro and macrovascular complications.&#xD;
      Several mechanisms have been implicated in the pathophysiology of these complications, one of&#xD;
      them is the formation and accumulation of a heterogeneous group of compounds called advanced&#xD;
      glycation end products (AGEs). The interaction of these compounds with their receptor, the&#xD;
      receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) triggers several signalling pathways&#xD;
      which will lead to increase in inflammatory molecules and enhanced reactive oxygen species.&#xD;
      In addition, to the membrane receptor RAGE, there are two soluble forms, the soluble RAGE&#xD;
      (sRAGE) and the endogenous secretory RAGE (esRAGE), these soluble receptors are capable to&#xD;
      bind AGEs and block the AGE-RAGE axis. It has been observed that in diabetes the needs of&#xD;
      thiamine are increased, and it could be an inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway&#xD;
      (thiamine is an essential cofactor in this pathway) and activation of other metabolic&#xD;
      pathways among them AGEs formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been proposed that supplementation of benfotiamine could decreased the risk of micro&#xD;
      and macrovascular complications, here we proposed that this could be because a decreased in&#xD;
      the formation of AGEs. For this reason, the objective of this study was to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of benfotiamine on AGEs and its soluble receptors (sRAGE) in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives in the current study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate and compare clinical and anthropometric characteristics in type 2 DM&#xD;
           patients with and without benfotiamine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate and compare in type 2 DM patients with and without benfotiamine treatment&#xD;
           the following biochemical parameters: Carboxymethyl-lysine (CML)(a marker for AGEs&#xD;
           levels), sRAGE, glucose, hemoglobin A1c, lipids (total cholesterol, C-HDL, C-LDL, and&#xD;
           triglycerides).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate and compare dietary data such as dietary AGEs and macro and macronutrients&#xD;
           in type 2 DM patients with and without benfotiamine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods 34 patients will be recruited, 17 per group, level of significance is 0.05 and power&#xD;
      80%. Size was calculated by difference in group means divided by standard deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the inform consent subjects will be assessed for inclusion criteria. Subjects&#xD;
      meeting the inclusion criteria and those whom accept to participate will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to receive either a placebo or benfotiamine treatment for 12 weeks. The randomization will be&#xD;
      done with a statistical Software (SPSS, V. 21, Chicago).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After group assignment, subjects will be instructed to assist to the Research Center three&#xD;
      times for initial assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first visit the subject will answer a questionnaire with personal data, medical&#xD;
      history and current medications. Patients will be asked to have 10-12 hours of fasting for&#xD;
      the blood sample and for the body composition assessment, weight, height and waist&#xD;
      circumference will be measured too. Also the blood pressure will be measured during this&#xD;
      first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the dietary assessment 24-hour dietary recalls will be applied in 3 different days.&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed not to change their dietary habits and to maintain their exercise&#xD;
      levels during the length of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will visit the Research Center every two-weeks to receive a new bottle of pills and&#xD;
      to answer an adherence questionnaire and also to ask for possible adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week six in addition to the adherence questionnaire another blood sample and blood&#xD;
      pressure will be taken. In addition, another 24-hour dietary recall will be completed&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 12 weeks all the basal assessments will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/ endpoints Change from basal serum levels of the following parameters:&#xD;
      measured basal and at the end of study: Carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), and sRAGE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum samples will be stored frozen at -80°C until assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification and quantification of CML will be measured with an immunoassay commercial&#xD;
           kit (OxiSelect ™)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification and quantification of sRAGE will be measured with Human RAGE Immunoassay&#xD;
           commercial kit (Quantikine®)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be presented as mean and standard deviation if presents normal distribution.&#xD;
      Normality of data will be evaluated by Kolmogorov-Smirnov. To determinate basal differences&#xD;
      between groups a t-Student test for independent samples will be applied. For the difference&#xD;
      between groups before and after treatment a t-Student test for dependent samples will be&#xD;
      applied. If data have not normal distribution, no parametrical tests will be used.&#xD;
