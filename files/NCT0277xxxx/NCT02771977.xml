  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, patients with acute kidney injury who have recently received a drug that may&#xD;
      affect kidney function will be randomized to having an alert placed in the electronic health&#xD;
      record or usual care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) carries a significant, independent risk of mortality among&#xD;
      hospitalized patients. Recent studies have demonstrated increased mortality among patients&#xD;
      with even small increases in serum creatinine concentration. International guidelines for the&#xD;
      treatment of AKI focus on appropriate management of drug dosing, avoiding nephrotoxic&#xD;
      exposures, and careful attention to fluid and electrolyte balance. Early nephrologist&#xD;
      involvement may also improve outcomes in AKI. Without appropriate provider recognition of&#xD;
      AKI, however, none of these measures can be taken, and patient outcomes may suffer. AKI is&#xD;
      frequently overlooked by clinicians, but carries a substantial cost, morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators conducted a pilot, randomized trial of electronic alerts for acute kidney&#xD;
      injury in 2014. The trial, which randomized 2400 patients with AKI as defined by an increase&#xD;
      in creatinine of 0.3mg/dl over 48 hours or 50% over 7 days, found that alerting physicians to&#xD;
      the presence of AKI did not improve the course of acute kidney injury, reduce dialysis or&#xD;
      death rates. However this study was conducted in a single hospital, and the alert itself did&#xD;
      not describe specific actions that a provider could take. In the present proposal, the&#xD;
      investigators seek to expand upon their prior study to determine both the modes of alerting&#xD;
      that would be most effective and to determine if targeting alerts (such as to patients on&#xD;
      medications that may worsen acute kidney injury) will improve effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized, controlled trial of an electronic AKI alert system. Using&#xD;
      the Kidney Disease: Improve Global Outcomes creatinine criteria, inpatients at several&#xD;
      hospitals will be randomized to usual care versus electronic alerting. Alerting will be&#xD;
      targeted to three specific drug classes: Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory drugs,&#xD;
      Renin/Angiotensin Blockers, and Proton-Pump inhibitors.&#xD;
