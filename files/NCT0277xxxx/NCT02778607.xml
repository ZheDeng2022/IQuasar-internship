    <textblock>
      Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Cortico-Basal Degeneration (CBD) and Multiple System&#xD;
      Atrophy (MSA) are degenerative brain conditions for which there are currently no curative&#xD;
      treatments. To aid the development of new treatment trials, there is a pressing need to&#xD;
      develop better methods for diagnosing these conditions early, and to track disease&#xD;
      progression. The PROSPECT-M-UK study will collect standardised clinical data over time.&#xD;
      Patients will also have the option to have a brain MRI scan, eye movement exam and donate&#xD;
      blood, skin and spinal fluid samples, with the aim to identify &quot;biomarkers&quot; that can improve&#xD;
      the accuracy of early diagnosis and track the natural time course of disease. Control&#xD;
      participants and those not meeting criteria for Parkinson's disease or other defined&#xD;
      conditions but are considered by the investigator group to be allied syndromes or at risk&#xD;
      states (atypical parkinsonian syndromes), will also be examined. Patients can also&#xD;
      participate via the CBD European registry or in a one-off study assessment through the&#xD;
      cross-sectional study, which involves completing questionnaires and a blood sample donation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are a group of neurodegenerative disorders which are often initially diagnosed to be&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD), but which are biologically and clinically distinct, and follow a&#xD;
      malignant disease course. The three most common conditions are PSP, CBD and MSA. These&#xD;
      conditions have a median survival of approximately 6-7 years and unlike PD, do not respond&#xD;
      well to dopamine replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PSP and CBD are characterized by tau-pathology and MSA by alpha-synuclein pathology. A great&#xD;
      deal of pre-clinical work has been carried out on tau and alpha-synuclein disease models, yet&#xD;
      there are no disease modifying agents for these conditions. There are a number of potential&#xD;
      therapeutic compounds in development and in order to improve the likelihood of their success,&#xD;
      there is a pressing need to increase the number of early case patients recruited into these&#xD;
      new treatment trails. Thus, better methods for improved accuracy of early diagnosis and for&#xD;
      tracking progression need to be developed. This can be achieved through:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a detailed study of the change in patients' clinical state over time;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. studying &quot;biomarkers&quot; such as blood, skin, spinal fluid and brain MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit patients with PSP, CBD and MSA who are referred to specialist&#xD;
      clinics for assessment and treatment. An additional group of Atypical parkinsonian syndrome&#xD;
      (APS) cases who do not meet criteria for Parkinson's disease or other defined conditions, but&#xD;
      are considered by the investigator group to be allied syndromes or at risk states will also&#xD;
      be invited to participate in the study. People unaffected by neurological disease will be&#xD;
      invited to participate on a one-off occasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being involved in the PROSPECT-M-UK longitudinal study will involve attending a research&#xD;
      assessment on 5 occasions over 3 years in our natural history cohort, and for 2 occasions&#xD;
      over 2 years for our longitudinal cohort. Study procedures consist of: having a neurological&#xD;
      examination; completing questionnaires to provide details of clinical history, self/carer&#xD;
      reported functional scales and quality of life; neuropsychology assessment; eye movement&#xD;
      exam; donating blood and skin samples; some patients will be invited to have a lumbar&#xD;
      puncture for spinal fluid collection and have a brain MRI scan on two occasions (at baseline&#xD;
      and after 1 year follow-up). Patients can also agree to be contacted by phone or at a clinic&#xD;
      appointment for remote monitoring of symptoms after face to face visits have completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a cross-sectional cohort will be established, to enable participation of&#xD;
      patients who cannot travel to a study centre. This will involve donating blood&#xD;
      samples,returning study questionnaires, and being monitored remotely. A CBD European registry&#xD;
      will also be created which will involve a structured neurological assessment, a medical notes&#xD;
      review and blood sample donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for the study is duration of disease, with the aim to improve methods for&#xD;
      early diagnosis and tracking disease progression. Importantly, the study will link together&#xD;
      centres and researchers from across Europe to establish the infrastructure and create a trial&#xD;
      ready cohort for future therapeutic study into PSP/CBD/MSA.&#xD;
