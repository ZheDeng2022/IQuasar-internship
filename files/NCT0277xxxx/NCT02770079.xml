      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define insulin requirement during pregnancy and to identify the rapid changes in insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity around parturition and the first 6 months post partum. Such knowledge would be&#xD;
      clinically useful and markedly improve insulin treatment before and after parturition for&#xD;
      women with type 1 diabetes and serve to identify the best possible timing of testing women&#xD;
      with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) for the development of type 2 diabetes post partum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botnia clamp in women before, immediately after delivery and 6 months post partum. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare 20 women with GDM in late pregnancy, day 15 post partum and 6&#xD;
      months post partum with 20 normal women investigated at the same time points. In addition the&#xD;
      investigators will collect feces samples from the mother and baby in order to determine&#xD;
      microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is a common condition with important implications for pregnancy outcome and&#xD;
      long-term morbidity for mother and offspring. Accordingly, tailoring the best treatment is&#xD;
      expected to have beneficial consequences both for the pregnant women and the future&#xD;
      generation.&#xD;
