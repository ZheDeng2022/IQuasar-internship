  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Strokes represent, in industrialized countries the leading cause of acquired motor disability&#xD;
      in adults older than 40. Stroke is responsible for France from 150 000 to 200 000 new cases&#xD;
      of hemiplegia each year. These patients will see their deficit to improve during the first 6&#xD;
      months after stroke. This recovery is largely based on brain plasticity mechanisms and the&#xD;
      rehabilitation has as main objective to optimize these mechanisms. However, only 20% of&#xD;
      patients hospitalized in a rehabilitation sector recover a functional upper limb. This lack&#xD;
      of functionality is not only due to overall strength gap but also to the predominance of this&#xD;
      gap on the extension movements of the wrist and fingers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meanwhile, work on brain plasticity helped develop new techniques of non-invasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation (Non-invasive Brain Stimulation, NIBS) as the model of coupled stimulations&#xD;
      (Paired Associative Stimulation, PAS) for modulating way over effective brain plasticity. In&#xD;
      previous studies, the investigators have shown over a 30 minutes session lasting facilitation&#xD;
      (60mn) and specific motor evoked potential (MEP) of the Extensor Carpi Radialis (ECR).&#xD;
      Several studies showed an adjuvant effect when GSIN were associated with learning of a motor&#xD;
      task. For PAS, some studies have shown a greater facilitation when the latter is associated&#xD;
      with muscle contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The motor imagery (MI) is imagining a movement without realizing it, it is based on&#xD;
      mechanisms similar to those of the real movement. This technique also showed its effects as&#xD;
      an adjuvant therapy in hemiplegic patients, however, they remain lower than those obtained&#xD;
      after a motor drive. Its use in patients with no motor makes its uniqueness and strength.&#xD;
