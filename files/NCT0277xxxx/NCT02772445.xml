      The purpose of this study is to refine STROKE-CARE for caregivers and explore changes in&#xD;
      caregiver and care-recipient outcomes&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with disabilities rely heavily on unpaid family caregivers to help perform&#xD;
      necessary occupations. The emotional and physical demands of caregiving often contribute to&#xD;
      caregivers experiencing burden. Caregivers with burden are at-risk for poor health and a&#xD;
      heightened risk of mortality. This is likely, in turn, to negatively impact care-recipient&#xD;
      quality of life. The proposed study refines a behavioral intervention that teaches caregivers&#xD;
      to facilitate problem solving over the course of daily activities. The long-term goal for&#xD;
      this project is to establish an effective rehabilitation intervention that promotes caregiver&#xD;
      health and well-being, which ultimately influences care-recipient health. This study will use&#xD;
      an open-case series and a single-arm clinical trial to refine the intervention and examine&#xD;
      caregiver and care-recipient response to the intervention. This research applies to the&#xD;
      priorities and objectives of this research initiative through examination of a&#xD;
      caregiver-centered, standardized intervention that is based on occupational theories and&#xD;
      principles, investigating outcomes experienced by caregivers of individuals with cognitive&#xD;
      deficits after stroke. Data from this pilot project will be used to design and obtain federal&#xD;
      funding for a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of the refined intervention&#xD;
      on caregiver and care-recipient health outcomes.&#xD;
