  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled dose escalation trial to&#xD;
      evaluate NTM-1632 in three dose cohorts (A: 0.033 mg/kg, B: 0.165 mg/kg, and C: 0.33 mg/kg).&#xD;
      NTM-1632 is a mixture of three monoclonal antibodies designed to treat botulinum neurotoxin&#xD;
      BoNT/B poisoning in adults. Dose cohorts A, B, and C will be randomized 2:6,&#xD;
      placebo:therapeutic, with a total study population of 24. The study duration is projected to&#xD;
      be approximately 8 months, with subject participation in cohort A being approximately 13&#xD;
      weeks, and subject participation in cohort B and C being approximately 17 weeks. The primary&#xD;
      objectives of this study are to assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of&#xD;
      NTM-1632 administered intravenously in healthy adults.&#xD;

      assess the pharmacokinetic characteristics of NTM-1632 following a single intravenous&#xD;
      administration and 2) assess the immunogenicity of NTM-1632 following a single intravenous&#xD;
