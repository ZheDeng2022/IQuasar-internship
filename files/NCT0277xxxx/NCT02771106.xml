      Mild TBI subjects will initially be identified by providers in the Hennepin County Medical&#xD;
      Center (HCMC) TBI Clinic. The subjects will then undergo objective testing by the&#xD;
      developmental optometrist to confirm if they do or do not have vision dysfunction related to&#xD;
      the mTBI. At the Center of Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) located at the University of&#xD;
      Minnesota (U of M), the whole brain will be imaged using resting state and task functional&#xD;
      MRI and diffuse tensor imaging (DTI) using a high field 3 Tesla (T) MRI. The subjects will&#xD;
      then receive neurovision rehabilitation if they are in the vision dysfunction group. This&#xD;
      treatment is standard care. Both groups will then undergo repeat objective vision testing by&#xD;
      the developmental optometrist at 3 and 6 months to confirm that vision dysfunction has&#xD;
      resolved. Resting state and task fMRI and DTI will be done at the same time to compare&#xD;
      functional and structural connectivity changes between the 2 groups.&#xD;

      The primary objectives are: 1) To localize changes following mild traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      (mTBI) in subjects with vision dysfunction using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)&#xD;
      and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). 2) To demonstrate the effectiveness of neuro vision&#xD;
      rehabilitation (NVR) on vision dysfunction initiated within nine months following mTBI by&#xD;
      normalizing objective visual measurements as well as changes on fMRI and DTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mild (TBI) comprises 80% of the 3.65 million brain injuries in the United States and costs an&#xD;
      estimated 17 billion dollars annually. Mild TBI is a challenging diagnosis and can be as&#xD;
      disabling as a severe TBI when chronic symptoms develop. In the past several years,&#xD;
      researchers have found that a somewhat silent majority of mTBI patients who develop lasting&#xD;
      symptoms have concurrent vision dysfunction. This cohort of patients with post-traumatic&#xD;
      visual difficulty, regardless of mechanism of injury, seem to demonstrate more significant&#xD;
      and lasting disability and poorer overall outcome than other TBI cohorts, yet these&#xD;
      correlations have not been adequately studied. The studies that have been performed have&#xD;
      found that visual dysfunctions may not spontaneously improve and become chronic in absence of&#xD;
      direct diagnosis and treatment. Time after injury has been shown in studies to have no&#xD;
      influence on incidence or frequency of visual difficulties but once identified, these&#xD;
      pervasive visual dysfunctions significantly improve in response to interventions such as&#xD;
      prescription glasses and NVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the past 16 months, the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at the University&#xD;
      of Minnesota (U of M) and the TBI Center at the Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) have&#xD;
      closely collaborated in a pilot study. The goal of this study was to identify the location in&#xD;
      the brain of post traumatic visual changes in acute mTBI subjects (&lt; 9 months from injury&#xD;
      date, ages 18-55) using resting state and task fMRI and DTI. Mild TBI subjects who had vision&#xD;
      dysfunction (vision group) were compared to mTBI subjects who did not have any vision&#xD;
      difficulties (controls). Task fMRI imaging demonstrated significant decreased brain activity&#xD;
      in the vision dysfunction subjects as compared to the controls in certain key vision areas.&#xD;
      Diffusion tensor imaging showed significant changes in certain areas of the corpus callosum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is designed as a longitudinal clinical study. Fifteen mTBI patients with vision&#xD;
      dysfunction (vision group) fitting the inclusion/exclusion criteria and 15 patients with mTBI&#xD;
      but with no findings on the visual screen (control group) within 9 months of their injury&#xD;
      will be included in the study. No subject will be excluded on the basis of sex/gender, race&#xD;
      or ethnicity. These mTBI subjects will initially be identified by physicians in the HCMC TBI&#xD;
      Clinic. If agreeable, consent will be obtained at both HCMC as well as prior to their&#xD;
      baseline MRI scans at CMRR. The subjects will then undergo objective testing by a specialized&#xD;
      eye doctor at HCMC to confirm if they do or do not have vision dysfunction related to the&#xD;
      mTBI. At CMRR, within 2 weeks of the visual testing, the whole brain will be imaged using&#xD;
      resting state and task fMRI and DTI using a 3T MRI machine. The subjects will then receive&#xD;
      neurovision rehabilitation for approximately 3 months at HCMC if they are in the vision&#xD;
      group. This treatment is standard care for this population. Both groups will then undergo&#xD;
      repeat objective vision testing by the specialized eye doctor at 3 and 6 months to confirm&#xD;
      that vision dysfunction has resolved. Resting state and task fMRI and DTI will be done at the&#xD;
      same time to compare functional and structural connectivity changes between the 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mild TBI is a significant cause of disability especially when symptoms become chronic. In&#xD;
      HCMC's clinical experience, this chronicity is often linked to vision difficulties. Vision&#xD;
      dysfunction will continue until properly identified and treated, especially with neuro vision&#xD;
      rehabilitation. The goals of this research study are to better understand cerebral structural&#xD;
      and metabolic changes associated with as well as the effectiveness of neuro vision&#xD;
      rehabilitation on post traumatic vision dysfunction by utilizing resting state and task fMRI&#xD;
      and DTI. A positive outcome will have a significant impact on the diagnosis and care of the&#xD;
      considerable numbers of mTBI patients suffering from vision dysfunction, especially because&#xD;
      neurovision rehabilitation will be more utilized by the medical community. In turn, the&#xD;
      overall functional outcomes after mTBI will improve, greatly relieving the suffering and&#xD;
      disability for these patients.&#xD;
