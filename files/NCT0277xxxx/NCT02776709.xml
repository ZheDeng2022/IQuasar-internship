  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cholangioscopy, or direct visualization of the bile ducts was first documented in the late&#xD;
      1970s and has made many advances over the last few decades. The advent of mother-baby scopes&#xD;
      allowed for both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, though the early scopes were often&#xD;
      fragile, and cumbersome due to the need for two endoscopists. Ultraslim endoscopes later&#xD;
      became popular as a method to digitally view the bile ducts, however, often needed guide-wire&#xD;
      or balloon-assistance to allow for cannulation. Other disadvantages of these systems included&#xD;
      limited steerability, and poor irrigation capabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advent of Spyglass, a single-operator peroral cholangioscopy method allowed for a&#xD;
      fiberoptic, catheter-based system that could be easily used for diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      purposes in the biliary system. However, image quality was often lacking due to the&#xD;
      fiberoptic technology. The new digital Spyglass system rectifies this inadequacy by&#xD;
      introducing a digital sensor for better image quality, which will allow for better&#xD;
      visualization and diagnosis of indeterminate strictures. Furthermore, modification of the&#xD;
      scope platform allows for efficient use, reliable directionality of the scope tip, and&#xD;
      improved ease of passage of accessories during therapeutic procedures such clearing stones or&#xD;
      stent placement.&#xD;

      All patients referred for the evaluation of indeterminate strictures or removal of difficult&#xD;
      stones will be eligible for enrollment in the consortium. The PI or study coordinator will&#xD;
      meet with the patient and discuss the study, its objectives, and obligations with each&#xD;
      patient. After full disclosure, informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon consent, basic demographics and data from prior procedures (when available) will be&#xD;
      recorded. An endoscopist proficient in ERCP, with expertise in cholangioscopy, will perform&#xD;
      the procedures using the Spyglass DS system with its associated components including biopsy&#xD;
      forceps (SpyBiteTM) and other accessories as necessary. Procedure time, visual findings,&#xD;
      number of biopsies taken, pathology, stone location, stone size, and method of stone&#xD;
      clearance and adverse events will be recorded on data collection forms and transferred into a&#xD;
      centralized password protected database. All patients will be followed for 6-12 months or&#xD;
      surgery (stricture cohort) to assess accuracy or stone recurrence rates.&#xD;
