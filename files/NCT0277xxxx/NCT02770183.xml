      The rational of the study is the description of the evolution of systolic cardiac function&#xD;
      post-stunning, evaluated by transesophageal minimally invasive echocardiography (hTEE). The&#xD;
      uses of these non-invasive methods have proved to be accurate for the qualitative and&#xD;
      semi-quantitative determination of the contractile function of the left ventricle and the&#xD;
      volume status of the patient. Furthermore the use of this technique has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      be a reliable method to analyze the stunning recovery infarction after controlled cardiac&#xD;
      arrest during the extra-corporeal circulation.&#xD;

      Myocardial stunning is a secondary pathophysiologic condition for a sustained reduction in&#xD;
      myocardial perfusion, which produces kinetic abnormalities in left ventricular wall that&#xD;
      persist for hours or days after the reperfusion phase. The physiological elements of the&#xD;
      stunning are: a) reduction in coronary blood flow, b) a partial or complete restoration of&#xD;
      coronary artery circulation and c) the dysfunction of persistence for a limited period, but&#xD;
      longer compared to recovery coronaire's flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is a leading cause of bewilderment myocardique.&#xD;
      This technique associated with administering a cardioplegic solution used to stop the heart&#xD;
      and myocardial protection on ischemia see myocardique consideration. It typically also&#xD;
      secondary to secondary inflammatory condition in the extracorporeal circulation and the&#xD;
      ischemia-reperfusion phenomenon (formation of free radicals), also with the important&#xD;
      activation coagulation. Myocardial stunning occurs in suites aortic unclamping during&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass. Cold ischemia performed by a cardioplegic liquid at 4 °C results in&#xD;
      reduced energy demands and thus to maintain some balance between metabolism, perfusion and&#xD;
      myocardial function during coronary by-pass. When aortic unclamping, there is usually a pure&#xD;
      myocardial stunning (without necrosis). After the coronary by-pass, the myocardial thickening&#xD;
      fraction is unchanged in the immediate future, but significantly decreased in the hours&#xD;
      before a full recovery between the following hours. In the factors associated with changes in&#xD;
      systolic function, autonomic nervous system is responsible for the regulation of blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart function in response to the stress of the coronary by-pass and the&#xD;
      postoperative state. Reduced variability in heart rate (heart rate variability - HRV) heard&#xD;
      how sign of autonomic dysfunction is also associated with myocardial stunning with a rate of&#xD;
      cardiaque post-surgery complications high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far no group has had the opportunity to study &quot;in vivo&quot; the temporal evolution of&#xD;
      myocardial stunning after the coronary by-pass as an example of myocardial stunning&#xD;
      &quot;controlled&quot; in order to better understand the pathophysiology of 'event. Indeed, the basis&#xD;
      of myocardial function recovery time following coronary by-pass is unknown and the impact of&#xD;
      intraoperative procedures on this recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transesophageal echocardiography, that is the gold standard for assessment of systolic&#xD;
      function, has gradually gained popularity and is used daily in the ICU to evaluate the&#xD;
      patient's hemodynamic status and evaluation of contractile function of the left ventricle to&#xD;
      load. One of its advantages is to measure heart activity at the bedside and assist the&#xD;
      physician in intensive care in the management of hemodynamic acute changes. It also allows&#xD;
      also to analyze the response to treatment defined above. Among the limitations of&#xD;
      transesophageal echocardiography are: the need for intensivists to be relevant to this&#xD;
      technique, the discontinuous nature of the procedure ( &quot;one shot&quot; monitoring) and finally&#xD;
      semi-invasif character that make it difficult 'prolonged and repeated execution of the&#xD;
      various measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent improvement in electronics has enabled the development of miniaturized sensors for&#xD;
      hemodynamic transesophageal echocardiography (ImaCor® ClariTEE®), called hTEE (hemodynamic&#xD;
      trans-esophageal echocardiography), which are used to perform an extended hemodynamic&#xD;
      monitoring ventilated patients; these prototypes are not yet widespread in Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit; their diagnostic capabilities and therapeutic impacts are currently under clinical&#xD;
      research. been studies in the past allowed us to validate the clinical image quality and how&#xD;
      the clinical information obtained are useful for clinical management of patient. In&#xD;
      particular, these studies have demonstrated the ease with which thanks to the small size of&#xD;
      the probe, the feedback of the superior vena cava, the patient's volume status, left&#xD;
      ventricular systolic function based on the Fractional Area Change, the size of the right&#xD;
      ventricle, and a pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade during the first test of&#xD;
      positioning sonde.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantages of continuous Htee of this new technique are related to the small size of the&#xD;
      probe, ease of positioning the probe in the esophagus, the diagnostic reliability and the&#xD;
      ability to stay up to 72 hours because the risk of pressure sores or lesions are comparable&#xD;
      to those of a nasogastric feeding tube (which is the same size). Compared to the conventional&#xD;
      trans-esophageal echocardiography, hTEE offers the advantage of performing continuous&#xD;
      monitoring rather than a case-by case basis. In particular, for the study of post-operative&#xD;
      myocardial stunning, this technique allows for a verification of the time course of&#xD;
      myocardial stunning, and thus describe the pathophysiology and the kinetics of recovery of&#xD;
      left ventricular contractile function. Furthermore this technique provides the means to&#xD;
      identify perioperative factors that can change this recovery (induce or shorten).&#xD;

    <description>Consecutive patients waiting to have elective cardiac surgery will be eligible. Each week the principal investigator will track patients in the operating program. The day of the consultation or the day before the operation, one of the investigators will have a talk with the patient to provide information and clarify doubts, also allowing the patient to read and look good all the details before giving its approval. For the screening, the principal investigator will use the criteria of inclusion and exclusion to select patients for the study. The screening uses clinical, laboratory or without other biological information.&#xD;
To minimize confounding factors, it will be taken consecutive patients, that will also be analyzed regarding all known variables that can affect the systolic function, as non-modifiable (age, cardiovascular risk factors, heart-rate variability and preoperative basal systolic function) and modifiable.</description>

    <description>In ICU, the doctors in charge places the probe in the esophagus, executing a series of morphological evaluations and semi-quantitative evaluations. Each image is saved as a video loop or a static image, to have a basic data for each patient and perform an off-line analysis. At the end of the first recording, the esophageal probe is left in the neutral position in the stomach, to eliminate any risk associated with a local increase of pressure.&#xD;
During the stay in the intensive care unit until the end of the study, the esophageal probe will be left in the neutral position, to run every two hours a new echocardiographic assessment on the main window, similar to the first evaluation, always recording loop-video and photographs, to have a time course of recovery of cardiac contractile function. All images will be stored in a digital archive.</description>
