  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The beneficial effect related to the administration of adipose tissue-derived stromal cells&#xD;
      (ADSC) is demonstrated in various situations of physiological and pathological wound healing,&#xD;
      thus opening a new field for cell therapy. Despite the use of new technologies, management of&#xD;
      burns in children as well as congenital malformation such as hypospadias and cleft lip and/&#xD;
      or cleft palate can lead to aesthetic and functional sequelae requiring multiple surgical&#xD;
      procedures. Cell therapy based on the administration of the ADSC seems a promising issue in&#xD;
      such indications, however, to date no study has been conducted with ADSC from a pediatric&#xD;
      population. An initial study (Protocol 0808203) allowed investigors to obtain the first&#xD;
      samples of adipose tissue from children and to conduct an in vitro comparative study on the&#xD;
      characterization and properties of the ADSC from children compared to adults. In the&#xD;
      continuity, this second study aims to complete knowledge on the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      children ADSC cell therapy assessed in an animal model of skin wound healing developed in the&#xD;
      lab.&#xD;

      Through this study, the medium term objective is to approach a clinical protocol for&#xD;
      treatment of pathological scars in developing an appropriate way to deliver ADSC for a future&#xD;
      clinical application, while ensuring the safety of such procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this work is to determine whether ADSC from children prepared according&#xD;
      to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), is associated with an improvement of wound healing in&#xD;
      vivo as demonstrated with adult ADSC. To answer this question, 40 samples of adipose tissue&#xD;
      of children obtained from settled surgery (inguinal hernia and vesico-ureteral reflux by&#xD;
      suprapubic way) will be performed within the 2 groups of children; 0 to 1 year and 2 to 13&#xD;
      years, defined from data acquired in the previous protocol. Wound healing will be evaluated&#xD;
      in a nude mouse model of skin burn. A macroscopic analysis will be carried out with two&#xD;
      indexes described in the literature (re-epithelialization and scar contraction) and expressed&#xD;
      as a percentage of the initial lesion at different times (3 days, 7 days, 10 days, 14 days,&#xD;
      21 days, 30 days). A microscopic analysis will be conducted to determine the rate of&#xD;
      re-epithelialization (day 7) and the evolution of the skin structural parameters (dermal and&#xD;
      epidermal thickness, density of collagen, inflammatory infiltration). These indexes will be&#xD;
      defined in the treated group (burned mice and injected with pediatric ADSC) from control mice&#xD;
      (burned but not injected with cells). A comparative analysis between the two groups of age&#xD;
      will be conducted that will be also compared to data collected with adult ADSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer to the second part of this primary goal regarding to safety, the study will perform&#xD;
      a long-term follow-up (1 yr) of burned mice injected with of ADSC, to obtain data in the&#xD;
      animal after transplantation of cells and for further clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complementary in vitro investigations still seems necessary to better understand the&#xD;
      specificities of ADSC from pediatric origin and particularly to perform transcriptomic and&#xD;
      epigenetic studies.&#xD;
