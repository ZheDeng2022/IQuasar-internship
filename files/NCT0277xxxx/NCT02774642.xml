    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine whether integrating insomnia and PTSD treatment will enhance&#xD;
      sleep, PTSD, and quality of life outcomes. This is a randomized control trial comparing&#xD;
      integrated evidence based CBT-I into PE (CBTI-PE) versus to a non-active sleep component plus&#xD;
      PE (hygiene-PE) to optimize PTSD, sleep, and quality of life outcomes in 90 Veterans. Such&#xD;
      benefits would further the VA's commitment to improving the mental health, recovery, and&#xD;
      community reintegration of Veterans detailed in the 2014-2020 VHA Strategic Plan. Findings&#xD;
      from the proposed study offer a unique opportunity to determine the malleability of&#xD;
      mechanisms (e.g., Total sleep time, Sleep efficiency) that can improve recovery outcomes&#xD;
      among this vulnerable population and to inform future treatment development and research.&#xD;
      Improved PTSD, insomnia, and quality of life outcomes can decrease risk of chronic impairment&#xD;
      and ultimately help affected Veterans live richer, more productive lives.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The lifetime prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is approximately 30% among&#xD;
      Vietnam Veterans and 11-17% among Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans. PTSD is associated with&#xD;
      enormous health care costs, increased suicidality, depression, poorer quality of life and&#xD;
      functioning, physical health, and increased substance use. Prolonged exposure (PE) is an&#xD;
      efficacious treatment for Veterans with PTSD that decreases avoidance of feared, but safe,&#xD;
      cues. Despite PE being one of the best available treatments for PTSD, 25 to 45% of PTSD&#xD;
      patients still meet diagnostic criteria following treatment. High rates of comorbid&#xD;
      disorders, such as insomnia, may interfere with the efficacy of PE and limit long-term&#xD;
      rehabilitation outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among Veterans with PTSD, sleep disturbances are nearly universal with 70 - 87% reporting&#xD;
      comorbid insomnia. Untreated insomnia can persist for years, is independently associated with&#xD;
      impaired health-related quality of life, does not resolve following PTSD treatment, and can&#xD;
      exacerbate daytime PTSD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, insomnia may interfere with the mechanisms of PE through safety learning,&#xD;
      habituation to feared stimuli, emotional coping, emotional processing, and cognitive&#xD;
      abilities necessary for successful treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this, insomnia is not a primary intervention for Veterans with PTSD. Given these&#xD;
      factors, it is critical to evaluate whether treating insomnia prior to PTSD will improve PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms and quality of life outcomes. Cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I) is&#xD;
      the first line treatment of chronic and severe insomnia, which produces lasting improvements&#xD;
      in sleep. By using CBT-I prior to, and integrated with, PE offers several novel advantages&#xD;
      that will: 1) increase client-centered treatment by addressing the number one subjective&#xD;
      complaint among Veterans with PTSD; 2) enhance PTSD outcomes and non-response rates by&#xD;
      addressing insomnia-related factors that interfere with PTSD treatment; 3) act as a stepping&#xD;
      stone and help to engage patients who are not initially willing to engage in trauma-focused&#xD;
      PE; 4) increase rehabilitation outcomes by addressing the two leading disorders that&#xD;
      independently affect quality of life for Veterans; 5) allow patients to address both symptoms&#xD;
      of insomnia and PTSD within a shortened timeframe; 6) increase continuity by allowing&#xD;
      patients to work with a single provider; and 7) decrease the risk of attrition between&#xD;
      referral clinics and waitlists. To date, no studies have capitalized on available&#xD;
      evidence-based CBT-I prior to PE to improve insomnia, PTSD, and quality of life outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>Integrates CBT-I and PE with the goal of enhancing both insomnia and PTSD outcomes. Integrated treatment will be delivered in 14 90-minute weekly sessions. CBTI-PE starts with VA rollout CBT-I for the first 3 weeks with a focus on the effects of PTSD on insomnia. PE protocol (psychoeducation) begins on week 4 of treatment and both treatments overlap till week 6 when CBT-I ends and the active treatment of PE begins (i.e., imaginal and in-vivo exposures). However, CBT-I sleep diary review and sleep time adjustment will continue till the end of treatment to increase adherence</description>

    <description>The investigators have included a non-active sleep control arm (3 Sessions)to allow for the dose response of 14 90 minute sessions. The non-active sleep control condition used in this study is a manualized protocol developed to exclude the active components of standard CBT-I treatment. Hygiene includes presentation of sleep hygiene education and reviewing daily stressors that may impact sleep before starting PE on week 4.</description>
