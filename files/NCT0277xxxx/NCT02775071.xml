    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the relationship between psychopathology, disordered eating, and&#xD;
      impulsivity (measured by clinical interview, self-report measures, and objective testing) on&#xD;
      changes in weight and psychosocial status in the first two years after bariatric surgery.&#xD;
      Participants will be 300 adults who plan to undergo bariatric surgery. Participants will&#xD;
      complete four assessments over a two-year period, one at baseline (before surgery) and 6, 12,&#xD;
      and 24 months after surgery. Each assessment will include computer tasks, surveys, clinical&#xD;
      interview, urine test, waist circumference and height/weight measurement. The investigators&#xD;
      will track how psychopathology, disordered eating, and impulsivity are related to changes in&#xD;
      weight and psychosocial status following bariatric surgery.&#xD;

      Psychosocial Status and Psychopathology in Candidates for Bariatric Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extreme obesity is associated with a signiﬁcant psychosocial burden, including impairments in&#xD;
      quality of life, body image, sexual behavior and other areas of psychosocial functioning.&#xD;
      While this distress is believed to contribute to the decision to have bariatric surgery, its&#xD;
      impact on postoperative outcomes is less clear. At present, little is known about the&#xD;
      physiological and behavioral contributions to success or failure of bariatric surgery.&#xD;
      Regardless, weight regain after bariatric surgery is frequently attributed to preoperative&#xD;
      psychosocial and behavioral factors. More speciﬁcally, there has been a great deal of&#xD;
      interest in the presence of formal psychopathology in bariatric surgery patients and its&#xD;
      potential contribution to postoperative outcomes. At least six studies have described rates&#xD;
      of psychopathology in candidates for bariatric surgery using structured diagnostic&#xD;
      instruments. Lifetime rates of any psychiatric diagnoses ranged from 36.8%-72.6%, higher than&#xD;
      those reported in most studies of the general population. Mood disorders were the most&#xD;
      frequent diagnoses, seen in 22.0%-54.8% of patients. Substance use disorders (SUDs) were&#xD;
      found in up to 35.7% of patients and alcohol abuse or dependence in up to 33.2%. Binge eating&#xD;
      disorder (BED), deﬁned as eating an unusually large amount of food within a short period of&#xD;
      time coupled with a loss of control over eating, has been diagnosed in 4.6% to 27.1% of&#xD;
      patients. Current diagnoses (as compared with lifetime) were less common, reported in&#xD;
      20.9%-55.5% of candidates for surgery. Mood disorders were diagnosed in up to 31.5%. BED&#xD;
      ranged from 3.4%-41.9%. Current substance use was seen in less than 2% of patients. (Note.&#xD;
      The lower percentages of those with current psychopathology, as opposed to lifetime&#xD;
      psychopathology, are expected.) While studies of the psychosocial characteristics of&#xD;
      bariatric surgery candidates have been informative, they are not without limitations. Many&#xD;
      studies have suffered from methodological concerns, including small sample sizes or lack of&#xD;
      an appropriate comparison group. Further, establishing psychiatric diagnoses prior to&#xD;
      bariatric surgery is challenging. Perioperative guidelines suggest that patients undergo an&#xD;
      evaluation with a mental health professional prior to surgery and most third party payers&#xD;
      require these evaluations. However, most programs do not use structured clinical interviews&#xD;
      to establish diagnoses for clinical purposes. Several studies have suggested that candidates&#xD;
      for bariatric surgery engage in impression management prior to surgery, in which they&#xD;
      minimize reports of psychopathology to present themselves to the bariatric team in the most&#xD;
      favorable light. To address this issue, assessment of psychiatric symptoms for research&#xD;
      purposes is recommended to occur independently from the required clinical evaluation, as the&#xD;
      investigators will do in the proposed study. Nevertheless, studies focusing on the&#xD;
      relationship between speciﬁc diagnoses and postoperative outcomes may fail to account for&#xD;
      other psychological constructs that may be shared across diagnoses. Mood disorders, BED, and&#xD;
      SUDs all share the common psychological construct of impulsivity, considered an important&#xD;
      aspect of executive functioning. A lack of impulse control may contribute to the excessive&#xD;
      weight gain seen in extreme obesity and may impact the results of bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disinhibition and Impulsivity among Persons with Extreme Obesity; Studies have suggested that&#xD;
      individuals with obesity, and in particular those with extreme obesity presenting for&#xD;
      bariatric surgery, show some deﬁcits in executive functioning. For example, candidates for&#xD;
      bariatric surgery have shown deﬁcits in working memory, mental ﬂexibility, motor speed and&#xD;
      complex attention.These deﬁcits could impact comprehension and retention of information&#xD;
      presented to patients during the preoperative consultation process and, thus, negatively&#xD;
      impact the ability to adhere to the dietary and behavioral changes required for an optimal&#xD;
      postoperative outcome. At the same time, metabolic dysregulation, such as insulin resistance&#xD;
      or hyperglycemeia seen in type 2 diabetes, also is associated with cognitive deﬁcits,&#xD;
      suggesting a potential physiological mechanism for the relationship. Dietary disinhibition,&#xD;
      deﬁned as a loss of control over eating, plays a central role in the overconsumption of food&#xD;
      and, subsequently, the development of obesity. Disinhibition is similar to impulsivity, the&#xD;
      term more commonly used in the substance use and smoking cessation literatures. Impulsivity&#xD;
      is a multi-faceted construct and refers to the absence of the ability to inhibit an automatic&#xD;
      behavior (otherwise known as response inhibition) and the tendency to discount future&#xD;
      consequences in favor of more immediate outcomes (known as delay discounting). Similar to the&#xD;
      role of disinhibition in obesity, impulsivity contributes to the development of and relapse&#xD;
      with SUDs. Indeed, response inhibition and delay discounting are associated with both SUDs&#xD;
      and obesity. Both also predict response to treatment for both SUDs and obesity. Chronic&#xD;
      overeating and binge eating share several neurobiological and behavioral similarities with&#xD;
      SUDs. In this regard, both may be viewed as behavioral disorders, in which intake (of food,&#xD;
      alcohol, and/or drugs) escalates to a rate that is unhealthy and maladaptive. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      the speciﬁc nature of the relationship between binge eating and substance use remains to be&#xD;
      fully elucidated. There are similarities between binge eating and addictive disorders,&#xD;
      including craving for the desired substance (drug or highly palatable food), a sense of loss&#xD;
      of control when using, repeated attempts to control use despite clear adverse consequences,&#xD;
      and the dedication of much time in obtaining and using the substance. Thus, the disinhibition&#xD;
      observed with obesity and binge eating, the impulsivity seen with substance use disorders,&#xD;
      and the emotional dysregulation associated with mood disorders all likely share commonalities&#xD;
      that may both contribute to the development of extreme obesity and also may be associated&#xD;
      with weight loss and changes in psychosocial status after bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychosocial Status and Psychopathology after Bariatric Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, individuals who undergo bariatric surgery report dramatic improvements in&#xD;
      psychosocial status and functioning postoperatively. The vast majority of patients report&#xD;
      signiﬁcant reductions in symptoms of depression and anxiety in the ﬁrst postoperative year.&#xD;
      They also report signiﬁcant improvements in health and weight-related quality of life.&#xD;
      Patients also report improvements in body image, sexual functioning, and relationship&#xD;
      satisfaction. The relationship between preoperative psychopathology and postoperative&#xD;
      outcomes is less robust. Livhits and colleagues reviewed this literature and concluded that&#xD;
      the preoperative factors of BMI, BED, and the presence of personality disorders provided the&#xD;
      strongest negative associations with postoperative weight loss. At least two studies have&#xD;
      suggested that preoperative psychopathology, particularly mood and anxiety disorders, is&#xD;
      associated with smaller weight postoperative weight losses. The relationship between BED and&#xD;
      postoperative weight loss is unclear; some studies have found a relationship between&#xD;
      preoperative BED and postoperative weight loss while others have not. Additionally, two&#xD;
      studies have suggested that a history of substance abuse is associated with larger weight&#xD;
      losses following bariatric surgery. The interpretation of this counterintuitive ﬁnding is&#xD;
      that the self-regulation skills that help patients maintain their sobriety also help patients&#xD;
      adhere to the demands of the recommended postoperative diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disinhibition and Impulsivity following Bariatric Surgery Encouragingly, studies have shown&#xD;
      that there are improvements in executive functioning in persons with extreme obesity in the&#xD;
      ﬁrst two years after bariatric surgery. Postoperatively, patients typically report decreases&#xD;
      in disinhibition and hunger, as well as increases in cognitive restraint. The physical&#xD;
      aspects of bariatric surgery typically prevent individuals from eating the objectively large&#xD;
      amount of food necessary to meet the diagnostic criteria of BED. However, many individuals&#xD;
      continue to report the feeling of loss of control over their eating.The self-reported&#xD;
      inability to control these impulses postoperatively is associated with smaller weight losses&#xD;
      and greater emotional distress in the ﬁrst few postoperative years. There is additional&#xD;
      evidence that patients have difﬁculty with impulse control after surgery. A number of studies&#xD;
      have suggested that there is an increased risk of substance abuse following bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. King and colleagues, in their seminal investigation, found an increased rate of&#xD;
      alcohol use disorder in the second postoperative year as compared to the year prior to&#xD;
      surgery or in the ﬁrst postoperative year. Other recent studies also have found increases in&#xD;
      alcohol or composite substance abuse (drug, alcohol, or cigarettes) in the ﬁrst two years&#xD;
      after bariatric surgery. Postoperative substance use has been associated with smaller&#xD;
      postoperative weight losses, postoperative nocturnal eating, and subjective hunger. Patients&#xD;
      at greatest risk for new onset SUDs were more likely to report problems with high sugar/low&#xD;
      fat food before surgery, further suggesting the role of impulsivity in eating behavior and&#xD;
      substance use before and after surgery. This increase in substance abuse after surgery has&#xD;
      been described as addiction transfer and characterized as a modern example of symptom&#xD;
      substitution in which abuse of one substance (food) is replaced by another (alcohol or drugs)&#xD;
      when patients are unable to consume large amounts of food after surgery. A potential&#xD;
      contributor to addiction transfer may be emotional dysregulation. In general, symptoms of&#xD;
      depression typically improve within the ﬁrst six months of bariatric surgery as patients are&#xD;
      in the period of most rapid weight loss. Within the ﬁrst two postoperative years, the use of&#xD;
      anti-depressant medications also decreases; however, a substantial minority of patients&#xD;
      report using these medications two years after surgery. As most patients begin to regain&#xD;
      weight postoperatively, they also experience an erosion of the improvements in depressive&#xD;
      symptoms and quality of life. In addition, a higher-than-expected number of postoperative&#xD;
      suicides have been documented. A secondary aim of the proposed study will investigate the&#xD;
      relationship between changes in weight during the ﬁrst two postoperative years and changes in&#xD;
      psychosocial status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed observational study will evaluate the relationship between measures of&#xD;
      psychopathology, disordered eating, and impulsivity, (each assessed preoperatively and in the&#xD;
      early postoperative period) and changes in weight and psychosocial status in the first two&#xD;
      years after bariatric surgery. All participants will complete assessments at baseline (before&#xD;
      surgery) and at 6, 12, and 24 months follow-up. Secondary aims will examine psychopathology,&#xD;
      disordered eating, impulsivity, as well as weight loss, in relation to changes in eating&#xD;
      behavior, physical activity, psychosocial status, and substance use in the first two years&#xD;
      after bariatric surgery. The study has one specific aim and two secondary aims.&#xD;
