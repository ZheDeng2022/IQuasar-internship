      Due to its localization in the cerebello-pontine angle, the vestibulo-cochlear nerve is at&#xD;
      risk to damage during surgery performed nearby. In most cases, peripheral-cochleovestibular&#xD;
      hypofunction recovers over the following weeks as the mechanism of damage is rather&#xD;
      demyelination than axonal damage. The rate, intensity and extent of recovery of such&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Due to its localization in the cerebello-pontine angle, the vestibulo-cochlear nerve is at&#xD;
      risk to damage during surgery performed nearby, e.g. when removing an epidermoid cyst,&#xD;
      treating a neuro-vascular conflict of the trigeminal nerve or resecting a petroclival&#xD;
      meningeoma. Intense vertigo and dizziness accompanied by spontaneous nystagmus following&#xD;
      Alexander's law, nausea and gait imbalance may be noted in these patients along with cochlear&#xD;
      hypofunction (hearing loss). In most cases, peripheral-cochleovestibular hypofunction&#xD;
      recovers over the following weeks as the mechanism of damage is rather demyelination than&#xD;
      axonal damage. The rate, intensity and extent of recovery of such perioperative&#xD;
      peripheral-vestibular damage is not known. Besides peripheral-vestibular hypofunction,&#xD;
      transient cerebellar hypofunction may arise, presenting with similar complaints (vertigo,&#xD;
      nausea, gait imbalance), however, distinct subtle ocular motor findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to characterize the frequency and pattern of iatrogenic&#xD;
      peripheral-vestibular and cochlear hypofunction and to follow-up on the speed and extent of&#xD;
      recovery. The investigators hypothesize that peripheral-vestibular and cochlear damage may be&#xD;
      observed in a significant fraction of neurosurgical treatments in the posterior fossa&#xD;
      including the cerebello-pontine angle. While initially deficits may be major, recovery is&#xD;
      expected to be substantial or even complete due to peripheral restoration. As an important&#xD;
      differential diagnosis, the investigators will evaluate also for potential (transient)&#xD;
      cerebellar loss of function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to quantify peripheral-vestibular function the investigators will use a CE-certified&#xD;
      videooculography device to record responses to the head-impulse test before and in the days&#xD;
      following elective skull base surgery. the video-head impulse test (vHIT) allows a&#xD;
      quantitative video-based assessment of the functional integrity of all semicircular canals&#xD;
      (MacDougall et al. 2013). By use of a high-speed video-camera mounted on goggles this test&#xD;
      quantifies the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), which is the fastest human reflex and allows&#xD;
      the recognition and visual fixation of objects while head turns or ambulation. This test is&#xD;
      used on a routine basis in our clinic and includes brief and fast, but small amplitude head&#xD;
      turns (10-15° excursion) in the planes of the different semi-circular canals (SCCs). The SCCs&#xD;
      are tested in three pairs in the horizontal, RALP (right anterior, left posterior) and LARP&#xD;
      (left anterior, right posterior) plane (Weber et al. 2008). During testing the participant is&#xD;
      asked to fixate a visual target straight ahead. Duration of this test: about 15 minutes.&#xD;
