  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the Carboxipeptidase D (CPD) genotyping as&#xD;
      a predictive biomarker of body weight and/or fat mass reduction in obese patients treated&#xD;
      with perindopril.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is nonclinical and clinical evidence that a subgroup of human subjects may present a&#xD;
      decrease in body weight and/or fat mass following treatment with perindopril. Although the&#xD;
      individual characteristics that determine such effect are still unknown, Gene PreDiT SA&#xD;
      (Biocant Park, Cantanhede, Portugal) discovered that certain genetic characteristics (e.g.,&#xD;
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CPD gene) may play a role and potentially could&#xD;
      serve as a potential predictive biomarker of response to perindopril.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These promising results, along with the fact that perindopril is a medicine already in use in&#xD;
      clinical practice, led Gene PreDiT SA to decide to proceed with the development of a&#xD;
      theranostic approach for the treatment of obesity. Such theranostic approach consists on the&#xD;
      use of CPD genotyping to identify obese subjects that could present improved body weight and&#xD;
      fat mass reduction following treatment with perindopril.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current clinical trial aims to prove the concept and provide data to design further&#xD;
      confirmatory studies. Additionally this study will evaluate the association between CPD SNPs&#xD;
      genotypes and response to perindopril; the effect of perindopril in waist circumference,&#xD;
      waist/hip ratio, and BMI and the tolerability and safety of perindopril in the study&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 periods and 4 visits (V): a run-in period of at least 4 weeks (V1 to&#xD;
      V2) and a 12-week perindopril treatment period (V2 to V4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After written informed consent, patients will undergo screening evaluations (V1). Patients&#xD;
      who meet the selection criteria will enter a run-in period of 4 weeks where they will be&#xD;
      given dietary and exercise counseling as standardized non-drug therapy. After the run-in&#xD;
      period (V2), patients will start the pharmacological therapy period where they will receive&#xD;
      perindopril 8 mg, once daily, for 12 weeks, concomitantly with the previously established&#xD;
      standardized non-drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 12-week pharmacological treatment, patients will attend an intermediate study&#xD;
      visit (V3) at approximately 6 weeks and a final visit (V4) for efficacy and safety&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumference, and body fat mass estimation&#xD;
      will be assessed at every study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 160 subjects will be enrolled, to have approximately 120 subjects evaluable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After V2, patients will be administered perindopril 8 mg, once daily, for 12 weeks,&#xD;
      concomitantly with the previously established standardized non-pharmacological therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling for clinical safety laboratory assessments (hematology and plasma&#xD;
      biochemistry) will be collected at the screening, at the end of the run-in period, at the&#xD;
      intermediate treatment visit, and at the end of the perindopril treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the screening, blood will also be collected for CPD genotyping, but the results will&#xD;
      remain blinded until database closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be evaluated through the assessment of treatment-emergent adverse events, vital&#xD;
      signs and clinical laboratory tests. Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
      Vital signs will be recorded at each scheduled visit. Clinical safety laboratory parameters&#xD;
      will be collected at screening, end of the run-in period, at the intermediate treatment&#xD;
      visit, and at the end of the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abnormalities in vital signs and laboratory parameters will be assessed by the clinical&#xD;
      investigator in terms of clinical relevance. Clinically significant abnormalities in clinical&#xD;
      laboratory and vital signs will be reported as adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associations between CPD SNPs genotypes and patient response will be assessed through the&#xD;
      appropriate statistical methods. The primary efficacy analysis will compare the response rate&#xD;
      in the group of subjects with the SNPs of interest and the group of the remaining subjects. A&#xD;
      logistic regression model will be used to assess the group differences. Weight and fat mass&#xD;
      at the start of the perindopril treatment period and gender will be used as covariates. Other&#xD;
      covariates will be investigated for exploratory purposes, but will not be included in the&#xD;
      model where main treatment effects are tested and compared. All the secondary efficacy&#xD;
      endpoints will be assessed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). In general, the principles&#xD;
      applied for the primary efficacy analysis will be replicated for the secondary efficacy&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be tabulated and summarized according to system organ class (SOC) and&#xD;
      preferred term (PT).&#xD;
