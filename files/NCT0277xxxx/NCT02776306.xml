  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of mirror box therapy on upper&#xD;
      extremity, motor recovery and motor functioning in patients that have suffered a stroke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arm and hand weakness as a result of stroke occurs in approximately 70% of stroke survivors,&#xD;
      with 30%-60% of patients being unable to fully recover functional use of their upper limbs.&#xD;
      As recovery may be due to insufficient or inadequate therapeutic interventions, the progress&#xD;
      and evaluation of upper limb treatment is currently being investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mirror Box therapy is a task orientated, non-invasive, economic and patient directed therapy&#xD;
      for hemiparetic upper limb post stroke patients. The study is intended to evaluate cerebral&#xD;
      reorganization by using mirror therapy. Movements of the stronger limb trick the brain into&#xD;
      thinking that the weaker arm is moving and to stimulate the respective brain areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are enrolled into two groups using standard upper limb rehabilitation for three&#xD;
      weeks followed by standard rehabilitation plus Mirror Box for another three weeks (Group 1).&#xD;
      Group 2 will receive the same therapy in inverted order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive clinical and functional assessment at baseline, three weeks and six&#xD;
      weeks including brain MRI using functional resting state MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is functional connectivity (correlation coefficient) at baseline and&#xD;
      after treatment. Secondary endpoints include motor and functional recovery using outcome&#xD;
      measures like Fugl Meyer assessment, Action Research Arm Test, grip and pincer strength.&#xD;
      Further secondary endpoints are increase in sensorimotor cortex activation across the period&#xD;
      of therapy and cortical reorganization.&#xD;
