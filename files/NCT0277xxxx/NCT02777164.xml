    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of cancer detection when&#xD;
      MIRA technology is combined with mammography, by evaluating the area under the ROC curve&#xD;
      (AUC) of mammography vs. mammography plus MIRA. This evaluation will be done in a Reader&#xD;
      Study on a subset of women with histology confirmed cancer and healthy women with dense&#xD;
      breast.&#xD;
