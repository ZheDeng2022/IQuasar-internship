  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to further validate the CDT as a screening tool for identifying&#xD;
      elderly cancer patients in need of a more in-depth cognitive evaluation within comprehensive&#xD;
      geriatric assessment (CGA) and to validate the pre-defined cut-off score of ≤ 4 according to&#xD;
      the Freund scoring system. All geriatric patients that are diagnosed with cancer will be&#xD;
      screened by the oncology clinical nurse specialists attached to the respective&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary clinics with the VES-13 and G8 questionnaire. Patients that screen&#xD;
      positive, will be offered referral to the multi-disciplinary onco-geriatric program where a&#xD;
      member of the research team will implement a full geriatric evaluation under supervision of&#xD;
      the medical oncologist and/or geriatrician who will then formulate recommendations and might&#xD;
      suggest referral to other health care providers. Individual results and survival data of all&#xD;
      the patients that have given their informed consent will be registered in a database.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      In this trial the investigators aim to establish whether Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT)&#xD;
      can reduce cognitive complaints in cancer survivors. All consenting patients aged 18 years or&#xD;
      above, who have been diagnosed with a solid tumour of hematologic malignancy and who have&#xD;
      completed or are in the late phase of a chemotherapy, radiotherapy, anti-hormonal or targeted&#xD;
      therapy treatment, can participate in this trial. Patients should suffer from subjective&#xD;
      cognitive complaints based on a score of 43 or more on the Cognitive Failure Questionnaire&#xD;
      (CFQ). These patients will be randomly assigned to either the control or intervention group.&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention group will be scheduled to receive an 8-week EFT intervention&#xD;
      program. Other patients will be placed on an 8-week wait list after which patients will also&#xD;
      start the EFT program.&#xD;
