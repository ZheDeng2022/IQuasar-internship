  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      L-theanine and caffeine are nutritional compounds that are naturally found in tea. Our recent&#xD;
      findings using an EEG paradigm are consistent with the findings of others, indicating that&#xD;
      intake of L-theanine and caffeine reduce the time needed for a person to differentiate&#xD;
      between two visual stimuli and react to only one stimulus. In order to understand how these&#xD;
      compounds give rise to these improvements, the investigators need to study how these&#xD;
      compounds are related to various areas of the brain. To achieve this, the investigators plan&#xD;
      to scan the brains of nine participants after they take either 1) L-theanine alone, 2)&#xD;
      caffeine alone 3) the combination of both L-theanine and caffeine as compared with a placebo&#xD;
      (distilled water), to see which has the greatest impact on attention and on regions in the&#xD;
      brain that bring about attention.&#xD;

      Recruitment: Participants will be recruited through advertisements in social media,&#xD;
      electronic and hardcopy noticeboards at Texas Tech University (e.g. Tech Announce, campus&#xD;
      bulletin boards), local media (e.g. newspapers), web-based media (e.g. Craig's list) and&#xD;
      flyers placed on bulletin boards off campus. Nine participants will be recruited after&#xD;
      screening for the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Screening (Telephone): Individuals who express an interest in participating will be&#xD;
      contacted by a graduate or an undergraduate research assistant who will administer a&#xD;
      structured telephone interview to: 1) provide information related to the requirements of the&#xD;
      study, along with potential risks and benefits 2) Screen for eligibility based on specific&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. All potential subjects will be informed that their&#xD;
      responses will remain confidential and that taking part in the screening interview in no way&#xD;
      obligates them to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 9 participants who meet eligibility criteria will be scheduled for their&#xD;
      appointments (at Texas Tech Neuroimaging Institute; TTNI) immediately or within 48 hours of&#xD;
      the telephone conversation depending on the discretion of each potential participant. Each&#xD;
      participant will be required to complete 5 visits to TTNI, scheduled at least 5 days apart,&#xD;
      in order to complete their participation in the study. The first visit will be 45 minutes in&#xD;
      length and each of the 4 subsequent visits will be 90 minutes in length. The participants&#xD;
      will be given the right to withdraw from the study at any point. In the event that a screened&#xD;
      and included participant should discontinue the study prematurely, additional subjects will&#xD;
      be recruited to maintain study total at 9 completers. Since the study is a cross-over design,&#xD;
      all participants will be exposed to all experimental conditions (i.e. theanine, caffeine, TC&#xD;
      and distilled water) in a random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recognition Visual Reaction Time (RVRT) Task: Participants will be instructed on the&#xD;
           importance of accuracy in performing the RVRT task in advance. A blue-colored background&#xD;
           will be presented. Participants will be requested to press a button on a computer&#xD;
           keyboard (during practice sessions) and on a fiber optic hand-held device during active&#xD;
           testing sessions (in the fMRI scanner) using the index finger of the dominant hand in&#xD;
           response to a white flash lasting for 30ms (target stimulus) as quickly as possible,&#xD;
           while ignoring a red colored flash lasting for 30ms (distractor stimulus). During each&#xD;
           run, 20±2 stimuli of each category of stimuli will be presented and the inter-stimulus&#xD;
           interval will be jittered to 5000ms±3000ms. Time taken to respond to target stimuli will&#xD;
           be recorded as RVRT. Omissions and responses to distractor stimuli (errors) will also be&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Scanning paradigm: Each scanning session will be scheduled for 20 minutes, comprised of&#xD;
           3 runs of fMRI scans while the participants are performing the RVRT tasks displayed on&#xD;
           an LCD screen and projected via a mirror attached to the head coil of the fMRI machine&#xD;
           (each run lasting for 4 minutes) followed by a structural (T1-weighted) scan lasting for&#xD;
           5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Protocol: All recruited participants will be scheduled for 5 visits at the&#xD;
      TTNI within 48 hours of receipt and subsequent evaluation of the prescreening material for&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants will be reminded of the visits via email /&#xD;
      telephone (per their stated preference) at both 1 week and again 1 day prior to each visit.&#xD;
      The visits will be scheduled at least 5 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First Visit: Prescreening, Consent and Training:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The study will be explained thoroughly to reinforce prior explanations and ensure&#xD;
                full understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Participants will be screened again to verify the inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
                by re-administering the screening questionnaire and MRI safety sheet by a member of&#xD;
                the BMTR lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Informed written consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. A participant number will be assigned, that identifies the order of administration&#xD;
                of the four substances (i.e. theanine, caffeine, TC and placebo) during the&#xD;
                subsequent visits. This order will be determined using a random number generator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Each participant will be provided with a solution of 160mg of caffeine dissolved in&#xD;
                200ml of distilled water in a disposable, clean, opaque, plastic cup to be consumed&#xD;
                completely within 1 minute, in order to train the participants to consume required&#xD;
                substances during the subsequent visits and to ensure that the participants can&#xD;
                tolerate the mildly bitter taste of the substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. In order to acclimate the participants to the RVRT task they will be performing in&#xD;
                the MRI scanner during their subsequent visits, each participant will perform a&#xD;
                training session where they will perform the RVRT task in three 5 min sessions,&#xD;
                separated by 60 second rest intervals using a laptop computer (under the&#xD;
                supervision of a graduate / undergraduate research assistants).&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Each participant will be reminded of the subsequent visits and the importance of&#xD;
                adherence to the preparation guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preparation and Administration of Substances: L-theanine and caffeine will be purchased&#xD;
           in purified powder form from a registered supplier. Both substances will be stored in&#xD;
           air-tight packing prior to preparation for administration according to manufacturer's&#xD;
           recommendations. All solutions will be prepared for administration maintaining the&#xD;
           highest possible standards of hygiene. Each solution of L-theanine will be made by&#xD;
           dissolving 200mg of theanine powder in 200ml of distilled water. Each solution of&#xD;
           caffeine will be made by dissolving 160mg of caffeine powder. Both L-theanine and&#xD;
           caffeine powder (200mg and 160mg respectively) will be dissolved in a 200ml aliquot of&#xD;
           distilled water to form each solution of TC. Two-hundred milliliters of distilled water&#xD;
           will be used as the placebo. Each solution will be prepared within 4 hours of scheduled&#xD;
           time of administration and stored in a disposable, clean, opaque, cup with a lid. The&#xD;
           participants will be instructed to consume the solution completely upon administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Preparation of participants for the Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Visits: All&#xD;
           recruited participants will be instructed to strictly adhere to the following guidelines&#xD;
           prior to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th visits in order to minimize confounding of the&#xD;
           results.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Avoid consumption of alcohol within 48 hours prior to the test&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Avoid smoking 12 hours prior to the test&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Sleep for at least 6 hours on the day prior to the test dates&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Avoid consumption of tea, coffee or foods / beverages containing caffeine within 12&#xD;
                hours prior to the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Visits: Administration of Substances and MRI Scanning:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Participants will be briefly reminded of the purpose of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Adherence to the preparation guidelines will be assessed. Should a participant&#xD;
                indicate non-adherence to preparation guidelines they will be discontinued from the&#xD;
                study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The solution (containing the appropriate substance / combination of substances) to&#xD;
                be administered to each participant during the visit will be provided in a&#xD;
                disposable, clean, cup to be consumed within 1 minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. A questionnaire regarding the taste and characteristics of the solution will be&#xD;
                administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Each participant will be given a verbal review of the RVRT task and will be allowed&#xD;
                to practice the RVRT task on a laptop computer for 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Each participant will be allowed to relax, seated in a comfortable chair, until 60&#xD;
                minutes elapses from the time of administration of the solution (to allow time for&#xD;
                the actions of L-theanine and caffeine on the brain to reach the maximum levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Combined functional and structural MRI scans will be performed while the&#xD;
                participants engage in the RVRT tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Visual analogue scales (100mm lines with the extremes of the measured parameter&#xD;
                listed at each end; the participant rates the measured parameter by making a&#xD;
                vertical mark on the line) will be administered to measure the perceived&#xD;
                improvement / deterioration of RVRT and perceived improvement / deterioration of&#xD;
                accuracy in the tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. At the end of the 5th visit, each participant will be debriefed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: RVRT will be compared across the four conditions (theanine, caffeine, TC and&#xD;
      placebo) constructing a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) model using the&#xD;
      R-statistical software. Subsequently, pair-wise comparisons of RVRT will be performed between&#xD;
      the four conditions, maintaining the family-wise error rate at 0.05. Following sequence of&#xD;
      operations will be conducted on the fMRI data using the FMRIB software library (FSL): visual&#xD;
      examination, distortion correction, motion correction, slice timing correction, spatial&#xD;
      smoothing and statistical analysis. BOLD responses will be compared across the four&#xD;
      conditions by constructing ANOVA models at a whole brain level as well as in the regions of&#xD;
      anterior cingulate cortex and antero-medial prefrontal cortex. Pair-wise comparisons of BOLD&#xD;
      responses will also be conducted between the conditions. RVRT, omissions and errors will be&#xD;
      included as covariates in fMRI analysis.&#xD;
