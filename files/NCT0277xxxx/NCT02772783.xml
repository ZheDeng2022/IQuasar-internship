  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Processed carbohydrates cause rapid changes in blood sugar and have been associated with&#xD;
      overeating and obesity. We have shown that test meals high in processed carbohydrate affect&#xD;
      brain areas involved in addiction, craving and overeating. It is unknown whether the changes&#xD;
      in blood sugar or the associated higher insulin levels mediate this brain activation and its&#xD;
      likely adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Answering this question is important for patients with type 1 diabetes who have elevated&#xD;
      risks of obesity and disordered eating: If blood sugar is the causal mechanism, optimal&#xD;
      insulin coverage should be protective. If insulin is the causal mechanism, however, a diet&#xD;
      high in processed carbohydrate could predispose to overeating and weight gain, as this diet&#xD;
      requires higher insulin doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To disentangle these factors, we will study brain activation and relevant blood markers in 15&#xD;
      men with diabetes. In 4 sessions, we will examine meals with differential carbohydrate&#xD;
      properties while giving insulin infusions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 15 male participants (age 18-45) with T1DM will be recruited. Participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study for a total of 1-3 months, and participate in a pre-test visit and&#xD;
      three test visits, each after a 10-12-hr overnight fast. Participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      consume their regular, weight maintaining diet between visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the pre-test visit, the study director or PI will meet participants, confirm eligibility&#xD;
      and obtain informed consent. Participants will receive a low glycemic index (GI) meal with&#xD;
      optimal iv insulin coverage using a negative feedback algorithm to maintain euglycemia&#xD;
      (euglycemic clamp). Insulin requirement will be quantified. At some time during the visit,&#xD;
      participants will present to the BIDMC research imaging facility for a practice MRI session,&#xD;
      during which they will undergo a brief imaging sequence to get accustomed to the scanning&#xD;
      process and eliminate anxiety as a confounder of imaging data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each of 3 test visits, one of the following experimental conditions will be applied in a&#xD;
      randomized, blinded cross-over design: (a) high GI meal with euglycemic clamp, (b) low GI&#xD;
      meal with euglycemic clamp, (c) high GI meal with primed-variable insulin infusion at the&#xD;
      rate established during the pre-test visit. After steady state is established, baseline&#xD;
      laboratory evaluation and MRI imaging will be obtained, followed by the test meal. Imaging&#xD;
      will be repeated at 1 and 4 hours postprandial. Blood samples for pertinent metabolic and&#xD;
      hormonal parameters will be obtained every 30 minutes. Each test-visit concludes with a&#xD;
      standard weighed meal to quantify ad-libitum intake.&#xD;

          <description>In a randomized cross-over design, a nutritional shake with high GI vs low GI was consumed with differential insulin coverage:&#xD;
High GI meal covered with IV insulin to to achieve euglycemia, resulting in hyperinsulinemia (experimental condition A); 1 day.&#xD;
1-week wash-out&#xD;
Low GI meal covered with IV insulin to achieve euglycemia (comparison condition B); 1 day.&#xD;
1-week wash-out&#xD;
High GI meal with IV insulin matching the low GI meal, resulting in hyperglycemia (experimental condition A); 1 day.&#xD;
The order of experimental conditions A and B was randomized.&#xD;
High and low GI liquid test meals were matched for macronutrient composition (60% carbohydrate, 15% protein, 25% fat), micronutrient profiles, physical properties, palatability and sweetness. Meals provided 25% of individual daily energy requirements.&#xD;
Insulin was given intravenously for 5 hours. Glucose levels were measured every 5 minutes for insulin titration.&#xD;
Because all participants completed all interventions, results are presented in aggregate for the entire study group.</description>

The shake provided 25% of daily calorie requirements with a macronutrient composition of 60% carbohydrate, 15% protein, 25% fat, and matched micronutrient profiles, physical properties, palatability and sweetness.&#xD;
Insulin was given intravenously to normalize blood glucose before the meal and for 5 hours postprandial. Blood glucose levels were measured every 5 minutes, and Insulin was adjusted using a negative feedback algorithm to maintain euglycemia.&#xD;
Interventions were presented in a cross-over design. Because all participants completed all interventions, results are presented by intervention.</description>

          <description>After an overnight fast, a nutritional shake with high GI was consumed. The shake provided 25% of daily calorie requirements with a macronutrient composition of 60% carbohydrate, 15% protein, 25% fat, and matched micronutrient profiles, physical properties, palatability and sweetness.&#xD;
Insulin was given intravenously to normalize blood glucose before the meal and for 5 hours postprandial. Blood glucose levels were measured every 5 minutes, and Insulin was adjusted using a negative feedback algorithm to maintain euglycemia.</description>
