      METHODS Ethics statement The study protocols have been reviewed and approved by the Jigjiga&#xD;
      University ethical review committee. Study consent was obtained from district administration,&#xD;
      district health office and community leaders. Control group received books and pens to&#xD;
      support the children's education during the study period and health education after the&#xD;
      completion of the study. Written consent was taken from the mothers of the children. During&#xD;
      the study no one was harmed nor died of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting The current study was conducted in the rural areas of Jigjiga district of&#xD;
      Ethiopian-Somali Regional State (ESRS) in the Eastern Ethiopia from February 1 to July 30,&#xD;
      2015. The ESRS is one of the nine regional states that constitute the Federal Democratic&#xD;
      Republic of Ethiopia. Pastoralism is a way of life whereby the livelihood of the people&#xD;
      depends on raising livestock and living on its milk and meat (23). Nearly 90% of the&#xD;
      population in ESRS resides in rural areas, leading either a pastoralist or agro-pastoralist&#xD;
      lifestyle. The majority of these pastoralists are nomadic and have a pattern of seasonal&#xD;
      movement from place to place for cattle grazing. Jigjiga district is one of the 68 districts&#xD;
      of the region, part of Fafan zone, with a total population of 277,560 according to 2007&#xD;
      census conducted by the central statiscal agency of Ethiopia of whom 149,292 are men and&#xD;
      128,268 women. A total of 34 Kebele is found in the district of which 4 are urban and 30 are&#xD;
      rural Kebele in the district. Finally Jigjiga district was selected for the study because of&#xD;
      its notable of high incidence of diarrhea disease and acute watery diarrhea epidemics as&#xD;
      reported by the Regional Health Bureau.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size determination The sample was calculated by using methods published by Hayes and&#xD;
      Bennett (24) to determine the number of communities required to detect a between-group&#xD;
      difference in diarrhea incidence density for the under five years old. Given recent studies&#xD;
      conducted in Eastern Ethiopia indicated disease rates for incidence of child diarrhea among&#xD;
      home based chlorine treatment intervention and non intervention group of 4.5 episodes/100&#xD;
      person week observations and 10.4 episodes/100 person week observations respectively (13),&#xD;
      80% power, 95% confidence interval, considering a coefficient of between-cluster variation&#xD;
      (k) of 0.62, adjusting for loss of follow up of individual households, incomplete&#xD;
      longitudinal data and 10% drop out and design effect of three from clustering. The final&#xD;
      sample 24 communities was calculated (12 intervention and 12 controls) with 50 children of&#xD;
      under-five in each cluster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and procedures The study subjects was divided into 2 study groups according to&#xD;
      clusters of community that received hygiene education and hand washing with soap&#xD;
      interventions and those control clusters that did not receive any interventions. Only rural&#xD;
      community of the district were selected for the study. A household was considered eligible&#xD;
      for the study if the following criteria are met: a) at least one child aged 0-59 months&#xD;
      living in the home and b) non model health extension household. A household was excluded if&#xD;
      the household graduated model health extension households. The 24 communities were allocated&#xD;
      to the intervention and control arms by having a meeting with community leaders, Kebele heads&#xD;
      and representative from the district health office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention of this study was an educational intervention of water and sanitation&#xD;
      hygiene and hand washing with soap to improve water-sanitation behaviours that shown to be&#xD;
      associated with high rates of childhood diarrhea in this region from the baseline studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Water storage behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Latrine availability and utilization&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hand washing after defecation and before meal preparation and eating by using soap&#xD;
           Mothers/caretakers in the intervention group were instructed to keep their water storage&#xD;
           container clean and covered, to have a latrine and utilize properly, and to wash their&#xD;
           hands and children's hands ideally with soap after defecation, before meal preparation&#xD;
           and eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers of the control group continued their way disposal of water storage behavior, latrine&#xD;
      sanitation and hand washing practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection A baseline survey was conducted on mother/caretaker, child and environmental&#xD;
      characteristics and pre-intervention diarrhea rates by using questionnaire that was&#xD;
      translated from English to local language, Somali. The field workers also arranged&#xD;
      neighborhood meetings to illustrate the pamphlets and show health problems resulting from&#xD;
      hand and water contamination and to show specific instruction on how to use the intervention&#xD;
      assigned to the cluster in every week during the study period. Each participating household&#xD;
      received a package of health education messages and soap (white bars). The field workers&#xD;
      encouraged mothers/care takers to wet their hands, lather them completely with soap, and rub&#xD;
      together for 1 minute after cleaning and child who had defecated, before food preparation,&#xD;
      before eating and before feeding children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome assessment The Primary outcome was longitudinal incidence of diarrhea. Diarrhea is&#xD;
      defined as the passage of three or more liquid or semi-liquid stools in a 24-hour period or&#xD;
      the passage of at least one liquid or semi-liquid stool with blood or mucus (25). The data&#xD;
      collectors visited intervention and control households in every 2 weeks period (12 visits) at&#xD;
      the same time to collect outcome data. At each visit, daily episodes of diarrhea over the&#xD;
      last previous 2 weeks were recorded for each under-five children based on the report of the&#xD;
      mother/caretaker of the child. The secondary outcome was bacteriological quality of drinking&#xD;
      water at household level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis All data collected was cross checked by the field supervisors at the field&#xD;
      sites on a daily basis. Prior to data entry, base line and surveillance data forms were&#xD;
      checked for completeness and consistence. Data was double entered on to EPI data Version&#xD;
      3.5.3 and statistical analysis was performed by using STATA Version 13. Intention- to- treat&#xD;
      analysis was used to compare the incidence of diarrhea among children under-five years of age&#xD;
      between intervention and control arms. During the six months after the intervention, the rate&#xD;
      of diarrhea (per 100 person-weeks) in children under-five years of age was measured for the&#xD;
      intervention communities and for the control communities. Water quality parameters were also&#xD;
      determined and compared among the intervention and control communities.&#xD;
