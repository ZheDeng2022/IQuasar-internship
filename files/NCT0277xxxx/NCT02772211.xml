      This is a two-stage experiment; the first stage is an open label trial in which participants&#xD;
      receive six intravenous (IV) treatments of ketamine. The second stage includes participants&#xD;
      that responded to ketamine (i.e. reduction of 25% in their symptoms of depression, as&#xD;
      measured by the Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale MADRS). The second stage is a&#xD;
      double-blind, controlled clinical trial of D-cycloserine (DCS) vs. placebo, as maintenance&#xD;
      treatment in patients who responded to ketamine treatment. The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      determine whether 8 weeks of DCS maintenance therapy will prevent relapse of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms following ketamine infusions&#xD;

      Background MDD is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide [5]. A substantial&#xD;
      proportion of patients do not achieve adequate remission despite multiple antidepressant&#xD;
      trials and augmentation strategies. TRD is defined as an insufficient response to at least&#xD;
      two adequate antidepressant trials. Many of these patients are referred to somatic treatment;&#xD;
      e.g. electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and&#xD;
      Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS), all of which can cause side effects, and are not always&#xD;
      efficacious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine has been safely used for decades for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia and&#xD;
      more recently for chronic pain. Ketamine is a noncompetitive, high-affinity antagonist of the&#xD;
      NMDA type glutamate receptor, with additional effects on dopamine and μ-opioid receptors.&#xD;
      During the last decade, 4 meta analyses summarizing over 22 controlled trials have been&#xD;
      published, showing the rapid and impressive effect of ketamine in TRD patients [6-8]. These&#xD;
      trials show that a single slow IV ketamine sub-anesthetic dose (0.5 mg/kg) over 40 minutes&#xD;
      dramatically improves depressive symptoms. Across studies, a clinically significant&#xD;
      antidepressant response was maintained for up to 72 hours in approximately half of the&#xD;
      patients; only a minority had relapsed within the first two weeks post-ketamine infusion [9,&#xD;
      10]. aan het Rot et al. [11] showed that repeated IV ketamine infusions prolong the duration&#xD;
      of improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D-cycloserine (seromycin) is a broad spectrum antibiotic, in use for over thirty years in the&#xD;
      treatment of tuberculosis, DCS functions as a partial agonist at the NMDA-R glycine site,&#xD;
      with agonist effects predominating at low dose and antagonist effects at high dose. Low DCS&#xD;
      dosages, such as 50-500 mg/d have been implemented in anxiety patients for memory and&#xD;
      learning enhancement. Beneficial antidepressant effects have been reported when higher&#xD;
      dosages (500-1000 mg/day) were used [3]. DCS regimens in TRD patients suggest that high dose&#xD;
      DCS may indeed be beneficial in the treatment of MDD. However, a previous study using a lower&#xD;
      dosage (250mg/d) did not show significant difference over placebo [3]. The antidepressant&#xD;
      effects of DCS seem to derive from its ability to inhibit NMDA-R function, similarly to&#xD;
      ketamine. One recent study demonstrated a beneficial effect of DCS after ketamine infusion in&#xD;
      bipolar depression patients [12]. Due to the potential neurotoxicity of ketamine in prolonged&#xD;
      administration. Other NMDA antagonist should follow ketamine infusion [13]. Therefore we&#xD;
      reason that DCS post-ketamine administration will considerably reduce relapse in TRD patients&#xD;
      when compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients will undergo 6 ketamine infusions within a 3-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intravenous ketamine will be administrated by a senior anesthesiologist and under the&#xD;
           supervision of a senior psychiatrist hence ensuring patient safety. We believe that&#xD;
           sub-anesthetic ketamine infusion will be safer and will cause fewer side effects than&#xD;
           ECT. The procedure will be explained in detail to each patient, and written consent will&#xD;
           be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After a psychiatric and medical evaluation by a senior psychiatrist and a senior&#xD;
           anesthesiologist, patients will be given ketamine infusion added on to their&#xD;
           antidepressant therapy. A slow ketamine infusion of 0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes will be&#xD;
           given to the patients. Patients will be monitored by the experienced staff which&#xD;
           includes a senior anesthesiologist and a nurse as well as a psychiatrist who will be&#xD;
           available nearby. All patients will be monitored continuously for heart rate and rhythm&#xD;
           and oxygen saturation, and blood pressure will be measured at 10 minutes intervals.&#xD;
           Heart rate variability will be measured and analyzed after ketamine treatment.&#xD;
           Measurements will be performed during the ketamine infusion at baseline, after 3 and 6&#xD;
           treatments. Depressive symptoms will be measured using Montgomery Asberg Depression&#xD;
           Scale (MADRS). In addition Clinical Global Severity Scale (CGI-S) and Clinical Global&#xD;
           Improvement (CGI-I) will be performed 2 hours after treatment. In many cases, patients&#xD;
           with depression also suffer from alexithymia: inappropriate identification of emotions.&#xD;
           Alexithymia will be measured at baseline after 3 and 6 treatments. Ketamine infusion&#xD;
           will be stopped in cases of a 20% or above increase in blood pressure or in heart rate&#xD;
           over baseline values and/ or an acute dissociative state.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be discharged to their homes at least three hours from end of infusion.&#xD;
           Due to the potential effect of ketamine each patient will need to be escorted to and&#xD;
           from the hospital by a family member or a friend.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. For patients who will meet response criteria (MADRS≥25%) after 6 ketamine infusions,&#xD;
           ketamine administration (weeks 1-3: days 1-21) will be stopped and patients will start&#xD;
           receiving DCS or placebo titrated slowly up to 1000mg/d over the next 8 weeks [2] in the&#xD;
           following manner:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Week 4: Days 22-24 - 250mg/d, one pill per day Well-being assessment and adverse&#xD;
                effect evaluation before drug elevation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Mid-week 4 to end of week 6: Days 25-42 - 500mg/d, two pills per day&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Week 7: Day 43-49 - 750mg/d, three pills per day&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Weeks 8-11: Days 50-77 - 1000mg/d four pills per day&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pyridoxine 200-300mg/d will be prescribed for all patients at the beginning of the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients who did not improve after 6 ketamine treatments will be removed from the study.&#xD;

          -  Patients will be excluded if they have current or history of psychotic or dissociative&#xD;
             symptoms, or severe personality disorder with psychosis or dissociative symptoms.&#xD;
             Additional exclusion criteria will be a lifetime history of psychotic mania, a&#xD;
             substance abuse or use of alcohol. Medical exclusion criteria will include -&#xD;
             uncontrolled elevated blood pressure, non-sinus rhythm, unstable ischemic heart&#xD;
             disease, uncorrected hyper thyroidism, and for women, pregnancy or the initiation of&#xD;
             female hormonal treatment &lt;3 months. Before ketamine treatment women of childbearing&#xD;
