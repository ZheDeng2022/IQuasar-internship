      This a Phase 2 randomized, open-label, two-stage study designed to investigate the antitumor&#xD;
      activity of tipifarnib in approximately 36 eligible subjects with MDS who have no known&#xD;
      curative treatment. Subjects will be randomized to receive tipifarnib orally with food&#xD;
      according to one of 2 treatment regimens.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study will investigate the antitumor activity in terms of ORR of tipifarnib in&#xD;
      approximately 36 eligible subjects with MDS who have no known curative treatment. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects may have received no more than 2 prior systemic regimens. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive tipifarnib orally with food according to one of 2 dose regimens. In the&#xD;
      absence of unmanageable toxicities, subjects may continue to receive tipifarnib treatment&#xD;
      until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease assessments will be performed at screening and at least once every approximately 12&#xD;
      weeks starting at the end of cycle 3. Determination of ORR will be assessed by the&#xD;
      Investigator according to the MDS International Working Group (IWG) criteria (Cheson 2006).&#xD;
      Upon disease progression, all subjects in the study will be followed approximately every 12&#xD;
      weeks for survival and the use of subsequent therapy until either death or 12 months after&#xD;
      accrual of the study has been completed, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
