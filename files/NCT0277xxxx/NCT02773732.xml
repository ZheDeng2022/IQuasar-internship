    <textblock>
      The purpose of the first part of this study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      of oral ciprofloxacin when given in combination with a fixed dose of oral etoposide in&#xD;
      patients with resistant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The purpose of the second part of this&#xD;
      study is to determine if the established dose of oral ciprofloxacin in combination with oral&#xD;
      etoposide is effective in the treatment of patients with resistant AML.&#xD;

      This study will look at: any side effects that occur, the effectiveness of the study drug,&#xD;
      and how your disease reacts to ciprofloxacin in combination with etoposide. This study will&#xD;
      try to find the highest tolerated dose of ciprofloxacin without causing serious side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ciprofloxacin is a commonly used antibiotic drug that is approved for use by the United&#xD;
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has not approved ciprofloxacin to treat&#xD;
      AML. Etoposide is an anticancer chemotherapy drug that is approved for use by the FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment of small cell lung cancer and testicular cancer. Etoposide is also used for&#xD;
      treatment of various blood cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is laboratory research that has shown that ciprofloxacin can make leukemia cells more&#xD;
      sensitive to etoposide chemotherapy. This observation indicates that ciprofloxacin may help&#xD;
      improve the effectiveness of etoposide in the treatment of resistant AML.&#xD;

             remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) after&#xD;
             at least one cycle of induction chemotherapy and not suitable for a second cycle of&#xD;
             standard intensive chemotherapy; or who have progressed after 1 cycle of&#xD;
             hypomethylating agent or intolerant to hypomethylating agent therapy and not suitable&#xD;
