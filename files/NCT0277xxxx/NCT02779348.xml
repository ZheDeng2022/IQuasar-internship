      Study design and methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a single-centre, open-label, randomised, two-way crossover study in healthy young&#xD;
      male and female volunteers. The study consisted of 2 treatment periods separated by a washout&#xD;
      period of 14 days or more. In one period, subjects received nebicapone 200 mg thrice-daily&#xD;
      (tid) for 9 days, and a warfarin 25 mg single-dose concomitantly with the morning dose of&#xD;
      nebicapone on Day 4. In the other period, a warfarin 25 mg single-dose was administered&#xD;
      alone. Warfarin pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were characterised following&#xD;
      warfarin dosing.&#xD;
