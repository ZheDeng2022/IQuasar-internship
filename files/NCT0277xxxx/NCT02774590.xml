      This research is being done to determine the safety and tolerability of timolol in the&#xD;
      treatment of acne and rosacea. The investigators will also look for specific biomolecular&#xD;
      changes in acne or rosacea skin when it is exposed to timolol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timolol is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of glaucoma.&#xD;
      In dermatology, it has been used as a treatment to decrease the size of vascular (blood&#xD;
      vessel) malformations in infant skin. Timolol is not approved for use in acne or rosacea and&#xD;
      its use in this study is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many people with rosacea have telangiectasias which are small, red dilated blood vessels on&#xD;
      the skin. They also suffer from flushing and acne-like lesions. Better treatments than those&#xD;
      currently available are desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acne vulgaris, or acne, is another chronic inflammatory and very common skin disease that&#xD;
      affects about 8 out of 10 young adults and adolescents. Signs of acne include papules and&#xD;
      blackheads that are often called primary lesions because they represent an active form of the&#xD;
      disease. There are also secondary lesions that can form later; they are known as acne scars&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rosacea affects roughly 16 million Americans who desire better treatments than those&#xD;
      currently available. Acne vulgaris, another chronic inflammatory skin disorder, mainly&#xD;
      affects teenagers but also affects 20-40% of adults. Investigating potential new treatments&#xD;
      will not only satisfy a clinical need, but also offers the opportunity to learn about the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of the disease and skin biology. The purpose of this study is to investigate the&#xD;
      possible role of timolol as a therapy for the erythema and papules associated with acne and&#xD;
      rosacea. It has been shown that timolol is beneficial and safe to treat infantile&#xD;
      hemangiomas. The investigators hypothesize that it may also be safe and effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of acne and rosacea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a single experiment where the test case was the PI (a practicing physician), the&#xD;
      investigators treated his rosacea with timolol for this off-label indication and have noticed&#xD;
      an improvement in flushing and an unexpected improvement in acneiform eruptions associated&#xD;
      with the rosacea. After 30 days, less flushing and acneiform lesions were noted on the&#xD;
      treated right side compared to the left side . Similarly, at 60 days after treatment, as&#xD;
      visualized by infrared imaging, significantly less inflammation and flushing was noted on the&#xD;
      treated right side even outside of episodes of flushing. The improvement was durable, such&#xD;
      that after a 60 day washout, improvements were still noted. In summary, during testing of the&#xD;
      PI as a case subject, timolol appeared effective, safe, and with some disease-remissive&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to conduct a 16 week split-face pilot study with up to 30 patients who have a&#xD;
      diagnosis of either inflammatory acne or rosacea to assess whether timolol maleate&#xD;
      effectively reduces erythema, flushing, telangiectasias, and/or papules. The investigators&#xD;
      also propose to biopsy a subset of our study patients to examine the biological activity in&#xD;
      the skin before and after treatment. The investigators are particularly interested in&#xD;
      studying epigenetic DNA methylation abnormalities in these conditions at baseline to compare&#xD;
      to normal subjects and as a result of therapy.&#xD;

    <description>All 24 subjects will receive study drug and everyone will be randomized to which side of the face is treated with study drug first (right half-face versus left half-face). After 8 weeks of split-face treatment every night before bed, the subjects will be instructed to start treating both sides for another 8 weeks. Up to 30 subjects may be enrolled to ensure a target sample size of 24 (12 acne cases, 12 rosacea cases). This is an exploratory study. No part of this protocol will be considered routine care.</description>
