      This is a window-of-opportunity study that examines the efficacy of doxycycline, and&#xD;
      FDA-approved oral antibiotic, on metakaryotic (cancer stem cells) in resectable pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer following eight weeks of treatment.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pancreatic tumors have two distinct cell populations -- eukaryotic tumor cells and&#xD;
      metakaryotic cells. The first cell type divides quickly but must stop at a certain point.&#xD;
      Metakaryotic cells, also called cancer stem cells, divide less frequently but have an&#xD;
      unlimited number of cell divisions. Chemotherapy works well on eukaryotic cells. Metakaryotic&#xD;
      cells are resistant to chemotherapy and radiation, so they are more difficult to eliminate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Massachusetts Institute of Technology basic science researchers working with the Medical&#xD;
      College of Wisconsin pancreatic cancer group demonstrated in the laboratory that doxycycline&#xD;
      can kill both eukaryotic and metakaryotic cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's goal is to discover if the metakaryocidal drug doxycycline kills any significant&#xD;
      fraction of the metakaryotic cells found in treated pancreatic tumors. Targeting metakaryotic&#xD;
      cells may decrease cancer relapse and metastases. The development of antimetakaryotics is&#xD;
      vital for pancreatic cancer patients, who are at risk for disease recurrence and&#xD;
      cancer-related death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the efficacy of doxycycline on inducing metakaryotic cell death in primary&#xD;
      pancreatic tumors from patients with resectable pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the plasma drug concentrations of the study drug at baseline and at days 1,&#xD;
           3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, and at restaging and at the time surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the histopathologic treatment response of the primary tumors which have&#xD;
           undergone neoadjuvant gemcitabine based chemoradiation and concurrent doxycycline&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To enumerate the number of observed dead/dying metakaryotes per 1 gram of resected&#xD;
           pancreatic tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will take 100 mg doxycycline twice daily for a period of eight weeks (56 days).&#xD;
      Following standard-of-care (not study trial-related) chemotherapy, patients will receive&#xD;
      radiation therapy. Patients will receive doxycycline beginning on the first day of radiation&#xD;
      therapy. Following this, patients will undergo surgery four to five weeks after completion of&#xD;
      chemoradiation. Doxycycline will be discontinued five to seven days prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves pharmacokinetic studies, which means that patients will have blood draws&#xD;
      several times so that serum levels may be evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>Cytopathologists will evaluate each patient sample. In addition, the histopathologic response of the primary tumor will be assessed using the College of American Pathology criteria for residual tumor response following neoadjuvant therapy for the exocrine pancreas. Researchers will enumerate the number of observed dead/dying metakaryotes per 1 gram of resected pancreatic tissue.</description>

    <description>Treatment with doxycycline hyclate will be administered as an oral agent on an outpatient basis. Patients will receive doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for a period of 8 weeks (56 days). Upon registration (baseline) and at the first, third, and fifth days of doxycycline therapy, patients will be seen to obtain trough serum concentrations for pharmacokinetic studies. Additional serum levels will be checked on days 8, 15, 22 and 29.</description>
