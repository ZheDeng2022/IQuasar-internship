  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether simulation training improves the&#xD;
      performance during arthroscopic surgery ('keyhole' surgery into a joint).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single blinded randomised controlled study of junior orthopaedic trainees aims to assess&#xD;
      whether the addition of simulation training improves arthroscopic technical skills&#xD;
      performance of junior orthopaedic trainees during knee arthroscopy in the operating theatre&#xD;
      compared to their usual clinical training programme. This will be assessed using objective&#xD;
      motion analysis parameters recorded from wireless elbow-mounted motion sensors during&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Wireless elbow-mounted accelerometer and gyroscopic sensors worn by the participant will generate 6 degree of freedom motion data (three rotational degrees around the x, y and z axes, known as 'roll', 'pitch', and 'yaw', and three translational degrees of freedom along x, y and z axes, known as 'surge', 'sway' and 'heave') which will be analysed using validated, bespoke algorithms to calculate the number of hand movements taken whilst performing a diagnostic knee arthroscopy according to a standardised protocol.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Wireless elbow-mounted accelerometer and gyroscopic sensors worn by the participant will generate 6 degree of freedom motion data which will be analysed using validated, bespoke algorithms. These data will be analysed for the relative activity and dominance of each hand during the procedure while participants perform a diagnostic arthroscopy of the knee in theatre according to a standardised protocol.</description>

        <description>Wireless elbow-mounted accelerometer and gyroscopic sensors worn by the participant will generate 6 degree of freedom motion data which will be analysed using validated, bespoke algorithms. These data will be analysed for the relative activity and dominance of each hand during the procedure while participants perform a diagnostic arthroscopy of the knee in theatre according to a standardised protocol.</description>
