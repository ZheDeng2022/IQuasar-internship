      Linezolid, primary treatment for MDR-TB combination therapy anti. Until it is the dose of 600&#xD;
      mg x1 / day, rather sensible for most patients is more, which was unanimous. It is true that&#xD;
      if a dosage is consensus, it goes without saying, because of the interindividual variability,&#xD;
      marked moreover to linezolid, a therapeutic monitoring assay of plasma levels is&#xD;
      indispensable for most pharmacological treatments. This therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)&#xD;
      often gives rise, as known, to dosage changes. It turns out that at present no real STP on&#xD;
      the basic objectives PK / PD is really made in France in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB)&#xD;
      and the bibliography remains rather poor recommendations, and yet all the elements are there:&#xD;
      indeed linezolid is an antibiotic whose activity is purely &quot;time-dependent&quot;. So one should&#xD;
      fulfill 2 PK / PD objectives whose precise boundaries are sometimes still to be determined:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -% T&gt; MIC, or percentage of time spent with plasma concentrations above the minimum&#xD;
      inhibitory concentration of linezolid (LNZ) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In practice, the&#xD;
      residual concentration before the next shot must be&gt; MIC (0.125 to 1 mg / l)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A fortiori it must also take into account the concentration preventing the appearance of&#xD;
           resistant mutants, amounting to 1.2 mg / l&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AUC / MIC&gt; 80, or ratio of the area under the curve (AUC, Area under curve) of plasma&#xD;
           concentration versus time and CMI LNZ Until then, and without real bibliographic&#xD;
           support, and for the sake of kindness to patients coupled with an economic advantage,&#xD;
           the STP consisted of 2 samples, a peak 1:30 after taking (Cmax) and a residual before&#xD;
           taking (C min) , after all, to 600mg x1 / 24 correlates well with the AUC (55% peak and&#xD;
           75% for the residual).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an observation that 25 to 30% of patients had a C min &lt;1.2 mg / L, and even&#xD;
      frequently &lt;0.2 mg / L to 600 mg x 1, with some low peaks and leaving presage an AUC may be&#xD;
      insufficient well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is therefore more imperative to be a pharmacological streamlining and ensuring&#xD;
      adequate therapeutic monitoring involves both maximum and minimum toxicity efficiency. And in&#xD;
      the light of what has already been practiced for other molecules such as mycophenolate for&#xD;
      example which is carried AUC or miniAUC for example. It would therefore be in the achievement&#xD;
      of AUC in all patients treated with LNZ for TB MDR / XDR for over a week. Achieving this&#xD;
      requires AUC obtaining 7 blood samples given day instead of two samples taken at present.&#xD;
      Indeed one must have in mind that the peak of rational / residual has become blurred in this&#xD;
      context, and that one of the two goals PK / PD is now filled (Cmin&gt; MIC / CMP) but it should&#xD;
      not be that not at the expense of the second (AUC). The benefits, direct and indirect are&#xD;
      multiple and obtaining them is ensured through this protocol. The study by analyzing&#xD;
      individual data will confirm the accuracy of the dose fractionation 300mgx2 / day and at a&#xD;
      time to highlight a potential new dosage adjustment that would need to achieve for further&#xD;
      study, so a substantial gain in terms of efficacy and toxicity via a suitable therapeutic&#xD;
      monitoring. Secondly, determine which collection points, in these patients, these doses will&#xD;
      be most interesting to take later in the routine of STP in order to collect less points (eg&#xD;
      miniAUC MPA) retaining same statistical power to estimate kinetic parameters, mainly the AUC&#xD;
      (eg aminoglycoside also). Finally in a third phase construction on the basis of these&#xD;
      individual kinetics of a population pharmacokinetic model with highlighting of population&#xD;
      parameters and especially co-related variables explaining the high pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      variability and allowing for following patients to determine the individually tailored dose&#xD;
      immediately before the first shot and the first assays.&#xD;

      Primary objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of the AUC / MIC and% T&gt; MIC for each patient to confirm the appropriateness,&#xD;
      in light of the peak and residual, and the interest of the split doses more frequently&#xD;
      performed in case of too low residual toxicity or secondary objective: Determination of&#xD;
      points of privileged samples in this context for maximum statistical power and minimal stress&#xD;
      for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Outlook: Development of a population PK model and determination of co-variables of interest&#xD;
      and individualized dosages immediately for the next patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, multi-center, non-interventional type of routine care Study duration: 1 day /&#xD;
      patient, maximum total duration of recruitment: 6 months, aim 30-40patients included&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acquisition of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional media (Informed consent, sampling protocol, collection form of biological,&#xD;
      clinical and pharmacological patient and treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analysis by a software suitable pharmacokinetic&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anonymity of data: an identifier for each subject will be awarded (first name and&#xD;
           surname / number) and the data will be entered in a computer file that will be retained&#xD;
           by the sponsor on the GHPSJ site for the realization of determinations of AUC and&#xD;
           optimal dosages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expected duration of patient recruitment: up to 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of patients to recruit 30 to 40 patients, limited by the number of hospitalized&#xD;
           patients in the recruiting center (sanatorium Bligny), combining both MDR-TB and&#xD;
           treatment with linezolid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of the study for each patient: 12 to 24 hours the time for the 7 samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regarding the iterative sampling and prevention of potentially associated pain, most&#xD;
           patients already have a KT or a PAC in place for administering IV drugs (amiklin,&#xD;
           augmentin or vitamins in particular), it is therefore on these it is planned to take&#xD;
           samples. For the few patients with no system in place for use, it will be explained and&#xD;
           proposed the establishment of a device Catelon and a patch Emla, the decision on the&#xD;
           matter will be up to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Destruction of samples: the samples will not be retained after being used for the study. They&#xD;
      will be destroyed in accordance with the rules of good practice research laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data: Data include clinical and biological, bacteriological patient. The GHPSJ guarantee that&#xD;
      the biological material will be digitally encoded and will not involve direct identifying&#xD;
      information of subjects participating in research. The shipment will be made by the&#xD;
      sanatorium Bligny staff under the supervision of the investigator within the department (Dr&#xD;
      Mathilde Jachym and Damien Le Du).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects: After notification of the CPP Ile de France II, the project will be&#xD;
      classified as &quot;research in routine care.&quot; The opinion of the CPP Ile de France II will be&#xD;
      requested at the meeting of June 2015. The manager research center will be the hospital group&#xD;
      Paris Saint-Joseph (GHPSJ). The latter will contract with the SHAM (usual insurer GHPSJ for&#xD;
      care and clinical research) to ensure the risk of the blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research information will be issued and the signature of the Circular will be collected&#xD;
      from the patient. An agreement will be made between institutions, and the GHPSJ Bligny&#xD;
      Medical Center, including the logistics of transport and harvest management.&#xD;
