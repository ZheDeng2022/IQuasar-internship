      Participating investigators will locate all IUB B insertions conducted at their facility at&#xD;
      least 12 month prior the initiation of study data collection. The study is composed of 2&#xD;
      parts. Part one is collecting data out of patient's medical record which is accessible only&#xD;
      to the doctor. This data is mostly demographic. Part two of the study comprises a phone call&#xD;
      to the patients done by the doctor or by authorized site personnel. In the phone call the&#xD;
      study purpose will be explained to the patient and a patient consent will be required. After&#xD;
      the patients consent to participate, the doctor will ask the patient the questions defined in&#xD;
      the study protocol regarding her experience during the time since the IUB SCu300B's&#xD;
      insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 200 eligible subjects will be invited to participate in the study. Informed&#xD;
      Consent Form will be signed and sent to the investigator, applicable CRFs will be completed&#xD;
      by the investigator or authorized site personnel. The patient questionnaires will be asked on&#xD;
      the telephone and entered directly into the CRF by the investigator or authorized site staff&#xD;
      (CRF = source document). Also the physician´s questionnaire will be directly completed in the&#xD;
      CRF by the investigator (CRF = source document). All other clinical data will be transcribed&#xD;
      to the CRF from the medical patient records (patient records = source document).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no planned patient visits to the doctor's office for study purposes. If the patient&#xD;
      visits the physician´s office as part of the clinical routine, the study procedures can also&#xD;
      be performed directly at the site instead of telephone contacts.&#xD;

      STUDY RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      IUDs pose several complications to users, such as perforation during insertion, migration and&#xD;
      expulsion. IUDs may also cause menorrhagia, discomfort and pain presumably due to distortion&#xD;
      of the uterus by their semi-rigid polymeric frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A proof of concept study was concluded on the SCu300A (the first approved variant of the IUB™&#xD;
      product family) and published and a comparative study for the SCu300A is ongoing. The purpose&#xD;
      of this current study is to obtain performance data on the SCu300B which is CE approved and&#xD;
      commercially sold. Since the IUB B has a slightly larger diameter and stiffer frame than the&#xD;
      SCu300A - to see if these parameters affect expulsion rate, efficacy and QOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This post marketing study aims to verify the IUB™'s SCu300B efficacy. Endpoints include 1&#xD;
      year Expulsion rate, as well as assessment of pregnancy rates, mal-position, perforation,&#xD;
      discontinuation rates and physician and participant's satisfaction. These results will be&#xD;
      used and will also help in reaffirming the assumption that the IUB™'s design contributes to&#xD;
      lower complication and side effect rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Benefits or risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this is a retrospective data collection, there will be no risks or benefits for&#xD;
      participants. The participants will have a phone call to propose the opportunity to be part&#xD;
      of the study. After full explanation of the study aims the patients willing to participate&#xD;
      will either consent by phone or sign and e mail a written informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited to this study by the Ob\Gyn physicians participating in the study.&#xD;
      The doctors will address their medical files to allocate patient who has been inserted with&#xD;
      an IUB B at least 12 month before data collection begins. At first - only contact information&#xD;
      will be found and no other clinical data will be taken out of patient's files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phone call to the patient will be done in which the patient will generally be asked if she&#xD;
      is willing to participate in a retrospective study. If the patient is willing, the informed&#xD;
      consent form will be sent to the patient together with an explanation letter and a&#xD;
      pre-addressed envelope per regular mail. If the patient is willing to participate and has&#xD;
      sent back the signed informed consent form, the investigator or authorized site staff will&#xD;
      call the patient, educate the patient about the research proposal on the phone and ask if&#xD;
      there are any questions to be addressed. After all questions are answered the doctor will&#xD;
      countersign the ICF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the same phone call the patient will be asked the protocol defined questions regarding the&#xD;
      past year of IUB use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the performance of the IUB™ SCu300B device&#xD;
      in clinical use. In particular, the study will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the safety and performance of the IUB™ by means of objective clinical measures&#xD;
           and in particular 1 year expulsion rates, perforation and pregnancy rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the usability and patient satisfaction of the IUB™ in terms of physician as&#xD;
           well as patient satisfaction for ease of insertion and subject QOL report questions.&#xD;
