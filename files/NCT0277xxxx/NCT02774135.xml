    <textblock>
      Preschoolers suffering from mild developmental disabilities are being referred to&#xD;
      Occupational Therapy (OT) clinics according to limitation in participating of daily&#xD;
      occupations. As well these children often demonstrate behavior or emotional difficulties. The&#xD;
      primary treatment goal is promoting participation yet many times the treatment focuses on&#xD;
      child's performance skills and not on occupation based activities. Respectively its outcome&#xD;
      measures are the child performance skills. This study will document the therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention, and evaluate its impact on child participation as well on his performance&#xD;
      skills and emotional aspects. Participants will be recruited from waiting list for&#xD;
      Occupational Therapy at Clalit Health services, Child Development Institute, and will be&#xD;
      evaluate four times. First time on referral to waiting list ( At the present time due to long&#xD;
      waiting list, children are waiting about three to four months before starting OT&#xD;
      intervention), second time before treatment, third time after three of treatments and last&#xD;
      follow-up after three months.&#xD;
