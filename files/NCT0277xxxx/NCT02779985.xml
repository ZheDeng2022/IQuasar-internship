  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effects of foods or food substances on energy expenditure are of particular interest, because&#xD;
      of the increasing prevalence of obesity and its consequent metabolic diseases like type II&#xD;
      diabetes and fatty liver disease, all risk factors for the development of cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases (CVDs). Recently, the Goji berry (Lycium Barbarum, wolfberry) was introduced into&#xD;
      the Western diet. L. Barbarum originates from Asia, where it is used to improve the health of&#xD;
      several organs. Although L. Barbarum is promoted as a super food with many beneficial&#xD;
      effects, consistent scientific evidence for these effects is lacking. In one study, it was&#xD;
      found that short-term intake of L. Barbarum polysaccharides - equal to 150 g of fresh berries&#xD;
      - increased postprandial oxygen consumption. This indicates that L. Barbarum might exert&#xD;
      beneficial effects on energy expenditure. Furthermore, long-term intervention trials have&#xD;
      shown beneficial effects of L. Barbarum on lipid and glucose metabolism in mice and type II&#xD;
      diabetic patients and on inflammatory status in healthy elderly. Altogether, L. Barbarum has&#xD;
      the potential to be used as a functional food to increase metabolic health, but detailed&#xD;
      information on the postprandial effects of L. Barbarum is missing. We therefore propose this&#xD;
      double-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled intervention trial to investigate the effect&#xD;
      of a single dose of L. Barbarum on postprandial energy expenditure substrate oxidation,&#xD;
      metabolic flexibility, lipid and glucose metabolism and inflammatory markers.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a single dose of L.&#xD;
      Barbarum on postprandial energy expenditure. Secondary objectives are to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of a single dose of L. Barbarum on postprandial lipid and carbohydrate oxidation and&#xD;
      metabolic flexibility, on postprandial lipid and glucose metabolism and on inflammatory&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled intervention trial with two test days&#xD;
      separated by a washout period of at least 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of 20 apparently healthy overweight (BMI between 25 and 30&#xD;
      kg/m2) men aged 18-65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive a mixed meal including 25 grams of dried L. Barbarum as the&#xD;
      intervention product and a matched mixed meal without L. Barbarum as the placebo product. The&#xD;
      meals will be matched for energy content and macronutrient composition.&#xD;
