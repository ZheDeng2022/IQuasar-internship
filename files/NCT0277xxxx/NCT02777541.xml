  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There aren't sufficient randomized prospective controlled trials in pediatric population&#xD;
      comparing the safety and tolerance of early feeding after PEG placement (3-4 hours). Most&#xD;
      patients are fasted for at least 12 hours following percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. In&#xD;
      order to decrease the period of fasting, inadequate nutritional support, and hospitalization&#xD;
      time, the investigators decided to design this study. The additional goal is to establish an&#xD;
      optimum standard procedure in the group of pediatric patients qualified for PEG insertion&#xD;
      procedure in Poland.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a multicentre, randomized, open label trial designed to evaluate the tolerance&#xD;
      and safety of early enteral nutrition after PEG placement in children. Recruitment will be&#xD;
      from patients attending the one of six medical centers in Poland: Department of&#xD;
      Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Feeding Disorders and Department of Pediatrics, The&#xD;
      Children's Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw, Department of Pediatrics, Gastroenterology,&#xD;
      Hepatology and Nutrition, Medical University of Gdańsk in Gdańsk, Department of Allergology,&#xD;
      Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Medical University in Łódź, Department of Pediatrics, Medical&#xD;
      University of Silesia in Katowice and Department of Pediatrics and Gastroenterology, Area&#xD;
      Hospital in Torus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include 100 patients, from 1-month-old to 18-year-old, qualified for&#xD;
      percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. All participants will be prepared for&#xD;
      the procedure according to the standard medical protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents/legal guardians, and where possible also the patient, will be informed about the&#xD;
      research plan, and after signed informed consent to participate in the study patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled for the study. At the Baseline visit participants will be randomized (1:1) to one of&#xD;
      two treatment group: Group I- early enteral feeding group (3 hours after PEG implantation) or&#xD;
      Group II- late enteral feeding group (8 hours after PEG implantation). The follow-up visits&#xD;
      in hospital is planned 3, 6, 9 mad 12 months after the procedure in all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Number of patients who will achieve full feed (total fluid and caloric requirements)&#xD;
      within 48 hours since the first feeding bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of early complications (to 6 days after PEG placement)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Number of late complications ( 7 days - 12 months after PEG placement)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Duration of hospitalization after PEG placement (in days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Gastric residuals (ml) - sum up to 48 hours since the first feeding bolus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improvement in nutritional status (3,6,9,12 months after the procedure) - body weight&#xD;
           gain (kg) and height gain (cm), BMI kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Influence of vitamin and trace element deficiency (vitamin D - 25(OH)D3, vitamin A,&#xD;
           vitamin E, sodium, potassium, calcium, zinc, iron, magnesium, selenium) and other&#xD;
           biochemical parameters abnormalities (serum level of urea, total protein, albumin,&#xD;
           glucose, glycated hemoglobin (hemoglobin HbA1c), aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine&#xD;
           transaminase (ALT), ferritin, C reactive protein) on complications rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Influence of ghrelin, leptin and adiponectin level on nutritional status improvement&#xD;
           after PEG placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Influence of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) diagnosed before the procedure on feeding&#xD;
           tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Corelation between fecal calprotectin level and feeding tolerance after PEG placement,&#xD;
           complication rate and nutritional status before PEG placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Influence of oropharyngeal flora on complications rate (wound infection)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Correlation between PEG placement and GER.&#xD;
