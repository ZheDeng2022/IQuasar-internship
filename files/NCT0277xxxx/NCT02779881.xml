  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of food allergy. The&#xD;
      investigators previously demonstrated that tolerance acquisition in children with&#xD;
      Immunoglobulin E- (IgE) mediated cow's milk allergy (CMA) is driven by epigenetic modulation&#xD;
      of the Th1 and Th2 cytokine genes. A regulatory T cell (Treg) suppressive phenotype,&#xD;
      characterized by stable expression of the transcription factor &quot;Forkhead box Protein 3&quot;&#xD;
      (FoxP3), plays a pivotal role in food tolerance. FoxP3 mRNA expression is lower in children&#xD;
      with atopic asthma or IgE-mediated food allergy than in healthy children. FoxP3 stable&#xD;
      expression requires full CpG demethylation of its transcriptional regulatory regions, and,&#xD;
      moreover, hypermethylation of the FoxP3 gene has been associated with reduced Treg function&#xD;
      and allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA methylation is a biologically and chemically stable epigenetic modification that locks in&#xD;
      long-term gene expression patterns. The demethylation status of FoxP3 at a highly conserved&#xD;
      region within the Treg-specific-demethylated-region (TSDR), a CpG-rich, located on the 2nd&#xD;
      conserved non-coding sequence of FoxP3 (CNS2), is restricted to Tregs. Transcriptional&#xD;
      activity of the TSDR is essentially determined by its methylation status : it is completely&#xD;
      inactive in its methylated state, but when the TSDR is demethylated, transcription factors&#xD;
      such as Ets-1 and Creb can bind to the TSDR. TSDR demethylated and open chromatin&#xD;
      conformation in the Foxp3 locus leads to stable phenotype differentiated Foxp3+ Treg. FoxP3&#xD;
      TSDR demethylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has been associated with&#xD;
      reduced atopic sensitization and asthma in children. Epigenetic regulation of antigen-induced&#xD;
      T-cell subsets may predict a state of immune tolerance in food allergy. Indeed, DNA&#xD;
      methylation of the FoxP3 gene in Tregs decreased during oral tolerance acquisition in&#xD;
      patients with peanut allergy undergoing oral immunotherapy. The aim of this study was to&#xD;
      evaluate further the epigenetic regulation of FoxP3 gene in children with IgE-mediated CMA.&#xD;

        IgE-mediated CMA children (aged 3 to 18 months) consecutively referred to the tertiary&#xD;
        Pediatric Allergy Center for oral food challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        During the same study period, consecutive healthy children, not at risk of atopic disorders&#xD;
        (namely, those without a first-degree relative affected by an atopic disorder), attending&#xD;
        the Center because of minimal surgical procedures served as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A venous blood sample (4 ml) was obtained from all patients after oral challenge.&#xD;
