  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This expanded access protocol is for infants or children with conditions preventing them from&#xD;
      taking in enough nutrients from food and must receive nutrition intravenously. Standard&#xD;
      intravenous nutrition contains fat emulsion made from soybean. If this fat emulsion is given&#xD;
      over a long period of time, it can cause problems within the liver and if persistent and not&#xD;
      addressed can even lead to severe and/or permanent injury to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that a type of fish oil blend, called Omegaven®, may be used in place of the&#xD;
      soybean fat blend. The Omegaven® fish oil blend may greatly reduce the risk of liver injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omegaven® is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is only offered under&#xD;
      an &quot;expanded access&quot; protocol as an alternative to the soybean fat blend.&#xD;
