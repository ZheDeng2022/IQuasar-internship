      For all patients that match the inclusion criteria a registration-protocol is completed. Then&#xD;
      the patients are operated and a surgery-protocol is completed. The patients are observed for&#xD;
      maximum 24 h and discharged if they meet the discharge-criteria. 30 days post-operative the&#xD;
      investigators do a follow-up of complications.&#xD;

  <condition>Ileostomy Closure in Rectal Cancer</condition>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Rectal cancer patients with ileostoma</arm_group_label>
    <description>In association with anterior resection of rectal cancer these patients obtain loop-ileostoma in order to avoid complications. These are closed within a few months and according to previous studies the admission time is 3-5 days after operation. This study is a single-arm study. The arm include patients having had rectal cancer operation and who have obtained a loop-ileostoma and that meet the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
The operation procedure is standardized; shortly described by dissecting the ileostoma from the abdominal wall and everting the stoma ledges, which will be sutured or stapled. The patients will be observed for 23 hours, and if there are no contraindications according to described criteria the patient can be discharged form the hospital, however all patients will be followed up.</description>

    <description>The operation procedure is standardized as described above (see group description).The patients will be observed for 23 hours, and if there are no contraindications according to described criteria the patient can be discharged form the hospital, however all patients will have follow-up telephone contact on a daily basis with a nurse for the first week. Patients will meet the surgeon 3 days after discharge and after 4 weeks.</description>
