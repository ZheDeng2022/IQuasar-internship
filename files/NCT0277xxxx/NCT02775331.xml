      This study aims to investigate whether use of interactive worktime planning tools that&#xD;
      support work-time control (possibilities to influence individual shift rosters i.e.&#xD;
      self-rostering) and guide for health-supporting shift ergonomics will improve health and&#xD;
      well-being among shift workers. Effects of the worktime planning tools will be studied in a&#xD;
      quasi-experimental design in the Finnish public sector. Health and well-being at baseline&#xD;
      (2012-2015), will be compared to follow-up data in 2016-2019 based on questionnaire and&#xD;
      pay-roll based objective working hour and sickness absence data among those who a) use an&#xD;
      interactive self-rostering software with a shift ergonomics sub-tool, b) whose working hours&#xD;
      are designed with a non-interactive shift planning software with the shift ergonomics&#xD;
      sub-tool and c) whose working hours are designed with a non-interactive shift planning&#xD;
      software without the shift ergonomics sub-tool.&#xD;

      Introduction Epidemiological studies suggest that shift work increases the risk of several&#xD;
      major public health diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and depression. Shift work is&#xD;
      also associated with work-life interaction and work stress. Appropriate shift scheduling is&#xD;
      expected to modify the health risks of shift work but there is not sufficiently knowledge on&#xD;
      whether it is possible to improve work time control and other health-supporting shift&#xD;
      rotation characteristics (shift ergonomics) using different types of shift planning tools,&#xD;
      and whether the possible changes in working hours can lead to successful and cost-saving&#xD;
      changes in health and well-being. There is especially lack of intervention studies on the&#xD;
      means to improve the working hours of women and older workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods Software In the Finnish public sector, basically three separate shift&#xD;
      scheduling software versions are currently available (Titania, CGI© Finland, Finland). The&#xD;
      first one (Titania1), is an interactive software supporting interactive shift rostering&#xD;
      (individual worktime control for employees) and giving guidance for health-supporting shift&#xD;
      ergonomics both to the shift planners use the employees using the software. The second&#xD;
      software (Titania2) is used by the shift planners only, and it gives similar guidance for&#xD;
      health-supporting shift ergonomics than software Titania1 but does not include an option for&#xD;
      self-rostering. The third software (Titania3) is otherwise similar shift planning software&#xD;
      than Titania 2 (used by the shift planners only) but does not include neither the&#xD;
      self-rostering nor the health-supporting shift ergonomics tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use a sampling software that has been developed earlier, to retrieve&#xD;
      all the daily objective working hour and absence data from the employers´ records. The&#xD;
      reliability, validity and accuracy of the used method to retrieve and analyze pay-roll data&#xD;
      on working hours has been assessed earlier based partially on the same dataset as this study.&#xD;
      The raw data will include data on each calendar day for shift starting and ending times, the&#xD;
      use of shift wishes and reasons for absence. The raw data will be processed into individual&#xD;
      level data by construction of variables within specific time frame (i.e. shift&#xD;
      characteristics based on the length, time, recovery and social aspects of working hours per&#xD;
      month or year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Using a non-randomized quasi-experimental design, the use of a self-rostering&#xD;
      software including also an option to evaluate shift ergonomics will be compared to the use of&#xD;
      a shift scheduling software without self-rostering but an option for shift ergonomics&#xD;
      evaluation and secondly, to shift scheduling software as usual (without self-rostering and&#xD;
      shift ergonomics evaluation). Questionnaire and registry data from 2016-2019 after the&#xD;
      intervention (T2) will be compared to baseline data from 2012 to 2015 before the intervention&#xD;
      (T1) in the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants The use of the three different versions of shift planning software will be&#xD;
      studied in approximately 6 000 employees in shift planning units/departments that will be&#xD;
      accounted as clusters in the analyses in six hospital districts of the ongoing Finnish Public&#xD;
      Sector study. According to 3/2016 information, 2/6 hospital districts have made a managerial&#xD;
      decision to start to use the Titania1 software during 2016 in all applicable wards, 2/6&#xD;
      hospital districts have decided to start to use the Titania2 software, and 2/6 organizations&#xD;
      have decided to remain in Titania3 software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are all hospital employees working in units that use the software (1-3) in the 6&#xD;
      hospital districts since 9/2015 for at least one year, and who have answered to a&#xD;
      questionnaire sent to all the workers of the organizations in 2015 and 2017 or 2019. Based on&#xD;
      earlier response rates of the cohort, the expected sample size is approximately 6000&#xD;
      employees, who are using at least one version of the software, and who will reply the&#xD;
      questionnaire both in 2015 and 2017 and/or 2019. In order to minimize potential bias due to&#xD;
      non-randomization and possible selection, the shift planning units (clusters) using Titania1,&#xD;
      Titania2 and Titania3 will be matched for a) the amount of shift work (% of workers in each&#xD;
      cluster having non-day shifts), b) age and c) baseline level of perceived work-time control&#xD;
      (only for intervention 1: shift planning with shift ergonomics and self-rostering) or c)&#xD;
      shift ergonomics (only for intervention 2: shift ergonomics). The pay-roll based daily&#xD;
      working hour data will be retrieved from the shift scheduling program retrospectively from&#xD;
      the beginning of 2012 and prospectively up to the end of 2019. Additional funding enables us&#xD;
      to continue the follow-up from 2017 to 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to comparing the overall effects of the use of Titania1 and Titania2 tools&#xD;
      compared to Titania3, a subgroup analysis will be done based on&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the registry-based individual use of the Titania1 and Titania 2 software within the&#xD;
           group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the possible changes of the perceived worktime control and objective shift&#xD;
           characteristics and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. individual differences (e.g. age, diurnal type, health).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thematic focus group interviews will be performed in the participating organizations to&#xD;
      gather end-user, shift-planner and employers´ attitudes, change processes and experiences on&#xD;
      using the Titania tools. This information will be used to further develop the Titania tools&#xD;
      according to feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The guidelines of the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Non-randomized Designs&#xD;
      (TREND) will be used in the reporting of the results.&#xD;
