    <textblock>
      Although RA pathomechanisms remains incompletely understood, periodontitis and RA share&#xD;
      pathogenic features : genetic and environmental influences, chronic inflammatory disease,&#xD;
      immunoregulatory imbalance, bacterial factors, persistence of antigen/peptide and clinical&#xD;
      factors (conjunctive and hard tissues destruction). Several hypothesis can be evocated : Gram&#xD;
      negative bacterial systemic spreading, inflammatory transmitter substance systemic spreading&#xD;
      (IL1, IL6, IL17, PGE2), systemic spreading of bacterial degradation products (LPS for&#xD;
      example).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently Porphyromonas gingivalis (PG) might be a susceptibility factor to RA because PG has&#xD;
      an enzyme, the peptidylarginine deiminase leading to auto antibodies creation and RA&#xD;
      increasing. As periodontitis, RA is chronic disease with a cyclic increase evolution, needing&#xD;
      a complex pluridisciplinary treatment approach. Recent studies have reported an increased&#xD;
      prevalence of RA patients with periodontal disease. Others studies show that periodontal&#xD;
      treatment induces a significant decrease of the sedimentation rate and of the DAS28.&#xD;
      Periodontitis is suspected to be an independent, aggravating factor in patients with RA&#xD;
      (given the definition from NIH : an aggravating factor is something that makes a condition&#xD;
      worse). So periodontal treatment cannot be considered as a RA treatment per se. But it is&#xD;
      hypothesised that treating periodontitis in RA patients showing signs of periodontitis could&#xD;
      result in improvement in RA disease activity. To date the role of periodontitis as an&#xD;
      aggravating factor in these patients remains unclear, and only RCT designs can reasonably be&#xD;
      used to test this causal hypothesis. There still remains some RA patients who have persistent&#xD;
      symptoms and frequent exacerbations despite specialist care and continuous treatment, so&#xD;
      results of treating aggravating factors are needed. As the majority of patients will benefit&#xD;
      from a systematic evaluation and treatment of aggravating factors, the periodontal treatment&#xD;
      strategy need to be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomised controlled trial is to assess the effectiveness of periodontal&#xD;
      treatment for rheumatoid arthritis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effectiveness of periodontal treatment to reduce the severity of rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis (RA), in patients suffering from both periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that periodontal treatment reduce the severity of rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
