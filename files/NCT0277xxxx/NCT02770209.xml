  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of a completely natural&#xD;
      tissue engineered cartilage, composed of a self-made tissue engineered oriented scaffold and&#xD;
      autologous chondrocytes, for repairing articular cartilage damage following injury. And it is&#xD;
      also aimed at investigating the safety of tissue engineered cartilage transplantation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Injured articular cartilage has limited capacity for self repair. Without timely, early and&#xD;
      effective treatment, damage to the articular cartilage progressively worsens, resulting in&#xD;
      joint swelling, pain and dysfunction. The patient ultimately develops osteoarthritis and will&#xD;
      be required to undergo artificial joint replacement. Clinical therapy for cartilage damage&#xD;
      includes microfracture surgery and autologous osteochondral transplantation. However, the&#xD;
      microfracture technique is limited to small-scale damage, and autologous osteochondral&#xD;
      transplantation is hindered by limited supply. With advances in material science, cell&#xD;
      biology, biomechanics and bioreactor technology, the new generation of biomimetic tissue&#xD;
      engineered osteochondral composites display great potential for the repair of cartilage&#xD;
      damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, in cartilage tissue engineering, seed cells are derived from autologous or&#xD;
      allogeneic chondrocytes, mesenchymal stem cells, embryonic stem cells or pluripotent stem&#xD;
      cells. Increasing evidence indicates that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells can be induced&#xD;
      to differentiate into chondrocytes, and these cells have been successfully used in the&#xD;
      treatment of large-size bone defects, cartilage lesions and spinal cord injury. The quality&#xD;
      and quantity of bone mesenchymal stem cells gradually decrease with age, especially in&#xD;
      patients with degenerative diseases. Adipose stem cells and umbilical cord mesenchymal stem&#xD;
      cells are abundant and have similar characteristics to bone mesenchymal stem cells, and both&#xD;
      of these cell types can be induced to differentiate into chondrocytes. Adipose stem cells and&#xD;
      umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells have been used to repair cartilage defects, but the&#xD;
      findings are still preliminary, and these cells cannot be harvested or cultured in large&#xD;
      quantities. Furthermore, the use of embryonic stem cells is complicated by ethical&#xD;
      considerations. As a consequence, autologous chondrocytes are optimal seed cells for&#xD;
      cartilage tissue engineering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transplantation of autologous chondrocytes in combination with tissue engineered&#xD;
      cartilage scaffolds to repair cartilage damage requires researchers to focus on two major&#xD;
      issues, namely, (i) the in vitro amplification of chondrocytes and (ii) the preparation of&#xD;
      biocompatible chondrocyte scaffolds. The preparation of chondrocyte scaffolds requires&#xD;
      advanced technique, and currently, only the Institute of Orthopedics at the Chinese PLA&#xD;
      General Hospital has the capacity to produce acellular cartilage; there is no other source of&#xD;
      tissue engineered cartilage scaffolds in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A proprietary allogeneic acellular cartilage-oriented scaffold was successfully created by&#xD;
      the Cartilage Tissue Engineering Research Group, Institute of Orthopedics, Chinese PLA&#xD;
      General Hospital (with intellectual property rights). The innovative scaffold simulates the&#xD;
      composition and spatial structural characteristics of normal cartilage. The preparation&#xD;
      methods are as follows: articular cartilage is pulverized to obtain natural cartilage&#xD;
      extracellular matrix, which is identical in biochemical composition to extracellular matrix&#xD;
      of natural articular cartilage. Then, a porous sponge-like scaffold is prepared using the&#xD;
      freeze-drying technique. In vitro experiments and large-animal articular cartilage injury&#xD;
      repair experiments have produced good results. Using this material, our research group&#xD;
      prepared biomimetic cartilage tissue engineered scaffolds, which mimic the structural&#xD;
      characteristics of natural articular cartilage extracellular matrix. This allogeneic&#xD;
      acellular cartilage scaffold has the following characteristics: (1) it is derived from&#xD;
      allogeneic cartilage, and the extracellular matrix remains intact after allografting, helping&#xD;
      to maintain the numerous components of normal cartilage, particularly type II collagen and&#xD;
      proteoglycans, resulting in enhanced repair. Cartilage scaffolds used outside of China are&#xD;
      mainly composed of types I and III collagen or hyaluronic acid, and vary greatly from natural&#xD;
      cartilage components. The original cartilage structure is difficult to reproduce with these&#xD;
      types of scaffolds, and fibrous cartilage may affect treatment outcome. (2) The biomimetic&#xD;
      scaffold has a similar three-dimensional structure to that of normal articular cartilage,&#xD;
      which is the oriented scaffold structure. The scaffold imitates the orientation of normal&#xD;
      cartilage cells, which are arranged perpendicular to the surface, and provides a paratactic&#xD;
      columnar structure that contributes to the columnar arrangement of cells. This structure in&#xD;
      combination with type II collagen and proteoglycans derived from normal articular cartilage&#xD;
      results in a scaffold structure that is extremely close to that of normal joint cartilage.&#xD;
      Consequently, the repaired cartilage will have normal structure and function. (3) The&#xD;
      oriented scaffold has a good biomechanical property. Its compressive stress is better than&#xD;
      the non-oriented scaffold in wet and dry conditions. (4) The oriented scaffold has good&#xD;
      biocompatibility. Preliminary experiments have investigated the immune responses of the&#xD;
      oriented scaffold of heterogeneous (porcine) and conspecific (rabbit) acellular cartilage.&#xD;
      After the oriented scaffold was implanted into the rabbit, its immune responses were observed&#xD;
      from the aspects of cellular immunity and humoral immunity. Results suggested that its&#xD;
      immunogenicity was low. Thus, it is verified that the oriented scaffold of acellular&#xD;
      cartilage has good biocompatibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Security Standard operating procedures for adverse events and severe adverse events will&#xD;
           be developed to ensure that any adverse reactions during the experiment will be treated&#xD;
           quickly to protect the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Definitions 2.1 Adverse events Adverse medical events may occur after cartilage&#xD;
           transplantation or microfracture surgery, but they do not necessarily have a causal&#xD;
           relationship with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Common adverse reactions after cartilage transplantation include fever, joint pain,&#xD;
           swelling and effusion. Common adverse reactions after microfracture surgery include&#xD;
           fever, joint pain, joint swelling and effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 The severity of adverse events Adverse events will be classified into three levels:&#xD;
           general adverse events, vital adverse events and severe adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3 Relationship with tissue engineered cartilage The correlation between adverse events&#xD;
           and tissue-engineered cartilage will be categorized into &quot;definitely related&quot;, &quot;probably&#xD;
           related&quot;, &quot;possibly unrelated&quot;, &quot;irrelevant&quot; or &quot;undetermined&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.4 Severe adverse events All events occurring during the trial requiring&#xD;
           hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization, or resulting in disability, or affecting&#xD;
           the ability to work, or with a risk of death or life-threatening events will be&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adverse event recording All adverse events during the experiment will be collected until&#xD;
           the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Recording and reporting All adverse events will be recorded by physicians, including&#xD;
           description of adverse events, occurrence time, end time, severity, frequency, and&#xD;
           treatment record.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Once a severe adverse event occurs, physicians will not only give necessary treatment,&#xD;
           but also truthfully report to the local Food and Drug Administration Bureau and the&#xD;
           National Food and Drug Administration Bureau within 24 hours, as well as promptly report&#xD;
           to the Ethics Committee. The data, treatment and follow-up results will be noted in the&#xD;
           report.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Follow-up observation of non-severe and severe adverse events If a patient suffers a&#xD;
           non-severe adverse event, the course and outcome will be closely monitored. The course&#xD;
           of severe adverse events will be recorded in follow-up reports or summary reports.&#xD;
           Patients will also be monitored, and observations will be recorded for a period of 30&#xD;
           days after a seizure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study hypotheses All hypotheses will be evaluated with two-tailed tests. A value of P &lt;&#xD;
           0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Baseline data comparability will be&#xD;
           assessed. Two-tailed statistical analysis will be performed with α = 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Number of cases A total of 100 patients will be involved in this study and divided into&#xD;
           two groups, with 50 cases in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Experimental analysis Experimental data will be analyzed using statistical software,&#xD;
           SPSS 22.0. Measurement data will be expressed as the mean ± SD, median, maximum, minimum&#xD;
           and quartiles; count data will be presented as a percentage (%). Count data between&#xD;
           groups will be compared using chi-square test or Fisher exact test. Measurement data&#xD;
           between groups will be compared using t-test. Nonparametric variables between groups&#xD;
           will be compared using rank sum test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be performed by professional&#xD;
           statisticians who will not be involved in the study. All data will be input and&#xD;
           reviewed, and a statistical analysis report will be prepared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preservation of articular cartilage Cartilage tissue will be preserved and transported&#xD;
           in a 50 mL centrifuge tube containing 8 mL of tissue preservation solution, placed on a&#xD;
           test tube rack on top of an ice pack, at 4 °C under sterile conditions. Cartilage tissue&#xD;
           will be transferred to the Institute of Orthopedics at the Chinese PLA General Hospital&#xD;
           within 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Chondrocyte culture and preservation Autologous chondrocytes will be cultured and&#xD;
           amplified in strict accordance with the standards and requirements of the National&#xD;
           Institutes for Food and Drug Control. All images and data will be recorded. Cartilage&#xD;
           seed cells will be frozen in liquid nitrogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data quality assurance (1) Researchers will fill in a case report form (CRF) accurately.&#xD;
           (2) Inspectors will regularly verify that all data recorded are correct and complete,&#xD;
           and that they are consistent with original records, and will be quickly transferred to&#xD;
           the data administrator. (3) The data administrator will further examine CRF tables and&#xD;
           return the form to the researchers. (4) Two data clerks will input duplicate data into a&#xD;
           computer database. (5) The two separate sets of data will be compared by computer&#xD;
           software, and modified according to the CRF. (6) Quality control: 5% of all case data&#xD;
           will be randomly selected for manual checking. If the data error is greater than 0.15%,&#xD;
           all the data in the database will be manually checked.&#xD;
