      The new device we are looking at is called the MarginProbe. It is a disposable probe which&#xD;
      measures the margins of tissue removed to check they are clear of cancer cells, during breast&#xD;
      conservation surgery. After specimen radiology, allows the Surgeon to remove further tissue&#xD;
      if necessary, during the same operation if any involved margins are identified. This&#xD;
      minimises the need for further repeat operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies carried out elsewhere in the world (USA and Israel) have identified that the&#xD;
      probe reduces re-excision rate but there has never been a study in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial involves randomly allocating patients once they are in theatre, to either the&#xD;
      MarginProbe procedure after breast conserving surgery and radiology has been completed, or&#xD;
      not.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Almost 60% of all patients diagnosed with breast cancer (48000 annually in the UK) undergo&#xD;
      breast conserving surgery (BCS. Surgical removal of the cancer aims to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      local recurrence and patient mortality. In order to minimise the amount of tissue removed,&#xD;
      excision up to the cancer-free area (margins) is undertaken. Further surgery, following&#xD;
      initial breast cancer surgery, is required in 25% - 30% of patients because of disease found&#xD;
      at the edges of the tissue removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reducing the need for further operations benefits patients (by reducing the number of&#xD;
      operations required, improving cosmetic outcome and minimising anxiety) and the NHS (by&#xD;
      realising economic benefits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MarginProbe, a disposable probe which measures the margins of tissue removed during breast&#xD;
      cancer surgery, allows the surgeon to remove further tissue during the same surgical&#xD;
      procedure to clear any involved margins, minimising subsequent re-operations. Four hundred&#xD;
      and sixty patients in 6 specialist Breast Units will be randomly allocated after BCS (and&#xD;
      specimen radiology), by telephone randomisation, to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MarginProbe assessment of the surgical specimen with re-excision of margins if required;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard BCS (clinical and radiological clear margins) whereby the wound will be closed&#xD;
           and the surgery completed (standard UK practice).&#xD;
