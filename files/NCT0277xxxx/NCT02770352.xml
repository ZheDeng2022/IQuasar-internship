  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proposal is to create a database for obstetric fistula patients at&#xD;
      Bwaila Hospital containing their demographics, obstetric history, fistula history, physical&#xD;
      exam findings, intraoperative and postoperative results. Data collection will be prospective&#xD;
      starting in 2011 upon institutional review board (IRB) approval to last a minimum of five&#xD;
      years and will have a retrospective component tracing back to January 2010. Primary goals of&#xD;
      data analysis will be to determine the risk factors for fistula formation, risk factors for&#xD;
      poor surgical outcomes and long-term incontinence, social and economic impact of fistula&#xD;
      repair, and the ability of various physical exam findings to predict likelihood of successful&#xD;
      repair. It is expected that findings will lead to improved surgical management of obstetric&#xD;
      fistulas both locally and internationally.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective and retrospective chart review of a cohort of women aged 12 years and&#xD;
      above who present to Bwaila Hospital with obstetric fistulas. Variables from existing subject&#xD;
      records tracing back to January 2010 will be input into the REDCap database and analyzed.&#xD;
      Prospective data collection will begin alongside obstetric fistula repairs upon IRB approval&#xD;
      and will last for a minimum of 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few variables were selected from the database for sample size determination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. HIV prevalence In order to assess a statistically significant difference in HIV&#xD;
           prevalence amongst fistula patients and the general population, with a projected&#xD;
           prevalence of 25% in fistula patients and 15% in the general population based on prior&#xD;
           studies, approximately 416 fistula patients would need to be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Risk factors for failure of repair-Goh classification Type 4 In order to assess a&#xD;
           statistically significant difference in failure of repair for fistula patients&#xD;
           classified based on the Goh classification as Type4 (approximately 30% failure rate&#xD;
           based on prior studies) and all other fistula patients (15% failure rate reported for&#xD;
           uncomplicated fistulas), approximately 200 patients would need to be enrolled in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that about 200 fistula patients will be enrolled into the database every&#xD;
      year. The study is expected to last a minimum of 5 years, for a total enrollment of 1250&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current Procedures For more than a year, the Freedom to Fight Fistula Foundation (FFFF) has&#xD;
      sponsored a fistula repair program at Bwaila that has consisted of visiting fistula surgeons&#xD;
      coming for short periods of time to conduct repairs. Since September 2011, a full time&#xD;
      fistula surgeon has been on site at Bwaila hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Referral to the FFFF at Bwaila occurs primarily via word-of-mouth, as currently demand highly&#xD;
      exceeds capacity. As of now, there is a waiting list of approximately 50 fistula patients.&#xD;
      Occasionally, the foundation makes visits to health centers to give educational presentations&#xD;
      on obstetric fistulas, and distributes flyers advertising its services in the local&#xD;
      community. Once the presence of a regular surgeon is established, and the waiting list is&#xD;
      diminished, the foundation anticipates increasing its advertising through newspaper and&#xD;
      radio, and by making regular visits to community events and district health centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bwaila Hospital is a hospital located in Lilongwe designated for women. It provides basic,&#xD;
      regular obstetric and gynecologic services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Bwaila Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective Arm A chart review of existing subject records tracing back to January 2010&#xD;
      will be conducted, and input in the REDCap database to the extent that it is available and&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective Arm Nurses will obtain informed consent from all patients admitted to Bwaila&#xD;
      Hospital for obstetric fistula evaluation to participate in the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will then interview the patients with a clinical history form. The information collected&#xD;
      with the form will be relevant to the care of the patient, and is part of routine care for&#xD;
      obstetric fistula patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The form includes demographic data, sexual history, obstetric history, and medical history,&#xD;
      and a depression screening and diagnostic tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the interview the patient will receive standard of care with their obstetrics doctor&#xD;
      for their fistulas (this is not part of the study): assessed for the presence of an obstetric&#xD;
      fistula; discuss possible repair; have repair; recuperate; discharged; return for follow-up&#xD;
      visits at one month and three months to assess how the patient is doing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At these visits patient will have 5 minute study interviews discussing their ability to&#xD;
      control their urination, and also how well they are getting by in their community, both&#xD;
      financially and socially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional data will be extracted directly from the patient chart as a secondary chart review&#xD;
      for the study, and will include a review of physical exam findings, preoperative findings,&#xD;
      intraoperative findings, postoperative results and follow-up findings at the one-month and&#xD;
      three-month review dates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This data will be transferred from the patient charts to REDCap. All information collected&#xD;
      will be de-identified.&#xD;
