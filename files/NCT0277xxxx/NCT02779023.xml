    <textblock>
      This study investigates the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of adding&#xD;
      Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) to the standard care received at the&#xD;
      Integrative Cardiac Health Project (ICHP) on insomnia symptoms and severity. ICHP is an&#xD;
      established cardiovascular disease prevention program to reduce cardiovascular disease risk&#xD;
      through the adoption of lifestyle changes related to improvements in diet, stress, sleep, and&#xD;
      exercise. The study will be conducted among patients with insomnia who are already enrolled&#xD;
      in the ICHP cardiovascular risk prevention program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center study, prospective, randomized, controlled, interventional trial&#xD;
      within ICHP at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC). To conduct both&#xD;
      phases of the study, up to 76 total male and female patients enrolled in ICHP who meet&#xD;
      criteria for insomnia will be recruited. Participants who meet inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria for this study, and consent to participate, will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      conditions: (1) ICHP, or (2) ICHP + CBT-I treatment. CBT-I treatment will consist of four&#xD;
      in-person appointments and two telephone appointments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methodology: Up to 76 total male and female patients enrolled in the ICHP who meet criteria&#xD;
      for insomnia will be recruited. All ICHP patients meet the following criteria before&#xD;
      enrolling in the program: military beneficiaries at least 18 years of age who are&#xD;
      self-referred or referred by their physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Participants will be selected for treatment groups based on a block&#xD;
      randomization scheme. The total number of blocks will be 19, and the number of subjects per&#xD;
      block will be 4. The treatment labels will be: ICHP and ICHP + CBT-I. The randomization&#xD;
      scheme varies the sequence of treatment categories in each block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation concealment: The allocation sequence will be concealed from the research team&#xD;
      enrolling participants in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed, and stapled envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once randomized, patients identified for the study will participate in the ICHP group or the&#xD;
      ICHP + CBT-I group (which consists of the ICHP program plus a 6-session CBT-I treatment). The&#xD;
      6 sessions will consist of 4 in-person appointments and two telephone appointments. Each&#xD;
      in-person session will be approximately 1 hour, and each phone session will be approximately&#xD;
      30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study data will be analyzed in two phases. Phase I will be a pilot study to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of CBT-I within the ICHP program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II will be implementation of the full RCT to determine the effectiveness of the CBT-I&#xD;
      intervention compared to ICHP usual care. Data collected during Phase I will be utilized in&#xD;
      the final analysis unless changes to the procedures which could affect outcome measures are&#xD;
      made after participants begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I (feasibility and acceptability): Primary outcomes for Phase I of the study will be&#xD;
      descriptive statistics on feasibility and acceptability measures as well as qualitative&#xD;
      responses to a post-treatment interview with participants. Secondary outcomes for Phase I&#xD;
      will be between-group differences in sleep outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimum criteria for advancing to Phase II include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment rate: Average of 21 participants enrolled per year. If the recruitment rate&#xD;
           during Phase I is not sufficient to enroll 21 participants per year during Phase II, it&#xD;
           will be necessary to modify the recruitment strategy in order to increase the rate of&#xD;
           participant enrollment before proceeding to Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment acceptability rate, as measured by both of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  50% of Phase I participants scoring question 3 of the Insomnia Treatment Evaluation&#xD;
                Measure-Revised (ITEM-R) as a &quot;3&quot; or &quot;4.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Question 3 asks: &quot;How satisfied are you with the treatment received&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Minimum of 50% of participants answering question 1 of the Post-Study Questionnaire&#xD;
                (&quot;Did you find this insomnia treatment valuable and useful to you?&quot;) as: ◦&quot;Yes&quot;&#xD;
                (item a) or ◦&quot;Moderately Useful&quot; (item c)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II (effectiveness of intervention): Primary outcomes for Phase II will be between-group&#xD;
      differences in level of change in sleep outcomes. Secondary outcomes for Phase II will&#xD;
      include: between-group differences in changes in depression, fatigue, perceived stress,&#xD;
      sleepiness, and sleep-related quality of life. Tertiary outcomes (exploratory) will include&#xD;
      changes in secondary cardiovascular risk factors.&#xD;
