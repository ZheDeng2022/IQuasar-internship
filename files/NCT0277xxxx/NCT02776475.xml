    <textblock>
      This prospective one group cohort study seeks to investigate the effects of sacral&#xD;
      neuromodulation on urinary urgency, frequency and urge incontinence are maintained after the&#xD;
      simulator device is temporarily turned off for a period of four weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence are very common symptoms, affecting up to&#xD;
      one in three adults in the United States. The total economic cost of these disorders was&#xD;
      estimated to be above $12 billion in the year 2000, with the vast majority being for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) has become a popular and successful treatment option for people&#xD;
      who suffer from these conditions. Sacral neuromodulation device delivers electrical pulses to&#xD;
      an area near the sacral nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been some data published which showed that for patients with fecal incontinence,&#xD;
      symptom relief can persist for significant time periods despite having the stimulator device&#xD;
      turned off. Based on their findings, potential exists to prolong battery life if patients can&#xD;
      cycle the on and off periods for their device while keeping their symptoms stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The typical battery life of the implantable pulse generator (IPG) is approximately 5 years&#xD;
      depending on the system settings. When the IPG is at the end of its battery life, a new IPG&#xD;
      must be implanted. The cost of replacing the IPG ranges from $13,952 to $16,470. IPG&#xD;
      replacement must be done in the operating room and requires the patient to undergo anesthesia&#xD;
      and its associated risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate whether the symptoms of urinary urgency, frequency, and urge&#xD;
      incontinence remain stable in patients with SNM with the device turned off for a period of&#xD;
      four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current Cincinnati Urogynecology Associates (CUA) patients who are currently being&#xD;
      successfully treated with sacral neuromodulation for the primary diagnosis of urinary urge&#xD;
      incontinence or urgency and frequency who elect participate in the study will have the device&#xD;
      turned off for four consecutive weeks. Their symptoms will be monitored during this time&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
