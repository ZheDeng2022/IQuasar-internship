  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the administration of porcine surfactant (poractant alfa, Curosurf®)&#xD;
      through a less invasive method (LISA) using a thin catheter, CHF 6440 (LISACATH®), during&#xD;
      non-invasive ventilation (CPAP, NIPPV, BiPAP) with an approved conventional surfactant&#xD;
      administration during invasive ventilation followed by rapid extubation in terms of short&#xD;
      term and mid-term safety and efficacy in spontaneously breathing preterm neonates with&#xD;
      clinical signs of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, multicenter, randomized, controlled study of spontaneously&#xD;
      breathing neonates with RDS. Neonates will be evaluated according to the selection criteria&#xD;
      and then randomized to surfactant treatment via LISA or standard administration procedure.&#xD;
      The enrollment will be staggered: the gestational age will be restricted to 27+0 weeks up to&#xD;
      28+6 weeks for the first 15 neonates. Provided no safety concerns are raised, the enrollment&#xD;
      will then be extended to the whole population (i.e. 25+0 weeks up to 28+6 weeks). Enrolled&#xD;
      neonates will be evaluated in a main phase of the trial until discharge or 40 wks&#xD;
      post-menstrual age (PMA), whichever comes first. Their clinical status and neurodevelopment&#xD;
      will be assessed at 24-month corrected age as a separate stand-alone visit.&#xD;
