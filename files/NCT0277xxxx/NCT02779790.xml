    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Weight loss is an&#xD;
      important therapeutic goal for overweight and obese patients to reduce their risk of&#xD;
      developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Liquid meal replacements (LMRs) are simple&#xD;
      tools that may aid in weight loss and may improve weight-related risk cardiometabolic risk&#xD;
      factors. There is a need to synthesize the evidence on LMRs and cardiometabolic risk to&#xD;
      inform clinical practice guidelines. The authors propose to conduct a series of systematic&#xD;
      review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effect of LMRs on 4&#xD;
      areas of cardiometabolic risk: markers of adipsoity, glycemic control, established lipid&#xD;
      targets, and blood pressure.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Liquid meal replacements (LMRs) provide a mixture of carbohydrate, fat and&#xD;
      protein, along with added vitamins and minerals in liquid ready-to-drink form or powder&#xD;
      formulas that require mixing. They are designed to mimic a low-calorie meal and serve as a&#xD;
      quick and easy source of calories to consume. Behavioral strategy tools are important to&#xD;
      assist obese individuals in losing weight and maintaining weight loss. There is evidence that&#xD;
      LMRs contribute to weight loss and may reduce related cardiometabolic risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for proposed research: An earlier meta-analysis demonstrated that partial meal&#xD;
      replacement plans produced significant weight loss and improved weight-related&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk factors. Several controlled trials have since investigated the effect of&#xD;
      liquid meal replacements on body weight and weight-related risk factors for disease. There is&#xD;
      a need to update of the evidence of the effect of LMRs on cardiometabolic risk to inform&#xD;
      dietary guidelines and public health policy development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To synthesize the evidence of randomized controlled trials of the effect of LMRs&#xD;
      on body weight, blood pressure, glycemic control and established lipid targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted according to the Cochrane&#xD;
      Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reported according to the Preferred&#xD;
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials&#xD;
      (Clinical Trials; CENTRAL) will be searched using appropriate search terms supplemented by&#xD;
      manual searches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: The investigators will include randomized controlled trials of &gt;= 2-weeks&#xD;
      duration that assess the effect of LMRs versus control diets on body weight, blood pressure,&#xD;
      markers of glycemic control and lipid profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: Two or more investigators will independently extract relevant data and&#xD;
      assess risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. All disagreements will be resolved&#xD;
      by consensus. Standard computations and imputations will be used to derive missing variance&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Four sets of outcomes will be assessed: (1) Markers of adiposity (body weight, BMI,&#xD;
      body fat, waist circumference), (2) glycemic control (HbA1c, fasting glucose, and fasting&#xD;
      insulin), (3) Established therapeutic lipid targets (LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol,&#xD;
      apolipoprotein B, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides), and (4) blood pressure (systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure and diastolic blood pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis: Pooled analyses of the mean difference will be performed using the generic&#xD;
      inverse variance method. Random-effects models will be used even in the absence of&#xD;
      statistically significant between-study heterogeneity because they yield more conservative&#xD;
      summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity. Fixed-effects models will&#xD;
      be used only if there are less than 5 included trials. Crossover trials will be assessed via&#xD;
      paired analyses. Heterogeneity will be assessed by the Cochran Q statistic and quantified by&#xD;
      the I2 statistic. To explore sources of heterogeneity, the investigators will conduct&#xD;
      sensitivity analyses, in which each study is systematically removed. If there are &gt;= 10&#xD;
      trials, the study investigators will conduct apriori subgroup analyses by liquid meal&#xD;
      replacement type (diabetes-specific formula, soy-based formula and fiber-containing formula),&#xD;
      age, health status (presence/absence of type 2 diabetes), comparator, dose, baseline&#xD;
      measurements, study design (parallel, crossover), follow-up (&lt;= 3 months, &gt; 3 months) and&#xD;
      risk of bias. Meta-regression analyses will assess the significance of categorical and&#xD;
      continuous subgroup analyses. When &gt;= 10 trials are available, publication bias will be&#xD;
      investigated by funnel plots and formal testing using Egger and Begg tests. If publication&#xD;
      bias is suspected, then the investigators will attempt to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry by&#xD;
      imputing the missing study data using the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence assessment: The strength of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: The results will be disseminated through interactive&#xD;
      presentations at local, national and international scientific meetings and publication in&#xD;
      high impact factor journals. Target audiences will include the public health and scientific&#xD;
      communities with interest in nutrition and obesity. Feedback will be incorporated and used to&#xD;
      improve the public health message and key areas for future research will be defined.&#xD;
      Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers will network among opinion leaders to increase&#xD;
      awareness and participate directly as committee members in the development of future&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The proposed research will synthesize the highest quality evidence from&#xD;
      randomized trials and aid in knowledge translation of the effect of LMRs on body weight and&#xD;
      related cardiometabolic disease risk. It will strengthen the evidence-base for guidelines,&#xD;
      improve health outcomes, by educating healthcare providers and patients, stimulating industry&#xD;
      innovation, and guiding future research design.&#xD;
