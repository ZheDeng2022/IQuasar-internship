  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 10-20% of older patients in primary care suffer from symptoms of depression and/or&#xD;
      anxiety. Depression and anxiety are associated with higher rates of cognitive decline, lower&#xD;
      quality of life, increased medical comorbidity, and higher mortality rates in these patients.&#xD;
      Given the world's aging population and consequent rapid increase in older patients in primary&#xD;
      care, many traditional therapeutic approaches for depression or anxiety in this patient&#xD;
      population - e.g. assessment by a mental health practitioner, individual psychotherapy and/or&#xD;
      appropriate psychotropic medication - have been inadequate, with many patients having&#xD;
      undetected depression and anxiety. Additionally, geriatric depression and anxiety are very&#xD;
      common, but difficult to treat with psychotropic medications: patients are more sensitive to&#xD;
      adverse effects and respond relatively less well to medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help with this issue, the investigators are conducting a randomized controlled trial of&#xD;
      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), a treatment that has been highly effective in&#xD;
      treating depression and anxiety, but has not yet been assessed in older adults. There has&#xD;
      been relatively little information about MBCT's effectiveness, particularly in the primary&#xD;
      care setting and in the acute treatment of depression and anxiety(vs. maintenance treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in 75-100 older adults in primary care with symptoms of anxiety&#xD;
      and depression. The study will take place in the &quot;centre local de services communautaires&quot;&#xD;
      CLSC Benny Farm, a primary health care centre in Montreal, Canada. Most patients aged 60+&#xD;
      with symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) score ≥10) or anxiety&#xD;
      (General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD- 7) score ≥10) will be eligible. Patients who are eligible&#xD;
      for the study will be randomized: half the patients will get 8-week MBCT with a trained&#xD;
      interventionist (occupational therapist, psychiatry resident, or psychiatrist). The other&#xD;
      half (control group) will get patient treatment as usual with patient primary care&#xD;
      physician/primary care team during the study, but then after the study, patients will be&#xD;
      offered the treatment if patients would like.&#xD;

    <description>Mindfulness Based Cognitive therapy (MBCT) will consist of group meditative practices, lasting 2 hours per week (or whatever the patient can tolerate). The interventions will be conducted at the &quot;centre local de services communautaires&quot; (CLSC) Benny Farm, once a week. Patients will be invited to try various techniques during sessions. The patients will be encouraged to practice the Mindfulness techniques, that includes formal mindfulness meditation and informal mindfulness practices (e.g. being in the present moment while not meditating), at home, between sessions, and will be provided with meditation compact discs to help them do so. MBCT interventions also include a cognitive therapy perspective. Specifically, the interventionists will offer education regarding depression and anxiety and will work on automatic mental processes that are believed to be at the root of the recurrence of depressive and anxious symptoms.</description>
