      Relationship of haptoglobin phenotype to vascular function and response to Vitamin E&#xD;
      supplementation in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: The EVAS Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phenotype haptoglobin 2-2 (Hp 2-2) is associated with higher oxidative stress,&#xD;
      inflammation, LDL peroxidation and higher cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes. We&#xD;
      aim to determine whether Hp 2-2 phenotype is associated with surrogate markers of&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk, inflammation, lipids and lipoprotein profile, oxidative stress, and&#xD;
      endothelial cell (EC) apoptosis (in vitro study) in patients with diabetes in our population&#xD;
      and whether vitamin E supplementation mitigates this risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 300 patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 (100 Chinese, 100 Malays and 100&#xD;
      Indians) and assess their Hp phenotype, surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk,&#xD;
      inflammation, vascular biomarkers and lipids phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma from 20 patients with Hp 2-2 phenotype and 20 patients with non Hp 2-2 phenotype will&#xD;
      be studied in vitro using a haemodynamic lab-on-chip system to determine whether there is a&#xD;
      difference in EC apoptosis between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Phase 200 patients will be recruited to a pilot randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT), stratified by Hp 2-2 phenotype status (100 Hp 2-2 and 100 non-Hp 2-2), and randomly&#xD;
      allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either vitamin E 400 IU supplementation daily for 6 months or a&#xD;
      placebo group. The trial will determine whether vitamin E improves the aforementioned&#xD;
      surrogate markers in the Hp phenotype strata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of proposed research to science and medicine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study allows us to understand the possible mechanism of cardiovascular risk in patients&#xD;
      with Hp 2-2 phenotype and to see whether vitamin E supplementation reduces this risk in a&#xD;
      pharmacogenomic targeted manner.&#xD;

      1.0 Background and Clinical Significance 1.1 Introduction The incidence of Diabetes Mellitus&#xD;
      type 2 (DM2) is growing rapidly globally and in Singapore. The main cause of increased&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in patients with DM2 is the development of microvascular and&#xD;
      macrovascular complications. Although strict glycaemic control has been proven to reduce&#xD;
      microvascular complications, the evidence is still lacking with regards to macrovascular&#xD;
      complications. Accelerated atherosclerosis is the leading cause of increased mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity in these patients. It is of paramount importance to assess novel targets to control&#xD;
      atherosclerosis in patients with DM2 on top of conventional treatment. There is an unmet need&#xD;
      to find new targets or markers predicting increased risk in patients with diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      and we need to consider alternative treatments on top of conventional targets to reduce risk&#xD;
      in these high risk group patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with DM2 are not only at an increased risk for atherosclerosis, they also carry a&#xD;
      greater extent of the disease burden. Endothelial dysfunction is considered the hallmark of&#xD;
      the pathological insult inflicted on the blood vessels. Hyperglycaemia affects mitochondrial,&#xD;
      enzymatic, and non-enzymatic pathways associated with the generation of reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species (ROS), leading to decreased nitric oxide bioavailability and endothelial dysfunction,&#xD;
      commonly demonstrated by reduced endothelium dependent vasodilatation and increased plasma&#xD;
      levels of endothelium derived regulatory proteins. Moreover, DM2 patients have compromised&#xD;
      antioxidant defenses in the form of low levels of the antioxidant enzymes and&#xD;
      alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), which may impede an adequate compensation for the increase in&#xD;
      oxidative stress. Another role of oxidative stress in mediating the development of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis has also been demonstrated in the oxidative hypothesis. In this model the&#xD;
      most prominent target for oxidative modification is the LDL molecule. Oxidised LDL is not&#xD;
      recognized by the LDL receptor but is readily taken up by the CD36 scavenger receptor pathway&#xD;
      in macrophages leading to appreciable cholesteryl ester accumulation and foam cell formation.&#xD;
      Oxidized LDL is proinflammatory, it causes inhibition of endothelial NO synthetase, promotes&#xD;
      vasoconstriction and monocyte adhesion, and promotes platelet aggregation and thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hp Phenotype and Oxidative Tissue Damage&#xD;
&#xD;
      The haptoglobin (Hp) protein is an antioxidant due to its ability to neutralize the oxidative&#xD;
      activity of haemoglobin (Hb). In humans, Hp is characterised by a genetic polymorphism with&#xD;
      three structurally different phenotypes (Hp1-1, Hp 2-1 and Hp 2-2 which result from&#xD;
      expression of two different alleles (Hp 1 and Hp 2) of the haptoglobin gene located on&#xD;
      chromosome 16q22. The protein product of the Hp2 allele is an inferior antioxidant compared&#xD;
      to Hp1 allele product. Hp 1-1 is a small molecule (86kDa) of well-defined structure, whereas&#xD;
      Hp 2-1 is characterised by heteropolymers (86-300 kDA) and Hp 2-2 forms large macromolecular&#xD;
      complexes (170-1,000 kDa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The function of Hp is to bind free Hb released from red blood cells, which is released into&#xD;
      the blood during the natural turnover of red blood cells. Free Hb is capable of causing&#xD;
      considerable oxidative tissue damage as a result of its heme iron. However, whenever Hb is&#xD;
      released into the circulation it immediately binds to Hp with extremely high affinity to form&#xD;
      an Hp-Hb complex. This binding serves to inhibit the oxidative potential of Hb by preventing&#xD;
      the release of heme iron from Hb. Hp is normally found in the blood in a more than 400-fold&#xD;
      molar excess to free Hb and therefore Hp is capable of binding all of the Hb that is released&#xD;
      during normal red blood cell turnover. Once Hb is bound to Hp it is rapidly cleared from the&#xD;
      blood stream via the CD163 scavenger receptor expressed on monocyte/macrophages, however,&#xD;
      formation and clearance of Hp-Hb complexes are impaired in Hp 2-2 phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron derived from Hb can catalyse a number of oxidative reactions which can be inhibited by&#xD;
      Hp .&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ferrous heme iron (Fe2+) can react with hydrogen peroxide to yield ferric Hb (Fe3+) and&#xD;
           the highly reactive hydroxyl radical species. By abstracting a hydrogen atom from&#xD;
           polyunsaturated fatty acids, hydroxyl radicals may initiate the process of lipid&#xD;
           peroxidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ferrous Hb (Fe2+) can also react with hydrogen peroxide to produce ferryl Hb (Fe4+), a&#xD;
           highly unstable molecule which readily reacts with a second molecule of hydrogen&#xD;
           peroxide to yield ferric Hb (Fe3+) and superoxide anion. The damaging effects of&#xD;
           superoxide anion are two-fold: reduction of ferric iron (Fe3+) in Hb to ferrous iron&#xD;
           (Fe2+), allowing for the production of additional hydroxyl radical as described in&#xD;
           reaction 1, and dismutation of superoxide anion to produce hydrogen peroxide, again&#xD;
           promoting the production of ROS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ferric Hb (containing Fe3+), also known as methaemoglobin, can spontaneously transfer&#xD;
           its heme moiety resulting in heme entry into diverse lipophilic environments such as LDL&#xD;
           or cell membranes. Once intercalated into its new lipid environment, heme iron can&#xD;
           undergo reactions with hydrogen peroxide as described above or with adjacent lipid&#xD;
           peroxides generating a free radical cascade and leading to extensive lipid oxidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As a part of the Hp-Hb complex, Hp stabilizes heme in the heme pocket of Hb, and&#xD;
           prevents Hb from causing oxidative injury . However, the degree to which Hp neutralizes&#xD;
           the redox activity of heme iron differs among Hp types. This has been shown in a number&#xD;
           of systems both in vitro and in vivo. For example, studies using linolenic acid showed&#xD;
           that Hp 1-1 prevented oxidation (diene formation) as measured by an increase in&#xD;
           absorbance at 232 nm to a greater extent than Hp 2-2 . Another study examined LDL&#xD;
           oxidation due to heme transfer from Hb to LDL. Heme transfer was measured by quenching&#xD;
           of the fluorescence signal emitted by dansylated LDL. It was found that Hp 1-1 was&#xD;
           superior in preventing heme transfer from Hb as compared to Hp 2-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hp Phenotypes and Cardiovascular Risk Studies have shown that Hp 2-2 Hb complexes are&#xD;
           also cleared less efficiently than non Hp 2-2 Hb complexes. In DM2 patients this&#xD;
           phenomenon is more pronounced due to the downregulation of CD163, particularly in Hp 2-2&#xD;
           individuals. An impairment in anti-inflammatory macrophage signalling through a&#xD;
           CD163/pAkt /IL-10 axis is also seen in Hp 2-2 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hp-Hb deficient clearance in Hp 2-2 DM2 individuals results in increased Hp-Hb binding&#xD;
           to Apo A1 on high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), thereby tethering the pro-oxidative heme&#xD;
           moiety to HDL. This renders it deficient in its ability to reverse transfer cholesterol&#xD;
           from macrophages.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Hp 2-2 protein is less efficient at blocking heme transfer from Hb compared to Hp&#xD;
           1-1. Furthermore, the increase in heme transfer when Hb is glycosylated may provide a&#xD;
           mechanistic explanation for the increase in cardiovascular disease seen in Hp 2-2 DM2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hence Hp 2-2 phenotype is associated with decreased ability to bind with Hb, decreased&#xD;
           clearance of Hp 2-2 Hb complexes, impairment in anti-inflammatory signalling pathway,&#xD;
           increased LDL oxidation, renders HDL-Cholesterol inefficient and less efficient in&#xD;
           blocking heme transfer from Hb to Hp 1-1 all leading to a higher cardiovascular risk. In&#xD;
           diabetes patients where some of these pathways are also affected the synergetic effect&#xD;
           of hyperglycaemia and haptoglobin phenotype is exacerbated leading to higher risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In longitudinal studies done in other populations, it has been seen that Hp 2-2 genotype&#xD;
           is associated with a 2-5 fold increased risk of incident CVD in individuals with DM. In&#xD;
           particular the strong heart study the odds ratio of having CVD in DM with the Hp 2-2&#xD;
           phenotype was 2-5 times greater than in DM with Hp 2-1 phenotype (p=0.002). In the&#xD;
           Munich Stent study a consecutive series of 935 treated diabetic individuals were&#xD;
           followed up for one year after stenting for major adverse cardiac events. In this study&#xD;
           the haptoglobin 2-2 phenotype was seen to be an independent predictor of major adverse&#xD;
           cardiac events. In addition it has been seen that vitamin E provides substantial&#xD;
           cardiovascular benefit to Hp 2-2 DM patients in one population (Israel-ICARE STUDY) and&#xD;
           post-hoc analysis of the WHS (Women Health Study,) and HOPE study to see whether Vitamin&#xD;
           E supplementation in subgroup of patients with the haptoglobin 2-2 phenotype influenced&#xD;
           mortality showed a non-significant reduction in total mortality. This has not been&#xD;
           widely adopted as larger trials, and on multiple populations, are needed to substantiate&#xD;
           the association and benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hp Phenotype and Ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
           In a local study done in Singapore, it has been seen that the frequency of the Hp genes&#xD;
           vary in the different ethnicities as follows :Chinese Hp1:0.330;Hp2:0.670;Hp0: 0.029;&#xD;
           Malays:Hp1:0.298;Hp2:0.702 ;Hp0:0.004; Indians Hp1: 0.167;Hp2:0.833;Hp0:0.009. The&#xD;
           distribution of the Hp frequencies has been seen to be at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in&#xD;
           our population hence the expected prevalence of Hp 2-2 is around 30-40%. The Hp&#xD;
           phenotypes will be determined by TaqMan analysis at the TTSH Research Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Haptoglobin genotypes and endothelial function&#xD;
&#xD;
           Endothelial dysfunction has received increasing attention as a potential contributor to&#xD;
           pathogenesis of vascular disease in DM. In DM2, the natural delicate balance in the&#xD;
           release of contracting and relaxing factors by the endothelium is altered which&#xD;
           contributes to further vascular and end-organ damage. Impaired endothelial function has&#xD;
           been postulated to provide a final common pathway by which multiple risk factors exert&#xD;
           their deleterious effects on cardiovascular health and has been established as a&#xD;
           powerful surrogate marker for cardiovascular risk with one study showing even better&#xD;
           predictability than the Framingham risk score . The EndoPAT 2000 device will be used as&#xD;
           this has been established for estimation of endothelial function in a non-invasive&#xD;
           manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are no direct studies done on looking at an association of Hp genotypes to&#xD;
           endothelial function, in one pilot study wherein endothelial function was assessed using&#xD;
           post-ischemic reactive hyperaemia and strain gauge plethysmography and expressed as&#xD;
           maximal flow after an ischemic period, it was seen that Hp 2-2 patients with diabetes&#xD;
           had worse endothelial function compared to non Hp 2-2 patients (450 +-50 versus&#xD;
           600+-40).&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Haptoglobin genotypes and CIMT (Carotid intima media thickness)&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the Diabetes Heart study, genetic analyses of Hp genotypes showed an association&#xD;
           between Hp 2-2 genotype and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT). These measurements&#xD;
           will be made with the subject lying down, with the head extended and slightly turned&#xD;
           opposite to the carotid examined, following the recommendations of the Mannheim CIMT&#xD;
           consensus.Two investigators have estimated the CIMT in 23 individuals and a Bland-Altman&#xD;
           plot was plotted and the limits of inter-user agreement was found to be within -0.1 to&#xD;
           +0.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4 Haptoglobin genotypes and aortic artery stiffness&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although there are no direct studies done comparing Hp genotypes and aortic artery&#xD;
           stiffness, one study was done wherein they evaluated the arterial elasticity of large&#xD;
           and small arteries using pulse wave contour analysis method. The large artery elasticity&#xD;
           index was lower in patients with Hp 2-2 compared with Hp 1-1 (8.4 +-2.3 ml/mmHg versus&#xD;
           12.6 +-4.1 ml/mmHg x 100; p&lt;0.0001). In this study the small artery elasticity index was&#xD;
           also significantly lower in patients with Hp 2-2 phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Increased vascular stiffness has been seen early in the course of Diabetes Mellitus Type&#xD;
           2 using sphygmocor device. It is likely that this stiffness is related to endothelial&#xD;
           dysfunction rather than structural vascular alterations-this in turn suggests that it is&#xD;
           reversible. Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), a measure of aortic distensibility, has&#xD;
           also been seen to predict mortality in patients with diabetes independently of known&#xD;
           confounding factors. The SphygmoCor Xcel device to estimate the aortic artery stiffness&#xD;
           using the carotid to femoral pulse wave velocity and central aortic pressure will be&#xD;
           used. The investigators will estimate the pulse wave velocity in 20 individuals in order&#xD;
           to establish the limits of agreement using the Bland-Altman plot before starting the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.5 Haptoglobin genotypes and vascular markers&#xD;
&#xD;
           Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1&#xD;
           (ICAM-1) are proteins expressed on the surface of activated endothelial cells (ECs) and&#xD;
           expressed in early atherosclerosis. These markers have been evaluated and considered&#xD;
           good markers of endothelial dysfunction because part of the protein is shed in the&#xD;
           circulation and can be detected in peripheral plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.6 Haptoglobin genotypes and phenotyping of plasma lipids&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hp 2-2 phenotype has been associated with higher oxidised LDL concentrations, which is&#xD;
           primarily involved in atherosclerosis. The concentrations of Apo-A1 HDL is also known to&#xD;
           be higher in this group of patients. Hp 2-2 phenotype may also be associated with higher&#xD;
           Lp(a) concentrations putting these patients at higher cardiovascular risk. Detailed&#xD;
           phenotyping of plasma lipids using proteomics to look for novel associations will be&#xD;
           done.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.7 Haptoglobin genotypes and Oxidative Stress&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is known that Hp 2-2 genotype confers a higher oxidative stress on the endothelium.&#xD;
           The total oxidative potential will be calculated as the Oxidative-INDEX. Two tests will&#xD;
           be done as follows to calculate this index. This index has been established as a good&#xD;
           estimate of the overall oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. d-ROMs test: This test will be performed on serum samples by using automated d-ROMs&#xD;
                method. (Vassalle C, Pratali L, Boni C, Mercuri A, Ndreu R. An oxidative stress&#xD;
                score as a combined measure of the pro-oxidant and anti-oxidant counterparts in&#xD;
                patients with coronary artery disease. Clin Biochem 2008;41:1162-7)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. FRAP (ferric reducing ability of plasma - a measure of the ability of the plasma to&#xD;
                prevent damage to vessels) and d-ROMs (derivatives for the Reactive Oxygen&#xD;
                Metabolites) test will be used to calculate the oxidative stress score.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Other markers of oxidative stress will also be measured such as glyoxal, methylglyoxal,&#xD;
           asymmetric dimethylarginine and homoarginine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.8 Haptoglobin genotypes and retinal Arteriovenous index&#xD;
&#xD;
           The presence of retinal microvascular abnormalities especially arterial constriction and&#xD;
           venular dilatation has been associated with an increased cardiovascular risk and has&#xD;
           been associated with endothelial dysfunction and inflammation.Currently there are no&#xD;
           studies looking at the relationship between Hp genotypes and retinal arteriovenous (AV)&#xD;
           index. . Prior to the investigations, eye drops will be instilled to dilate pupils for&#xD;
           fundus examination and to lubricate the cornea. Retinal imaging will be done for the&#xD;
           subjects at the eye clinic. If patients do not wish to participate in the retinal&#xD;
           imaging, they may choose to opt out from the retinal imaging test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.0 Vitamin E, haptoglobin phenotype and cardiovascular risk reduction&#xD;
&#xD;
           While functional differences between Hp1 and Hp2 allelic protein products particularly&#xD;
           in DM can explain the differences in susceptibility to complications in the Hp 2-2&#xD;
           individuals from non Hp 2-2 individuals, the main reason of unique benefit from vitamin&#xD;
           E is that redox active Hb is associated with HDL only in Hp 2-2 DM individuals. In&#xD;
           patients with DM decreased Hp-Hb complexes results in increased Hp-Hb binding to Apo-A1&#xD;
           on high-density lipoprotein (HDL), thereby tethering the pro-oxidative heme moiety to&#xD;
           HDL. HDL in Hp 2-2 DM individuals is deficient in its ability to stimulate the reverse&#xD;
           transfer of cholesterol from macrophages. Besides these, the Hp phenotype 2-2 is&#xD;
           associated with increased oxidative stress due to deficient clearance of free radicals&#xD;
           and increased LDL peroxidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Vitamin E is a potent antioxidant with anti-inflammatory properties. It significantly&#xD;
           alleviates the condition of oxidative stress by both its potent free radical scavenging&#xD;
           properties and by interacting directly and strongly with the antioxidant enzymes.&#xD;
           Vitamin E supplementation in humans and animal models has shown to decrease lipid&#xD;
           peroxidation, superoxide production and decreasing the expression of scavenger receptors&#xD;
           (SR-A and CD36) which are particularly important in the formation of foam cells.&#xD;
           Although vitamin E has not been proven to be useful in reducing cardiovascular risk in&#xD;
           the general population, it has been useful in patients with Hp 2-2 phenotype with DM,&#xD;
           both conditions which increase oxidative stress substantially in studies done in one&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There have been only three interventional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which&#xD;
           the only antioxidant which the DM participants received was vitamin E and in which the&#xD;
           Hp type of study participants was determined. The ICARE study was the only RCT aimed to&#xD;
           evaluate vitamin E in DM patients for which Hp genotype was prospectively collected. In&#xD;
           this study, 1,434 DM individuals &gt; or = 55 years of age with the Hp 2-2 phenotype were&#xD;
           randomised to vitamin E (400 IU/day/placebo). The primary composite outcome was&#xD;
           significantly reduced in individuals receiving vitamin E (2.2%) compared to placebo&#xD;
           (4.7%, p=0.001) at 18 months after initiation of the trial when it was terminated.&#xD;
           Additionally, blood samples from a subset of patients recruited for the WHS and HOPE&#xD;
           studies were analysed for Hp polymorphism, and the outcomes reassessed according to the&#xD;
           patient's Hp type. In all these studies, a higher risk of cardiovascular events was seen&#xD;
           in Hp 2-2 individuals and a benefit to vitamin E supplementation was seen in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1 Justification for dose and duration of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol).&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will be using vitamin E 400 IU per day and matched placebo. We will commission the&#xD;
           company Beacons who will prepare the vitamin E capsules (400 IU) and the matching&#xD;
           placebo capsules. Vitamin E preparation will be the natural tocopherol which occurs in&#xD;
           the RRR-configuration. We will give vitamin E 400 IU for 6 months as most studies using&#xD;
           surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk has seen an improvement in 6 months after&#xD;
           supplementation. Moreover, in the ICARE study mentioned above an improvement in&#xD;
           cardiovascular outcome was seen at 18 months thus suggesting that 6 months should be&#xD;
           adequate duration to see an improvement in surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The eight forms of vitamin E are divided into two groups; four are tocopherols and four&#xD;
           are tocotrienols. They are identified by prefixes alpha- (α-), beta- (β-), gamma- (γ-),&#xD;
           and delta- (δ-). alpha-tocopherol is the most abundant form in nature, known to have the&#xD;
           highest biological activity based on fetal resortion assays and reverses vitamin E&#xD;
           deficiency symptoms in humans. Natural tocopherols occur in the RRR-configuration only.&#xD;
           The synthetic form contains eight different stereoisomers and is called&#xD;
           'all-rac'-α-tocopherol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Vitamin E is found in its natural form in vegetable oils (wheat germ, sunflower,&#xD;
           safflower, corn and soybean oils), nuts (almonds, peanuts and hazelnuts), seeds&#xD;
           (sunflower seeds), green leafy vegetables (spinach and broccoli) and fortified breakfast&#xD;
           cereals, fruit juices, margarine and spreads. The institute of Medicine recommended&#xD;
           intakes for individuals is about 15mg/day. The highest safe level of vitamin E&#xD;
           supplements for adults is 1,500 IU/day for natural forms of vitamin E, and 1,000 IU/day&#xD;
           for the man-made (synthetic) form. Popular vitamin E supplements available includes,&#xD;
           D-alpha tocopherol which is derived from natural oils. Commercially available vitamin E&#xD;
           supplements usually contain only alpha-tocopherol provided either unesterified or as the&#xD;
           ester of acetate, succinate or nicotinate. In humans, free and esterified&#xD;
           alpha-tocopherol have the same bioavailability. Supplements can contain either the&#xD;
           natural RRR-or synthetic (all-rac) alpha-tocopherol. The biological activity of natural&#xD;
           RRR alpha-tocopherol is higher than that of synthetic all-rac-alpha-tocopherol and other&#xD;
           natural forms of vitamin E.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Both oxidative stress and individual genetic makeup contribute to vitamin E homeostasis&#xD;
           in humans and this may be responsible for the variable clinical effects seen in&#xD;
           improvement of clinical variables in clinical trials. Vitamin E is absorbed in the&#xD;
           intestine, enters the circulation via the lymphatic system where absorbed together with&#xD;
           lipids, it is packed into chylomicrons and transported to the liver. After passage&#xD;
           through the liver, only alpha-tocopherol preferentially appears in the plasma and most&#xD;
           of the other forms of vitamin E is preferentially metabolised and either secreted in the&#xD;
           bile or not taken up and excreted in the faeces. In the liver, hepatic alpha-tocopherol&#xD;
           transfer protein (α-TTP) specifically sorts out the α- form with the 2R-stereoisomers.&#xD;
           Plasma RRR-α-tocopherol incorporation is a saturable process. Plasma levels of&#xD;
           RRR-α-tocopherol cease to increase at approximately 80 μM despite increasing dosages of&#xD;
           vitamin E supplementation of up to 1,320 mg all-rac-α-tocopherol per day. This is likely&#xD;
           secondary to the rapid replacement of circulating with newly absorbed α-tocopherol and&#xD;
           kinetic analyses demonstrates that the entire pool of α-tocopherol is replaced daily. In&#xD;
           humans, the preferential accumulation of α-tocopherol in the body is dependent upon both&#xD;
           a functional α-TTP and increased metabolism and excretion of non-α-tocopherols. The&#xD;
           alpha-tocopherol transfer protein regulates whole-body distribution and concentrations&#xD;
           of vitamin E by controlling the secretion of vitamin E from the liver. It has been seen&#xD;
           that the expression of the alpha-tocopherol transfer protein gene can be induced by&#xD;
           oxidative stress and hypoxia, by agonists of the nuclear receptor PPARα and RXR, and by&#xD;
           increasing cAMP levels. This is mediated by an already present transcription factor&#xD;
           called cAMP response element-binding (CREB) transcription factor. Single-nucleotide&#xD;
           polymorphisms that are commonly found in healthy people drastically affect promoter&#xD;
           activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Various doses of vitamin E ranging from 400 IU to 2,000 IU have been used in clinical&#xD;
           trials. The institute of medicine, USA suggests a recommended dietary intake (RDA) of&#xD;
           15-1,000 mg/day (1 mg =1.5 IU; 22.5-1,500 IU/day). We are using a dose of 400 IU for six&#xD;
           months. There is no evidence of adverse effects if taken within the RDA, However there&#xD;
           may be haemorrhagic toxicity in high doses especially in patients on anticoagulants.&#xD;
           Hence we will be excluding patients on anticoagulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.0 Statistical Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 Sample size calculation: The overall estimated sample size for the study is 300&#xD;
           patients. The required sample size of 100 for each Hp phenotype stratum of the RCT phase&#xD;
           is based on: 5% type I error; 90% power; the assumption that vitamin E is expected to&#xD;
           have at least a moderate effect, represented by a standardized effect size (mean&#xD;
           difference/pooled-standard error) of 0.5, on each risk marker; two sample t-test with&#xD;
           equal variance; and a 15% drop out rate. Assuming 35% prevalence of Hp 2-2 in our&#xD;
           population, we need to screen 300 patients to recruit 100 Hp 2-2 phenotype patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assuming a mean difference on RHI of 0.25 units with corresponding standard deviation&#xD;
           (SD) of 0.3 - yielding a standardized effect size of 0.25/0.3 = 0.83 as minimal&#xD;
           difference in RHI seen in another study. We did not adjust for multiple&#xD;
           testing/comparisons due to the pilot nature of the RCT, as well as the exploratory&#xD;
           nature of the study in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The sample size for the in vitro study is constrained by limited resources.&#xD;
           Nevertheless, simulation results based on a two-sided Wilcoxon Signed-Ranked test, 5%&#xD;
           type I error, a correlation between pairs of 0.5, and 5000 Monte Carlo simulation&#xD;
           samples indicate that 20 pairs provide adequate power to detect moderate to large&#xD;
           standardized effect sizes (M1).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomisation will be done electronically through the web - a centralized&#xD;
           password-protected intranet website to ensure that the patients are randomised the&#xD;
           moment they are eligible for the trial (strictly sequential). A blocked randomisation&#xD;
           schedule will be employed, in blocks of 10, for the study based on a 1:1 allocation&#xD;
           ratio. The dedicated password-protected site will then allocate a unique patient trial&#xD;
           number which will correspond to the treatment numbers labelled in the medication boxes.&#xD;
           Following randomisation, the first dose will be administered to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Data handling and statistical analyses: Data Handling All relevant will be collected&#xD;
           using appropriate well-designed study data-collection forms at each visit and telephone&#xD;
           follow up assessment. All study data will be stored in a study database assessable only&#xD;
           to data entry and data validation study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical Analysis Plan Data on baseline demographic and clinical variables as well as&#xD;
           risk markers will be summarized by Hp phenotypes and overall to provide insight on&#xD;
           potential associations. Binary data will be summarized using frequency and proportions.&#xD;
           Chi-square test and Fisher exact test will be used to evaluate relevant associations&#xD;
           (including benefits of vitamin E), and if necessary logistic regression will be used to&#xD;
           characterize associations while adjusting for potential confounders. Continuous&#xD;
           variables will be summarized using means (standard deviations) or median (range) as&#xD;
           deemed appropriate. Two sample t-test or Mann-Whitney test will be used to evaluate&#xD;
           relevant associations and generalized linear models will be used to characterize&#xD;
           associations while adjusting for potential confounders. Generalized linear models are&#xD;
           considered as they can accommodate non-normal (asymmetric) data or log-normal data (such&#xD;
           as laboratory data) if necessary. Separate tests and models will be performed for each&#xD;
           relevant outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data from the in vitro study will be summarized similarly as described in the preceding&#xD;
           paragraph, by Hp 2-2 phenotype status and vitamin E concentrations. Wilcoxon&#xD;
           Signed-Ranked test will be used to evaluate the benefits of vitamin E between Hp&#xD;
           phenotype groups by concentrations. Mann-Whitney and Jonckheere-Terpstra test will be&#xD;
           used to evaluate the concentration-benefit relationship of vitamin E by Hp phenotype&#xD;
           groups. Generalized linear mixed models will be employed to explore various trends and&#xD;
           associations while accounting for (i) the matching of Hp 2-2 and non Hp 2-2 patients,&#xD;
           (ii) repeated assessment within a patient by vitamin E concentration, (iii) adjusting&#xD;
           for potential confounders, and (iv) adjusting for potential non-normality (asymmetry) of&#xD;
           the data by using other appropriate distributions such as log-normal or gamma&#xD;
           distributions. An overall analysis of the data from in vitro study will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bland-Altman analysis will be used to estimate and evaluate the limits of agreement for&#xD;
           the agreement and reliability studies. Where appropriate, a mixed model approach will be&#xD;
           used to estimate and evaluate the relevant reliability coefficients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.0 Clinical Significance&#xD;
&#xD;
           If an association is seen between Hp 2-2 phenotype with cardiovascular risk, this group&#xD;
           of patients can be targeted for vitamin E treatment on top of statins and other&#xD;
           conventional treatment to reduce the cardiovascular risk. Future large scale nation-wide&#xD;
           RCT can be planned to see whether vitamin E treatment helps to reduce the risk in this&#xD;
           group of patients. Conducting such studies in a multi-ethnic population is imperative as&#xD;
           it provides insight on the consistency and generalizability of the expected benefits.&#xD;
