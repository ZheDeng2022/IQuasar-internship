  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability of apremilast&#xD;
      once-daily formulation relative to a twice daily formulation when administered as multiple&#xD;
      doses (Part 1), and when administered as a single dose under fasting and fed conditions (Part&#xD;
      2). Information on safety and tolerability will also be obtained.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Part 1: This is an open-label, randomized, two-period, two-sequence, crossover study in&#xD;
      healthy subjects. The study will consist of a screening phase, a baseline phase, two&#xD;
      treatment periods, and a follow-up phone call. Each period will be ten days in duration&#xD;
      including 7 days of dosing and sample collection for up to 72 hours post Day 7 morning dose.&#xD;
      There will be a washout between period 1 and period 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: This is an open-label, randomized, four-period, four-sequence crossover study to&#xD;
      evaluate the PK and exposure of apremilast following single dose administration of different&#xD;
      formulations of apremilast. Part 2 will consist of a screening phase, baseline, four&#xD;
      treatment periods, and a follow-up phone call. Each period will be four days in duration for&#xD;
      dosing (Day 1) and sample collection for up to 72 hours post Day 1.&#xD;

A serious AE is any AE occurring at any dose that:&#xD;
Resulted in death;&#xD;
Was life-threatening;&#xD;
Required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;&#xD;
Resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;&#xD;
Was a congenital anomaly/birth defect;&#xD;

             which conception is possible must use barrier contraception (latex or non-latex&#xD;
             condoms NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane]) while&#xD;
             on Investigational Product (IP) and for at least 28 days after the last dose of IP.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Must agree to refrain from donating sperm, blood or plasma (other than for this study)&#xD;

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
