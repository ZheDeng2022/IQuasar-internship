      MyCardiacRecovery (MyCaRe) is an interactive platform that includes a standardized&#xD;
      educational format and interactive tracking (wound healing and activity progression using&#xD;
      photo capabilities and Fitbit flex accelerometer) support during the first 6 to 8 weeks post&#xD;
      hospital discharge. This application will help patients and family navigate their way through&#xD;
      the continuum of care by providing an: a) integrated link between acute care and outpatient&#xD;
      cardiac rehab for efficient coordination of information and reduction in duplication of&#xD;
      services; b) patient care and education materials designed to address salient recovery&#xD;
      questions; c) improved communication between the patient and care providers and, d) ensure&#xD;
      streamlined systematic referral to CR. This innovative strategy has the potential to&#xD;
      positively impact patient satisfaction, improve patient outcomes and possibly minimize&#xD;
      financial constraints placed on the health care system. Phase 1 (preliminary usability&#xD;
      testing) of prototype 1.0 is complete. Phase 2 will focus on testing MyCaRe 2.0 in a sample&#xD;
      of post cardiac surgery patients using a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) design.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The early transition period post coronary artery bypass graft surgery is one associated with&#xD;
      intense physiological and psychosocial adjustment that requires patients make sustainable&#xD;
      long-term lifestyle changes. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an evidence-based risk reduction&#xD;
      program that has been shown to improve overall fitness and quality of life as well as lower&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease. Therefore, the development&#xD;
      of supportive strategies to bridge the gap from acute care in to CR through early&#xD;
      intervention for cardiac surgery patients is essential. MyCardiacRecovery (MyCaRe) is an&#xD;
      interactive platform that includes a standardized educational format and interactive tracking&#xD;
      (wound healing and activity progression using photo capabilities and Fitbit flex&#xD;
      accelerometer) support during the first 6 to 8 weeks post hospital discharge. This&#xD;
      application will help patients and family navigate their way through the continuum of care by&#xD;
      providing an: a) integrated link between acute care and outpatient cardiac rehab for&#xD;
      efficient coordination of information and reduction in duplication of services; b) patient&#xD;
      care and education materials designed to address salient recovery questions; c) improved&#xD;
      communication between the patient and care providers and, d) ensure streamlined systematic&#xD;
      referral to CR. This innovative strategy has the potential to positively impact patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, improve patient outcomes and possibly minimize financial constraints placed on&#xD;
      the health care system. Phase 1 (preliminary usability testing) of prototype 1.0 is complete.&#xD;
      Phase 2 will focus on testing MyCaRe 2.0 in a sample of post cardiac surgery patients using a&#xD;
      pilot randomized controlled trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Summary: App Study Phase 2 - Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial N= 40 (20 usual care&#xD;
      + intervention; 20 usual care) Study Population: Post cardiac surgery patient population at 1&#xD;
      acute care cardiac centre in Toronto Study Design Pilot Randomized controlled trial Study&#xD;
      Duration May 2016 - Dec 2017 Study Agent/ Intervention MyCaRe prototype (mobile application)&#xD;
      Primary Objectives: 1) To examine the effect of MyCaRe application on enrolment in CR post&#xD;
      cardiac surgery in comparison to usual care (assessing effectiveness of intervention);&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) To examine the impact of MyCaRe application on patient recovery and satisfaction (i.e.&#xD;
      knowledge level, perceptions of recovery outcomes such as activity progression, quality of&#xD;
      life, anxiety and depression) 3) To examine the effect of MyCaRe application on health&#xD;
      services use. 4) To examine patient and clinician satisfaction, specifically user ease,&#xD;
      usability and comfort with MyCaRe application.&#xD;

    <description>The number of individuals who attend their initial cardiac rehab intake appointment will be the primary outcome measure of enrollment. Enrollment is defined in accordance with Canadian Cardiovascular Society data definitions (http://bridge.ccs.ca/index.php/en/), as patient having attended their scheduled cardiac rehab intake appointment (i.e., risk factor assessment, goal-setting). Enrollment will be verified with patient as well as with the CR program in which they are enrolled.</description>

    <description>Patients receiving usual care are typically referred to CR at the time of discharge from the acute care center via paper or electronic systematic referral (completed by a physician or nurse practitioner). Additionally, a conversation with the patient regarding CR by a healthcare provider may occur, however this communication is not always a consistent occurrence. Once referred, patients will await contact from a CR program in their region/area and if actual program enrollment occurs, this usually happens between 8 to 10 weeks post discharge.</description>

    <description>The MyCaRe mobile application (education and symptom monitoring which includes pain, mood scales, wound monitoring) and Fitbit accelerometer (steps walked, distance) will be provided to patients receiving intervention group allocation for the initial 6 to 8 weeks recovery post cardiac surgery. The patients will be provided a temporary loan mobile device loaded with MyCaRe and Fitbit Flex before leaving hospital. They will be asked to input data (pain, mood, wounds, activity) daily if possible in first 2 weeks and once weekly thereafter until 6 to 8 weeks or until entry to a cardiac rehabilitation program.</description>
