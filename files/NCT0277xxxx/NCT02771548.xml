      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are one of the most common sporting injuries of the&#xD;
      knee. ACL reconstruction (ACLR) has become one of the most common surgical procedures in an&#xD;
      attempt to increase joint stability and facilitate athletes to return to sport (RTS).&#xD;
      Although ACLR is considered a relatively successful procedure, dynamic control risk factors&#xD;
      and strength and power deficits in the involved limb are still present after patients return&#xD;
      to sport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic multi-plane, multi-joint actions such as jumping, landing, change of direction&#xD;
      cutting, have been shown to be common mechanisms of injury for the ACL in field sports .&#xD;
      Returning to multidirectional sports requires a proficiency and efficiency of movement when&#xD;
      carrying out these tasks. There is a lack of standardized, objective criteria to accurately&#xD;
      assess an athlete's ability to safely RTS. Therefore, there is a need for research that&#xD;
      simultaneously analyses sport specific dynamic tasks (3D motion analysis) and muscular&#xD;
      strength/power deficits that may explain poor outcomes following ACLR. This study aims to&#xD;
      further investigate movement patterns, limb asymmetry and muscle strength deficit in patients&#xD;
      post-surgery to identify risk factors for re-injury and criteria for RTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analyse kinematic (movement descriptors) and kinetic (forces that cause movement) during&#xD;
           sports specific dynamic tasks at different time-points (6 and 9 months) following ACLR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore the association of those findings with those who re-injure, those who have&#xD;
           persistent knee pain or with those who fail to return to sport.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the ACLR participants with age and gender matched healthy multidirectional&#xD;
           athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesised that biomechanical analysis will identify clear risk factors for poor&#xD;
      outcomes following ACLR. Analysis of ACLR athletes' biomechanics during sports specific tasks&#xD;
      will aid in the identification of athletes who are not yet ready to return to sport and will&#xD;
      inform the clinician of what must be targeted in specific rehabilitation protocols before&#xD;
      return to sport is considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from patients who are scheduled to undergo anterior cruciate&#xD;
      ligament reconstruction at the Sports Surgery Clinic, Ireland. Healthy participants will be&#xD;
      recruited from local multidirectional teams. Participation will be voluntary and after&#xD;
      obtaining informed consent patients will be asked to complete pre-operative questionnaires to&#xD;
      ascertain injury information, and the function of their knee. During surgery the surgeon will&#xD;
      fill out an intra-operative questionnaire. Items recorded will include graft type, laxity,&#xD;
      involvement of other ligamentous structures, type of femoral and tibial fixation, meniscal or&#xD;
      chondral pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomechanical assessment takes place at 6 and 9 months post surgery for the ACL group while&#xD;
      the healthy participants will be tested on one occasion. The 3D testing session will include&#xD;
      capturing of jumping, landing, hopping and cutting mechanics through the use of three&#xD;
      dimensional motion capture technology and force plates. Here reflective markers are placed on&#xD;
      the skin at anatomical landmarks. These markers are picked up by the infrared cameras and&#xD;
      tracked at 200 frames per second. Participants will make contact with a force plate with&#xD;
      their foot on undertaking the movements. Force and marker data will be combined to calculate&#xD;
      joint angles and moments. Participants will also perform a muscle strength test using&#xD;
      equipment called an isokinetic dynamometer. Both the operated and non-operated limbs will be&#xD;
      tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also be asked to fill out validated questionnaires to monitor self reported&#xD;
      knee function, their confidence in their knee and also collect data on any continuing adverse&#xD;
      symptoms such as locking, giving way, swelling or pain. Participants will also be asked if&#xD;
      and when they return to sport. Questionnaires will be administered to participants at pre-op,&#xD;
      3, 6, 9, 12, 24 months, 5 and 10 years post operatively.&#xD;

      3D Biomechanical testing involves the following progressive neuromuscular challenge tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single leg countermovement jump - Vertical jump as high as possible off one leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single leg drop jump- Hop from a 20cm height onto one leg and jump as high as possible&#xD;
           with as little time spent on the ground&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Double leg drop jump- Hop from a 30cm height onto one leg and jump as high as possible&#xD;
           with as little time spent on the ground&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hurdle hop - Lateral hop over a 15cm hurdle followed by a hop back to the starting&#xD;
           position and a hold for 2sec&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single Leg Hop for distance - maximal jump for horizontal distance on one leg while&#xD;
           sticking the landing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-planned change of direction cut - Sprint for 5 metres, make a 90 degree change of&#xD;
           direction pre-determined by the tester and sprint for a further five meters to the&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Indecision cut - Sprint for five meters then react to a light stimulus and make a 90&#xD;
           degree cut to the left or right for a further 1.5metres&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Registry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient data will be inputted into the Sports Surgery Clinic medical data management&#xD;
      software. Captured data will include:&#xD;
&#xD;

           Resonance Imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-Operative data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pre-Operative Questionnaire- Date of injury, Activity undertaking when injury&#xD;
                occurred, level of sporting activity, Injury mechanism, limb dominance, previous&#xD;

&#xD;
        3. Intra-Op data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Operative notes are recorded in theatre using a standardised in theatre questionnaire.&#xD;
           This form was developed under consensus with all surgeons who complete ACL&#xD;
           reconstructive surgery at the Sports Surgery Clinic. Included are graft type, laxity,&#xD;
           involvement of other ligamentous structures, type of femoral and tibial fixation,&#xD;
           meniscal or chondral pathology.&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  ACL RSI&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form- The IKDC subjective form is&#xD;
                a reliable and valid measure to monitor symptoms and function in daily living&#xD;
                activities in those with knee disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cincinnati Questionnaire - a valid and reliable measure of patient reported outcome&#xD;
                after ACL injury&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sports Surgery Clinic return to performance questionnaire- asks whether the&#xD;
                participant has returned to sport, have they injured the operated knee or&#xD;
                contralateral knee and asks whether they still experience pain and rate that pain&#xD;
                on a numerical rating scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  3D test battery findings&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 12 and 24 months post op data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Marx Activity Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ACL RSI&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  IKDC&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sports Surgery Clinic return to performance questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly cross-checking will be undertaken by two members of staff to ensure data entered&#xD;
           onto the registry is correct and contemporaneous.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A six-monthly audit of the registry will be undertaken by external auditors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry standard operating procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Basic patient contact details are inputted by administration staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physiotherapists and biomechanists input physical examination findings on medical data&#xD;
           software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-reported questionnaires are completed on site using a tablet device and uploaded&#xD;
           automatically to the registry once the questionnaire is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During theatre, the surgeon fills out the standardised intra-operative form, which is&#xD;
           uploaded to the registry following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For analysis or auditing purposes, data is downloaded from the Sports Surgery Clinic&#xD;
           medical data management software and placed into Microsoft excel. Patient names are&#xD;
           de-identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suggested sample size = 1000&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size calculation was carried out based on current numbers presenting to the&#xD;
           clinic. Clinical numbers indicate a re-rupture rate of either the ipsilateral or&#xD;
           contralateral ACL of 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study aims to recruit 1000 participants and follow them over 24 months. With a&#xD;
           likely re-rupture rate of 5%- it is hypothesized that 50 re-ruptures will occur over the&#xD;
           24 month period. This is a conservative number allowing for dropouts, and a split&#xD;
           between contralateral and ipsilateral ACL injuries, which will be analysed separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is also aimed to recruit 50 healthy volunteers from multidirectional field sports&#xD;
           teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for missing data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Checklist to flag missing data at the end of every week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with missing data may be excluded from the data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variables of interest include kinematics, kinetics, power, and vertical ground-reaction&#xD;
           force at the pelvis, hip, knee and ankle at specific time points during different&#xD;
           jumping, landing and cutting manoeuvres.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differences between involved and uninvolved legs will be calculated, and used to assess&#xD;
           for asymmetry. Two group comparisons will be conducted using the Student t test or&#xD;
           Kruskal-Wallis test for normal and non-normally distributed variables, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multivariable logistic regression, using variables with P values of &lt;/=0.05 from 2-group&#xD;
           comparisons (those who go on to suffer a 2nd ACL injury and those who don't), will be&#xD;
           used to identify the most predictive variables of the second ACL injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A multivariable logistic regression analysis will also be conducted to identify the most&#xD;
           predictive variables of patient reported subjective knee function (IKDC) and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Associations between intra-operative findings and outcome measures of re-injury pain and&#xD;
           return to sport will be explored, also using regression analysis.&#xD;
