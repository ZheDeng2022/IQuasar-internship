      This is a single-center, randomized, single-blinded study of the Hantaan virus HTNV DNA&#xD;
      vaccine alone, Puumala virus PUUV DNA vaccine alone, and mixed Hantaan/Puumala HTNV/PUUV DNA&#xD;
      vaccines delivered intramuscularly IM by the needle-free PharmaJet Stratus DSJI device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigational HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines, manufactured in accordance with cGMP guidelines&#xD;
      by Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma Services (California), from their respective drug substances,&#xD;
      pWRG/HTN-M(co) and pWRG/PUU-M(s2),were constructed on a well-characterized plasmid backbone,&#xD;
      pWRG7077. These plasmid DNA vaccines will be delivered IM using the needle-free, disposable&#xD;
      syringe jet injection device (PharmaJet Stratis). Subjects will be randomized into 3 groups&#xD;
      of 9 subjects each for a total of 27 subjects. Each subject will receive a total of 3&#xD;
      vaccinations. Group 1 vaccine will consist of 2 administrations of 1 mg of HTN plasmid (left&#xD;
      and right deltoid) for a total of 2 mg/vaccination. Group 2 vaccine will consist of 2&#xD;
      administrations of 1 mg of PUU plasmid (left, right deltoid) for a total of 2 mg/vaccination.&#xD;
      Group 3 vaccine will consist of a 1:1 mixture of HTNM and PUU vaccines (left, right deltoid)&#xD;
      for a total of 2 mg/vaccination (1 mg/vaccination of each DNA). Vaccinations will be&#xD;
      administered on Days 0, 28, and 56. There will be an optional 4th vaccination on Day 168&#xD;
      dependent on subject availability for the additional follow-up visit on Day 196, tolerability&#xD;
      of the vaccinations to date, and investigator discretion. Volunteers will be invited back for&#xD;
      the 4th vaccination to determine if a booster dose results in increased immunogenicity and&#xD;
      seroconversion. All subjects will be followed until Day 252 (9 months). A Day 365 follow-up&#xD;
      visit, for an immunogenicity draw only, may be requested dependent on immunogenicity results&#xD;
      shortly after this final date, generally within 4 weeks of the Day 252 visit or once the&#xD;
      assays can be completed. Subjects may be allowed to receive other licensed vaccinations or&#xD;
      enroll in other clinical trials after the Day 252 visit.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Study will enroll 3 randomized groups of 9 subjects for a total of 27 subjects. Every subject will receive a total of 3 vaccinations. Subjects will be blinded to the group they are randomized to. Each vaccination consists of 2 administrations of 1 mg (left/right deltoid) for a total of 2 mg/vaccination. Group 1 will be vaccinated with the HTNV vaccine, pWRG/HTN-M (co). Group 2 will be vaccinated with the PUUV vaccine, pWRG/PUU-M (s2). Group 3 will be vaccinated with a combined HTNV/PUUV vaccines. Each group will be vaccinated on Days 0, 28, and 56. An optional 4th vaccination on Day 168 with follow-up on Day 196. All doses will be administered with PharmaJet Stratis device. All subjects to be followed until at least 3 months post last vaccination with Day 252 the final study visit (a 12-month, optional follow-up visit may be requested approximately on Day 365). Subjects will complete postinjection memory aids for 7 days after each vaccination.</intervention_model_description>
