  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucagon like Peptide -1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are well known to stimulate&#xD;
      glucose-induced insulin secretion and to reduce energy intake. Recent findings from animal&#xD;
      and human studies suggest a role of GLP-1 in regulating water and salt homeostasis. GLP-1 has&#xD;
      been shown to reduce fluid intake after an oral salt load or during a meal - pointing to a&#xD;
      hypodipsic effect. The aim of this study is to elucidate whether these putative hypodipsic&#xD;
      properties of GLP-1 might be of advantage in persons with an exaggerated thirst perception as&#xD;
      is the case in patients with primary polydipsia.&#xD;

      GLP-1 analogues are currently used for the treatment of hyperglycaemia associated with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus and given his properties as a natural satiety hormone, the GLP-1 analogue&#xD;
      liraglutide was recently approved by the FDA for weight management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In studies related to the influence of GLP-1 and -analogues in controlling food intake a&#xD;
      concomitant reduction of fluid consumption has been observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that GLP-1 analogues not only modulate appetite and provide&#xD;
      satiety but also reduce fluid intake and thirst sensation in humans - especially in those&#xD;
      with excessive thirst perception (patients with primary polydipsia). In view of future&#xD;
      therapeutic options for these patients we aim to investigate the influence of the long-acting&#xD;
      GLP-1 analogue dulaglutide on fluid intake, thirst perception and quality of life in patients&#xD;
      with primary polydipsia compared to placebo.&#xD;
