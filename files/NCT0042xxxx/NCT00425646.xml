      RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor&#xD;
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others&#xD;
      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Imatinib&#xD;
      mesylate and bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to&#xD;
      the tumor. Giving imatinib mesylate together with bevacizumab as maintenance therapy may stop&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer from growing or coming back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving imatinib mesylate together with&#xD;
      bevacizumab after first-line chemotherapy and bevacizumab works in treating patients with&#xD;
      stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the clinical efficacy of maintenance therapy comprising imatinib mesylate and&#xD;
           bevacizumab after completion of first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab,&#xD;
           in terms of progression-free survival, in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell&#xD;
           lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily on days 1-21 and bevacizumab IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 1 year in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
