  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to compare the efficacy and safety of ozarelix 15 mg given intramuscular (IM) 2&#xD;
      weeks apart on the improvement of symptoms and the duration of improvement for up to 6 months&#xD;
      in men with Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH) who are over 50 years of age.&#xD;

      This study is to compare the improvement in symptom scores, peak flow rate and quality of&#xD;
      life in men suffering from lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to Benign Prostatic&#xD;
      Hypertrophy (BPH) following treatment with ozarelix. Ozarelix is compared to placebo and&#xD;
      injections given 14 days apart. Patients are followed for 6 months and both safety and&#xD;
      efficacy assessed at monthly visits. Additionally, the impact of treatment on erectile&#xD;
      function, if any, as well as Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) and Testosterone levels will be&#xD;
      monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening period of 7 days. The duration of the study is 40 weeks, including a 28-day&#xD;
      placebo run-in phase (eligible participants entered a placebo run-in phase in which placebo&#xD;
      is administered twice over a 2 week period [Day -28 and Day -14] and participants are&#xD;
      assessed to establish baseline values approximately 14 days following the second placebo&#xD;
      injection), study drug is administered on Days 0 and 14 followed by 34 weeks of observation&#xD;
      after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>IPSS is a validated self-administered index for grading benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-related signs and symptoms. It consists of a set of seven questions. A total score of 1-7 indicates mild disease, 8-19 moderate disease and 20-35 severe disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Prostate Symptom Score - Quality of Life (IPSS-QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>IPSS QOL is a disease-specific quality of life question, referred to as IPSS Question 8. Participants with an IPSS QOL of &lt;3 at screening will be excluded from this study. The rating is as follows: 0=delighted, 1=pleased, 2=mostly satisfied, 3=mixed, 4=mostly dissatisfied, 5=unhappy, 6=terrible.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>BPH Impact Index (BPHII)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BPH Impact Index (BII) is used to assess the impact of BPH on various aspects of health. This 4 question self administered index uses a scoring range from 0 (best) to 13 (worst).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) Global Assessment Question (LUTS-GAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The self administered LUTS GAQ is a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; response to a question asking whether overall improvement in LUTS will be observed during the treatment period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Index of Erectile Function-15 (IIEF-15)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>International Index of Erectile Function Erectile Function Domain (IIEF-EF) will be used to assess the effect of ozarelix on erectile function in sexually active men. IIEF-EF is defined as the sum of the scores for Questions 1-5 and 15 of the IIEF questionnaire. This recall instrument is self-administered by the participant. Individual questions are graded from 1 to 5 with a maximum total score of 30. Lower IIEF-EF scores represent diminished erectile function. Men with a score of â‰¥ 26 are interpreted as having normal erectile function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Urinary Flow Rate (Qmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Qmax was measured by free flow uroflowmetry. Qmax is defined as the peak urine flow rate (measured in milliliter (mL)/second using a standard calibrated flowmeter). For a Qmax to be considered valid, the voided volume had to be at least 125 mL. The uroflowmeter is to be calibrated weekly.</description>
