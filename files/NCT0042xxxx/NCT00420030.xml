  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Outcome of patients with myocardial infarction complicated with cardiogenic shock is very&#xD;
      poor. Although early mechanical revascularization has been demonstrated superior to&#xD;
      conservative medical treatment, mortality range remains about 45-60%. Some medical registries&#xD;
      have showed further therapeutic benefit by administration of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa&#xD;
      inhibitors during PCI in patients with cardiogenic shock. However, there is no randomized&#xD;
      study that supports this therapeutic strategy in these high risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors improve angiographic (TIMI-flow), echocardiographic (LV function) and&#xD;
      clinical (combined end-point) outcomes in patients with myocardial infarction complicated&#xD;
      with cardiogenic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open &quot;pseudorandomized&quot; multicenter, phase IV clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate to document better angiographic, echocardiographic and clinical&#xD;
      outcome after upfront abciximab administration in comparison to standard periprocedural&#xD;
      therapy in patients undergoing PCI for cardiogenic shock. This would be the first randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial that could support this therapeutic strategy.&#xD;

      Routine upfront abciximab versus standard peri-procedural therapy in patients undergoing&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention for cardiogenic shock PRAGUE-7 Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors improve angiographic (TIMI-flow), echocardiographic (LV function) and&#xD;
      clinical (combined end-point) outcomes in patients with myocardial infarction complicated&#xD;
      with cardiogenic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open &quot;pseudorandomized&quot; multicenter, phase IV clinical trial. The reason for&#xD;
      &quot;pseudorandomization&quot; (i.e. randomization by even or odd date, when the PCI is performed) is&#xD;
      ethical: it saves time, what is critical in this clinical setting. It does not delay&#xD;
      treatment at all, while classical randomization in cardiogenic shock may sometimes delay&#xD;
      treatment by up to 15 minutes and this is the main reason why randomized trials on shock are&#xD;
      rarely able to enroll patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A - Upfront administration of abciximab bolus followed by 12-hours abciximab infusion +&#xD;
      standard therapy Group B - Standard peri-procedural therapy with possibility of abciximab&#xD;
      administration according the interventional cardiologist. Expected rate of peri-procedural&#xD;
      abciximab administration in this group is 20% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allowed and excluded concomitant medication see bellow in the table&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A Group B&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before PCI Aspirin according to physician All treatment according to Clopidogrel according to&#xD;
      physician physician Heparin bolus 70IU/kg of body weigh Abciximab bolus 0,25 mg/kg of body&#xD;
      weigh&#xD;
&#xD;
      During PCI Abciximab 12-hours infusion 0,125microgram/kg/min Abciximab according to Other&#xD;
      treatment according to physician physician&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excluded Thrombolysis, Eptifibatide, Tirofiban Thrombolysis, Eptifibatide, treatment&#xD;
      Tirofiban&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      80 patients (40 patients in each group). This number of patient permit to complete the study&#xD;
      within &lt;2 years. Because of this and because of incidence of cardiogenic shock the study&#xD;
      sample size is not supported statistically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Thirty-day clinical combined outcome : death / reinfarction / stroke / new renal&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Death = death from any cause, reinfarction = recurrent ischemic symptoms with new increase&#xD;
      in CK-MB, stroke = any new neurologic deficit lasting &gt; 24 hours, new renal failure =&#xD;
      increase in creatinine to &gt; 300 micromol/l)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: 1) Combined end-point death / reinfarction / stroke / TIMI-flow &lt;3 / EF &lt;30% on&#xD;
      day 30. 2) Left ventricular EF assessed by echocardiography on the day 30 (in deceased pts.&#xD;
      EF assumed to be 0%) 3) Rate of major bleeding complication 4) Myocardial blush score after&#xD;
      PCI 5) TIMI-flow after PCI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-day clinical outcome as well as other categorical characteristics of patients in the&#xD;
      two groups will be compared by Fisher´s exact test. Group differences in continuous factors&#xD;
      will be compared by by Student´t-test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac catheterization, PCI and abciximab:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will undergo coronary angiography by femoral access using 5F or 6F&#xD;
      sheath and catheters. All patients will receive standard antithrombotic and anticoagulant&#xD;
      treatment either during transport or directly at the catheterization laboratory. Patients&#xD;
      randomized into group A will receive bolus of abciximab given as a bolus dose of 0,25mg per&#xD;
      kg of body weight immediately after randomization (either in CCU, emergency dept. or upon&#xD;
      arrival to cath-lab), followed by an infusion of 0,125microgram/kg/min (maximum&#xD;
      10microgram/min) for 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PCI - will be performed immediately after coronary angiography if technically feasible.&#xD;
           PCI will be performed at infarct related artery (IRA). Intracoronary stent - will be&#xD;
           implanted if possible. Type, length and size of the stent will be choose according&#xD;
           decision of invasive cardiologist&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abciximab - will be given to all patients randomized into group A as mentioned above.&#xD;
           Periprocedural abciximab bolus (0,25mg/kg) followed by 12-hours abciximab infusion&#xD;
           (0,250 microgram/kg/min) will be given selectively to patients randomized into group B&#xD;
           according to the decision of invasive cardiologist - we expect that GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor&#xD;
           (abciximab) will be given to cca 10-20% of patients in this group (what is our current&#xD;
           routine for the use of GPIIb/IIIa blockers in this setting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiographic data will be stored on CD. Independent invasive cardiologist blind to clinical&#xD;
      data and blind to the randomization of the patient, will assess TIMI flow of IRA before and&#xD;
      after PCI (grade 0-3), myocardial blush score before and after PCI in the area of IRA (grade&#xD;
      0-3) and TIMI frame count after PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete echocardiographic examination will be performed 24hours, on the day 7 and day 30&#xD;
      after PCI. Vivid7 ultrasound systems will be used. Data will be stored in digital form if&#xD;
      possible (otherwise storage on S-VHS will be used). Independent observer will assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  end-systolic and enddiastolic diameter of left ventricle (parasternal view)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ejection fraction measured using Simson´s method&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  regional left ventricle function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approval of local ethical committee is required as for any other research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated finding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate to document better angiographic, echocardiographic and clinical outcome after&#xD;
      upfront abciximab administration in comparison to standard periprocedural therapy in patients&#xD;
      undergoing PCI for cardiogenic shock. This would be the first randomized clinical trial that&#xD;
      could support this therapeutic strategy.&#xD;
