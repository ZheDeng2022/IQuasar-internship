  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a phase I study. This phase I study is not a standard drug dose escalation&#xD;
      study, but rather a Clinical System Performance Evaluation Trial of a therapeutic device.&#xD;
      However for purposes of this protocol we will refer to this portion of the trial as a phase I&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility and clinical practicability of&#xD;
      the registered ultrasound and fluoroscopy (RUF) in combination with CMS Interplant system® in&#xD;
      an initial cohort of 6 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will involve demonstrating the feasibility of using the system in an actual operating&#xD;
      room environment as well as obtaining a preliminary assessment of the accuracy and&#xD;
      performance of the source location algorithm by comparing with postoperative CT dosimetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary endpoint of this study will be evaluation of the feasibility of using the RUF&#xD;
      system and of performing real-time optimization in the operating room environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary endpoints of this study will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acute and late toxicity as assessed by IPSS, SHIM, and EPIC questionnaires at multiple&#xD;
           follow-up intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PSA-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population will be patients with a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate who&#xD;
      are seen in consultation at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 360 patients per year with the diagnosis of prostate cancer are seen in the&#xD;
      Department of Radiation Oncology at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Of these patients, approximately&#xD;
      45% have low-risk (T1a-T2a, Gleason 6 or less, PSA 10 ng/ml or less) or intermediate-risk&#xD;
      disease and are suitable for brachytherapy based on disease risk. Within this group of&#xD;
      patients, approximately 70% are eligible for brachytherapy based on gland size and no prior&#xD;
      transurethral resection of prostate (TURP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 80% of patients offered brachytherapy at consultation decide to receive their&#xD;
      treatment at Johns Hopkins. Overall, we currently perform 2 brachytherapy procedures per week&#xD;
      on average, for a yearly total of approximately 90 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For purposes of homogeneity of treatment and patient population, this protocol will only&#xD;
      enroll patients currently treated at this institution with brachytherapy alone, and will not&#xD;
      enroll patients (intermediate or high risk disease) who will require external beam radiation&#xD;
      in addition to brachytherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      This will be a prospective Phase I study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Identification: Patient confidentiality will be maintained in accordance with Health&#xD;
      Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants must sign an informed consent that will describe the objectives of the study&#xD;
      and potential risks. All patient data reported on the case reports forms will be identified&#xD;
      by the patient's initials and study code number only.Patients shall not be identified by&#xD;
      name. This should serve to protect the confidentiality of subjects enrolled on the trial.&#xD;
      Clinical data and records for all subjects studied including history and physical findings,&#xD;
      laboratory data, and results of interventions are to be maintained by the investigators in a&#xD;
      secure, locked location. Computerized data will require password authorization(s) for access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the Recruitment Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be identified at the time of consultation in the Department of&#xD;
      Radiation Oncology by Dr. Song or Dr. DeWeese. If Dr. DeWeese identifies a potential patient&#xD;
      during a consult he will refer them to Dr. Song so that Dr. Song can offer the patient the&#xD;
      opportunity to participate. Dr. DeWeese will not offer patients the opportunity to&#xD;
      participate but will only assist in identifying potential patients for the research team as&#xD;
      he sees many brachytherapy cases during his consultations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the Informed Consent Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only the principal investigator and those listed as co-investigators will perform the&#xD;
      informed consent interview. The informed consent interview will take place before the patient&#xD;
      is to be treated to ensure that the patient has adequate time to discuss the research project&#xD;
      with family, friends, and/or other Health Care providers. During the informed consent&#xD;
      interview the interviewer (investigator) will take as much time as needed to ensure that the&#xD;
      potential subject understands the research project and also clearly understands that he does&#xD;
      not have to participate in this project to receive his cancer treatment at Johns Hopkins. If&#xD;
      the patient decides to enroll into the research project he will sign three copies of the&#xD;
      informed consent form. One will be for his own records,one will be kept in the Clinical&#xD;
      Research Office at Johns Hopkins, and the third one will be kept in his medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Assignment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 patients will be enrolled onto the trial. The patients will have their brachytherapy&#xD;
      planned using a registered ultrasound and fluoroscopy (RUF) in combination with the CMS&#xD;
      Interplant system®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Procedures for Standard Brachytherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History and physical and KPS at the time of consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volume of the prostate based on ultrasound at the time of diagnostic biopsy. If this is&#xD;
           not available, then patient will have prostatic volume estimated by digital rectal&#xD;
           examination at time of consultation and confirmatory ultrasound performed in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumors are to be graded and Gleason score provided on the pathology report.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prostate specific antigen (PSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scan of the pelvis. Nodes evaluated negative by imaging methods will be classified as&#xD;
           NX.Only nodes evaluated negative by surgical sampling will be classified as N0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone scan is optional, given the low risk of positive findings in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IPSS Symptom Score at the time of consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once informed consent has been obtained the following assessments will be performed on the&#xD;
      subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-Treatment Evaluation (to be performed within 6 weeks prior to day 1 of&#xD;
           brachytherapy): i. History and Physical ii. IPSS, SHIM, and EPIC questionnaires (See&#xD;
           Appendix 1 for questionnaires). iii. Serum PSA iv. Chest X-Ray v. Bone Scan (if&#xD;
           clinically indicated) vi. CT of pelvis vii. Ultrasound volume (to be done 4 weeks to 4&#xD;
           days prior to day 1 of brachytherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1 of Brachytherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Chest X-Ray&gt; ii. CT of the Pelvis&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
           &gt; These studies can be done the day after Brachytherapy&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
           i. History and Physical ii. IPSS, SHIM, EPIC questionnaires iii. Serum PSA iv. CT of the&#xD;
           Pelvis v. Chest X-Ray&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
           i. History and Physical ii. IPSS, SHIM, EPIC questionnaires iii. Serum PSA iv. Chest&#xD;
           X-Ray&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Month 6: 6 months (+/- 4 weeks) from Brachytherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. History and Physical ii. IPSS, SHIM, EPIC questionnaires iii. Serum PSA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Month 9: 9 months (+/- 4 weeks) from Brachytherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. History and Physical ii. IPSS, SHIM, EPIC questionnaires iii. Serum PSA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Month 12: 12 months (+/- 4 weeks) from Brachytherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. History and Physical ii. IPSS, SHIM, EPIC questionnaires iii. Serum PSA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post 12 month follow-up patients will be followed for an additional two more years :&#xD;
           (Note: In years 2 and 3, patients will be followed on a semiannual basis and will have&#xD;
           the following assessments performed): i. History and Physical ii. IPSS, SHIM, EPIC&#xD;
           questionnaires iii. Serum PSA Version 4: 07/11/2006 9&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be Collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data that will be collected for this trial will be the results and/or findings of the&#xD;
      procedures and assessments that are previously outlined. R&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results/findings will be abstracted from the source documents (e.g. physician notes, nursing&#xD;
      notes, radiology reports, lab reports, etc…) and recorded onto study specific case report&#xD;
      forms. Only medical records that have been validated by the provider will be used as source&#xD;
      documents for data collection. The data manager assigned to this trial will be responsible&#xD;
      for the data collection. He/She will have access to patient medical records and will record&#xD;
      medical information from the medical record onto the case report form. The principal&#xD;
      investigator will review the data on a monthly basis for accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RADIATION THERAPY AND RESEARCH INTERVENTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population who will be offered this protocol are those who are currently offered&#xD;
      brachytherapy as standard treatment at our institution. Patients will experience no change in&#xD;
      the procedure other than an approximately 10% increase in the duration of fluoroscopy 'on'&#xD;
      time during the procedure. There will also be one additional CT scan post-implant to assess&#xD;
      dosimetry at Day ~30. This is necessary to account for the effects of post-implant edema on&#xD;
      the dosimetric parameters and source positions measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implant Volumes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target volume definitions are, for the most part, based upon the ICRU Report 58, Dose and&#xD;
      Volume Specification for Reporting Interstitial Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Target Volume, CTV: Pre-implant TRUS definition of the prostate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planning Target Volume, PTV: An enlargement of the CTV as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Expand the TRUS definition of the prostate by 3 mm in the lateral dimension for each&#xD;
           TRUS axial image. Thus, the lateral dimension of the prostate will increase by&#xD;
           approximately 6 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Expand the TRUS definition of the prostate by 3 mm in the anterior dimension for each&#xD;
           TRUS axial image.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Maintain the same posterior border of the prostate as defined by TRUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Project the expanded most cephalad axial definition to a plane 3 mm cephalad to the&#xD;
           cephalad most TRUS plane.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Project the expanded most caudad axial definition to a plane 3 mm caudad to the caudad&#xD;
           most TRUS plane. The PTV is approximately 6 mm longer in the caudad-cephalad dimension&#xD;
           than the CTV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation Target Volume, ETV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ETV is defined as the post-implant CT definition of the prostate.&#xD;
