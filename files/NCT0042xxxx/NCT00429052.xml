      The main objectives of this study are define frequency of plaque shift phenomenon and impact&#xD;
      on flow dynamics in the side branch as assessed by intravascular ultrasound, and evaluate&#xD;
      acute and late side branch ostial vessel reaction to balloon angioplasty and drug-eluting&#xD;
      stents.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Percutaneous coronary intervention of bifurcation lesion remains a challenge, even in the era&#xD;
      of drug eluting stents (DES). Bifurcation interventions, when compared with non-bifurcation&#xD;
      interventions, have a lower rate of procedural success and a higher rate of restenosis&#xD;
      regardless of the techniques or technologies used. Although stenting of individual&#xD;
      non-bifurcated lesion has been shown to be superior to balloon angioplasty, stenting of both&#xD;
      branches seems to offer no advantage over stenting of the main branch (MB) alone. The recent&#xD;
      introduction of DES has resulted in a lower event rate and reduction of MB restenosis in&#xD;
      comparison with historical controls. However, reports suggest that restenosis at the side&#xD;
      branch (SB) ostium continues to be elevated. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) studies have&#xD;
      shown that stent dimensions are important predictors of restenosis even with DES. Recently&#xD;
      published observational data of IVUS analysis of bifurcation lesions treated with &quot;crush&quot;&#xD;
      technique has shown the smallest minimum stent area at the SB ostium. This may contribute to&#xD;
      a higher restenosis rate. Plaque shift and insufficient covering of the SB ostium may also&#xD;
      play a major role in a development of SB restenosis. The belief that plaque shift occurs&#xD;
      during bifurcation stenting is challenged by the fact that plaque is mainly located opposite&#xD;
      to the side branch ostium as demonstrated by IVUS and anatomical studies. Further, the&#xD;
      occurrence of plaque shift in bifurcation lesions has never been scientifically investigated.&#xD;
      Finally, bending and twisting of the coronary arteries at the bifurcation should be taken&#xD;
      into account in the mechanism of SB restenosis because of continuous vessel wall injury by&#xD;
      the rigid stent and potential stent fractures. Bifurcation represents an extreme model of&#xD;
      vessel bending and twisting because the vessels beyond the bifurcation are in different&#xD;
      path/orientation and different heart walls. A better understanding of the mechanisms of&#xD;
      bifurcation intervention and restenosis is essential for the development of a successful&#xD;
      technique and dedicated technologies for this challenging scenario. Despite multiple&#xD;
      retrospective studies and various ingenious techniques, a true prospective mechanistic&#xD;
      investigation remains lacking in the field of bifurcation. The main objectives of this study&#xD;
      are define frequency of plaque shift phenomenon and impact on flow dynamics in the side&#xD;
      branch as assessed by IVUS, and evaluate acute and late side branch ostial vessel reaction to&#xD;
      balloon angioplasty and DES.&#xD;
