      This is a phase I study to test the immunogenicity of a recombinant vaccine based on Modified&#xD;
      Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) expressing the antigen 85A (from Mycobacterium tuberculosis). This&#xD;
      vaccine is delivered intradermally by a needle injection in healthy volunteers previously&#xD;

      This is a phase I study to test the immunogenicity of a recombinant vaccine based on Modified&#xD;
      Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) expressing the antigen 85A (from Mycobacterium tuberculosis). This&#xD;
      vaccine is delivered intradermally by a needle injection in healthy volunteers who have&#xD;
      recieved a BCG immunisation month previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Selection of volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
           Volunteers for the study will be recruited through advertisements. Each volunteer will&#xD;
           have received an information sheet concerning the study and will have agreed to&#xD;
           participate in writing. Volunteers will be given at least 48 hours between reading the&#xD;
           information leaflet and agreeing to participate. Female volunteers will be told of the&#xD;
           theoretical risk of congenital anomaly should they become pregnant during the study and&#xD;
           only those who undertake to take precautions to avoid pregnancy during the study period&#xD;
           will be eligible. Volunteers will give signed consent for their GP's to be notified&#xD;
           about their participation in the trial. The GP will be faxed a letter on the day of&#xD;
           screening and asked to reply if they know of a reason why the volunteer should not take&#xD;
           part. The signed consent form will also be faxed with the letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
           Volunteers will be asked to sign the informed consent form for screening. The following&#xD;
           will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical history and examination&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Laboratory evaluations - including clinical chemistry, haematology, HLA typing,&#xD;
                anti-vaccinia antibodies, anti-HBV antibodies, anti-HCV antibodies, anti-HIV&#xD;

                psychiatric disorder, drug or alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Oral or systemic steroid medication or the use of immunosuppressive agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Positive HIV antibody test, HCV antibody test or positive HBV serology except&#xD;
                post-vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Heaf test greater than Grade 0&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Confirmed pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Previous MVA immunisations&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Withdrawal Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Withdrawal of consent by subject for any reason&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Loss to follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Non-compliance with study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Protocol violation&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Serious adverse event (as defined in Appendix 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Any other reason at discretion of the Principal Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Confirmed pregnancy during study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Immunisation&#xD;
&#xD;
           On Day 0, subjects will receive a single intradermal injection of 0.1ml BCG (SSI strain)&#xD;
           over the deltoid muscle. Blood will be taken at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after this&#xD;
           immunisation. At 4 weeks, after blood has been taken, volunteers will be immunised with&#xD;
           5 x 107pfu MVA85A in 0.1ml. Subjects will be observed for an hour after MVA85A&#xD;
           immunisation. Vital signs will be monitored at 30 and 60 minutes post-immunisation.&#xD;
           Local reactions at the site of administration will be evaluated at 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A photograph of the injection site may be taken at 48 hours (with written consent). The&#xD;
           injection site will be reviewed 7 days after each immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood will be taken at the following time points: At the screening visit*, prior to the&#xD;
           BCG vaccination, 2 weeks and 4 weeks after BCG, *1 week after the MVA85A vaccination, 2&#xD;
           weeks, 4 weeks, *8 weeks, and *24 weeks after the vaccination. Up to 55 mls will be&#xD;
           taken at any one time with the total being no more than 500 mls over the study period.&#xD;
           *Samples taken on these dates will be tested for full blood count and biochemical&#xD;
           screen. Immunological assays will be performed at all time points to determine vaccine&#xD;
           immunogenicity. A pregnancy test will be performed prior to vaccination for female&#xD;
           volunteers. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be prepared for cellular&#xD;
           immunological assays to be performed without or following cryopreservation. Other&#xD;
           serological measures of immune response, i.e. antibody titres, will be assayed on frozen&#xD;
           plasma samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All blood tests will be taken within 1-3 days of the due date as described in the&#xD;
           schedule above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurance and severity of local side-effects The occurance and severity of systemic&#xD;
      side-effects The induction of T cell responses (as measured by an interferon-gamma Elispot&#xD;
      assay).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proliferation assays and cytotoxic T cell assays will be performed on strong CD4+ and CD8+&#xD;
      responses respectively.&#xD;
