      Title: Local anesthesia for office biopsy of the prostate: effects on pain control, quality&#xD;
      of life and surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction: Local anesthetic should be administered prior to transrectal needle biopsy of&#xD;
      the prostate to control pain in the office setting. Various centers have injected anesthetic&#xD;
      in different regions in and around the prostate prior to biopsy. Patient experience with each&#xD;
      technique has varied. We would like to determine which procedure provides the best pain&#xD;
      control. In addition, we would like to know if the anesthetic placement has any effect on&#xD;
      urinary patterns, bowel habits, and sexual function. Furthermore, for those patients found to&#xD;
      have cancer and elect surgical treatment, we plan to evaluate if the anesthetic had an impact&#xD;
      on surgical dissection of their prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators plan to identify those patients who require prostate biopsy for&#xD;
      diagnosis. Each patient will be randomly assigned to a different anesthetic injection group.&#xD;
      During the biopsy protocol, our nurse will monitor the patient?s pain level according to the&#xD;
      visual analog score. The patient will complete a pre-biopsy questionnaire and two post-biopsy&#xD;
      questionnaires administered at 1 and 4 weeks after biopsy. He will receive results of the&#xD;
      prostate biopsy pathology report within 48 hours by calling his primary referral service.&#xD;

      RESEARCH PROPOSAL AND PROTOCOL&#xD;
&#xD;
      TITLE Local anesthesia for prostate biopsy: Effects on pain control, quality of life, and&#xD;
      surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS Local anesthetic (1% lidocaine) should be administered prior to transrectal&#xD;
      needle biopsy of the prostate to control pain in the office setting. In this study, we would&#xD;
      determine which location of injection manages pain best by comparing the patient?s subjective&#xD;
      pain response as depicted by the visual analog score. In addition, we will evaluate how the&#xD;
      prostate biopsy and anesthetic techniques changed the patient?s quality of life and determine&#xD;
      what impact was observed during surgical dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE Transrectal ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the prostate is the gold standard&#xD;
      for diagnosing prostate cancer. We perform approximately 80 of these procedures per month in&#xD;
      our office setting. This intervention often sparks anxiety in patients due to the pain that&#xD;
      may be encountered. In fact, past patient surveys show that 50-90% of patients suffered&#xD;
      significant pain during their prostate biopsy when local anesthesia was not used1. Since the&#xD;
      year 2000, we have been injecting local anesthetic prior to the biopsy. This allows us to&#xD;
      obtain an average of 10 to 12 samples from the gland. Overall, most patients are able to&#xD;
      tolerate this procedure without significant morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cost of an office biopsy at our clinic is close to $1800, while those done under&#xD;
      anesthesia in an operating room can be over $7000. Patients may need to undergo this biopsy&#xD;
      in a monitored setting if it is done at the time of an additional procedure or if a&#xD;
      saturation biopsy is planned, where up to 30 samples may be taken. Other patients are done&#xD;
      under anesthesia if they adamantly refuse office biopsy due to their anxiety over pain&#xD;
      associated with the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain is a subjective response and varies between patients. Various methods of anesthesia have&#xD;
      been employed to control pain in the office setting. Our traditional method has been to apply&#xD;
      local anesthetic lubricant to the rectum. Following this, we use a 22 gauge spinal needle&#xD;
      under ultrasound guidance to place 5cc of lidocaine into the junction of the base of the&#xD;
      prostate and seminal vesicle on each side of the gland, and draw the medication distally&#xD;
      toward the apex. Other groups have been injecting the anesthetic directly into the prostate&#xD;
      gland on the right and left sides of midline. Still, other centers have focused on&#xD;
      anesthetizing only the apex of the gland. There is no consensus as to which location provides&#xD;
      the best pain relief for the patient. This knowledge would be critical as more men undergo&#xD;
      this procedure to identify prostate cancer as early as possible. It is a procedure that&#xD;
      should be done successfully in the office setting to allow patients early diagnosis, while&#xD;
      helping to contain medical costs and avoid the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it is unknown whether the location of anesthetic injection causes differences in&#xD;
      quality of life after the procedure. Specifically, we would be focused on determining how&#xD;
      this changed urinary patterns, bowel habits, and sexual function. Furthermore, regarding&#xD;
      patients who are found to have cancer and would like surgical intervention, we plan a future&#xD;
      study to see if anesthetic has any influence on ease of dissection during prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRELIMINARY STUDIES Transrectal ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the prostate was first&#xD;
      described in 19892. In the beginning, only hypoechoic areas and palpated nodules were&#xD;
      targeted for biopsy. Later, elevated serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) became a common&#xD;
      indication for biopsy. The sextant biopsy was done to sample the gland, but it became&#xD;
      apparent that many cancers were being missed3. More biopsies were needed and now, some&#xD;
      centers will perform more than twenty biopsies in an office setting for thorough&#xD;
      investigations 4-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The autonomic nerves from the caudal roots of S2 to S5 detect pain from the prostate biopsy.&#xD;
      These nerves travel to the prostatic vascular pedicles located posterolaterally to the gland&#xD;
      and innervate the prostate capsule and stroma. In 1996 Nash described a technique to ease the&#xD;
      pain from the procedure7. His team used transrectal ultrasound to place 5cc of 1% lidocaine&#xD;
      into the region of this prostatic neurovascular pedicle between the junction of the base of&#xD;
      the prostate and seminal vesicle. This was done on the right and left sides of the prostate,&#xD;
      significantly decreasing pain during the procedure. Modifications have been made where&#xD;
      injection begins at this location but the anesthetic is also drawn distally toward the&#xD;
      prostate apex to numb pain fibers along the entire breadth of the gland8. Most centers use&#xD;
      this method to obtain an office biopsy and some even use this technique to perform saturation&#xD;
      biopsy in an office setting5. Traditionally, we have also been performing this anesthetic&#xD;
      method in our clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet, another study has looked at intraprostatic administration of 1% lidocaine to provide&#xD;
      anesthesia9. In this analysis, 10cc of 1% lidocaine was infiltrated in 2 or 3 sites on the&#xD;
      right and left sides of the gland, drawing the anesthetic from base towards the apex of the&#xD;
      prostate. This method was compared to the traditional method described above. The&#xD;
      intraprostatic method was found to be a better analgesic technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, even in this study, the apical biopsies continued to be the most uncomfortable. This&#xD;
      location often proves to be the most painful site to obtain samples from. It is thought that&#xD;
      this region of the prostate gland lies beneath the dentate line and therefore, more pain&#xD;
      fibers exist there. Groups have anesthetized this region only and found significant success&#xD;
      in pain control10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study has ever compared these various methods to each other to determine how to best&#xD;
      alleviate patient discomfort during office biopsy of the prostate. With more men undergoing&#xD;
      prostate biopsy, either for the first time or on a repeat event, it would be critical have&#xD;
      this knowledge for the best patient satisfaction. We still do not know if the anesthetic&#xD;
      causes difference in quality of life. In addition, for those patients who are found to have&#xD;
      cancer on their biopsy, we need to determine if the local anesthetic has any effect on pelvic&#xD;
      dissection during prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INVESTIGATIONAL DESIGN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Patient Population and Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will not exclude patients based on age or race. Any male patient seen in our clinic&#xD;
      with the following conditions that warrant and consent to transrectal needle biopsy of the&#xD;
      prostate would be recruited for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Elevated serum PSA&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypoechoic nodule incidentally discovered on transrectal ultrasound for other purposes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Abnormal digital rectal exam (DRE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following exclusion criteria must be in place to prevent complications and interference&#xD;
      with data interpretation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients taking narcotics on a routine basis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients on Coumadin therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with ano-rectal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients with history of prostatitis, pelvic pain, pelvic floor tension myalgia, or&#xD;
           other pain syndromes&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients with active prostate abscess or urinary tract infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients with allergy to local anesthetic&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Potential Patient Risk&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks in this study are no greater than the risks incurred during a standard office&#xD;
      biopsy of the prostate. Most patients undergoing biopsy since the year 2000 have received a&#xD;
      transrectal injection of local anesthetic prior to prostate biopsy. However, complications&#xD;
      associated with transrectal needle biopsy of the prostate do include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Urinary tract infection, and even urosepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Erectile dysfunction that is usually short-lived, but may take weeks to recover&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rectal bleeding, ranging from minor spotting to severe hematochezia warranting&#xD;
           interventions by a colorectal surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hematuria, ranging from spotting to severe requiring Foley catheter placement and&#xD;
           bladder irrigation&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Hematospermia that although not harmful to the patient, may last up to 2 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Hypotension due to vaso-vagal responses&#xD;
&#xD;
      These risks are part of the actual prostate biopsy. Our study to apply local anesthetic to&#xD;
      various regions around the prostate do not increase these risks and do not add any new&#xD;
      additional risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Risk Prevention&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several ways to prevent complication from office biopsy of the prostate. These&#xD;
      methods have been employed by our staff since beginning this procedure in our clinic. Risk is&#xD;
      decreased by enforcing the following pre-procedural guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stop all aspirin-containing or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) agents 7 days&#xD;
           prior to the biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Begin a quinolone (or other appropriate antibiotic) the night prior to procedure and&#xD;
           continue this prophylaxis for a total of 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If the patient has a prosthetic joint or heart valve, administer appropriate SBE&#xD;
           prophylaxis one hour before biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Administer one Fleets enema rectally at least one hour before biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks that the patients would be subjected to are no different than if they were not a&#xD;
      part of this study. All prostate biopsies are associated with a small risk, but most patients&#xD;
      do not suffer long term consequences. Our study is meant to determine how to provide the best&#xD;
      pain relief possible while obtaining tissue diagnosis and identifying prostate cancer as&#xD;
      early as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Budget&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding will be sought from the Department of Urology Research Committee. These funds will be&#xD;
      used for nursing support and statistical analysis. We will need nursing assistance for&#xD;
      recruitment and consenting, as well as assisting with having patients complete the pre-biopsy&#xD;
      survey. This will require approximately 10 minutes of the nurse?s time, allocated among&#xD;
      approximately 243 study patients. In addition, the nurses will assist with the post biopsy&#xD;
      survey administration and collection. Statistical analysis will be completed by our urology&#xD;
      research statisticians. The small grants project funding of $5000 should allow complete&#xD;
      coverage of this project. No special equipment, medications, or supplies will need to be&#xD;
      obtained. We will be using materials that are a standard part of our practice. The patient&#xD;
      will have to pay for the fees of the office biopsy, anesthetic, and pathology, but there will&#xD;
      not be any other costs to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Justification of Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our statisticians have reviewed the prior studies regarding this subject. A total of 81&#xD;
      patients will be required in each study arm to achieve 80% power to detect a difference in&#xD;
      means of 0.4 points on the visual analog scale. This assumes that the common standard&#xD;
      deviation is 0.9 using a two-tailed t-test with a 0.050 significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Research Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who qualify for the study will be recruited at the time of their initial&#xD;
      consultation with a urologist in our department. They will be met by our research study nurse&#xD;
      and consented in the exam room. Then, they will be asked to complete the pre-biopsy survey.&#xD;
      The patients will also be given a packet at that time which includes the post-biopsy surveys&#xD;
      to be done at 1 and 4 weeks after the procedure. (All questions on both surveys will have&#xD;
      been derived from previously validated questionnaires.) After consenting, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to one of three groups to determine how to best administer anesthetic prior to&#xD;
      prostate biopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Injection between the base and seminal vesicle on the right and left sides of the&#xD;
      gland, while drawing the needle distally to ensure numbing of the prostate apex Group 2:&#xD;
      Intraprostatic injection into 2 sagittal planes, beginning at the base of the prostate and&#xD;
      traversing distally toward the apex on the right and left sides of the prostate Group 3:&#xD;
      Injection at the apex of the prostate only, between the prostate and rectal wall, on the&#xD;
      right and left sides of the gland&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will have appropriately refrained from any aspirin or NSAID medications for at&#xD;
      least 10 days. They will have started their appropriate antibiotic the night prior to biopsy.&#xD;
      A Fleets enema will have already been administered by self one hour before the appointment.&#xD;
      Upon arrival, they will meet with our urology biopsy nurse who will review the study once&#xD;
      more with the patient. He will then administer 20% benzocaine (Hurricane) jelly to the&#xD;
      patients rectum and prepare the patient in the standard knee-chest prone position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use the standard B-K 7.5 mHz transrectal side-fire ultrasound probe for the imaging&#xD;
      in this procedure. The study-coordinator physician will then administer the anesthetic (1%&#xD;
      plain lidocaine) through a 22g spinal needle under transrectal ultrasound guidance to each&#xD;
      group as described above:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Inject 6cc of anesthetic into the junction between the base and seminal vesicle,&#xD;
      while drawing out toward apex of the prostate on the right side. This will be repeated on the&#xD;
      opposite side of the gland for a total of 12cc of anesthetic. Ultrasound will be used to&#xD;
      confirm the presence of the anesthetic under real-time imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Inject 3cc of anesthetic into a sagittal plane, beginning at the base of the&#xD;
      prostate, and drawing distally toward the prostate apex. This will be repeated in another&#xD;
      sagittal plane on the right side of the gland. The same process will be done on the left side&#xD;
      of the gland. A total of 12cc of anesthetic will be applied and confirmed by ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3: Inject 6 cc of anesthetic just lateral to the prostate apex between the gland and&#xD;
      rectum using ultrasound guidance to confirm its position. The same procedure will be repeated&#xD;
      on the other side of the gland. A total of 12cc of anesthetic will be applied. (See Figure 1&#xD;
      for images) A timer will be set at this point for a total of 3 minutes. The biopsy physician&#xD;
      will then enter the room and the coordinator will leave. This doctor will perform an&#xD;
      ultrasound exam of the prostate to search for abnormalities and obtain a volume measurement&#xD;
      to estimate gland size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this interval, a total of 12 biopsies will be obtained. If no ultrasound lesions&#xD;
      were identified, 2 apical, 2 base, and 2 mid-gland biopsies will be performed on each side of&#xD;
      the prostate. If any hypoechoic regions are noted this will be counted toward the total&#xD;
      number of biopsies, not to exceed 12 samples per patient. At completion of the biopsy, the&#xD;
      patient?s rectum will be examined digitally and the penile meatus will be inspected to rule&#xD;
      out significant bleeding requiring further intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain analysis is the first focus of this study and thus, we will use the well-established&#xD;
      standard visual analog scale to provide patients with an index to rate their pain (See Figure&#xD;
      2). Subjects will have the visual analog scale in front of them. They will be asked to&#xD;
      provide a number corresponding to their pain level when our biopsy nurse requests them to&#xD;
      rate their pain. We will ask at the time points listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Time of transrectal ultrasound probe insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time of anesthetic needle insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Time of biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At completion of biopsy session, to obtain overall pain response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be placed in the left lateral decubitus position and vital signs will be&#xD;
      reassessed before slowly allowing the patient to move away from the biopsy table. He will&#xD;
      then be allowed to get dressed and recover. The patient will then be allowed to leave our&#xD;
      Gonda 7 urology clinic. He will be sent out with a reminder to complete the questionnaires at&#xD;
      1 and 4 weeks after biopsy. These questionnaires will be used to assess quality of life&#xD;
      changes that may be brought on by the prostate biopsy. Two surveys will be used to determine&#xD;
      how long the changes lasted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, our long term study will look at how the prostate biopsy and anesthetic methods&#xD;
      affect surgical removal of the prostate. We will identify those patients who end up having a&#xD;
      biopsy positive for cancer. If they elect surgical management, we will review the surgeon?s&#xD;
      operative report to identify any difficulties he or she encountered in their case. We would&#xD;
      compare our three groups to understand if an anesthetic location is associated with any&#xD;
      difficulty in the surgical cases as coded by the staff surgeon. It will also be critical to&#xD;
      review operative times and estimated blood loss among the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. Anticipated Results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer is a major concern for men in our modern times. They will have to undergo&#xD;
      prostate biopsy for diagnosis. This procedure is a vital part of the diagnostic armamentarium&#xD;
      in urology. It can be a painful procedure, but there are ways to improve tolerance. In this&#xD;
      study, we plan to define which anesthetic method provides the best pain relief during an&#xD;
      office biopsy of the prostate. In addition, we will see how the anesthetic impacts quality of&#xD;
      life and surgical interventions for cancer. This information will improve clinical practice&#xD;
      and patient satisfaction with the procedure.&#xD;
