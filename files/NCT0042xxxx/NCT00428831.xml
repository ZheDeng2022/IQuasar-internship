      The main purpose of this study is to look at relationships between types of flu viruses and&#xD;
      characteristics of infected patients, including vaccination status, organ system involvement,&#xD;
      and disease severity. In this study, 500 patients with respiratory illnesses will have&#xD;
      nose/throat fluid samples collected. At Children's Hospital Boston, patients 30 days to 5&#xD;
      years of age will be recruited; at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, patients of any age&#xD;
      will be eligible. The researchers will compare the symptoms of infection by similar flu virus&#xD;
      types and look at differences in the flu virus types between the 2 age groups of patients.&#xD;
      The researchers will also look at whether any flu virus types first show up in the children&#xD;
      prior to infecting the adults. Hopefully this study will improve understanding of how flu&#xD;
      viruses develop, spread, and cause disease. This information may help the development of more&#xD;
      effective flu vaccines, prevention measures, and treatments.&#xD;

      There is evidence that the pediatric population, in particular, may play an essential role in&#xD;
      influenza transmission. One recent study showed that children between the ages of 3 and 4&#xD;
      years were consistently the first population group to be affected by influenza illness over&#xD;
      several winter seasons. In addition, influenza illness in children less than 5 years of age&#xD;
      was the strongest predictor of mortality among adults. Collecting samples from adults as well&#xD;
      as children in the pre-school age group would enable researchers to further examine the&#xD;
      specific role this population plays in the evolution of influenza virus lineages and the&#xD;
      development of dominant strains. In this prospective observational study, the researchers are&#xD;
      therefore proposing to collect samples from pediatric patients at Children's Hospital and&#xD;
      from adults at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. This will enable the researchers to&#xD;
      compare the clinical manifestations resulting from infection by similar strains and to&#xD;
      examine differences in the genomic sequences of the viruses between the two population&#xD;
      groups. The primary objective of this study is to conduct a pilot study to explore&#xD;
      correlations between influenza viral strains and clinical characteristics of infected&#xD;
      patients, including vaccination status, organ system involvement, and disease severity. With&#xD;
      regard to outcome measures, the researchers will determine rates of clinical features&#xD;
      associated with specific viral strains. The clinical characteristics the researchers will&#xD;
      examine are vaccination status, illness symptoms (presence of fever, cough, runny nose/&#xD;
      stuffy nose, headache, myalgia, fatigue), initial O2 saturation, treatment with antibiotics&#xD;
      or antivirals, hospitalization, daycare or kindergarten attendance, exposure to elderly&#xD;
      persons, and length of illness. The secondary study objective is to conduct a pilot study to&#xD;
      compare the influenza genomic sequences and clinical data from pediatric and adult patients&#xD;
      infected with influenza and to explore potential viral transmission patterns between these&#xD;
      two populations. With regard to the outcome measures, the researchers will determine rates of&#xD;
      clinical features and of specific viral strains in the pediatric and adult populations. The&#xD;
      clinical characteristics the researchers will examine are the same as in the primary&#xD;
      objective. The researchers will also identify any temporal patterns in the infections caused&#xD;
      by specific viral strains in the two groups. Specifically, the researchers will examine&#xD;
      whether any viral strains first emerge in the pediatric population prior to infecting the&#xD;
      adult group. A total of 500 patients with respiratory illnesses will be recruited at&#xD;
      Children's Hospital Boston and at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. At Children's&#xD;
      Hospital, patients 30 days to 5 years of age will be recruited; at Beth Israel Deaconess&#xD;
      Medical Center patients of any age will be eligible. The researchers will recruit patients of&#xD;
      both genders and of any health status. Respiratory samples and clinical information will be&#xD;
      collected from each participant. It is hoped that this study will help further the&#xD;
      researchers' understanding of how influenza viruses evolve, spread, and cause disease. In the&#xD;
      future, this may help in the development of more effective vaccines and prevention measures,&#xD;
      as well as treatments for people infected with influenza.&#xD;
