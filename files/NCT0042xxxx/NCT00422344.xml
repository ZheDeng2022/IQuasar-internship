  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of RAD-001 and Sunitinib given in combination&#xD;
      for renal cell cancer. We also want to find out what effects (good and bad) the combination&#xD;
      of RAD-001 and Sunitinib have on you and your tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAD001 is a pill that works by shutting down some of the pathways in the cell that make&#xD;
      tumors grow. Sunitinib is a pill that works by shutting off the signal in the cancer cells&#xD;
      that tell the cells to grow blood vessels. Without this signal, the blood vessels to the&#xD;
      tumors shrink down.&#xD;

      To assess the maximum tolerated doses and overall safety and tolerability of Sunitinib&#xD;
      administered in combination with RAD001 for the treatment of patients with metastatic renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess antitumor activity of the combination of Sunitinib and RAD001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to confirm that the 2 agents can be administered safely in&#xD;
      combination. Patients will begin treatment with Sunitinib and RAD001 on Day 1. RAD001 will be&#xD;
      administered orally on a weekly schedule. Sunitinib will be given orally on a 4 weeks on, 2&#xD;
      weeks off schedule. DLT determination will be based on toxicities observed in Cycle 1 - a&#xD;
      cycle is defined by Sunitinib dosing ( 6 weeks). Once the MTD for the combination has been&#xD;
      identified, a total of 10 patients will be enrolled at the highest dose level that allows for&#xD;
      administration of multiple cycles and provides potentially therapeutic drug levels of both&#xD;
      drugs to further assess safety and tolerability and to obtain a preliminary assessment of&#xD;
      efficacy. Patients will be treated with RAD001 and Sunitinib until there is disease&#xD;
      progression, significant toxicity or withdrawal of patient consent. Patients judged to derive&#xD;
      benefit from treatment would be offered participation in a continuation protocol at the&#xD;
      conclusion of this study.&#xD;

RAD001 will be given orally daily or weekly in subsequent cohorts with the first treatment on day 1. DLT determination will be based on toxicities observed in Cycles 1 - a cycle being defined by Sunitinib dosing.
