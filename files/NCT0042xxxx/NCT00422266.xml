  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of chronic degenerative diseases, especially cardiovascular disease (CVD), is&#xD;
      high world over and especially in India. High blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels are&#xD;
      known to be important risk factors for CVD. There is a strong body of evidence for the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of plant sterols on blood total and LDL-cholesterol and omega-3 fatty&#xD;
      acids from fish on blood triglycerides. However, the combined benefits of consuming both&#xD;
      plant sterols and omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil on blood cholesterol and triglycerides&#xD;
      has not been investigated previously, except in one study where the methodology used was not&#xD;
      the most appropriate for testing such a combination. In addition, most studies on plant&#xD;
      sterol efficacy realised so far were done in Western countries. The present study will&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy of plant sterols and omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil on improving&#xD;
      the cardiovascular risk profile of Indian adults with dyslipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that, after 4 weeks of intervention, men consuming both plant sterols and&#xD;
      omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil will have a lower cardiovascular risk profile than men&#xD;
      receiving only plant sterols or only fish oil or none of these dietary supplements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized parallel (2 x 2 factorial)&#xD;
      design with 3 experimental treatments and one control treatment. A two week run-in period&#xD;
      will be observed during which all subjects will be given placebos for plant sterols.&#xD;
      Thereafter the subjects will be randomly allocated to the 4 treatment groups for the&#xD;
      intervention period of 4 weeks and will undergo baseline assessment of blood lipids,&#xD;
      inflammatory and coagulation markers, anthropometry, lifestyle and dietary habits. The&#xD;
      intervention period will be closed by repeating measurements of lipids, inflammatory and&#xD;
      coagulation markers, anthropometry, lifestyle and diet. Participants are mildly&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemic adult males (TC between 5.0-8.0 mmol/L), aged between 35-55 years who&#xD;
      are employees of NTPC, Badarpur, New Delhi will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be randomly allocated to the four treatment groups (1 control and 3&#xD;
      experimental, 50 subjects per group) with the help of computer generated random number&#xD;
      tables. In case of a surplus of volunteers, a lottery method of selection will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active and control products will be almost identical with respect to taste and appearance&#xD;
      and will only differ in coding. During the study, the treatment code of the products will be&#xD;
      blinded and only known by a person not directly involved in the study. The subjects will only&#xD;
      be identified by a unique identification code given to them at the time of filling their&#xD;
      interview-schedules. All the information obtained from the subjects will be coded using this&#xD;
      unique identification code. During the intervention period the key linking subject's names&#xD;
      and codes will only be accessible to authorized staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each subject the Investigator and Sponsor will each receive a blinded code envelope with&#xD;
      details of treatment. In case of an emergency (e.g. Serious Adverse Event possibly related to&#xD;
      treatments, or unexpected Adverse Events), the envelope can be opened to identify the&#xD;
      treatment given to a subject. The Investigator and Sponsor will immediately inform each other&#xD;
      about such de-blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding. Only after&#xD;
      the blind review meeting of PI, Investigator and Sponsor, the randomization codes will be&#xD;
      broken and made available for data analysis.&#xD;
