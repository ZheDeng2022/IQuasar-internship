      This is a phase I study to examine the safety and immunogenicity of MVA85A delivered&#xD;
      intradermally into the deltoid region in volunteers who have recieved BCG in the past 20&#xD;
      years&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Selection of volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers for the study will be recruited through advertisements. Each volunteer will have&#xD;
      received an information sheet concerning the study and will have agreed to participate in&#xD;
      writing. Volunteers will be given at least 48 hours between reading the information leaflet&#xD;
      and agreeing to participate. Female volunteers will be told of the theoretical risk of&#xD;
      congenital anomaly should they become pregnant during the study and only those who undertake&#xD;
      to take precautions to avoid pregnancy during the study period will be eligible. Volunteers&#xD;
      will give signed consent for their GP's to be notified about their participation in the&#xD;
      trial. The GP will be faxed a letter on the day of screening and asked to reply if they know&#xD;
      of a reason why the volunteer should not take part. The signed consent form will also be&#xD;
      faxed with the letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 Screening&#xD;

      Volunteers will be asked to sign the informed consent form for screening. The following will&#xD;
      be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory evaluations - including clinical chemistry, haematology, HLA typing,&#xD;
           anti-vaccinia antibodies, anti-HBV antibodies, anti-HCV antibodies, anti-HIV antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heaf test - to exclude prior exposure to TB&#xD;

                liver disease, renal disease, gastrointestinal disease, neurological illness,&#xD;
                psychiatric disorder, drug or alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Oral or systemic steroid medication or the use of immunosuppressive agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Positive HIV antibody test, HCV antibody test or positive HBV serology except&#xD;
                post-vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Heaf test greater than Grade II&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Confirmed pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Previous MVA immunisations&#xD;
&#xD;
                5 Withdrawal Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Withdrawal of consent by subject for any reason&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Loss to follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Non-compliance with study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Protocol violation&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Serious adverse event (as defined in Appendix 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Any other reason at discretion of the Principal Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Confirmed pregnancy during study period&#xD;
&#xD;
                6 Immunisation&#xD;
&#xD;
                On Day 0, subjects will receive a single intradermal injection of 5 x 107pfu in&#xD;
                0.1ml over the deltoid muscle. Subjects will be observed for an hour after all&#xD;
                immunisations. Vital signs will be monitored at 30 and 60 minutes&#xD;
                post-immunisation. Local reactions at the site of administration will be evaluated&#xD;
                at 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
                A photograph of the injection site may be taken at 48 hours (with written consent).&#xD;
                The injection site will be reviewed 7 days after each immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Blood will be taken at the following time points: At the screening visit*, prior to&#xD;
                the first vaccination, *1 week after the first vaccination, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8&#xD;
                weeks, *12 weeks, and 24 weeks after the vaccination. Up to 55 mls will be taken at&#xD;
                any one time with the total being no more than 500 mls over the study period.&#xD;
                *Samples taken on these dates will be tested for full blood count and biochemical&#xD;
                screen. Immunological assays will be performed at all time points to determine&#xD;
                vaccine immunogenicity. A pregnancy test will be performed prior to vaccination for&#xD;
                female volunteers. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be prepared for cellular&#xD;
                immunological assays to be performed without or following cryopreservation. Other&#xD;
                serological measures of immune response, i.e. antibody titres, will be assayed on&#xD;
                frozen plasma samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
                All blood tests will be taken within 1-3 days of the due date as described in the&#xD;
                schedule above.&#xD;
&#xD;
                7 Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
                The occurance and severity of local side-effects The occurance and severity of&#xD;
                systemic side-effects The induction of T cell responses (as measured by an&#xD;
                interferon-gamma Elispot assay).&#xD;
&#xD;
                Proliferation assays and cytotoxic T cell assays will be performed on strong CD4+&#xD;
                and CD8+ responses respectively.&#xD;
