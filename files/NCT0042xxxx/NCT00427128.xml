  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study randomized two stratifications of acute phase MDD SSRI responders, categorized as&#xD;
      having either &quot;true drug&quot; response or &quot;placebo response&quot; pattern, to continuation with SSRI&#xD;
      vs placebo in a double-blind trial to determine if stratification category predicted&#xD;
      continuation outcome.&#xD;

      This study enrolled 627 subjects with Major Depressive illness at New York State Psychiatric&#xD;
      Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. Subjects were treated with fluoxetine 10-60mg&#xD;
      over a 12 week period. The &quot;responder&quot; group was defined by those no longer meeting criteria&#xD;
      for Major Depression at week 12, along with CGI ratings of &quot;much improved&quot; or &quot;very much&#xD;
      improved&quot; as determined by an independent evaluator. At week 12 &quot;non-responders&quot; were&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study and received open label treatment; responders were randomized in&#xD;
      double-blind fashion to either fluoxetine continuation (20-80mg daily) at response dose or&#xD;
      placebo switch for up to 24 weeks. The responder group was stratified by &quot;specific or true&quot;&#xD;
      drug response (late onset and persistent once attained) and &quot;nonspecific or placebo&quot; response&#xD;
      (early onset or nonpersistent) patterns. Subjects were evaluated at one week and two week&#xD;
      intervals at different phases of continuation treatment, and depression relapse was&#xD;
      determined by agreement between study psychiatrist and independent evaluator CGI and Ham-D&#xD;
      ratings, as well as administration of the MDD section of the Mood Disorders Module of the&#xD;
      Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders at those visits. A subset of study&#xD;
      participants also provided DNA samples to determine whether there are any DNA markers of&#xD;
      response type. Data were analyzed to test the following hypotheses: that during continuation&#xD;
      fluoxetine treatment improved patients with a &quot;true drug&quot; acute response pattern randomized&#xD;
      to placebo had a poorer outcome than those maintained on active drug; that during&#xD;
      continuation fluoxetine treatment improved patients with a &quot;placebo&quot; acute response pattern&#xD;
      randomized to placebo had no worse an outcome than those maintained on drug; that during&#xD;
      continuation fluoxetine treatment patients with a &quot;true drug&quot; acute response pattern&#xD;
      randomized to continue on fluoxetine were more likely to maintain their benefit than those&#xD;
      with a &quot;placebo&quot; pattern.&#xD;
