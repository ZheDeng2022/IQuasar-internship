    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multi-center study is to obtain clinical data to substantiate that&#xD;
      Aastrom TRC autologous bone marrow cells will regenerate bone in patients with established&#xD;
      (appendicular skeletal) non union fractures, when used with one of the commonly employed&#xD;
      commercially available allograft chip matrices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for regeneration of atrophic long bone fracture non-union is&#xD;
      autologous bone and marrow chiseled from the patient's iliac crest in open surgery under&#xD;
      general anesthesia. This method for harvesting bone and marrow is associated with substantial&#xD;
      morbidity of long-term pain, the possibility of deep-seated infection at the site of the bone&#xD;
      harvest and other indirect consequences such as extended time of surgery, substantial expense&#xD;
      and the potential for blood transfusion. The procedure is also associated with a bone graft&#xD;
      failure rate of at least 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the substantial morbidity resulting from the aggressive open surgical procedure,&#xD;
      alternatives are sought. Current alternatives to autologous bone include commercially&#xD;
      available synthetic, xenograft and allograft matrices, either used alone or combined with&#xD;
      bone autograft. Cell-free substitutes, such as matrices combined with platelet rich plasma or&#xD;
      recombinant bone morphogenic proteins for osteoinductivity, are also used. These&#xD;
      alternatives, although less morbid than a full bone harvest, have not yet been stringently&#xD;
      determined to be equivalent. Therefore, there is a continuing search for additional improved&#xD;
      alternatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aastrom Biosciences, Inc. has developed a unique process for growing human bone marrow,&#xD;
      including the early stem cell populations, from small samples of percutaneously aspirated&#xD;
      bone marrow. The process is carried out in the AastromReplicell Cell Production System (ARS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed to obtain clinical data to substantiate that Aastrom TRC&#xD;
      autologous bone marrow cells will regenerate bone in patients with established non union&#xD;
      fractures, when used with one of the commonly employed commercially available allograft chip&#xD;
      matrices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bone marrow cells will be obtained by a brief, percutaneous, small volume aspiration&#xD;
      (approximately 30 - 50 ml) from the posterior iliac crest obtained under local and conscious&#xD;
      sedation. Percutaneous marrow aspiration is substantially less morbid and time consuming than&#xD;
      the current open surgical process of bone autograft harvest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will treat up to 36 patients (11 in the first group and 25 in a second group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated using standard surgical procedures for the treatment of non union&#xD;
      fractures (including commonly used hardware needed to stabilize the fracture). The processed&#xD;
      cells will be mixed with commercially available bone matrix during surgery and placed in the&#xD;
      area of the fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored for 12 months following the surgery.&#xD;
