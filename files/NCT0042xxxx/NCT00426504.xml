  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Historically, patients with stage III and IV head and neck cancer have been treated with&#xD;
      surgery and/or radiation therapy. Based on the results of recent clinical trials, in patients&#xD;
      not able to undergo surgery, chemotherapy with radiation therapy has been adopted as the&#xD;
      current standard of care. The chemo-radiation approach, however, entails a significant&#xD;
      increase in treatment-related toxicity, limiting the extent to which this treatment can be&#xD;
      offered to patients. In this trial, the ability of a new form of radiation therapy delivery&#xD;
      called IMRT will be evaluated for its ability to reduce the amount of radiation-induced&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mechanisms of action to explain the radiation-induced toxic effects resulting from the&#xD;
      more aggressive radiation therapy treatments of head and neck cancer include the additive and&#xD;
      synergistic increase in mucositis from the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The&#xD;
      severe toxicity associated with more aggressive radiation therapy treatments for locoregional&#xD;
      head and neck cancer limits the extent to which these treatments can be offered since many&#xD;
      patients present with nutritional deficiencies and consequent general debility. Intensity&#xD;
      Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) is a technology has the potential for exquisite dose painting&#xD;
      and structuring in such a manner that it can permit exclusion of normal tissues and sensitive&#xD;
      structures from the high dose radiation volume without compromising primary tumor or nodal&#xD;
      target coverage. In this phase I/II feasibility trial, radical radiotherapy will be delivered&#xD;
      using Helical Tomotherapy Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (HT-IMRT) to a dose of 66-70 Gy to&#xD;
      involved areas and to at least 50 Gy to un-involved sites, treated prophylactically. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that the pattern of failure and toxicity profiles of patients treated with&#xD;
      helical tomotherapy will demonstrate the greater efficacy of helical tomotherapy, as compared&#xD;
      with conventional radiotherapy, in the treatment of cancers of the head and neck.&#xD;
