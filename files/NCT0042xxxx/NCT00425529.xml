  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to test the tolerance and practicality of the&#xD;
      new device Module AOX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to determine the changes in oxidative, antioxidative status,&#xD;
      plasma free amino acids, and various immune parameters in critically ill patients receiving&#xD;
      the enteral nutrition with and without using Module AOX.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Surgery and trauma induce hypercatabolism accompanied by a systemic immunoinflammtory&#xD;
      response and massive production of reactive oxygen species at the site of injury. In these&#xD;
      situations, requirements for certain amino acids (glutamine, cysteine) and antioxidant&#xD;
      micronutrients (zinc, vitamin E, vitamin C, beta-caroteen, selenium) are markedly increased&#xD;
      and may not be covered by the levels normally present in standard enteral diets, especially&#xD;
      in the early phase when enteral nutrition is introduced gradually. Thus, supplementation with&#xD;
      amino acids and antioxidant micronutrients may be appropiate in order to optimize nutritional&#xD;
      support in such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administration of selected nutrients via modular devices added to a standard enteral&#xD;
      formulation is an attractive means of providing optimized nutrition support for specific&#xD;
      disease states. Module AOX is intended for supplementation of patients requiring nutritional&#xD;
      support for a condition in which oxidative stress is expected. The module contains:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glutamine: to support gut mucosal and immune function, to minimize early depletion of&#xD;
           glutamine stores and preserve body protein&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cysteine: to support synthesis of glutathione, an important cellular antioxidant, and to&#xD;
           support the synthesis of acute phase proteins&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vitamin E, vitamin C and beta-caroteen: water- and lipid-soluble antioxidant&#xD;
           micronutrients to boost antioxidant defenses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Zinc: to compensate for increased losses and to support protein synthesis, immune&#xD;
           function and wound healing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Selenium: to compensate for increased losses, support antioxidant defenses and immune&#xD;
           function&#xD;
