      The purpose of this study is to determine whether psychological intervention is effective in&#xD;
      improving quality of life, mood, and relationships among adults with end-stage renal disease&#xD;
      who are awaiting kidney transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite known quality of life (QOL) deficits associated with end-stage renal disease (ESRD),&#xD;
      there have been very few attempts to develop strategies to improve QOL in adults with ESRD&#xD;
      awaiting renal transplantation. The long-term goal of this research program is to better&#xD;
      understand how QOL can be enhanced, to identify the mechanisms underlying QOL changes, to&#xD;
      identify which patients benefit most from QOL intervention, and to determine whether QOL&#xD;
      benefits can extend beyond transplantation. The objective of this research is to determine&#xD;
      the effectiveness, feasibility and applicability of Quality of Life Therapy (QOLT) in&#xD;
      treating adults with ESRD awaiting renal transplantation. In a recent small, single-center&#xD;
      clinical trial, we demonstrated that QOLT can improve QOL, psychological functioning, and&#xD;
      social intimacy in patients awaiting lung transplantation. We now seek to examine whether&#xD;
      this intervention can be effectively adapted and implemented with adults with ESRD who are&#xD;
      awaiting renal transplantation. The central hypothesis is that by targeting improvements in&#xD;
      specific life domains, QOLT yields significant clinical benefits in QOL, psychological&#xD;
      functioning, and the patient-caregiver relationship. This hypothesis is being tested by&#xD;
      pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the effectiveness of QOLT; 2) Examine the&#xD;
      differential effectiveness of QOLT by race (White, African American); and 3) Assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of a multisite R01 application. Under the first aim, adults with ESRD awaiting&#xD;
      renal transplantation are being randomized to receive QOLT, Supportive Therapy (ST), or&#xD;
      Standard Care (SC). Primary outcomes are changes in QOL, psychological functioning, and&#xD;
      social intimacy at 1 and 12 weeks post-treatment. Under the second aim, the relationship&#xD;
      between race and intervention outcomes will be closely examined. Under the third aim,&#xD;
      attrition rates, reasons for attrition, therapist adherence to treatment protocols, and&#xD;
      participant satisfaction ratings are being gathered to assess the need for protocol changes&#xD;
      prior to developing a larger, multisite clinical trial R01 application. This study is&#xD;
      innovative because it is among the first to evaluate a theoretically-driven psychological&#xD;
      intervention to specifically improve QOL in the context of ESRD and renal transplantation.&#xD;
      The research is significant because it is expected to advance and expand understanding of how&#xD;
      QOL can be improved in patients with ESRD.&#xD;
