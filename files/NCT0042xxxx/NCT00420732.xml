      To determine the response rate of the administration of HyperAcute-Lung Cancer Vaccine for&#xD;
      subjects with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer who have been treated with&#xD;
      first line platinum-doublet therapy and have responded or are considered to have stable&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unfortunately, despite the best clinical efforts and breakthroughs in biotechnology, most&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with advanced stage lung cancer continue to die from their disease.&#xD;
      Reasons for this include that: 1) patients are often diagnosed at a time when their lung&#xD;
      cancer has already spread to other sites such as the chest cavity, bone, lung, liver, and&#xD;
      brain limiting the options for local radiation therapy and surgery, and 2) the cancer cells&#xD;
      are resistant or become resistant to chemotherapy drugs used to treat the patient. Resistance&#xD;
      to one type of chemotherapy agent often rapidly leads to resistance against many other&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These reasons are the major causes of cancer progression that are usually discussed when&#xD;
      considering treatment options for patients with disease that continues to grow and spread.&#xD;
      However, another important part of the body should be considered-- the immune system.&#xD;
      Scientists have clearly shown that lung cancer cells produce a number of abnormal proteins or&#xD;
      abnormal amounts of certain proteins found in normal lung cells. Normally one would expect a&#xD;
      patient to develop an immune response against these abnormal proteins found in their cancer&#xD;
      and attack them much the way we would fight off an infection from a foreign bacteria or&#xD;
      virus. However, for reasons that scientists do not fully understand, the immune system fails&#xD;
      to respond to these abnormal proteins and does not attack the lung cancer cells. This human&#xD;
      clinical trial proposes a new way to make the immune system recognize the cancer and&#xD;
      encourage it to attack the cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many people are familiar with the idea of transplants between people of organs like the&#xD;
      kidneys or heart. When an organ transplant between two people is completed one of the&#xD;
      problems that can occur is rejection of the donated organ by the recipient. This can occur&#xD;
      because the immune system of the patient who receives the organ attacks the donated organ. If&#xD;
      you were to attempt to transplant a pig heart to a human the rejection would be dramatically&#xD;
      stronger than when organs are transplanted between two people. This is partly because lower&#xD;
      animals express sugar-protein patterns on the surface of their cells that humans do not. In&#xD;
      fact, our immune systems can quickly recognize tissues from lower mammals such as the pig or&#xD;
      the mouse and destroys them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, we have put a mouse gene into human lung cancer cells that produces these&#xD;
      abnormal sugar patterns and stimulates the immune system to attack the lung cancer. This&#xD;
      strategy works well to kill human other cancer cells in the laboratory, but it needs to be&#xD;
      tried in lung cancer patients to see if it will be effective and to determine if such a&#xD;
      treatment causes any side effects. We propose to test this new treatment in subjects with&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer to see if it can stop, slow or destroy tumors in these subjects.&#xD;
      Subjects will be injected with an anti-tumor vaccine consisting of a mixture of three types&#xD;
      of dead human lung cancer cells that have been genetically altered to express the mouse gene&#xD;
      responsible for making this abnormal sugar-protein on the cells.&#xD;
