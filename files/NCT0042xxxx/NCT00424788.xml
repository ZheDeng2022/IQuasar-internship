  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Natalizumab (TYSABRI) is a protein-based drug that is manufactured by Biogen Idec in&#xD;
      partnership with Elan Pharmaceuticals. Natalizumab is approved in the US and Europe for the&#xD;
      treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The purpose of this study is to determine whether the&#xD;
      amount of natalizumab (TYSABRI) that is present in your blood (plasma) can be reduced or&#xD;
      eliminated by separating and removing the plasma and replacing it with other fluids, a&#xD;
      process called plasma exchange.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  considered by the Investigator to be free of signs and symptoms suggestive of any&#xD;
             serious opportunistic infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  willing to discontinue and remain free from concomitant immunosuppressive or&#xD;
             immunomodulatory treatment (including interferon beta and glatiramer acetate) for the&#xD;
             duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  willing and able to comply with the site's plasma exchange protocol which may require&#xD;
             hospitalization or daily visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  considered by the Investigator to be immunocompromised&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  history of, or available abnormal laboratory results indicative of any major disease&#xD;
             that would preclude the administration of a recombinant humanized antibody&#xD;
             immunomodulating agent for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  condition(s) considered to be contraindication(s) for plasma exchange, including but&#xD;
             not limited to bleeding diathesis, hypotension, or vascular access limitations&#xD;
