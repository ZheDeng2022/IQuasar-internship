      The investigators hypothesize that continuation of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) at home&#xD;
      after an episode of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) treated by NIV in COPD&#xD;
      patients would reduce the likelihood of death and recurrent AHRF requiring NIV or intubation.&#xD;
      The investigators designed this study in a way that recruited COPD patients would be started&#xD;
      on home NIV or sham treatment after an episode of AHRF requiring acute NIV. The patients are&#xD;
      acclimatised to NIV application after a few days of acute use. The investigators chose&#xD;
      occurrence of life-threatening event (recurrent AHRF and death) as the primary endpoint.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has been shown in randomised controlled trials to improve&#xD;
      arterial blood gases, reduce intubation and mortality rates in patients suffering from&#xD;
      exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) complicated by acute&#xD;
      hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) [1-7]. Despite success of NIV in AHRF of COPD,&#xD;
      survivors of this group of patients might suffer from further episodes of AHRF after&#xD;
      discharge. It has been found in a recent study that COPD patients who survived AHRF after&#xD;
      treatment with acute NIV had a high risk of readmission and life-threatening events in the&#xD;
      ensuing year [8]. At one year after discharge, 80% had been readmitted for respiratory&#xD;
      diagnoses, 63% had another life-threatening event and 49% had died, mainly due to respiratory&#xD;
      failure. Survivors spent a median of 12% time hospitalized in the subsequent year. A&#xD;
      significant proportion of survivors required repeated NIV for recurrent AHRF. Another study&#xD;
      showed that in COPD patients who declined intubation for AHRF and were treated with acute&#xD;
      NIV, these outcomes were even worse, with a 1-year survival of only 30% [9]. It becomes&#xD;
      imperative to find ways to reduce the occurrence of life-threatening events in the survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been uncontrolled data to suggest that home NIV might reduce both hospital&#xD;
      admissions and clinic visits in severe COPD with hypercapnic respiratory failure. In 11&#xD;
      severe stable COPD patients with chronic hypercapnia who did not respond to conventional&#xD;
      treatment, Jones et al put them on home NIV [10]. Hospital admissions and clinic visits were&#xD;
      halved in the subsequent year, together with a sustained improvement in arterial blood gases.&#xD;
      Cost saving was demonstrated with home NIV in severe COPD in another study [11]. However,&#xD;
      results from randomized controlled studies (RCTs) are conflicting. Three early studies&#xD;
      suggested that home NIV was not superior to standard treatment in stable severe COPD [12, 13,&#xD;
      14]. On the other hand, Meecham-Jones et al found that NIV with long term oxygen therapy&#xD;
      (LTOT) significantly improved daytime blood gases, nocturnal gas exchange and sleep quality&#xD;
      in severe COPD [15]. A long-term RCT on home NIV in severe COPD showed that home NIV&#xD;
      significantly reduced dyspnoea ratings, improved psychomotor coordination and decreased&#xD;
      hospital admissions at 3 month, though reduction in hospital admissions was no longer evident&#xD;
      by 12 months [16]. However, these randomized studies have been criticized for including&#xD;
      chronic stable COPD patients who were not hypercapnic enough to benefit from home NIV, using&#xD;
      inadequate inflation pressures, inadequate patient acclimatization time and not selecting the&#xD;
      optimal outcome variables [17]. In the most recent RCT [18], home NIV with LTOT was shown to&#xD;
      significantly improve gas exchange, dyspnoea score and quality of life; there was also a&#xD;
      trend to reduced hospital and ICU admissions. However, the study was only powered to detect&#xD;
      improvement in daytime PaCO2 in the NIV group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that continuation of NIV at home after an episode of AHRF treated by NIV in&#xD;
      COPD patients would reduce the likelihood of death and recurrent AHRF requiring NIV or&#xD;
      intubation. We design this study in a way that recruited COPD patients would be started on&#xD;
      home NIV or sham treatment after an episode of AHRF requiring acute NIV. The patients are&#xD;
      acclimatised to NIV application after a few days of acute use. We choose occurrence of&#xD;
      life-threatening event (recurrent AHRF and death) as the primary endpoint.&#xD;
