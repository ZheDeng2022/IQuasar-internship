      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of Avastin™&#xD;
      (bevacizumab) and Velcade™ (bortezomib) that can be given in combination to patients with a&#xD;
      metastatic or unresectable advanced malignancy. The safety and effectiveness of this drug&#xD;
      combination will also be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bevacizumab is an anti-cancer drug designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells by blocking blood vessels that supply nutrients necessary for tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bortezomib is an anti-cancer drug designed to block the proteins needed for tumor growth.&#xD;
      This may cause cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be enrolled into a group&#xD;
      of about 6 participants. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose of&#xD;
      bevacizumab and bortezomib combined. The next group of participants will receive the next&#xD;
      highest dose of bevacizumab and bortezomib combined. This process will continue until the&#xD;
      study doctor finds the highest dose that can be tolerated. The dose that you receive will&#xD;
      depend on when you are enrolled in this study and the safety data that is available at that&#xD;
      time. The dose of bevacizumab and bortezomib that you receive may be lowered if you do not&#xD;
      tolerate the study drug combination well. You will not receive any doses of the study drug&#xD;
      higher than the dose you are first assigned to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab and bortezomib will be given in &quot;cycles.&quot; Cycles will be about 21 days long or&#xD;
      longer, depending on any side effects you may experience. During Cycle 1, Day 1, you will&#xD;
      receive bevacizumab by vein over 90 minutes. If bevacizumab is well tolerated in Cycle 1, it&#xD;
      will given over 60 minutes in Cycle 2. If it is well tolerated in Cycle 2, it will be given&#xD;
      over 30 minutes in Cycle 3. It will continue to be given over 30 minutes in further cycles as&#xD;
      long as the drug is still being well tolerated. Depending on which dose level you are&#xD;
      assigned to, you will receive bortezomib on Days 1 and 8, or on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11. You&#xD;
      will receive bortezomib by vein over about 1-5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have blood drawn (about 1 tablespoon each time) for routine tests once a week during&#xD;
      Cycle 1. You will have a physical exam sometime between Days 7 to 14 during Cycle 1. During&#xD;
      the rest of the cycles, you will have a physical exam and blood drawn (about 1 tablespoon&#xD;
      each time) for routine tests once every 3 weeks. The status of the disease will be measured&#xD;
      by a CT or MRI scan after every 2 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerable dose (maximum tolerated dose or MTD) of the combination of&#xD;
      bevacizumab and bortezomib is found, up to 15 additional participants with advanced cancer&#xD;
      will be enrolled to receive that dose, so that researchers can learn more about the effects&#xD;
      of the study drugs on the tumor. A tumor biopsy will be required within two weeks before the&#xD;
      first treatment and again at the end of the first cycle for those patients. Up to 10&#xD;
      additional patients with kidney cancer will be enrolled to receive the highest tolerable&#xD;
      dose. Tumor biopsies are optional for patients with kidney cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue to receive bevacizumab and bortezomib on this study, unless the cancer gets&#xD;
      worse or you experience any intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once your participation is over in this study, you will receive standard of care follow-up&#xD;
      for the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Bevacizumab and bortezomib are both FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available. Bevacizumab is FDA approved for the treatment of colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      Bortezomib is FDA approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The combination use of&#xD;
      bevacizumab and bortezomib is investigational and authorized for use in research only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 111 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with advanced or metastatic cancer that is refractory to standard therapy,&#xD;
             relapsed after standard therapy, or have no standard therapy that induces a complete&#xD;
             response (CR) rate of at least 10% or improves survival by at least three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must be &gt;/= 6 weeks beyond treatment with nitrosoureas or mitomycin-C, &gt;/= 4&#xD;
             weeks beyond other chemo- or radiotherapy, and must have recovered to &lt;/= grade 1&#xD;
             toxicity for any treatment-limiting toxicity of prior therapy. (Exception: patients&#xD;
             who received palliative low dose radiotherapy to the limbs 1-4 weeks before this&#xD;
             therapy provided pelvis, ribs, sternum, scapulae, vertebrae or skull were not included&#xD;
             in the radiotherapy field). Patients who have received non-chemotherapeutic biologic&#xD;
             agents must wait 5 half-lives or 4 weeks, whichever is shorter, from the last day of&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt;/= 2 (Karnofsky &gt;/=&#xD;
             60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function defined as: leukocytes &gt;/=&#xD;
             3,000/mL; absolute neutrophil count &gt;/= 1,500/mL; platelets &gt;/=75,000/mL; creatinine&#xD;
             &lt;/= 2 * Upper Limits of Normal (ULN); total bilirubin &lt;/= 2.0; alanine&#xD;
             aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT) &lt;/= 3 * ULN; Exception for patients with liver&#xD;
             metastasis: total bilirubin &lt;/= 3 * ULN; ALT(SGPT) &lt;/= 5 * ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The effects of bevacizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. Angiogenesis is&#xD;
             of critical importance to fetal development, and bevacizumab is likely to have adverse&#xD;
             consequences in terms of fetal development. For this reason, women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and for 30 days after the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Life expectancy of at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with hemoptysis within 28 days prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with clinically significant unexplained bleeding within 28 days prior to&#xD;
             entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Uncontrolled systemic vascular hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease, including: history of&#xD;
             cerebrovascular accident (CVA) within 6 months, myocardial infarction or unstable&#xD;
             angina within 6 months, unstable angina pectoris.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection requiring parenteral antibiotics on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnant or lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of hypersensitivity to bevacizumab, murine products, or any component of the&#xD;
             formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron, mannitol, or any component of the&#xD;
             formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. (Only for the 10-patient expansion cohort after identification of the MTD): Patients&#xD;
             must be willing to undergo biopsy before treatment and at the end of cycle 1.&#xD;
