  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is the most common metabolic disorder worldwide. Some herbs are&#xD;
      traditionally used in treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Urtica Dioica (UD) or&#xD;
      stinging nettle is traditionally used in Morocco, Turkey, Brasil, Jordan and with much&#xD;
      frequency in northern Iran.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies on animal models along with in vitro studies has shown hypoglycemic effect for&#xD;
      aqueous extract of UD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to investigate hypoglycemic effects of UD tea bags in patients with T2DM on&#xD;
      glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, along with its effects on lipid profile (LP), blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP), liver, and kidney function.&#xD;

      The study will be performed under randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, and&#xD;
      case-control design. The object of this study is patients with T2DM. Patients are randomly&#xD;
      assigned to start with placebo tea bags (3 tea bags as 2-gram tea bag steamed in boiling&#xD;
      water for 20 minutes: mixture of bran powder which is already boiled in water twice plus&#xD;
      spinach powder) in control groups and UD tea bags (3 tea bags as 2-gram tea bag steamed in&#xD;
      boiling water for 20 minutes) in patients with T2DM for two months. Every two weeks, fasting&#xD;
      glucose, postprandial glucose after a standard breakfast, serum insulin, lipids, alanine&#xD;
      amino transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), creatinine (to calculate GFR),&#xD;
      along with blood pressure will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Randomized Clinical Trial.&#xD;
