  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nausea and vomiting are common complaints in the emergency department (ED). There are many&#xD;
      pharmacologic agents used for the treatment of these complaints. None are new nor&#xD;
      experimental. Very little research has been done in the ED setting to determine which of&#xD;
      these agents is most effective with the least adverse effects. Our own previous research&#xD;
      found that droperidol but not prochlorperazine and metoclopramide is more effective than&#xD;
      placebo. Because of the recent FDA black box warning added to droperidol, the use of this&#xD;
      agent has suddenly ceased in many EDs. Promethazine remains a very commonly used antiemetic&#xD;
      in many EDs but one recent study found it less effective than prochlorperazine which was in&#xD;
      turn found no more effective than placebo in our own study. As a result many physicians have&#xD;
      turned to ondansetron, a newer and more expensive agent. Experience among anesthesiologists&#xD;
      and oncologists has shown ondansetron to be highly effective with a minimum of adverse&#xD;
      effects. These patient populations, however, are very different from those found in the ED.&#xD;
      It is our hypothesis that promethazine and ondansetron are equally effective for the ED&#xD;
      treatment of unselected patients with nausea and vomiting with similar rates of adverse&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
