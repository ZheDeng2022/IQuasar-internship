      This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to determine whether the activity&#xD;
      in the brain when someone wins something affects the part of the brain that controls&#xD;
      movement. Studies have shown that the brain releases signals to mark rewards for certain&#xD;
      behavior, like the activity the brain generates when an animal receives food or drink after&#xD;
      performing a certain action. This study will look for a way to detect this kind of signal in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age are eligible for this study. Participants&#xD;
      undergo TMS during two experiments slot machine stimulation and key sequence (see below). For&#xD;
      TMS, a wire coil is held on the subject s scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through&#xD;
      the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The stimulation may cause&#xD;
      twitching in muscles of the face, arm or leg, and there may be a pulling sensation on the&#xD;
      skin under the coil. The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected with small metal disk&#xD;
      electrodes taped onto the skin of the arms or legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stimulation strength needed to activate the hand muscles is determined at the beginning&#xD;
      of each experiment. To do this, the subject sits with his or her arms and hand relaxed.&#xD;
      Magnetic pulses of varying strengths are applied in order to find the right strength. Also, a&#xD;
      series of 45 pairs of magnetic pulses is administered so close to each other that they&#xD;
      produce only one movement. Measurements of the movements generated serve as a baseline for&#xD;
      comparison with movements generated during the experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Slot Machine Simulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects play a computer game similar to a slot machine. They press a button to start the&#xD;
      game and watch as three barrels of the machine spin into place. Subjects can win $0.25, $1or&#xD;
      $5 if all three barrels match when they stop spinning. If all three barrels do not match,&#xD;
      subjects do not win any money, except in rare instances, when they are awarded money even&#xD;
      when all three barrels do not match. In one trial in this experiment, subjects receive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation after they see the second barrel stop spinning. In another&#xD;
      trial, they receive the stimulation after the third barrel stops spinning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Sequence&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects see a letter on a computer screen and press a combination of the three keyboard keys&#xD;
      G, H, and J. If they press the keys in the right order and under the time limit, they win $1.&#xD;
      At some point, the letter displayed changes, and the subjects must guess a new combination to&#xD;
      earn money. Each of the letters corresponds to its own combination of key presses. A few&#xD;
      moments after the subjects see whether they pressed the keys in the right order, they receive&#xD;
      TMS.&#xD;

      Objectvie:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of mesencephalic dopamine neurons in reward processing has been established in&#xD;
      primates using electrophysiological techniques and in humans using functional neuroimaging.&#xD;
      Their role is thought to be dual: i) they show sustained activity with the expectation of a&#xD;
      future reward and ii) a phasic response after reward. Animal data indicate that these&#xD;
      neurons, located in the midbrain areas A8-10, behave as a single functional unit when&#xD;
      activated. They have rich projections to both the prefrontal and motor cortices where they&#xD;
      synapse on interneurons and cortical pyramidal cells, producing primarily inhibition. Though&#xD;
      their function is not fully understood, these projections clearly play an important role in&#xD;
      motivation and learning. Since there are no electrophysiological techniques available to&#xD;
      detect dopaminergic or inhibitory activity in the human prefrontal cortex, our objective is&#xD;
      to develop a paradigm to detect a reward related signal in the primary motor cortex, where&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation can be used to measure brief events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population that we will study will be healthy volunteers between the ages of 18-60,&#xD;
      without any significant medical history, contraindication to TMS or history of addictive&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the dopamine reward-related signal will alter level of evocable&#xD;
      inhibition in primary motor cortex. Using behavioral paradigms that deliver intermittent&#xD;
      reward, we aim to demonstrate a difference in the amount of cortical inhibition, i) when&#xD;
      reward is expected compared to when reward is not expected ii) after rewarded compared to&#xD;
      unrewarded trials iii) when reward follows a variable effortful response, and iv) when there&#xD;
      is uncertainty as to whether a reward will be administered. If we are unable to produce a&#xD;
      signal in the motor cortex with these simple paradigms, we will look for a reward-related&#xD;
      change in inhibition when the rewarded behavior is the associative learning of a motor&#xD;
      sequence. We will control for effects of variations in attention related to the experimental&#xD;
      task, but not specific for reward, with a similar behavioral paradigm that manipulates&#xD;
      attention and expectation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures will be changes in the conditioned/unconditioned MEP for each reward&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
