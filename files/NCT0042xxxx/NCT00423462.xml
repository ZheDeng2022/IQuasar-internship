  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Analysis of the ongoing patient-therapist interaction, the transference, is considered a key&#xD;
      active ingredient in psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy and psychoanalysis.However,&#xD;
      one century after Sigmund Freuds's famous &quot;Dora&quot; case, the first clinical description of&#xD;
      transference, no study of transference interpretations have been published.In the present&#xD;
      study 100 out-patients were randomized to receive one year weekly dynamic psychotherapy, with&#xD;
      and without transference interpretations. That is, one treatment component,transference&#xD;
      interpretations, were added to a comparison condition, therapy of the same format, by the&#xD;
      same therapists, but without use of transference interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treatment session were audiotaped, and treatment integrity have been carefully checked.&#xD;
      Patients were evaluated at treatment termination, one year after treatment termination and&#xD;
      three years after treatment termination. Enrollment of patients started january 1993, and all&#xD;
      follow-up evaluations completed by December 2005.&#xD;

      This study is designed to measure specific long-term effects of transference interpretations&#xD;
      in dynamic psychotherapy, using an experimental dismantling design. One hundred psychiatric&#xD;
      out-patients, referred to seven study therapists, to receive exploratory dynamic&#xD;
      psychotherapy, were randomized to one year weekly dynamic psychotherapy, with and without&#xD;
      transference interpretations.They suffered from mood,anxiety,and personality disorders or&#xD;
      interpersonal problems not due to a mental disorder. All treatment sessions were audiotaped&#xD;
      and treatment integrity carefully checked.All patients have been evaluated before treatment,&#xD;
      after treatment, one year after termination of treatment, and three years after termination&#xD;
      of treatment. The main outcome measures were the Psychodynamic Functioning Scales (PFS) and&#xD;
      Inventory of Interpersonal Problems-Circumplex version (IIP-C).Chang over time is assessed&#xD;
      using linear mixed model analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that patients treated with transference interpretations will have a&#xD;
      more favourable course over the whole study period of four years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second hypothesis is that suitable patients, that is patients with a life long pattern of&#xD;
      more mature object relations (QOR) and/or patients without comorbid personality disorders&#xD;
      will do better with transference interpretations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insight and identification with the therapist will be analyzed as putative mediators of&#xD;
      long-term change in interpersonal functioning&#xD;
