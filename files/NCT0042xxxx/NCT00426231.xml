    <textblock>
      Our research aims to improve the use of medicines known to prevent recurrent heart attacks.&#xD;
      In particular, we know that statin treatment is useful after heart attacks, but many patients&#xD;
      do not use it. There are a few possible reasons for this. Patients cannot find affordable&#xD;
      medicine. Their doctor may not prescribe the medicine after they leave the hospital. Some&#xD;
      people may culturally mistrust using the medicine. So they may decide not to take it even if&#xD;
      it is prescribed. We are developing a hospital based culturally attuned program to target&#xD;
      this problem. In this program, a community health worker counsels and helps patients in&#xD;
      accessing pharmacy assistance programs. We will test whether this program can improve&#xD;
      appropriate statin use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll patients who have heart attacks. We will compare patients who are counseled by&#xD;
      the community health worker with those who get the usual care at baseline and at 6 and 12&#xD;
      months (participants enrolled during the early phase of the recruitment will have an&#xD;
      additional study visit at 24 months). We will test if their &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol levels are&#xD;
      controlled. We will find out how regularly they have filled their questionnaire and taken the&#xD;
      medicine. Finally, we will test if they are getting benefit from the statin treatment. We&#xD;
      will do this using blood tests and imaging the patients' arteries with ultrasound. We will&#xD;
      also measure how cost-effective it is for a hospital to run the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is our goal to develop a community health worker model that is culturally sensitive for&#xD;
      people with cultural, educational or educational barriers. Statin use is known to benefit&#xD;
      patients in theory; such a culturally competent program will improve health outcomes in&#xD;
      practice. After we test it, a cost-effective program such as this can be implemented in other&#xD;
      hospitals.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The lipid-specific and pleiotropic benefits of statin therapy, and secondary prevention of&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD) mortality have been demonstrated. Statin therapy in particular&#xD;
      is underutilized in both white and Black American populations who have CAD and who do not&#xD;
      have access to therapy or who cannot afford it. Systems factors related to these findings&#xD;
      involve a lack of continuous access to medications following hospital discharge for many&#xD;
      Black Americans and for white Americans who do not have the ability to readily afford their&#xD;
      medicines or who do not have the educational background to understand the importance of&#xD;
      therapy. In many cases, there is failure by primary care physicians to continue statin&#xD;
      therapy after discharge in patients who have poor access to therapy or who do not comply with&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy. Patient factors include mistrust and volitional nonadherence related to&#xD;
      beliefs and personal priorities, and a lack of education and support related to preventive&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will thus take place in lower income and lower educational level Black and white&#xD;
      American patients identified at the time of hospitalization and will continue for two years&#xD;
      after a myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, or percutaneous intervention.&#xD;
      The overall hypothesis is that a quality of care intervention delivered to Black and white&#xD;
      American patients with lower incomes and /or education by a culturally competent community&#xD;
      health worker (CHW) within an existing hospital system will result in improved outcomes. The&#xD;
      CHW will counsel patients and help them access resources, including Maryland and private&#xD;
      pharmacy assistance programs. The specific aims are to compare the impact of a hospital-based&#xD;
      CHW intervention versus usual care (UC) on (1) the percent who achieve LDL cholesterol goals,&#xD;
      (2) adherence to the statin regimen, and (3) health outcomes including inflammatory markers&#xD;
      and vascular function at 6 and 12 months after hospitalization for the premature CAD event.&#xD;
      (Participants enrolled during the early phase of the recruitment will have an additional&#xD;
      study visit at 24 months.) We will determine the cost of achieving the LDL-C goal in each&#xD;
      group. Outcome measures include patient adherence (pill counts, modified Hill-Bone&#xD;
      questionnaire), lipid parameters, hs-CRP, and brachial artery reactivity as a marker of&#xD;
      endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention to treat analyses will be used. Multivariable adjusted analysis using generalized&#xD;
      linear models or generalized estimating equations will be used to determine the independent&#xD;
      effect of the interventions after adjusting for covariates. A sample size of 68 subjects per&#xD;
      group can detect hypothesized differences in the proportion of participants meeting goal&#xD;
      levels of LDL-C with 92% power, as the primary outcome at 1 years. This proposal will&#xD;
      demonstrate the effectiveness of a potentially generalizable model of culturally competent&#xD;
      care that will improve the use of statin therapy and its health outcomes in Black and white&#xD;
      Americans with documented CAD and poor access to statin pharmacotherapy.&#xD;
