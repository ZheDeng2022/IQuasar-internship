      Negative physical examination alone has been shown unreliable for excluding intra-abdominal&#xD;
      injuries in adult patients with multitrauma. Therefore, the management of patients with a&#xD;
      normal clinical examination after blunt trauma is a subject of controversy. Since 1970s,&#xD;
      computer tomography (CT) has become the mainstay of evaluating hemodynamically stable trauma&#xD;
      patients. It's generally accepted that hemodynamically stable patient with abnormal abdominal&#xD;
      examination results require the use of CT as well as patients with depressed level of&#xD;
      consciousness. Controversy exists with the awake, clinically evaluable patients with no&#xD;
      obvious signs of abdominal and chest trauma. In the last years number of studies express CT&#xD;
      role in evaluation of asymptomatic trauma patient with mechanism of injury supporting&#xD;
      probability of internal organs injury. Those studies show that in a large number of patients&#xD;
      the management was changed according to CT results. The authors recommended liberal use of CT&#xD;
      in trauma patient population. All those studies have been performed in adult trauma patients.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of whole body imaging in pediatric patients&#xD;
      with suspicious mechanism of injury, which are hemodynamically stable and has no obvious&#xD;
      signs of chest and abdominal injury. The incidence of injury in these patient population as&#xD;
      well as changes in treatment based on results of CT will be examined. Methods The prospective&#xD;
      observational study will be performed in Assaf Harofeh Medical Center. All patients up to 15&#xD;
      years old with blunt mechanism of multisystem trauma will be eligible for enrollment to the&#xD;
      study. Only patients whose parents singed the inform consent will be enrolled.Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be based on the mechanism of injury: 1. no visible injury of chest and&#xD;
      abdomen2. hemodynamically stable3. normal abdominal examination in neurologically intact&#xD;
      patient or unevaluable abdominal examination in patients with depressed level of&#xD;
      consciousness. 4. significant mechanism of injury as any of the following a. high speed (more&#xD;
      than 55km/hr) motor vehicle accident b. fall of greater than 3 meters c. automobile hitting&#xD;
      pedestrian d. assaulted with depressed level of consciousness All patients will undergo CT of&#xD;
      the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis as a part of their evaluation. CT scan will be performed&#xD;
      in Emergency Department short after patient's admission and clinical evaluation. An abnormal&#xD;
      CT will be defined as exhibiting any traumatic abnormality. Patient treatment plan changes&#xD;
      will be defined as alteration in management based directly on CT findings.Data regarding&#xD;
      patient demographics, mechanism of injury, physical examination findings, Glasgow Coma Score&#xD;
      on emergency department admission, Injury Severity Score, radiologic interpretation of chest&#xD;
      and pelvic roentgenograms, injuries required operative procedures, laboratory data, CT scan&#xD;
      findings, and changes in management plan based on CT findings will be recorded.&#xD;
