      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients with cancer in the&#xD;
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that may occur in DNA and identify&#xD;
      biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict a patient's response to&#xD;
      treatment and help plan the best treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying gene expression in predicting treatment response in&#xD;
      patients receiving gemcitabine and S-1 for locally advanced unresectable or metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate intratumoral expression level of ribonucleotide reductase subunit 1 (RRM1)&#xD;
           with response to gemcitabine hydrochloride therapy in patients with locally advanced&#xD;
           unresectable or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate intratumoral expression levels of other genes (e.g., deoxycytidine kinase&#xD;
           [dCK], equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 [ENT1], and concentrative nucleoside&#xD;
           transporters 1 and 3 [CNT1 and CNT3]) with response in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine, preliminarily, the median survival of these patients, using a therapeutic&#xD;
           strategy entailing sequential addition of agents and decision making based on early CA&#xD;
           19-9 biomarker response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety of this approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the percentage of patients classified as potential biomarker responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the time to progression with each successive line of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the proportion of patients with ≥ 25% decline in CA 19-9 biomarker (i.e.,&#xD;
           biomarker response) with each successive line of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify other genes that may mediate sensitivity to gemcitabine hydrochloride, S-1, and&#xD;
           other agents with activity in pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the frequency of host genetic polymorphisms in various nucleoside&#xD;
           transporters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial treatment (gemcitabine hydrochloride alone): Patients receive gemcitabine&#xD;
           hydrochloride IV over 100 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. CA 19-9 levels are assessed in&#xD;
           weeks 1 and 3 of each course. Patients who are biomarker responders continue to receive&#xD;
           treatment with gemcitabine hydrochloride alone. Courses repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who are no longer&#xD;
           biomarker responders or show other evidence of disease progression proceed to therapy&#xD;
           comprised of gemcitabine hydrochloride and S1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gemcitabine hydrochloride and S-1 treatment: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride&#xD;
           IV over 100 minutes on days 1 and 15 and oral S-1 twice daily on days 1-7 and 15-21.&#xD;
           Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo core needle tumor biopsy and fine-needle aspiration at baseline. Tissue&#xD;
      samples are analyzed for correlation between transcript and protein expression by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry and for expression of genes and gene products that may mediate&#xD;
      sensitivity to gemcitabine hydrochloride (RRM1, ENT1, CNT1 and 3, dCK); S-1, thymidine&#xD;
      phosphorylase [TP], TS, DPD, and ORPT; and other anticancer treatments (ERCC-1, epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor, GSK-3β) by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Tissue&#xD;
      samples are also analyzed by microarray and comparative genomic hybridization to identify new&#xD;
      genes that may predict chemotherapeutic response or mediate sensitivity to anticancer&#xD;
      therapy. Mutational status of KRAS and p53 gene are also assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected at baseline and are analyzed by genotyping assays to identify&#xD;
      polymorphic variants of select genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
