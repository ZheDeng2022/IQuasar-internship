      his study will evaluate a series of problem-solving education sessions for patients&#xD;
      undergoing a stem cell transplant and their family caregivers. The emotional stress of&#xD;
      transplant extends beyond patients to their families, especially caregivers. Little is known&#xD;
      about managing the emotional distress associated with stem cell transplant or the support and&#xD;
      education most helpful to caregivers of stem cell recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing a stem cell transplant and their family caregivers may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. All participants must be 18 years of age and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and their caregivers receive routine treatment-specific education from transplant&#xD;
      team members. This study adds a series of educational sessions focusing on problem-solving&#xD;
      skills. In addition to the study education, participants do the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a 130-item questionnaire when they consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a 60-item questionnaire and attend a 60-minute face-to-face education session&#xD;
           before the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a 40-item questionnaire and attend a 60-minute face-to-face education session&#xD;
           before hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete the same 40-item questionnaire and attend a 60-minute face-to-face education&#xD;
           session 2 weeks after hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attend a 30-minute face-to-face education session 4 weeks after hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a 60-item questionnaire 6 weeks after hospital discharge.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) generates multiple symptoms and&#xD;
      problems that can vary in complexity. Although it seems evident that patients and caregivers&#xD;
      experience clinically significant levels of psychological distress, few intervention studies&#xD;
      have been explored to address this concern in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem-solving is an essential skill for patients and caregivers. Increased problem-solving&#xD;
      skill has been shown to decrease psychological distress and may improve symptom distress and&#xD;
      health related QOL. The COPE (Creativity, Optimism, Planning, Expert Information)&#xD;
      problem-solving education intervention has demonstrated benefit and has been reported as a&#xD;
      positive therapy by cancer patients and their families. Only one study has reported the&#xD;
      application of this intervention in the acute care setting and no study has been done with&#xD;
      patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the feasibility of conducting an individualized dyadic&#xD;
      problem-solving education (PSE) intervention in patients and family caregivers experiencing&#xD;
      allogeneic HSCT. In addition, this study will explore the effect of a PSE intervention on&#xD;
      problem-solving skills in patients and family caregivers experiencing allogeneic HSCT.&#xD;
      Moreover, this study will explore the relationship of baseline psychological distress and&#xD;
      family functioning to change in problem-solving skills following a PSE intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single group, mixed-methods, repeated measure design. Subjects will be accrued to&#xD;
      this protocol if they agree to participation in an allogeneic HSCT at the Clinical Center,&#xD;
      NIH, are greater than or equal to 18 years old, able to read English and able to comprehend&#xD;
      the investigational nature of the study. Patient volunteers must have an adult family member&#xD;
      to serve as their primary caregiver throughout the study period. A sample of 20 subjects (10&#xD;
      patient/family caregiver dyads) will be recruited to capture the essence of the experience&#xD;
      and adequately evaluate the feasibility of the intervention in this sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each dyad will be scheduled for four individualized PSE intervention sessions (study&#xD;
      intervention) in addition to the usual care group education. Study questionnaires will be&#xD;
      administered twice prior to allogeneic HSCT, at 2 time points during the intervention period,&#xD;
      and at the end of the study. As a feasibility study, there will be no long term follow-up&#xD;
      after the intervention period. Questionnaires include: Brief Symptom Inventory-18,&#xD;
      Problem-Solving Inventory-Revised, Symptom Distress Scale, and the Family&#xD;
      Adaptability-Cohesion Evaluation Scale-IV. In addition, the dyad will participate in a&#xD;
      semi-structured interview at the end of each intervention session and the interventionist&#xD;
      will complete a log that tracks subject attendance, session length, and discrepancy between&#xD;
      planned and actual session date and time. Quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques&#xD;
      will be used in this study.&#xD;
