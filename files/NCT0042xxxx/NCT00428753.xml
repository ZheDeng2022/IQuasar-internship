    <textblock>
      This study will determine risk factors of human infection with avian influenza A virus, also&#xD;
      known as bird flu virus. Certain risk factors such as exposure to poultry, travel history,&#xD;
      health status, and other factors may affect one's risk of getting bird flu. Study&#xD;
      participants will include individuals, older than age 1, that tested positive for influenza A&#xD;
      (H5N1) in a previous surveillance program and controls (individuals that have not tested&#xD;
      positive for avian influenza A (H5N1) and have no fever or respiratory symptoms). There will&#xD;
      be 1 study visit during which volunteers will be asked detailed questions about their health,&#xD;
      work, and travel habits. Study participants will be asked to donate a blood sample to test&#xD;
      for antibodies, the part of the blood that fights infection.&#xD;

      This study is a matched case-control study of risk factors for human infection with avian&#xD;
      influenza A (H5N1) virus in China. The primary study objective is to determine the risk&#xD;
      factors for avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in humans, in China, whether or not the&#xD;
      subject was symptomatic. The confirmed case-patients and confirmed antibody positive avian&#xD;
      influenza A (H5N1) persons (asymptomatic or sub-clinical) identified by the previously done&#xD;
      National Surveillance Program will be included in this study as cases. Controls will be&#xD;
      identified from population registries in villages with rural cases and in the adjacent&#xD;
      apartment buildings of the urban cases' residences. If the National Surveillance Program&#xD;
      identifies healthcare workers infected with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, healthcare&#xD;
      workers in the same department of the healthcare facilities in which the cases worked will&#xD;
      also be included as controls. A matched case-control study will be conducted with a ratio of&#xD;
      4 controls per 1 case. Cases and controls who meet the eligibility criteria will be consented&#xD;
      and enrolled in the study. After enrollment a questionnaire will be administered to obtain&#xD;
      information on demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, daily activities, shopping&#xD;
      habits, poultry raising in the backyard, poultry vaccination, exposure to sick/dead poultry&#xD;
      or healthy appearing poultry, visits to places where live poultry were kept (e.g., poultry&#xD;
      stalls, retail markets, wholesale markets or poultry farms) in the week before illness,&#xD;
      eating habits, food preparation activities related to poultry, children's activities such as&#xD;
      playing with poultry and swimming in water with water fowl, exposure to other animals&#xD;
      including wild birds, and exposure to other humans with respiratory illnesses or confirmed&#xD;
      H5N1 case-patients. Survived cases, individuals whose specimen H5N1 tested positive in&#xD;
      previous National Surveillance Program and controls will be asked to provide a blood sample&#xD;
      to determine whether they have antibodies to H5N1. New confirmed cases and controls will be&#xD;
      asked to donate a blood sample for H5N1 antibody testing. Any control that tests positive&#xD;
      will become a case and additional controls will be identified. All samples will be tested for&#xD;
      H5N1 antibodies with hemagglutination inhibition (using horse red blood cells) and&#xD;
      microneutralization assay. If all negative, the individual will be considered sero-negative;&#xD;
      if all positive, the individual will be considered sero-positive for the purposes of this&#xD;
      study; if results from hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) assays&#xD;
      are discordant, the MN result will be considered the final result (negative or positive).&#xD;
      Appropriate antigens for the assays will be selected based on the antigenic characteristics&#xD;
      of the virus circulating in the region at the time of sample collection. HI and MN assays&#xD;
      will be performed according to accepted SOPs. The study will be completed within one year.&#xD;
