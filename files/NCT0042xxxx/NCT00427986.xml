      The purpose of the present study is to examine, if retinal swelling in diabetic patients can&#xD;
      be reduced by an intravenous injection of galactose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Macular oedema (swelling of the retina) is a leading cause of severe visual loss and&#xD;
      blindness in patients with diabetes. The oedema is caused by fluid accumulation in the&#xD;
      retinal tissue from leaking capillaries and leads to an increase in the retinal thickness.&#xD;
      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has become the primary technique to estimate the retinal&#xD;
      thickness objectively, and the scans can be performed without any discomfort to the patient&#xD;
      after dilation of the pupils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Starling equation, a general basic physiologic rule, specific factors&#xD;
      influence the fluid transport between the capillaries and the surrounding tissue. One of&#xD;
      these factors is the balance between the large molecules within the vessel lumen and the&#xD;
      surrounding tissue, e.g. the osmotic pressure balance. By changing the osmotic balance some&#xD;
      drugs can reduce the fluid content in the tissue by extracting water from the tissue to the&#xD;
      vessel lumen. Such a drug is galactose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study we examine, if treatment with intravenous galactose can reduce the&#xD;
      retinal thickness in diabetic macular oedema evaluated by OCT during a three-hour monitoring.&#xD;
      Galactose (0.5 mg/mL) is administered as 1 mL galactose per kg body weight + 10% with a&#xD;
      maximum of 80 mL, and injection time is 5 min. If reduction of the thickness with galactose&#xD;
      is found, it then confirms the application of the Starling osmotic forces on diabetic macular&#xD;
      oedema. In the same time span series of venous blood samples are taken for analysis of plasma&#xD;
      osmolarity and electrolytes. The systemic blood pressure is also monitored as well as the&#xD;
      capillary glucose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As diurnal variations in the retinal thickness estimates potentially can influence the&#xD;
      results, the OCT measurements and blood samples are repeated on a second day for each&#xD;
      participant, without treatment with galactose for comparison. The order of two visits is&#xD;
      given by randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analysis will take place after inclusion of 15 to 20 patients to evaluate the need&#xD;
      for inclusion of 45 patients.&#xD;
