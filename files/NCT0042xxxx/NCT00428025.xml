  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) is an uncommon but potentially serious&#xD;
      complication of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a specialized&#xD;
      endoscopic examination of the ducts draining the liver and pancreas. Although many different&#xD;
      strategies have been tried and studied in attempts to reduce this risk, few have been shown&#xD;
      to make a significant difference. Those that have are either very expensive, difficult to&#xD;
      administer, or both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory medication most often used to treat arthritis, has shown&#xD;
      potential to decrease the risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis. It can be given after the procedure&#xD;
      to patients at most risk for the complication, and has few side effects. This study will&#xD;
      randomize people in the study to placebo or active medication, to determine if Diclofenac&#xD;
      reduces the incidence of pancreatitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diclofenac, when administered immediately post ERCP in patients at higher risk of developing&#xD;
      post-ERCP pancreatitis, will significantly reduce the incidence of this complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergoing ERCP not having exclusion criteria will be approached for&#xD;
      participation prior to the procedure. At the end of the procedure, prior to transfer from the&#xD;
      endoscopy suite, within 15 minutes of the end of the procedure, if the patient meets&#xD;
      inclusion criteria, a study suppository will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The suppositories will be prepared by a study pharmacist according to a randomization list&#xD;
      prepared by an independent biostatistician. They will be randomized using a permuted block&#xD;
      design, in blocks of 20. The placebo is inert, and identical to the study medication, a 100&#xD;
      mg diclofenac rectal suppository. The code will not be broken until enrolment of patients is&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, endoscopists, nurses, and the principal investigator will all be blinded to the&#xD;
      randomization code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-ERCP acute pancreatitis is the primary outcome. Consensus definition of this is new&#xD;
      typical (epigastric/retroperitoneal) pain combined with an elevation of serum lipase or&#xD;
      amylase &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal. Pain will be assessed through history and&#xD;
      physical exam by an attending gastroenterologist the morning after the procedure, with&#xD;
      documentation in the chart and research form of the presence or absence of pain. Serum&#xD;
      amylase will be measured the morning after the procedure, between 7 and 10 am (approximately&#xD;
      18 hours post procedure). Most patients will be inpatients but outpatients will be included&#xD;
      if they can be assessed through clinical exam and blood chemistry analysis the following&#xD;
      morning. Patients will be contacted one week after the procedure to ensure no episode of&#xD;
      abdominal pain or bleeding has been missed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and Power Calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two sided Fisher's Exact Test will be used to compare the proportion of patients developing&#xD;
      post-ERCP pancreatitis in each group (placebo vs. active drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the population selected, the estimated risk of pancreatitis is 15%. To demonstrate a&#xD;
      decrease to 5%, 141 patients will be required in each group, with 80% power and an alpha&#xD;
      error 0.05. Secondary outcomes will include severity of pancreatitis, hyperamylasemia, length&#xD;
      of stay, and mortality. Safety data regarding renal function and GI bleeding will also be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
