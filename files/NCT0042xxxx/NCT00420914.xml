      BACKGROUND:Platelet transfusions play a major role in the management of thrombocytopenic&#xD;
      patients. Platelet transfusions may be given either in the absence of hemorrhage&#xD;
      (prophylactic transfusions), or to control bleeding (therapeutic transfusions). Prophylactic&#xD;
      platelet transfusion therapy is most commonly used in patients with decreased marrow platelet&#xD;
      production (hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia) and accounts for the majority of platelets&#xD;
      transfused to these patients. As platelet use continues to increase at a rate&#xD;
      disproportionately higher than that of red cells, it is important to identify the most&#xD;
      cost-effective strategies for providing platelet support. The two most important factors -&#xD;
      within the control of the ordering physician - that will significantly influence the total&#xD;
      amount of platelets transfused are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the prophylactic platelet transfusion &quot;trigger&quot; selected for transfusion;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the number of platelets given per transfusion. The optimal quantity of platelets to be&#xD;
           used per transfusion remains a highly controversial subject. No prospective platelet&#xD;
           transfusion trials have been performed in which patients are randomized to an assigned&#xD;
           platelet dose throughout their period of thrombocytopenia to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
           different doses on transfusion outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRODUCTION: A randomized prospective platelet dose trial is proposed to determine a safe,&#xD;
      efficient, and cost-effective dosing strategy for transfusing platelets. The trial is&#xD;
      designed to answer two fundamental questions: 1) Are low dose platelet transfusions not&#xD;
      inferior to standard dose platelet transfusion for patients with chemotherapy induced&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia as measured by the frequency of WHO bleeding Grade 2 or greater; and 2) How&#xD;
      does the dose of platelets transfused affect the interval between platelet transfusion&#xD;
      events, and, thereby, the total number of platelets transfused?&#xD;
&#xD;
      GENERAL OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hemostatic efficacy of low dose platelet transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: This will be a non-inferiority study designed to determine if low dose&#xD;
      prophylactic platelet transfusions can be transfused to patients with chemotherapy induced&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia without an increase in the frequency of WHO bleeding (Grade 2 or greater )&#xD;
      when compared to the current transfusion strategy of using standard dose platelet products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The low dose platelet transfusions will be targeted at 2.25 x 10^11 platelets/transfusion&#xD;
      (range 1.5-2.9 x 10^11/product).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard dose platelet transfusions will be targeted at 4.5 x 10^11 platelets/transfusion&#xD;
      (range 3.0-6.0 x 10^11/ product)&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: This will be a multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial in which&#xD;
      eligible patients will be randomized to receive low dose or standard dose prophylactic&#xD;
      platelet transfusions. Patients will be transfused prophylactically using a transfusion&#xD;
      trigger of a platelet count equal to or below a level of 10 x 10^9/L (10,000/uL)or at a&#xD;
      higher trigger (dependant on transfusion guidelines set by individual institutions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evidence of bleeding will be assessed daily according to the WHO classification of&#xD;
      bleeding. Study personnel involved in the daily hemostatic assessments of patients will be&#xD;
      blinded as to the patient's randomization assignment. The grade of bleeding will be assigned&#xD;
      using an Adjudication Committee blinded to the treatment that each patient is receiving. Each&#xD;
      patient will be followed throughout their period of thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has been established and is comprised of two&#xD;
      hematologists not associated with the study, one critical care physician, and a&#xD;
      biostatistician. Three of these individuals have experience serving on Data Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Boards and all have expertise in clinical research methodology. The DSMB will receive and&#xD;
      review any adverse events and regular reports. The information on the report will be blinded&#xD;
      by designating treatment groups as A or B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATIFICATION: There will be two levels of stratification in this study. The first level of&#xD;
      stratification will be by center as there will be center differences in the chemotherapy and&#xD;
      bone marrow or stem cell transplant protocols used. The second level of stratification will&#xD;
      be by diagnostic grouping: bone marrow/stem cell transplant; and non transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT ALLOCATION: Eligible patients who have given written consent, will be randomized to&#xD;
      a treatment arm when they require their first prophylactic platelet transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION: Patients will be randomized to one of two prophylactic platelet transfusion&#xD;
      strategies either low dose or standard dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of each platelet transfusion, a platelet count will be performed on the product&#xD;
      and the weight of the platelet bag will be recorded so that the absolute number of platelets&#xD;
      given with each platelet transfusion can be calculated. Either apheresis platelets or whole&#xD;
      blood derived platelet concentrates will be used to achieve the required platelet dose based&#xD;
      on product availability or the preferences of the patient's physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERIOD OF FOLLOW-UP: Study patients will be followed throughout their period of&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia until bone marrow recovery has occurred (with a platelet count of ≥ 50&#xD;
      x10^9/L (50,000/uL) or the patient has been on the study for 30 days, withdraws consent, dies&#xD;
      or is discharged from hospital or to a setting that does not allow for daily assessment of&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS: WHO Grade 3 or 4 bleeding will be considered a serious adverse event&#xD;
      and will be monitored throughout the study. These serious adverse events will be reported to&#xD;
      the data coordinating center and to the relevant IRB within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS OF PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: There will be two analyses performed: the first will compare&#xD;
      the proportion of patients in each treatment group that have Grade 2 or greater bleeding: the&#xD;
      second will be a recurrent event analysis which uses a strategy that includes the proportion&#xD;
      of patients who bleed, the numbers of bleeds that occur and the timing of the bleed (i.e.&#xD;
      whether it occurs early or late during the period of thrombocytopenia).&#xD;
