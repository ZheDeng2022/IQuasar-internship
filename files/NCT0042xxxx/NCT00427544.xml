    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to asess the safety and tolerability of ascending single&#xD;
      oral doses of PRA-027 in healthy women of nonchildbearing potential. The secondary purpose is&#xD;
      to provide the initial pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of PRA-027 in&#xD;
      healthy women of nonchildbearing potential, and to evaluate the effect of a high-fat meal on&#xD;
      the PK and PD of PRA-027 administered to healthy women of nonchildbearing potential.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of nonchildbearing potential (WONCBP) aged 18 to 60 years. Must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test result within 48 hours before administration of test article. Women who&#xD;
             are surgically sterile must provide documentation of the procedure by an operative&#xD;
             report or ultrasound scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) in the range of 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2 and body weight ³50 kg. BMI&#xD;
             is calculated by taking the subject's weight, in kilograms, divided by the square of&#xD;
             the subject's height, in meters, at screening: BMI=weight (kg)/[height (m)]2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by the investigator on the basis of screening evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory, gynecologic,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, hematologic, neurologic, or&#xD;
             psychiatric disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of drug abuse within 1 year before study day 1, a history of alcoholism&#xD;
             within 1 year before study day 1 or consumption of more than 2 standard units of&#xD;
             alcohol per day (a standard unit equals 12 ounces of beer, 1½ ounces of 80-proof&#xD;
             alcohol, or 6 ounces of wine). Any positive findings during the urine drug screen for&#xD;
             amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone, and&#xD;
             opiates.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any investigational or prescription drug within 30 days before test article&#xD;
             administration. Consumption of any caffeine-containing products (eg, coffee, tea,&#xD;
             chocolate, or soda) or alcoholic beverages within 48 hours before study day 1.&#xD;
             Consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit-containing products within 72 hours before&#xD;
             study day 1. Use of any over-the-counter drugs, including herbal supplements (except&#xD;
             for the occasional use of acetaminophen and vitamins ≤100% of the recommended daily&#xD;
             allowance) within 14 days before study day 1.&#xD;
