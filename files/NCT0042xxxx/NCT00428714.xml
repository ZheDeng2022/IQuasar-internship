  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to see how quickly two different types of prostate cancer participants respond&#xD;
      when taking enzastaurin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 - asymptomatic participants with androgen-independent prostate-specific antigen&#xD;
      (PSA)-progressive disease without clinical or radiographic evidence of metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 - participants with androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer (documented bone&#xD;
      or soft tissue metastases) with rising PSA, clinical, radiographic disease progression&#xD;
      following one prior docetaxel-based regimen&#xD;

    <description>Objective responders were defined as participants (pts) in Cohort 1 who met prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response criteria. PSA Complete response (CR) was defined as a decrease in PSA to an undetectable level (&lt;0.2 ng/mL) confirmed by a second value obtained at least 4 weeks apart and without clinical or radiographic evidence of disease. PSA Partial Response (PR) was defined as a decrease in PSA of &gt;=50% at any time during the study. The decline of &gt;=50% in PSA must be from a baseline value of &gt;5 ng/mL and must be confirmed by a second value obtained at least 4 weeks apart and without clinical or radiographic evidence of disease.</description>

    <measure>Cohort 1 - Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>time of response to progressive disease, death, unacceptable toxicities, or study closure whichever occurred first (up to 56 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was the date of first objective assessment of CR or PR to the date of first progression or death due to any cause. Progression of disease defined as:1) PSA progression: (a) in whom a 50% decline in PSA has not been achieved, defined as 25% increase over baseline or nadir whichever is lower and an increase in the absolute value of PSA level by 5 ng/mL and confirmed by another PSA at least 4 weeks apart, (b) in whom a 50% decline in PSA has been achieved, defined as 50% increase over the nadir and an increase in the absolute value of PSA level by 5 ng/mL and confirmed by another PSA level at least 4 weeks apart. 2) Objective Progression defined as radiographic evidence of metastatic disease irrespective of PSA value or 3) death due to any cause.

        <description>Objective responders were defined as participants (pts) in Cohort 1 who met prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response criteria. PSA Complete response (CR) was defined as a decrease in PSA to an undetectable level (&lt;0.2 ng/mL) confirmed by a second value obtained at least 4 weeks apart and without clinical or radiographic evidence of disease. PSA Partial Response (PR) was defined as a decrease in PSA of &gt;=50% at any time during the study. The decline of &gt;=50% in PSA must be from a baseline value of &gt;5 ng/mL and must be confirmed by a second value obtained at least 4 weeks apart and without clinical or radiographic evidence of disease.</description>

        <title>Cohort 2 - Number of Participants With a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (Objective Response Rate)</title>
        <description>Objective responders in Cohort 2 met either CR or PR for composite criteria of PSA and RECIST. CR was defined as a decrease in PSA to an undetectable level (&lt;0.2 ng/mL) confirmed by a second value at least 4 weeks apart and without clinical or radiographic evidence of disease per RECIST and normalization of bone scan. Bone only disease CR is normalization of bone scan with achievement of a nondetectable PSA confirmed 4-weeks after initial undetectable PSA. PR was defined as a decrease from baseline by 50% in PSA at any time during the study and confirmed by a second value at least 4 weeks apart and having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions per RECIST and stable or improved bone scan.</description>
