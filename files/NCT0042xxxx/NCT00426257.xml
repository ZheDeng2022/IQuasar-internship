      Rationale: Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynaecologic cancer in the Netherlands&#xD;
      preceded by endometrial cancer. It is however the leading cause of death among women with&#xD;
      gynaecologic malignancies with an annual mortality rate of 9 per 100.000. The majority of the&#xD;
      patients are diagnosed with a high stage ovarian carcinoma due to the fact that symptoms&#xD;
      occur at a late stage of the disease and screening methods for ovarian cancer are suboptimal.&#xD;
      Optimal treatment consists of a combination of chemotherapy and debulking surgery. Despite&#xD;
      the appearance of localized disease and the absence of obvious residual tumour following&#xD;
      primary treatment, the majority of patients (80%) will have persistent disease or will&#xD;
      develop recurrent disease. Additional strategies are warranted to reduce the recurrence rate&#xD;
      and increase disease free survival and overall survival in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of administering intraperitoneal chemotherapy is based on the ideas on peritoneal&#xD;
      dialysis. Intraperitoneal drug therapy is designed to maximize drug delivery to the tumour&#xD;
      with generally acceptable systemic side effects associated with IV administration of the&#xD;
      drug. This strategy is especially attractive for treatment of ovarian carcinoma, which&#xD;
      remains largely restricted to the abdominal cavity for most of its natural history. So far 3&#xD;
      randomised controlled trials have shown an overall and progression-free survival benefit when&#xD;
      cisplatin is administered postoperatively by the IP route in patients with stage III,&#xD;
      optimally resected disease. These studies however found that the majority of patients did not&#xD;
      complete all planned 6 cycles due to catheter related problems. An alternative way of&#xD;
      administering chemotherapy intra abdominally whilst bypassing the use of a catheter intra-&#xD;
      abdominally is provided by perfusion of the abdomen during surgery under hyperthermic&#xD;
      conditions. This study compares the interval debulking plus or minus the perfusion of the&#xD;
      abdomen with chemotherapy under hyperthermic conditions during surgery (OVHIPEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objectives of this study are comparing the duration of recurrence free&#xD;
      survival following completion of treatment between the 2 study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of this study involve toxicity and morbidity, quality of life, tumour&#xD;
      response following treatment and overall survival of the study arm compared to the standard&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Phase III randomised trial Study population: Patients diagnosed with stage III&#xD;
      ovarian carcinoma, peritoneal cell carcinoma or tuba carcinoma who are eligible for interval&#xD;
      debulking surgery either following primary chemotherapy or following incomplete primary&#xD;
      debulking and chemotherapy. Age between 18 - 76 yr old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: One group undergoes interval debulking with hyperthermic perfusion of the&#xD;
      abdominal cavity with cisplatin 100 mg/m2 at the end of surgery. The other group is treated&#xD;
      by interval debulking only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Recurrence free survival Nature and extent of the burden and&#xD;
      risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Participants of the study&#xD;
      will be asked to fill in quality of life questionnaires (12 times in 2 year). Blood samples&#xD;
      will be taken following written informed consent before treatment, during surgery and during&#xD;
      follow-up visits for marker studies and proteomics studies (10 times during 2 year). For&#xD;
      patients participating in the pharmacokinetic studies (20) 2 tissue samples will be taken&#xD;
      from the abdominal cavity during surgery and blood samples will be taken 6 times during and&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During follow-up 3 monthly visits will be scheduled in the first 2 years and 6-monthly visits&#xD;
      during year 3-5. During these follow-up visits routine physical exam including pelvic exam&#xD;
      and vaginal ultrasound (optional) is performed. CT-scans will be performed in the first 2&#xD;
      years before randomisation and 4 times at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks of participating in this trial are related to the abdominal perfusion of cisplatin.&#xD;
      This can cause systemic effects such as: nephrotoxicity, bone marrow toxicity, neurotoxicity,&#xD;
      and longer hospital stay. It can also increase the chance on bowel perforation of a bowel&#xD;
      anastomoses resulting in a longer hospital stay and possibly surgical intervention. To&#xD;
      prevent systemic side effects of intra-abdominally administered cisplatin, sodium&#xD;
      thiosulphate is administered intravenously during surgery.&#xD;
