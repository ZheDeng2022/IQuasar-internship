  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the possible prognostic relationship between exhaled breath condensate pH and clinical&#xD;
      symptoms, it is quite plausible that exhaled breath condensate pH can prove useful in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit. For example, if exhaled breath condensate pH falls prior to the onset of&#xD;
      clinical symptoms, it is likely that it can be useful as an early marker, heralding the onset&#xD;
      of various inflammatory lung diseases. Specifically, exhaled breath condensate pH could be&#xD;
      used as a safe, non-invasive screening tool for Ventilator Associated Pneumonia. Similarly,&#xD;
      just as changes in exhaled breath condensate pH might predict the onset of disease, exhaled&#xD;
      breath condensate pH changes might also mark the progression or resolution of disease (e.g.&#xD;
      alerting clinicians to possible readiness for extubation). Although such notions are&#xD;
      hypothetical, they are beginning to be supported by anecdotal evidence.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a method of collecting exhaled breath condensate pH&#xD;
      continually from ventilated patients, which (1) takes samples from an exhaust port on the&#xD;
      outside of the ventilator circuit, and (2) possesses no measurable resistance to the&#xD;
      ventilator circuit (and, therefore the sampling procedure in no way affects the patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Now, additionally, we have performed the continuous collection process on 10 patients in the&#xD;
      intensive care units, none of whom have had any ill effects from the collection process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placement of the exhaled breath condensate collection device on the ventilator exhaust&#xD;
      port offers a simplified, accurate, and safe method of investigating the relationships&#xD;
      between airway pH and various pulmonary inflammatory disease processes in intubated patients&#xD;
      of all ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to further extend our study of airway pH in intubated subjects, we believe it is&#xD;
      necessary to obtain more frequent exhaled breath condensate pH measurements from intubated&#xD;
      subjects. To that end, we have developed a collection system that will also measure the pH of&#xD;
      the collected exhaled breath condensate in a fashion similar to the methodology used for&#xD;
      thousands of assays in our laboratory and other laboratories globally. This involves&#xD;
      deaeration of the sample to remove carbon dioxide. In the lab environment, this is performed&#xD;
      with Argon. In the ICU setting, we will accomplish the same effect by using wall oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The continuous exhaled breath condensate pH collection and assay system consists of a&#xD;
      condenser attached to the exhaust port of the ventilator. The condenser is kept chilled to&#xD;
      slightly above freezing temperature by a refrigeration system commonly employed in ICU&#xD;
      settings. The collection device stays attached to the exhalation port of the ventilator&#xD;
      continuously, for hours to days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected exhaled breath condensate is channeled into two deaeration chambers, through which&#xD;
      wall oxygen is bubbled (total flow of 1 liter/min). In the second deaeration chamber, a micro&#xD;
      pH electrode is inserted. This pH electrode is attached to a pH recorder that has internal&#xD;
      memory that can record essentially an infinite number of measurements, allowing for any&#xD;
      length duration of monitoring. This recorder has been evaluated by clinical engineering for&#xD;
      radio frequency and other interference and is cleared for hospital use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After measurement of pH, exhaled breath condensate is channeled into a waste chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The breath condensate collection system is maintained chilled by a &quot;hospital grade&quot;&#xD;
      Electri-Cool II model 767 refrigerated cooling system (or near-equivalent) that is clinically&#xD;
      approved for use in the intensive care units. This device is approximately 30 cm on a side,&#xD;
      and is kept on a wheeled cart out of the way of any clinical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis to be Tested: Clearly state the objectives and hypotheses and clearly define the&#xD;
      primary and any secondary outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Exhaled breath condensate pH will have greater within-hour variability in subjects with&#xD;
           lung disease than in subjects intubated for non-pulmonary reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exhaled breath condensate pH will rise prior to readiness for extubation in infants and&#xD;
           toddlers requiring mechanical ventilation for acute bronchiolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A decline in exhaled breath condensate pH or an increase in exhaled breath condensate pH&#xD;
           variability will predict the onset of pulmonary inflammatory processes (such as&#xD;
           ventilator-associated pneumonia) in those who initially require mechanical ventilation&#xD;
           for non-inflammatory reasons.&#xD;
