  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall plan of this project is to evaluate [123I] mZINT as a tool to assess SERT density&#xD;
      in humans. This protocol will be completed in three parts. In Part A serial dynamic SPECT&#xD;
      will be acquired after injection of [123I] mZINT in healthy controls to assess regional brain&#xD;
      uptake in human subjects. If Part A demonstrates robust brain region specific uptake, then&#xD;
      Part B - additional studies in healthy subjects to assess biodistribution, and Part C -&#xD;
      studies in PD subjects to compare regional uptake to healthy controls, will be completed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All study procedures will be conducted at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders (IND)&#xD;
      and Molecular NeuroImaging (MNI) in New Haven, CT. Approximately 10 (6 -Part A and 4 - Part&#xD;
      B) healthy subjects and 10 PD subjects will be recruited from the IND databases, patient&#xD;
      spouses, and the community to participate in this protocol. The study doctor will discuss the&#xD;
      study procedures and evaluate the subject for eligibility. All subjects will undergo written&#xD;
      informed consent and a screening evaluation including baseline clinical laboratory testing,&#xD;
      and a baseline physical and neurological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following bolus intravenous injection of 5 mCi of 123-I mZINT over 15 seconds, serial dynamic&#xD;
      SPECT brain acquisitions will be obtained to evaluate the regional brain uptake and washout&#xD;
      of activity. Venous blood measures will be obtained with each acquisition and&#xD;
      characterization of 123-I mZINT and metabolites will be assessed. Safety assessments will&#xD;
      include vital signs, serum chemistries, CBC, urinalysis, and EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs will be assessed at pre-injection baseline and 15, 30, 60, and 90 minutes&#xD;
      following the infusion of 123-I mZINT. An EKG will be obtained at baseline and at 20 and 40&#xD;
      min post 123-I mZINT injection. Adverse events will be assessed when vital signs are&#xD;
      obtained. Clinical laboratory tests performed at baseline and after each injection including&#xD;
      the following: serum chemistry battery, complete blood count with differential, and&#xD;
      urinalysis.&#xD;
