      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether JX-594 (Pexa-Vec) is safe and&#xD;
      effective for treating surgically unresectable malignant melanoma.&#xD;

      Cancer of the skin is the most common of all cancers, probably accounting for more than 50%&#xD;
      of all cancers. Melanoma accounts for about 4% of skin cancer cases but causes a large&#xD;
      majority of skin cancer deaths. The American Cancer Society estimates that about 62,190 new&#xD;
      melanomas will be diagnosed in the United States during 2006.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DTIC is the only chemotherapy drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma. The reported response rates are 5-20% without any evidence of prolonged survival in&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials versus best supportive care. The median overall survival for&#xD;
      melanoma patients treated with DTIC alone is approximately 8 months; PFS and TTP following&#xD;
      treatment with DTIC is approximately 7 weeks, and the objective response rate for DTIC alone&#xD;
      (CR+PR) is less than 10% (Millward, 2004). Other chemotherapy agents including cisplatin and&#xD;
      carboplatin, BCNU, vindesine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, and vinorelbine have also been tested&#xD;
      but none have improved upon the very modest activity of DTIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melanoma may be the optimal target for JX-594 immunotherapy because of the relatively high&#xD;
      rate of accessible disease for injection, the positive response of melanoma seen with IL-2&#xD;
      immunotherapy, and the lack of effective, tolerable therapy for patient with metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma. Furthermore, it is speculated that JX-594 replication targets the EGFR pathway,&#xD;
      which is highly expressed in melanocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from an initial Phase I/II study suggest that intratumoral injection of JX-594 is&#xD;
      safe and effective in treating both injected and distant disease in patients with surgically&#xD;
      incurable metastatic melanoma. Response of both injected tumors (in 5 of 7 patients) and&#xD;
      response of at least one non-injected tumor (in 4 of 7 patients) was demonstrated, including&#xD;
      two patients who achieved a partial response (6 + months) and a complete response (4 +&#xD;
      months) to JX-594 treatment. Particularly noteworthy is that efficacy and gene expression&#xD;
      occurred despite pre-treatment vaccination (and, therefore, pre-existing anti-vaccinia&#xD;
      immunity) in all patients.&#xD;
