  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in organ transplant&#xD;
      recipients. Management of tuberculosis in this setting is challenging due to the complexity&#xD;
      of diagnosis and the potential toxicity of anti-TB therapy, especially in liver transplant&#xD;
      candidates and recipients. Although the tuberculin skin test (TST) is recommended for&#xD;
      screening of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in all candidates for liver&#xD;
      transplantation, the performance of the TST in this setting is less than optimal, due to a&#xD;
      lack of specificity (false-positive results due to interaction with BCG vaccine and other&#xD;
      mycobacterial infections), and a lack of sensitivity in a population that is relatively&#xD;
      immunocompromised. Recently, a new test named QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) has been approved&#xD;
      for the diagnosis of LTBI. QFT-G detects the release of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) by&#xD;
      sensitized white cells after incubation of whole blood with TB antigens. QFT-G is expected to&#xD;
      be more specific than TST. However, there are no studies defining the performance of QFT-G in&#xD;
      a population of patients on a waiting list for liver transplantation. We plan to estimate the&#xD;
      usefulness of the QFT-G test for the diagnosis of LTBI in a cohort of patients with end-stage&#xD;
      liver disease. We hypothesize that the QFT-G test will correlate better with the risk of&#xD;
      LTBI. This study advances research on the prevention of a serious bacterial infection that&#xD;
      can have devastating consequences in the post-transplant setting. The new diagnostic strategy&#xD;
      may more accurately determine the presence of LTBI, thereby allowing appropriate therapy.&#xD;

      -  Review and record the results of the test/procedures (x-rays, CT-scans, etc.) that are&#xD;
           part of the subject's clinical care and the results will become part of the research&#xD;
           record. In addition, laboratory results (liver function tests, chemistry, CBC with diff,&#xD;
           PT and INR or PTT) will be collected from the medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record the list of medications the subject is taking. Collect information on&#xD;
           demographics (address, phone number, etc.) including gender, race and ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review and record past medical and social history&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening procedures will take a total of about 15-30 minutes and all subjects will be&#xD;
      seen in the Liver Transplant Clinic. The investigator and research coordinators will be&#xD;
      reviewing the subject's medical record to collect the required information about the&#xD;
      subject's medical history. We will ask the subject, if it cannot be found in the medical&#xD;
      record, about past TB exposure and treatment, overseas travel, and current resident status&#xD;
      (long term care facility, home, hospital, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject qualifies for the research study the subject will undergo the experimental&#xD;
      procedures listed below. These procedures will take place during the visit in the Liver&#xD;
      Transplant Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the liver transplant evaluation subjects will have blood withdrawn for different&#xD;
      types of testing. When the blood is obtained we will collect about 3cc of blood for the new&#xD;
      TB testing. This collection of the blood sample will occur while the subject is getting their&#xD;
      required pre transplant blood work so that they will not need to get stuck twice with a&#xD;
      needle. The results of this research testing will not be available to the subject or&#xD;
      physicians but will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QuantiFERON®-TB Gold IT system uses specialized blood collection tubes, which are used to&#xD;
      collect whole blood. Incubation of the blood occurs in the tubes for 16 to 24 hours, after&#xD;
      which, plasma is harvested and tested for the presence of IFN-g produced in response to the&#xD;
      peptide antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QFT-G (IT) assay will be performed according to the manufacturer's instructions&#xD;
      (Cellestis Ltd.). One mL of whole blood is placed in three separate test tubes, one&#xD;
      containing no antigen (nil control), one with TB antigens (ESAT-6, CFP-10 and TB7.7) and one&#xD;
      with phytohemaglutinin (mitogen or positive control). The three tubes will be incubated as&#xD;
      soon as possible after collection (within 16hrs) and will incubate for 16 to 24 hours at&#xD;
      37°C. Following this incubation period, the tubes will be centrifuged. The plasma will be&#xD;
      removed from the tube and placed in a plasma storage container. These containers will then be&#xD;
      frozen for future IFN-γ measurement by ELISA. Each institution will perform testing up to&#xD;
      this point in the process. Each month, plasma samples will be posted on ice to Edmonton&#xD;
      Hospital in Alberta, Canada. The samples will be batched and then undergo the ELISA testing&#xD;
      process according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A result of ≥0.35 IU/mL in the TB antigen tube will be considered a positive result. If the&#xD;
      level is less than this and the mitogen control is positive (≥ 0.5 IU/mL), a negative result&#xD;
      will be recorded. If the level in both the TB antigen and mitogen tube is less than the&#xD;
      threshold for positive, then an indeterminate (anergic) result will be recorded. The nil&#xD;
      antigen tube adjusts for background IFN-γ levels and is subtracted from the IFN-γ level for&#xD;
      the TB antigen and mitogen tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once we have collected the blood sample the subject will have completed the study.&#xD;
