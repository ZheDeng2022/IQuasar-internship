  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is a common problem in advanced cancer and palliative care. The development of tools&#xD;
      to measure fatigue, however, has been slowed by their inability to distinguish between&#xD;
      fatigue and other related symptoms, such as tiredness. Our work suggests that these&#xD;
      distinctions are important because they serve as markers for stressors associated with&#xD;
      advancing disease. We have developed a tool that we believe will distinguish between these&#xD;
      two states as well as exhaustion. In this study we will conduct some initial tests of this&#xD;
      tool in preparation for its use as an outcome indicator in future studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on a series of qualitative studies, our group is developing a new rapid fatigue&#xD;
      assessment screening tool (rFAST) for use with individuals who have advanced cancer and are&#xD;
      receiving care in either an active treatment or palliative setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The three tools (tiredness, fatigue, and exhaustion) in the rFAST are each defined by&#xD;
           the same six dimensions: decline in stamina, decline in cognition, decline in sleep&#xD;
           quality, diminished social network, and increased emotional reactivity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The five subscales of the tiredness, fatigue, and exhaustion scales are internally&#xD;
           consistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Tiredness, fatigue, and exhaustion are distinct states that are manifested by unique&#xD;
           patterns of scores on their 6 subscales&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The mean POMS-Vsf scores of individuals who meet the definition of fatigue will be lower&#xD;
           than the mean POMS-Vsf scores of individuals who meet the definition of tiredness and&#xD;
           higher than the mean POMS-Vsf scores of individuals who meet the definition of&#xD;
           exhaustion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the factor structure of the tiredness, fatigue, and exhaustion scales of the&#xD;
           rFAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the internal consistency of the 5 subscales within the tired, fatigue, and&#xD;
           exhaustion scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare actual rFAST scale scores to hypothesized scale profiles for tiredness,&#xD;
           fatigue, and exhaustion.&#xD;
