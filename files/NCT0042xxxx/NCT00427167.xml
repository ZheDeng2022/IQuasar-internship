    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and immune response of healthy volunteers to an&#xD;
      experimental malaria vaccine called AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® (Registered Trademark) + CPG 7909.&#xD;
      Malaria is an infection of red blood cells caused by a parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, that&#xD;
      is spread by certain kinds of mosquitoes. Each year, about 1 million people are killed by&#xD;
      malaria worldwide, most of them young children in Africa. AMA1 C1 may help block the malaria&#xD;
      parasite from getting into red blood cells. The vaccine is mixed with Alhydrogel® (Registered&#xD;
      Trademark), a material that is commonly added to vaccines to make them work better (also&#xD;
      called an adjuvant). Besides evaluating the vaccine, this study will also test two solutions&#xD;
      of an experimental adjuvant, CPG 7909-P and CPG 7909-S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people between 18 and 50 years of age may be eligible for this 7-month study.&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (A, B, C or D below). All&#xD;
      receive two vaccinations, given as a shot in the upper arm either 1 or 2 months apart, as&#xD;
      shown:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: AMA1 CI/Alhydrogel® (Registered Trademark)/CPG 7909-P at Day 0 and Day 28&#xD;
           (1-month interval)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: AMA1 CI/Alhydrogel® (Registered Trademark)/CPG 7909-S at Day 0 and Day 28&#xD;
           (1-month interval)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C: AMA1 CI/Alhydrogel® (Registered Trademark)/CPG 7909-P at Day 0 and Day 56&#xD;
           (2-month interval)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group D: AMA1 CI/Alhydrogel® (Registered Trademark)/CPG 7909-S at Day 0 and Day 56&#xD;
           (2-month interval)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A and B participants return to the clinic for checkups at 3, 7, and 14 days after each&#xD;
      vaccination and again at months 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. Group C and D participants come to the&#xD;
      clinic at 3, 7, and 14 days after each vaccination and again at months 3, 4, 5, and 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the vaccinations, the study includes the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photographs of the subject's arm where the vaccination is given if a rash develops.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily temperature and symptoms record for the first 6 days after each of the 2&#xD;
           vaccinations, and at any other time there is concern about fever or other symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draws about 12 times during the study to check for safety and to measure the&#xD;
           antibody response and the effect of the study vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants may be asked to undergo plasmapheresis, a procedure for collecting plasma,&#xD;
      the liquid part of the blood. This is done by using a machine called a blood cell separator.&#xD;
      Blood is collected through a needle place...&#xD;

      AMA1-C1 + CPG 7909 is a blood stage malaria vaccine candidate. The objectives of this Phase 1&#xD;
      study are to confirm the previously demonstrated safety and immunogenicity of AMA1-C1 + CPG&#xD;
      7909 formulated in a phosphate buffer. In addition, this study will evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of AMA1-C1 + CPG 7909 formulated in a saline buffer, and determine if the&#xD;
      addition of CPG 7909 in a saline buffer enhances the immune response to AMA1-C1 in a manner&#xD;
      similar to that seen with the addition of CPG 7909 in a phosphate buffer. The immunological&#xD;
      effect of giving a second dose of vaccine at 1 or 2 months will also be evaluated. The study&#xD;
      is a double blind Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy adult volunteers. Volunteers will be&#xD;
      screened and 24 participants will be enrolled and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups in a 2x2&#xD;
      design: 6 volunteers will receive 2 doses of 80 micrograms AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel + 500&#xD;
      micrograms CPG 7909 (phosphate) at a 1-month dosing interval; 6 volunteers will receive 2&#xD;
      doses of 80 micrograms AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel + 500 micrograms CPG 7909 (saline) at a 1 month&#xD;
      dosing interval; 6 volunteers will receive 2 doses of 80 micrograms AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel + 500&#xD;
      micrograms CPG 7909 (phosphate) at a 2-month dosing interval; and 6 volunteers will receive 2&#xD;
      doses of 80 micrograms AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel + 500 micrograms CPG 7909 (saline) at a 2 month&#xD;
      dosing interval. Safety outcome measures are local and systemic (including laboratory)&#xD;
      adverse events. Immune responses to vaccination will be measured by enzyme-linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and parasite growth inhibition assay (GIA), and will be compared&#xD;
      among groups.&#xD;
