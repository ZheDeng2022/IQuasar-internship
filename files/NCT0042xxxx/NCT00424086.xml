      The objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a&#xD;
      Split Virus, Vero Cell derived, Seasonal Influenza Vaccine (VCIV) in comparison to a Licensed&#xD;
      Egg Derived, Split Virus, Seasonal Influenza Vaccine (EIV) in healthy subjects 18 years of&#xD;
      age and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 1000 subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single&#xD;
      injection of VCIV or EIV. Subjects will be monitored for 180 days following vaccination for&#xD;
      occurrence of adverse reactions and for antibody response to the vaccine.&#xD;
