    <textblock>
      In the current study we will study the effect of adding shiatsu treatment to conventional&#xD;
      therapy in work with hospitalized schizophrenic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses of this study are several:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Shiatsu can improve the patients' symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Shiatsu can ameliorate neuromuscular side effects produced by standard anti-psychotic&#xD;
           treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Shiatsu can provide patients with tools to deal with the stresses of their illness&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Methodology We propose an open pilot study in which a total of 20 patients of both sexes&#xD;
      will be enrolled. These patients will be drawn from the inpatient psychiatric wards at Herzog&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon inclusion into the trial, all participants will receive shiatsu treatment, consisting of&#xD;
      two individual weekly 40-minute shiatsu treatment sessions for four weeks. Provider and&#xD;
      patient will be of the same gender. Standard pharmacotherapy will be provided as needed&#xD;
      during the treatment period. Medication and dosage will not be changed. If necessary,&#xD;
      benzodiazepines will be administered as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments will be included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medication: Use of SOS benzodiazepines&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical rating scales: PANSS, CGI, NOSIE, Hamilton Scales for depression and anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Side effect scales: Simpson Angus Scale, AIMS scale, UKU scale 2. Neurophysiological&#xD;
      testing: Prepulse inhibition (PPI). 3. Neurocognitive testing: This will be performed using&#xD;
      the NIMH's Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS)&#xD;
      Consensus Cognitive Battery for Clinical Trials.&#xD;

      SHIATSU ADJUVANT THERAPY FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA Protocol for an Open Pilot Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Background Schizophrenia is a severe, chronic mental illness that affects approximately 1%&#xD;
      of the population worldwide. While the pharmacological treatments available have advanced&#xD;
      considerably in the last fifty years, there are limits to what they offer some patients,&#xD;
      especially in terms of improving dysphoria, sleep, mood, avolition, social functioning, and&#xD;
      anhedonia, which contribute greatly to the everyday misery of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, some of the antipsychotic drugs induce side effects of parkinsonism, akathisias,&#xD;
      orofacial dyskinesias, dystonias, and their associated muscle pain, and stiffness. The&#xD;
      treatments used for those side effects are anticholinergic drugs (e.g. trihexyphenidyl),&#xD;
      benzodiazepines, and beta blockers. The number and variety of such drugs suggests what&#xD;
      clinicians know to be unfortunately true: there are no magic bullets for these symptoms.&#xD;
      These drugs are also not innocent, causing side effects of their own, contributing to&#xD;
      polypharmacy, and carrying a financial cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schizophrenia, then, remains a debilitating illness whose treatment results are often partial&#xD;
      and may produce unpleasant side-effects. New approaches to supplement standard modalities&#xD;
      ought to be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shiatsu, or acupressure, is a holistic form of medicine originating in Japan but now widely&#xD;
      practiced throughout the world. Shiatsu involves applying pressure to &quot;meridians&quot; of the&#xD;
      body, much like acupuncture but without the needles. The shiatsu therapist views the whole&#xD;
      body as interconnected - stiffness in one part may reflect a problem in another, or emotional&#xD;
      disharmony. In accordance with the WHO definition of health as &quot;a state of complete physical,&#xD;
      mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity,&quot; shiatsu&#xD;
      massage aims to improve the overall well-being of its recipients by manipulating the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shiatsu theory is based on traditional Chinese medicine, which posits meridians of life force&#xD;
      (chi) running through the body, and aims to optimize health through manipulating the body&#xD;
      into maximal alignment. Disease, according to this approach, is as an accumulation of damage&#xD;
      and stress that causes the body to tense up in various areas, leading to health disturbances.&#xD;
      The treatment aims to loosen tense muscles and tendons and restore balance to the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shiatsu also involves a diagnostic process that is designed to locate sources of problems.&#xD;
      The main four areas of this process are the patient's appearance, his/her voice, the specific&#xD;
      complaints and medical history of the patient, and touch diagnosis. The touch is meant to&#xD;
      reveal areas of excess or lack of energy in the body or internal organs and autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system. Treatment is individualized according to the findings of this examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals of treatment, in addition to releasing muscle and tendon tension and protecting these&#xD;
      structures, are to help the patient acquire an awareness of his or her body and psyche in&#xD;
      order to avoid recurrence of the problems, to identify life stressors (mental and physical),&#xD;
      and to strengthen the patient's overall energy flow and resilience to disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two fields of shiatsu are do-in and anma. Do-in are the exercises that involve stretching&#xD;
      parts of the body combined with breathing exercises in order to loosen tense joints and&#xD;
      improve general circulation. Anma shiatsu is the more familiar massage-type treatment.&#xD;
      However, it is not performed for comfort or pleasure, as in Western massage, but rather as a&#xD;
      type of medical treatment. It is performed with a fully dressed patient, with direct pressure&#xD;
      applied with the practitioner's fingers. Both diagnosis and treatment are performed this way,&#xD;
      with the findings of the exam directing further actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How might the effects of shiatsu be explained in terms of Western medicine? In order to&#xD;
      answer this, we will consider research done not only for shiatsu but for acupuncture as well,&#xD;
      which has been more extensively examined. This is justified for two reasons: first of all,&#xD;
      shiatsu and acupuncture share the same understanding of human functioning and disease,&#xD;
      including the core concepts of chi and meridians, and accordingly they recognize the same&#xD;
      points along the body for applying pressure (shiatsu) or needles (acupuncture). Secondly, in&#xD;
      studies which have been conducted to test the effectiveness of alternative remedies,&#xD;
      acupressure and acupuncture have often been combined (e.g. Vachiramon &amp; Wang, 2005; Melchart&#xD;
      et al, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Biological basis for shiatsu Medical research has attempted to understand how Chinese&#xD;
      medicine works its effects. Several theories have been developed which may be of relevance to&#xD;
      schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Endorphins: The most established effect of acupuncture is the release of endorphins,&#xD;
           which are endogenous opioid neuropeptides (Hökfelt, 1991; Sjölund et al, 1977).&#xD;
           Endorphin release appears to be closely related to the analgesic effects of acupuncture.&#xD;
           Endorphins also promote a general feel of well being and reduction of tension which can&#xD;
           have salutary effects in treating mental illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cytokines: Cytokines mediate the inflammatory response. They also promote endorphin&#xD;
           release by the pituitary (Van der Meer et al, 1996). Drzyzga et al (2006) have reviewed&#xD;
           the possible connection between cytokines on the one hand, and neuropathological&#xD;
           changes, schizophrenia, and anti-psychotic medication mechanisms of action on the other.&#xD;
           A growing body of evidence suggests that cytokinins mediate neuropathological changes in&#xD;
           schizophrenia and the antipsychotic effects of medication. Acupuncture has been shown to&#xD;
           affect the cytokine system in animal (Liu et al, 2004) and human (Petti et al, 2002)&#xD;
           studies. The cytokine system is theoretically a pathway through which acupuncture could&#xD;
           produce therapeutic effects upon schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Glutamatergic mechanisms gained prominence as an important factor in the pathogenesis&#xD;
           and treatment of schizophrenia. In experiments with animals, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid&#xD;
           (NMDA) receptor antagonists have synergistically enhanced the anti-nociceptive effects&#xD;
           of electro-acupuncture (Zhang et al, 2002). Assessing the relationship between&#xD;
           glutamatergic activity and acupuncture effects could provide important information about&#xD;
           therapeutic mechanisms of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Neuropeptide Y (NPY): NPY's role in the CNS is not well understood. However,&#xD;
           appreciation for the possible role of NPY in the pathogenesis of severe mental disorder&#xD;
           has increased in recent years. NPY mRNA levels were significantly reduced in the frontal&#xD;
           cortex of patients with both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Kuromitsu et al, 2001).&#xD;
           NPY has also been shown to play a role in mediating the effects of antipsychotic&#xD;
           medication, in both animal (Huang et al, 2006) and human studies (Obuchowicz et al,&#xD;
           2004). Interestingly, the effects of NPY may be mediated by glutamatergic mechanisms&#xD;
           (Rosse &amp; Deutsch, 2004). This is relevant to our study because NPY levels in saliva have&#xD;
           been found to increase following acupuncture treatment (Dawidson et al, 1998). This,&#xD;
           then, is another possible mechanism through which acupuncture can be clinically relevant&#xD;
           to the treatment of schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have already been carried out to assess the effectiveness of Chinese medicine in the&#xD;
      treatment of schizophrenia. In a recent review of five studies in the Cochrane Database&#xD;
      (Rathbone &amp; Xia, 2005), acupuncture as adjuvant therapy provided with anti-psychotic&#xD;
      medication showed some evidence of improved outcomes on clinical rating scales and side&#xD;
      effect profiles, though overall the evidence was deemed insufficient to reach a definite&#xD;
      conclusion, and &quot;more comprehensive and better designed studies&quot; were recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second review (Moffet, 2006) of clinical trials of acupuncture for various medical&#xD;
      disorders made the important observation that too often, no meaningful physiological&#xD;
      rationale is provided for the proposed effectiveness of the treatment. Proposing a rationale&#xD;
      enables the investigator to suggest a testable causal hypothesis which can contribute to our&#xD;
      knowledge of the technique's mechanism of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study we will focus on assessments of the glutamatergic system by&#xD;
      neurophysiological (prepulse inhibition) testing using prepulse inhibition (PPI). In this&#xD;
      paradigm, the subject is presented with an auditory stimulus, or &quot;pre-pulse&quot;, which would not&#xD;
      ordinarily cause the subject to blink. Following this initial prepulse by a tenth of a second&#xD;
      comes a second, louder stimulus, the pulse, which would cause blinking were it not preceded&#xD;
      by the prepulse. Pre-pulse inhibition, a measure of sensory gating or filtering, is&#xD;
      determined by the reduction in blink response to a pulse following a pre-pulse as compared to&#xD;
      the blink response without the preparatory pre-pulse. Prepulse inhibition of the startle&#xD;
      response, which has been reliably demonstrated in both humans and animals (rev. in Braff et&#xD;
      al., 2001; Swerdlow et al., 2001), is a preattentive, automatic process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schizophrenia patients have been repeatedly shown reduced inhibition of the startle reflex in&#xD;
      PPI (rev. in Geyer et al., 2001). This loss of normal PPI is thought to be a measure of the&#xD;
      deficient sensorimotor gating (Braff and Geyer, 1990) that underlies sensory flooding and&#xD;
      cognitive fragmentation in these patients (McGhie and Chapman, 1961). Furthermore, some&#xD;
      studies report that PPI deficits may correlate with symptoms severity or cognitive and&#xD;
      functional impairment in schizophrenia and may partially or completely resolve with&#xD;
      antipsychotic drugs treatment (rev. in Braff et al., 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the proposed models of PPI hypothesizes the involvement of glutamatergic, mainly&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated neurotransmission. Glutamate is a key&#xD;
      inhibitory neurotransmitter. Glutamatergic neurotransmission may correlate with the&#xD;
      efficiency of sensory gating (Swerdlow and Geyer, 1999). Glutamatergic synapses have been&#xD;
      implicated in the regulation of PPI in rodents (Swerdlow et al., 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the possible connection between PPI and the glutamatergic system, we decided to&#xD;
      administer PPI to the subjects before and after the shiatsu treatment in order to assess&#xD;
      whether any ameliorating effect of shiatsu, which as noted can involve glutamatergic&#xD;
      mechanisms, may correlate with changes in the PPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also assess neurocognitive function using a battery of tests developed specifically&#xD;
      for use in assessing patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Study goals: Based upon the rationales we suggested for utilizing shiatsu in the treatment&#xD;
      of schizophrenia, and based upon the studies which have already been performed, we are&#xD;
      proposing a pilot study to examine the efficacy of shiatsu as adjuvant therapy for&#xD;
      antipsychotics in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study are several:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To improve the patients' symptoms 2. To ameliorate neuromuscular side effects produced by&#xD;
      standard anti-psychotic treatment 3. To provide patients with tools to deal with the stresses&#xD;
      of their illness 4. To provide a basis for further investigation of the effects of shiatsu 4.&#xD;
      Methodology We propose an open pilot study in which a total of 20 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
      These patients will be drawn from the inpatient psychiatric wards at Herzog Hospital. They&#xD;
      will be recruited by the treating physicians at these facilities. All patients would be fully&#xD;
      informed of the experimental treatments, goals, and possible outcomes. Either the&#xD;
      participant, or where relevant the court-appointed guardian, will be required to provide&#xD;
      informed consent. Participants will of course be free to discontinue their participation for&#xD;
      any reason at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. DSM-IV-R diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ages 18 and over&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical status stable, as reflected by at least one month of drug treatment without&#xD;
           change of anti-psychotic drug or dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ability to cooperate with 40-minute sessions 4.2 Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Active fracture or other orthopedic problem&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Skin condition that renders treatment unsafe or painful&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Active infection in skin or soft tissues, such as cellulitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Any acute illness or other medical condition (e.g. solid tissue malignancy) for which&#xD;
           shiatsu may be contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Study design Upon inclusion into the trial, all participants will receive shiatsu&#xD;
      treatment, consisting of two individual weekly 40-minute shiatsu treatment sessions for four&#xD;
      weeks. The shiatsu providers are all trained and certified by Tsabar College, an alternative&#xD;
      medicine training institute, and all have at least two years of post-training experience in&#xD;
      shiatsu. Each patient will receive all treatments from the same provider for the duration of&#xD;
      his or her treatment. Provider and patient will be of the same gender. The patient is clothed&#xD;
      with a shirt and full-length trousers or skirt during shiatsu. Treatment will not include&#xD;
      contact with sensitive regions of the body, such as the chest (in work with females), pelvic,&#xD;
      or inner thigh regions, or any other region of the body with which the patient is not&#xD;
      comfortable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard pharmacotherapy will be provided as needed during the treatment period. Medication&#xD;
      and dosage will not be changed. If necessary, benzodiazepines will be administered as&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 Rescue strategies and withdrawal from research In case of exacerbation, defined as an&#xD;
      increase of 2 points on the BPRS (or 4 to 6 on the individual items listed above), or of one&#xD;
      point on the CGI, the patient may receive clothiapine at a dose of up to 80 mg/day for not&#xD;
      more than 3 days within a 14-day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of relapse, defined as an increase of 3 points on the BPRS (or from 5 to 7 on somatic&#xD;
      concern, conceptual disorganization, hostility, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior or&#xD;
      unusual thought content), or of 2 points on the CGI, the patient will be withdrawn from the&#xD;
      study and appropriate treatment instituted. Furthermore, if the patient deteriorates&#xD;
      clinically in a way that may be related to treatment (e.g. paranoid fantasies directed&#xD;
      towards the shiatsu therapist), the research protocol for that individual will be&#xD;
      discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant emergent medical problems will also lead to the withdrawal of the patient from&#xD;
      the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.5 Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments will be included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medication&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Use of SOS benzodiazepines: quantity and frequency&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical rating scales&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. PANSS&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. CGI&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. NOSIE&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Hamilton Scales for depression and anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Side effect scales:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Simpson Angus Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. AIMS scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. UKU scale 3. Neurophysiological testing: Prepulse inhibition (PPI). This is performed as&#xD;
           follows: The eyeblink component of the acoustic startle reflex is measured using&#xD;
           electromyography of the obicularis oculi muscle. Two electrodes (6 mm) Ag/AgCl&#xD;
           electrodes filled with electrode gel (parker laboratories inc.) will be positioned below&#xD;
           and to the right of the patient's right eye, over the obicularis oculi muscle.&#xD;
           Electrodes will be placed to minimize potential electro-oculogram artifact.&#xD;
           Specifically, 1 electrode will be placed approximately 1 cm lateral to and 0.5 cm below&#xD;
           the lateral canthus, and the second electrode will be placed approximately 1.5 cm below&#xD;
           and slightly medial to the first electrode, conforming to the location of the obicularis&#xD;
           oculi fibers. A ground electrode will be placed behind the right ear over the mastoid.&#xD;
           All resistances will be less than 10 kOhm. Electrodes will be fixed to the skin as close&#xD;
           as possible to each other using adhesive collars. All acoustic stimuli will be delivered&#xD;
           binaurally through headphones (Maico, TDH-39-P). Subjects will be seated comfortably in&#xD;
           a softly lit after they will be informed of the procedure. The prepulse and startle&#xD;
           stimuli are bursts of white noise with a fixed interstimulus intervals of 30, 60 and 120&#xD;
           ms for measuring PPI or 15 ms and 4500 ms for measuring PPF. The startle session will&#xD;
           begin with a 5-minute acclimation period of 70-dB white noise, which will continue&#xD;
           throughout the session, followed by six trial blocks. Block 1 consisted of six&#xD;
           pulse-alone trials. Blocks 2 and 3 each consisted of 32 trials, containing 8 pulse-alone&#xD;
           and 24 prepulse-pulse trials presented in pseudorandom order. Block 4 consisted of six&#xD;
           pulse-alone trials. Block 5 consisted of six pulse-alone trials and 12 prepulse-pulse&#xD;
           trials and block 6 consisted six pulse alone trials. The first, forth and sixth blocks&#xD;
           will measure habituation as well as startle response, the second and the third blocks&#xD;
           will measure startle response and PPI and the fifth block will measure PPF. The pulse&#xD;
           alone stimulus is a 40 ms presentation of 115dB white noise, the prepulse stimulus is a&#xD;
           20 ms (except the 15 ms interval stimulus which lasts 5 ms) presentation of 86 dB noise,&#xD;
           both over 70 dB of continuous background noise. Acoustic stimuli consist of pulse alone,&#xD;
           prepulse and pulse, or no stimulus trials and are presented in a fixed pseudorandom&#xD;
           order. Electromyographic activity recorded by the electrodes will be directed through a&#xD;
           customized electromyographic amplifier to a computerized startle response monitoring&#xD;
           system for digitization and analysis (SR-LAB; San Diego Instruments Inc, San Diego,&#xD;
           Calif). The system will record 1000 one-ms readings starting at the onset of the startle&#xD;
           stimulus. Acoustic startle and prepulse stimuli will be presented binaurally through&#xD;
           headphones.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4. Neurocognitive testing: This will be performed using the NIMH's Measurement and&#xD;
           Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive&#xD;
           Battery for Clinical Trials. This recently-developed battery is recommended for use in&#xD;
           clinical trials of putative cognition-enhancing agents in schizophrenia. The MATRICS&#xD;
           battery, including Hebrew translations of relevant tests, is presently used in the&#xD;
           Stanley Foundation-sponsored Israel Multicenter D-Serine Trial (IMSER) (Dr. Heresco-Levy&#xD;
           - Co-Principal Investigator) and will be implemented by a trained psychologist presently&#xD;
           participating in this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5. Hypothesis: Shiatsu adjuvant therapy will improve psychiatric and motor symptoms in&#xD;
           patients after four weeks of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.1 Potential Benefits: Shiatsu treatment is a pleasant experience involving applying&#xD;
           pressure manually to various points of the body. Furthermore, the research will itself&#xD;
           lead to more time spent by staff with patients, which is to the patient's benefit.&#xD;
           Beyond that we anticipate that shiatsu will be of benefit, alongside the standard&#xD;
           pharmacological treatment which will be continued, in enhancing the patient's wellbeing&#xD;
           and reducing medication side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.2 Potential Adverse Effects: Shiatsu is not known to carry any significant risks to&#xD;
           patients. It may rarely cause soreness, muscle cramps, or local pain. Patients will be&#xD;
           informed of this possibility and instructed to notify the shiatsu therapist if&#xD;
           discomfort occurs during treatment. Psychological distress may be aroused by the human&#xD;
           contact and touching that occurs during treatment. Patients will be advised about this&#xD;
           possibility as well. Patients wishing for any reason to discontinue the research will of&#xD;
           course be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.3 Significance of study: The treatment of schizophrenia could benefit from new&#xD;
           modalities to complement existing approaches. To date, no study has systemically&#xD;
           evaluated the use of shiatsu in treating schizophrenia, and only one study has evaluated&#xD;
           shiatsu in this population for drug induced myospasm. Due to the chronic nature of this&#xD;
           disease and the severe impairment of quality of life, any and all means should be sought&#xD;
           in combating the suffering inherent in this disease. Shiatsu may be a cost-effective,&#xD;
           pleasant, and well-tolerated treatment for some schizophrenia symptoms. This study may&#xD;
           pave the way for similar studies in other psychiatric patients.&#xD;
