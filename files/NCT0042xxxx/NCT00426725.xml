      The suggested research is aimed to test the effectiveness of an external mechanical device to&#xD;
      be applied and used by the parturient herself in pain relieving during labour . The research&#xD;
      is to be performed in a controlled closely observed way, to ensure the safety of the involved&#xD;
      parturient and newborn.&#xD;

      Clinical Trial Design A prospective controlled study meant to scientifically test the&#xD;
      feasibility of a device to alleviate labour pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every woman will sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Guidance for proper and safe use of the device will be given by specially trained&#xD;
           midwives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be performed at the Laniado Hospital-Sanz Medical Center, Netanya,&#xD;
           Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study group will consist of 60 women, 30 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligibility : Ages Eligible for study is 18 years and up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study group shall consists of 30 parturients at active labour, with contractions,&#xD;
           demanding to receive analgesia. The device will be given, with guidance from a&#xD;
           pre-trained midwife and under professional supervision. This study group will include&#xD;
           also women choosing to continue using it till the application of epidural analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The control group shall consists of 30 parturients at active labour, with contractions,&#xD;
           choosing to receive epidural analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women with low-risk normal pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy women, age 18 years or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At active labour, with contractions and labour pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women at high risk pregnancies (with Diabetes Mellitus, Arterial Hypertension, multiple&#xD;
           fetal pregnancy, abnormal amniotic fluid index, Intra Uterine growth restriction(IUGR),&#xD;
           or any situation which might imply placental insufficiency)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caesarean sections in the past&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any contraindication to vaginal delivery (as breech presentation or Placenta Previa).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any active illness, abnormal body temperature, Fatigue, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women complaining of any pain nonrelated to labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for taking out of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon parturient's demand. Analgesia will be given upon parturient demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parturients arriving at the delivery room and fitting the criteria will randomly divided into&#xD;
      two groups: the study group, which will use the device, and the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensity of pain will be measured in five different stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Before they put on the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Five minutes after starting to use the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. After 30 minutes of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The device will be turned off for the duration of three consecutive contractions after&#xD;
           which pain intensity will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The device will be turned on and pain intensity will be measured after 5 minutes of&#xD;
           renewed use.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pain intensity will be measured and defined by the participants using the Mosby&#xD;
                Pain Rating Scale (see attached document).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The device will be attached to participants with uterine contractions with a&#xD;
                frequency of at least 3 contractions every 10 minutes and cervical dilatation of at&#xD;
                least 2 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Both groups will be divided according to 3 age subgroups: 18 to 30, 31 to 40, and&#xD;
                41 to 45.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A further division will be according to BMI: below BMI 20, 20 to 25, and above a&#xD;
                BMI of 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups 6 indexes will be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparison of pain intensity between subjects of both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stage of application of analgesia, epidural or other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Length of second stage of birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Rate of instrumental deliveries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Rate of Caesarean Sections due to non-advancement progressive labour, arrest of cervical&#xD;
           dilatation, or arrest of fetal head descent .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rate of fetal non reassuring monitor, like fetal deceleration or low variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study length:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study may take around one year, or till enough cases are collected in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of success:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Success will be defined as proof of labour pain relief achievement, measured as a difference&#xD;
      between the study and control groups, among participants in the study group, according to&#xD;
      statistical criteria as are customary in similar studies. Exceptional success will be&#xD;
      considered if statistical proof could be observed that using the device shortens delivery&#xD;
      length of time, or, that using of the device diminishes the usage of epidural analgesia.&#xD;
