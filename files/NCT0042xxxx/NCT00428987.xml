    <textblock>
      This study will describe the phenotype (physical and behavioral traits) of overweight and&#xD;
      obese people. It will characterize the hormones, metabolism, food preferences, fitness and&#xD;
      physical activity levels, sleep patterns and thought processes in people with and without&#xD;
      weight problems. Genetic material will be collected for studies of the internal codes that&#xD;
      influence body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People over 18 years of age from all weight categories (lean, overweight, obese) who are&#xD;
      reasonably healthy may be eligible for this study. Participants undergo the following tests&#xD;
      and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam, electrocardiogram, blood and urine tests, instructions for recording food&#xD;
           intake for 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metabolic studies for menstruating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting metabolic rate to study how many calories the body burns at rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mixed meal test to measure hormones such as insulin that regulate blood sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose tolerance test to determine how sensitive the body is to insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour energy expenditure to measure the amount of oxygen breathed in and the amount of&#xD;
           carbon dioxide breathed out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat 24-hour energy expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diurnal blood sampling and temperature assessment to study the body s internal clock.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Air-displacement plethysmography (Bod Pod) to measure body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dual energy x-ray absortiometry (DEXA) to measure body fat and bone density.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat Bod Pod and DEXA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric measurements and bioelectrical impedance to measure height, weight, and&#xD;
           circumferences, skinfold thickness, fluid status and percentage body fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bromide dilution to measure the amount of water not in cells in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Doubly labeled water to measure the amount of calories burned in a 7-day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour diet reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endothelial reactivity to measure how the blood vessels stretch or dilate for assessing&#xD;
           cardiovascular health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treadmill or bicycle exercise capacity test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical activity monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unicorder to detect any breathing difficulties that may interfere with sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fat and muscle biopsy to look for variations in gene expression in fat tissue and&#xD;
           muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurocognitive testing to check memory, decision-making, hand-eye coordination, and&#xD;
           reasoning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of mood problems and assess personality type.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation to assess the quantity and quality of pain experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Taste testing to determine the response to bitter, salty, sweet and sour substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occupational therapy evaluation to explore the subject s adaptations, if any, for&#xD;
           performing personal, social or professional activities; the subject s views on his or&#xD;
           her weight, body size and shape, and strategies to control weight.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although complex metabolic, hormonal, and neural networks operate to control body weight,&#xD;
      obesity is in most cases, the result of over-feeding and inactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the majority of obese patients, patterns of fundamental behavior determine the success or&#xD;
      failure of weight loss interventions. Behavior is controlled to some degree by conscious&#xD;
      decision making and is influenced by signals from the integrated networks involved in body&#xD;
      weight regulation. The contributions of behavior, environment, socioeconomic status,&#xD;
      physiology and genetics assure that no single therapeutic regimen will be successful in all&#xD;
      obese individuals. In order to explore the factors that impede weight loss and result in&#xD;
      weight regain, the obese phenotype and its variants must be defined. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to detail hormonal, metabolic, cognitive and behavioral traits across the spectrum&#xD;
      of weight categories utilizing the state-of the-art facilities of the Metabolic Units at the&#xD;
      Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center, NIH. Genetic material will be banked for analysis&#xD;
      of phenotypic subgroups as they emerge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients over the age of 18 are eligible for this study. While childhood obesity is an&#xD;
      important public health issue, the variables of growth and hormonal controls will be&#xD;
      delineated in separate studies. Over-weight and obese patients are encouraged to participate&#xD;
      in as full an evaluation as feasible. Lean individuals will be recruited to create a&#xD;
      normative database for body composition (dual energy x-ray absortiometry, air displacement&#xD;
      plethysmography), energy expenditure (resting energy expenditure, 24h respiratory chamber and&#xD;
      doubly labeled water) and other techniques used to study traits of importance. The study will&#xD;
      be conducted in both the inpatient and outpatient setting and can include evaluation of&#xD;
      hormones, diurnal variation, sleep, eating behavior and taste perception, physical fitness,&#xD;
      psychological and neurocognitive functioning. Importantly, this protocol is the means by&#xD;
      which pilot data are obtained to develop novel approaches and hypotheses for studying obesity&#xD;
      and its associated traits.&#xD;
