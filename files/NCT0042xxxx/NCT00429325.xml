  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year more than 4 billion cases of diarrhea occur worldwide culminating in about 2.5&#xD;
      million deaths, almost all in the developing nations. Reliable diagnosis of patients with&#xD;
      acute infectious diarrhea which could be appropriately managed with antibiotics at&#xD;
      presentation still remains a formidable challenge to the clinicians. To address this issue of&#xD;
      predicting microbiological infectious etiology for diagnosing acute infectious diarrhea, we&#xD;
      would evaluate stools from all patients with acute diarrhea with culture, Guaiac based fecal&#xD;
      occult blood test (FOBT), Calprotectin and lactoferrin assays simultaneously. This would be&#xD;
      the first study evaluating fecal calprotectin as a diagnostic marker in acute diarrhea&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are about 4 billion cases of diarrhea worldwide i.e. about half the population of the&#xD;
      world is affected with it once every year. Though the mortality because of it has reduced&#xD;
      significantly still it contributes to more than 2.2 million deaths (4% of all deaths) and 5%&#xD;
      of health loss due to disability annually. Most of these deaths are due to acute diarrhea, in&#xD;
      the developing countries which rapidly causes dehydration unless adequately supplemented.&#xD;
      Unlike many of the medical challenges, acute infectious diarrhea still remains a significant&#xD;
      global health hazard. Adequate, appropriate treatment with proper antimicrobials not only&#xD;
      shortens the morbidity, hospitalisation and costs to the society but also can be life saving&#xD;
      in certain infectious diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biggest problem is the lack of accurate diagnostic modality to differentiate acute&#xD;
      infections from non infectious diarrhea. Stool microscopy, Guaiac based fecal blood tests&#xD;
      (hemoccult), lactoferrin assays and bacteriological culture have been used for this purpose&#xD;
      till now. However none of these were of great help in the diagnostic algorithm of management&#xD;
      of acute diarrhea. The gold standard to diagnose acute infectious diarrhea is of course the&#xD;
      bacteriological culture. But its very expensive, time consuming and delays definite therapy.&#xD;
      There is a need for something simple, cheap, fast and accurate to diagnose acute infectious&#xD;
      diarrhea. In the present prospective study, we plan to evaluate the performance&#xD;
      characteristics of fecal calprotectin in diverse group of patients referred to our hospitals.&#xD;
      Its performance characteristics would be compared with that of lactoferrin and FOBT.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients having acute diarrhea i.e. 3 or more stools per day or stool weight&#xD;
             exceeding 200 grams lasting less than 15 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients having the following diagnosis as they might have high calprotectin levels not&#xD;
        only because of the diarrhea per se but may also be because of the underlying pathology&#xD;
        itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gastrointestinal malignancy (colorectal cancer, gastric cancer etc)&#xD;
