  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In many communities, skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) with MRSA have become&#xD;
      more prevalent than infections with β-lactam susceptible bacteria. This has necessitated&#xD;
      altered empiric antimicrobial therapy of SSTI to cover MRSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate empiric therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or doxycycline for&#xD;
      outpatient SSTI in an area of high MRSA prevalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized, prospective, open-label investigation. Setting: Emergency Department of&#xD;
      Parkland Hospital in Dallas, Texas. Patients: Adults with SSTI. Intervention: Empiric oral&#xD;
      therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (160 mg/800 mg, twice daily) or doxycycline (100&#xD;
      mg, twice daily).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement: The primary endpoint was clinical failure defined as hospitalization or change&#xD;
      in antibiotic therapy over the 10 to 14 days after initial emergency department evaluation.&#xD;

      As MRSA in more likely to be isolated from a SSTI than is a β-lactam susceptible organism at&#xD;
      Parkland Hospital in Dallas, Texas, we performed a randomized, prospective, open-label&#xD;
      investigation in our emergency department to determine the efficacy of empiric therapy using&#xD;
      off-patent oral antibiotics (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160 mg/800 mg twice daily or&#xD;
      doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days) for the outpatient treatment of SSTI abscesses,&#xD;
      requiring wound packing after incision and drainage but not requiring hospitalization. Only&#xD;
      SSTI requiring wound packing were enrolled to eliminate the inclusion of smaller SSTI not&#xD;
      requiring wound packing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation was approved by The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board and included adults (≥ 18 years old) who were willing and able to&#xD;
      provide informed consent. Inclusion criteria included being able to return for follow-up at 2&#xD;
      to 5 days after enrollment and being accessible by telephone for follow-up assessment at 10&#xD;
      to 14 days and 28 to 35 days after enrollment. Exclusion criteria excluded patients with&#xD;
      contraindications or history of hypersensitivity reaction to any of the study treatment&#xD;
      regimens, an infected prosthesis or device, concomitant bacteremia or deep infections (e.g.&#xD;
      osteomyelitis, necrotizing fasciitis, endocarditis), diabetic foot infections, known&#xD;
      immunodeficiency, pregnant or breastfeeding, requirement of additional antimicrobial agents,&#xD;
      and those who did not obtain assigned antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study was clinical failure defined as subsequent hospital&#xD;
      admission, administration of intravenous antibiotics, or change in oral antibiotics over a&#xD;
      period of 10-14 days after initial emergency department presentation. Repeated outpatient&#xD;
      incision and drainage of the SSTI at 2 to 5 days after enrollment was not considered a&#xD;
      clinical failure, if antibiotics were not changed and intravenous antibiotics were not&#xD;
      administered. The trial enrolled patients from October 2005 to May 2006. Method of&#xD;
      randomization was by generation of random numbers using www.randomizer.org, and alternately&#xD;
      assigning these to the two treatment groups, and then sorting the numbers consecutively to&#xD;
      determine the sequence of assigning treatment group to consecutively recruited patients.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed with SigmaStat 3.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago,&#xD;
      Illinois). This investigation had no external funding.&#xD;
