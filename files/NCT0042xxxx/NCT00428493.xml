      The purpose of this study is to see if people in China who have contact with someone infected&#xD;
      with bird flu (H5N1) become infected themselves without necessarily getting sick. Adults and&#xD;
      children greater than 1 year of age who have contact with someone infected with bird flu may&#xD;
      participate in the study. At the first 1-2 study visits, a blood sample will be taken from&#xD;
      volunteers in order to test for antibodies, the part of the blood that fights infection. If&#xD;
      the result of the H5N1 antibody test is positive after the 1st or 2nd study visit, an&#xD;
      additional blood sample will be collected during a 3rd and 4th study visit. Volunteers will&#xD;
      be asked questions about their work, home life, and possible contact with poultry, other&#xD;
      birds, animals, and people infected with bird flu. Participants will be involved in study&#xD;
      related procedures for up to 90 days.&#xD;

      This will be a prospective cohort study of individuals exposed to confirmed cases of Human&#xD;
      Influenza A (H5N1) infection in China. The study will be conducted over a period of&#xD;
      approximately one year. Adults and children, greater than age 1, who meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be consented and enrolled in the study. These subjects will undergo up to two&#xD;
      blood draws for serologic testing of the presence of H5N1 antibodies according to an&#xD;
      algorithm. These subjects will also be administered a structured questionnaire for collection&#xD;
      of demographic information, information on potential exposure to poultry, other birds or&#xD;
      animals, or infected humans and any clinical symptoms. This questionnaire will have similar&#xD;
      data elements to the questionnaires used in the past for collection by the China CDC. The&#xD;
      questionnaires were administered in areas of China where there have been poultry and human&#xD;
      cases, as well as, other high risk populations in non-outbreak areas. Enrolled participants&#xD;
      will complete two study visits no more than one month apart with a third visit for those who&#xD;
      test positive for influenza A H5N1 infection. Participants who consent to HIV testing will&#xD;
      have a fourth visit to obtain their HIV test results. The primary study objective is to&#xD;
      determine the prevalence of antibodies to avian influenza A (H5N1) virus among close contacts&#xD;
      and health care workers associated with confirmed H5N1 infected individuals in China. The&#xD;
      secondary study objectives are to: describe risk factors for human infection with avian&#xD;
      influenza A (H5N1) virus in China; evaluate the incidence of seroconversion and increases in&#xD;
      titer of H5N1 antibodies; describe risk factors associated with seroconversion and increases&#xD;
      in titer of H5N1 antibodies; determine T-cell immune responses in H5N1 infected individuals;&#xD;
      and determine the prevalence of co-infection of H5N1 and HIV-1. The primary endpoint is&#xD;
      detection of avian influenza H5N1 infection as determined by a positive result on&#xD;
      Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) and confirmed by Microneutralization (MN). Corresponding&#xD;
      with the secondary study objectives, the following will be assessed as secondary study&#xD;
      endpoints: association of risk factors with avian influenza seropositivity, including&#xD;
      demographic characteristics and various exposures to poultry, other birds, and to infected&#xD;
      humans; H5N1 serum antibody titer seroconversion or a greater than or equal to 4-fold&#xD;
      increase in titer; association of risk factors with avian influenza seroconversion, including&#xD;
      demographic characteristics and various exposures to poultry, other birds, and to infected&#xD;
      humans; HIV-1 infection as determined by ELISA and Western Blot assays and co-infection of&#xD;
      H5N1 and HIV-1 as determined by both assays described above; and T-cell responses to H5N1 as&#xD;
      determined by ELISPOT assay and ICS.&#xD;
