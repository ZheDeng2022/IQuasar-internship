  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to assesss the safety and immunogenicity of vaccine based on Modified Vaccinia&#xD;
      Ankara (MVA) expressing the 85A antigen (from Mycobacterium. tuberculosis). This vaccine is&#xD;
      delivered intrdermally by a needle injection in healthy volunteers.&#xD;

      1. This is a phase I study to assesss the safety and immunogenicity a recombinant MVA&#xD;
           encoding a secreted antigen from Mycobacterium. tuberculosis Antigen 85A, delivered&#xD;
           intrdermally by a needle injection in healthy BCG naive volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Selection of volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
           Volunteers for the study will be recruited through advertisements. Each volunteer will&#xD;
           have received an information sheet concerning the study and will have agreed to&#xD;
           participate in writing. Volunteers will be given at least 48 hours between reading the&#xD;
           information leaflet and agreeing to participate. Female volunteers will be told of the&#xD;
           theoretical risk of congenital anomaly should they become pregnant during the study and&#xD;
           only those who undertake to take precautions to avoid pregnancy during the study period&#xD;
           will be eligible. Volunteers will give signed consent for their GP's to be notified&#xD;
           about their participation in the trial. The GP will be faxed a letter on the day of&#xD;
           screening and asked to reply if they know of a reason why the volunteer should not take&#xD;
           part. The signed consent form will also be faxed with the letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Screening&#xD;

                7 Immunisation&#xD;
&#xD;
                On Day 0 and Day 21, subjects will receive a single intradermal injection of 5 x&#xD;
                107pfu in 0.1ml over the deltoid muscle. Subjects will be observed for an hour&#xD;
                after all immunisations. Vital signs will be monitored at 30 and 60 minutes&#xD;
                post-immunisation. Local reactions at the site of administration will be evaluated&#xD;
                at 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
                A photograph of the injection site may be taken at 48 hours (with written consent).&#xD;
                The injection site will be reviewed 7 days after each immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Blood will be taken at the following time points: At the screening visit*, prior to&#xD;
                the first vaccination, *1 week after the first vaccination, prior to the second&#xD;
                vaccination, *1 week after the second vaccination, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, *12 weeks and&#xD;
                24 weeks after the second vaccination. Up to 55 mls will be taken at any one time&#xD;
                with the total being no more than 500 mls over the study period. *Samples taken on&#xD;
                these dates will be tested for full blood count and biochemical screen.&#xD;
                Immunological assays will be performed at all time points to determine vaccine&#xD;
                immunogenicity. A pregnancy test will be performed on screening and each&#xD;
                vaccination day prior to vaccination for female volunteers. Peripheral blood&#xD;
                mononuclear cells will be prepared for cellular immunological assays to be&#xD;
                performed without or following cryopreservation. Other serological measures of&#xD;
                immune response, i.e. antibody titres, will be assayed on frozen plasma samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
                At the end of the six month follow-up period, volunteers will be offered BCG&#xD;
                immunisation. If they accept, imunological monitering will continue for a further&#xD;
                six months. 50mls of blood will be taken for cellular immunological assays 1 week,&#xD;
                2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months and 6 months after BCG immunisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                All blood tests will be taken within 1-3 days of the due date as described in the&#xD;
                schedule above.&#xD;
&#xD;
                8 Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
                The occurance and severity of local side-effects. The occurance and severity of&#xD;
                systemic side-effects. The induction of T cell responses (as measured by an&#xD;
                interferon-gamma Elispot assay).&#xD;
&#xD;
                Proliferation assays and cytotoxic T cell assays will be performed on strong CD4+&#xD;
                and CD8+ responses respectively.&#xD;
