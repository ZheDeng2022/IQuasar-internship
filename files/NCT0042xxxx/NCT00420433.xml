      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate and compare the sensitivity and specificity of computed tomography (CT),&#xD;
           plain radiography (XR), and skeletal scintigraphy (SS) with each other for the&#xD;
           assessment of response of bone metastasis in patients with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate and compare the sensitivity and specificity of M. D. Anderson (MDACC) bone&#xD;
           metastasis criteria with that of current criteria (UICC, WHO) in breast cancer patients&#xD;
           for the assessment of the behavior of osseous metastasis in breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of each&#xD;
           response group (CR, PR, SD, PD) assessed by imaging and response criteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare plain x-rays (XR), skeletal scintigraphy (SS), computed tomography&#xD;
      (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) in&#xD;
      measuring response. MRI and PET/CT can be performed if they are needed by standard of care.&#xD;
      We anticipate MRI will be performed most commonly due to back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will also compare three sets of standardized evaluation criteria (UICC criteria,&#xD;
      WHO criteria, MDACC criteria). The MDACC criteria are new while the UICC and the WHO are&#xD;
      standard criteria. The old criteria are no longer thought to be as reliable because they are&#xD;
      based only on older technology (XR and SS). Since newer technologies are not included in the&#xD;
      old criteria, most cancer doctors do not use these older criteria for evaluation of bone&#xD;
      lesions. Therefore, new bone tumor criteria including newer imaging techniques (CT and MRI)&#xD;
      are needed. At the end of the study, researchers will look at how sensitive and clear each&#xD;
      imaging technique is, and they will use a set of criteria to learn which technique best&#xD;
      measures the disease's response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will have a complete physical exam, including a score of their&#xD;
      bone pain. Routine blood tests (between 1-2 tablespoons) will be performed before&#xD;
      participation in this study begins. Women who are able to have children must have a negative&#xD;
      blood pregnancy test before starting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also have imaging examinations (XR, SS, CT, and MRI, PET/CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the first examinations will be finished within one month before the start the&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapy. If imaging examinations alone cannot prove that the disease has spread&#xD;
      to the bone, a needle bone biopsy will be done. A bone biopsy means that researchers will&#xD;
      collect a couple of small tumor samples from the suspicious bone site. The tumor samples will&#xD;
      be taken using a large needle while you are under the appropriate anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible for this study, you will have imaging exams (described&#xD;
      below), bone score evaluations, and blood tests (between 1-2 tablespoons) done before&#xD;
      treatment and again at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after starting anticancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plain radiographs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also called X-rays. You will receive a complete bone survey. This consists of 2 views of&#xD;
      spine, one view of the top of your head, one view of your chest, one view of your pelvic&#xD;
      bones, and two of your ribs, one from each side. Any other symptomatic bone scans will also&#xD;
      be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skeletal scintigraphy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also called bone scan. You should not eat for more than 4 hours before this examination. You&#xD;
      will get the pictures 2-3 hour after intravenous injection of Technetium-99m bound to&#xD;
      methylene diphosphonate (Tc-99m MDP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scan will include your chest, abdomen, and pelvis. You should not eat for more than 6&#xD;
      hours before this examination. You will be given oral and intravenous contrast as is done in&#xD;
      standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an optional procedure. MRI of the symptomatic areas will be performed and followed on&#xD;
      the same schedule as other imaging. You will be given contrast dye by vein as is done in&#xD;
      standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET/CT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an optional procedure. The examination usually takes 30-40 min while you are lying on&#xD;
      the moving bed with tunnel 60-90min after injection of 2-deoxy-2-[18F] fluoro-D-glucose (FDG)&#xD;
      by vein. You should not eat for more than 6 hours before this examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your part in the study will end after the 12 month tests. However, you will be monitored for&#xD;
      3 years after enrolling on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. This study is not focusing to test the treatment agents but&#xD;
      to test the imaging technique assessing bone tumor response. The exams performed in this&#xD;
      study are commercially available and are part of routine examination. A total of up to 120&#xD;
      patients will take part in the study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Newly diagnosed bone (from calvarium to pelvis include ribs and sternum) and&#xD;
             nonosseous (it should be measurable by CT) metastasis or primary breast tumor (with a&#xD;
             confirmation of no surgical treatment for 12 months) from breast cancer. If the bone&#xD;
             metastasis is not confirmed by imaging, bone biopsy is needed. Please see diagnostic&#xD;
             flow sheet. (APPENDIX B)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Zubrod performance status 2 or less. (APPENDIX A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient must receive systemic treatment (e.g., chemotherapy, hormonal therapy) for&#xD;
             this newly diagnosed metastatic disease. (Additional bisphosphonate treatment will be&#xD;
             acceptable.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must sign an informed consent document indicating awareness that this study&#xD;
             is not focusing on the verification of treatment agents but on verification of&#xD;
             modalities to assess bone tumor response, in keeping with institutional policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have less than 3 months interval from completion of treatment&#xD;
             (chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy) for primary breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have the history of radiation therapy for bone disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History or presence of brain/leptomeningeal metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of other malignancies except cured non-melanoma skin cancer or cured cervical&#xD;
