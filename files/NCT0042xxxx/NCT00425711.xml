  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acamprosate will be given to approximately 30 DUI Court participants for 3 months and&#xD;
      outcomes will be monitored. The hypothesis is that acamprosate will be safe and&#xD;
      well-tolerated and that subjects' craving and other symptoms related to addiction will&#xD;
      improve over time.&#xD;

      Purpose: The study is a 13 week open-label study of the use of acamprosate in subjects who&#xD;
      have elected to participate in the DUI Court program in Tulsa County. Admission to the DUI&#xD;
      Court is completely voluntary. Participants must apply for admission, undergo an initial&#xD;
      evaluation, and receive approval by the District Attorney's office and the presiding judge.&#xD;
      The four-phase program requires a minimum of 1 year to complete. Each phase requires&#xD;
      counseling, mandatory random urine drug screens, mandatory daily breathalyzer tests, a&#xD;
      nightly curfew and that the participant be gainfully employed or in school. Currently,&#xD;
      approximately 10% of the participants are able to complete the program in the minimum 12&#xD;
      month requirement. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the duration of alcohol&#xD;
      abstinence in DUI Court participants receiving acamprosate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Thirty subjects will be enrolled in the study. New DUI court participants, within 3&#xD;
      months of enrollment, will be invited to participate in the trial. Qualified subjects will&#xD;
      receive, in addition to the required DUI court assessments and treatments, a physical&#xD;
      examination, baseline safety laboratory, study drug, psychiatric evaluation, depressive and&#xD;
      anxiety rating scales, a personality disorder questionnaire and vital signs taken at each&#xD;
      visit. Alcohol and substance use will be assessed by self-report and validated with review of&#xD;
      the court-ordered laboratory and breathalyzer tests.&#xD;
