      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation&#xD;
      therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known&#xD;
      whether giving radiation therapy to a smaller area of tissue surrounding the tumor is as&#xD;
      effective as giving radiation therapy to a wider area of tissue surrounding the tumor in&#xD;
      treating soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving external-beam radiation therapy&#xD;
      to a small area of tissue surrounding the tumor to see how well it works compared with giving&#xD;
      external-beam radiation therapy to a wider area of tissue surrounding the tumor in treating&#xD;
      patients who have undergone surgery for soft tissue sarcoma of the arms, hands, legs, or&#xD;
      feet.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if reduced volume adjuvant radiotherapy increases limb function without&#xD;
           compromising local control in patients with previously resected extremity soft tissue&#xD;
           sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the overall level of disability in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the disease-free survival and overall survival of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, prospective, multicenter study. Patients are&#xD;
      stratified according to tumor grade (1 vs 2 vs 3), adequacy of surgical clearance (R0 vs R1),&#xD;
      and treatment center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (control): Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), including full&#xD;
           margins, once daily 5 days a week for 6Â½ weeks .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients undergo EBRT as in arm I but only reduced margins are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every&#xD;
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
