          <title>Change From Baseline in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Internalization Assay in Epithelial Brushings - EGFR Spots at Nucleus With Marker</title>
          <description>Change in number of EGFR spots at nucleus per cell with marker. The degree of EGFR internalization (and hence activation) was measured using antibody or ligand labeling techniques in epithelial brushing samples obtained during the endobronchial biopsy at visit 2 (baseline) and at the end of the 4-week period of randomised treatment (visit 5). Measurements visit 2 are used to standardize measurements at visit 5, and the standardized visit 5 value is calculated in % control as (visit5/visit2*100).</description>
