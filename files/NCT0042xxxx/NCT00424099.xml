  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if methylphenidate (Ritalin) can help to&#xD;
      control fatigue caused by cancer. Its effect on other symptoms such as drowsiness,&#xD;
      depression, sleeplessness, physical activity, and anxiety will also be studied. Another goal&#xD;
      of this study is to learn if receiving a phone call by a nurse improves fatigue in patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is one of the most common problems in patients with advanced cancer. Currently, there&#xD;
      are no treatments for managing fatigue. Methylphenidate is a stimulant that increases ability&#xD;
      to pay attention, increases mental alertness, and decreases feelings of fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the roll of dice) to one of 4 groups. You will have an equal chance of being placed in any&#xD;
      of the 4 groups. You, the medical staff, and researchers will not know to which group you&#xD;
      have been assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of which group you are in, you will record your fatigue in a daily diary at&#xD;
      breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bedtime. Based on your level of fatigue, you will take&#xD;
      the study drug as needed. You can take the study drug every 2 hours but you may not take more&#xD;
      than 4 capsules a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Group 1 will take a methylphenidate capsule by mouth as needed to relieve&#xD;
      symptoms of fatigue for 14 days. A nurse will call you 4-6 times in the first two weeks to&#xD;
      ask about side effects and other symptoms. The phone calls should take about 10-20 minutes.&#xD;
      The study nurse will set up a convenient time for you to take the phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Group 2 will take a placebo capsule by mouth as needed for 14 days. A placebo&#xD;
      is a capsule that does not contain any medication but looks just like the methylphenidate. A&#xD;
      nurse will call you 4-6 times in the first two weeks to ask about side effects and other&#xD;
      symptoms. The phone calls should take about 10-20 minutes. The study nurse will set up a&#xD;
      convenient time for you to take the phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Group 3 will take a methylphenidate capsule by mouth as needed for 14 days.&#xD;
      Participants in this group will not receive any calls from a study nurse. However, A research&#xD;
      staff member will call you 4-6 times in the first two weeks to ask about side effects and&#xD;
      other symptoms. The phone calls should take about 10-20 minutes. The research staff member&#xD;
      will set up a convenient time for you to take the phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Group 4 will take a placebo capsule by mouth as needed for 14 days.&#xD;
      Participants in this group will not receive any calls from a study nurse. However, A research&#xD;
      staff member will call you 4-6 times in the first two weeks to ask about side effects and&#xD;
      other symptoms. The phone calls should take about 10-20 minutes. The research staff member&#xD;
      will set up a convenient time for you to take the phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to wear a wrist actigraph monitor (a wristwatch that keeps track of your&#xD;
      physical activity and your sleep cycles) for the first 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will keep a daily diary of your fatigue and other symptoms, the number and times pills&#xD;
      are taken, and your fatigue rating before and 2 hours after taking methylphenidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On about day 15 (or within 3 days) you will return to the palliative care clinic at M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson for tests. You will be asked about your level of drowsiness, pain, constipation, and&#xD;
      fatigue. You will be asked about any side effects you may have experienced and the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the drug. You will repeat the 6 minute physical test, the cognitive status&#xD;
      test, and you will return the actigraph monitor to the research nurse. You will also be given&#xD;
      the option to receive up to 4 capsules of methylphenidate per day until Day 36. You will not&#xD;
      be told whether you were taking placebo or methylphenidate during Days 1-14. If you cannot&#xD;
      come to the clinic on Day 15, all tests except the walking test, may be performed over the&#xD;
      telephone. You will be asked to mail the actigraph back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you decide not to take methylphenidate on Days 15-36, you will be considered off-study and&#xD;
      you will have end-of-study tests on Day 15. If you decide to take methylphenidate on Days&#xD;
      15-36, you will remain on study until Day 36. On Day 36, you will have end-of-study tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For end-of-study tests, you will repeat the physical and cognitive tests. You will be asked&#xD;
      about your symptoms and any side effects you may be experiencing. You will then return to&#xD;
      your primary physician who will discuss with you whether or not to continue on the&#xD;
      methylphenidate based on your response to the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this study should end on either Day 15 or Day 36. However, if you&#xD;
      develop intolerable side effects (including fatigue) while on this study, the medication will&#xD;
      be stopped and you will be removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Methylphenidate has been approved by the FDA and is a&#xD;
      commercially available drug. It is FDA approved at this dose level. Its use in this study,&#xD;
      for this purpose, is investigational. About 212 patients will take part in this multicenter&#xD;
      study. About 142 patients will be enrolled at The University of Texas (UT) MD Anderson.&#xD;
