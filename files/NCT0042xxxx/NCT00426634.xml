  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether exposure to the increased levels of mold and other allergens&#xD;
      in New Orleans post-Hurricane Katrina affect symptoms in children with asthma. It will also&#xD;
      determine if having an asthma counselor (AC) can reduce a child s asthma symptoms in this&#xD;
      setting. An AC helps the families in the study obtain appropriate health care, medicines and&#xD;
      social services for their asthmatic child and instructs them about avoiding allergens and&#xD;
      ridding allergens from the home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children between 4 and 12 years of age living in Orleans Parish or surrounding areas impacted&#xD;
      by flooding who have moderate to severe asthma may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents provide a family medical history and information about the child s asthma symptoms,&#xD;
      medications and medical history. The children undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical examination and blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spirometry (for children 6 and older) or peak flow (for children under 6) test: For&#xD;
           spirometry, the child wears a nose clip and breathes into a mouthpiece attached to a&#xD;
           machine that measures how fast air moves out of the child s lungs. For the peak flow&#xD;
           meter test, the child blows into a plastic tube after taking a deep breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergy skin testing: 24 common allergens are applied to the arm by little pricks or&#xD;
           scratches and the skin is observed for reactions to the allergens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff visit the participants homes three times during the 1-year study to test for&#xD;
      moisture, mold and other allergens. After the first visit, families are randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of two groups. Group 1 participants attend two educational group sessions about asthma&#xD;
      and then three individual sessions. An AC visits the home one time during the study to&#xD;
      instruct the family on how to use supplies provided to reduce allergens in the home. Group 2&#xD;
      participants have an individual special teaching meeting with the AC at the end of the study.&#xD;
      After the meeting, the AC visits the home to instruct the family on use of the supplies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families are surveyed by phone every 3 months during the study to answer questions about the&#xD;
      child s asthma attacks, medicines used, doctor visits, school days, missed, or work days&#xD;
      missed to care for the child. At the end of the study, the child has a final medical&#xD;
      examination, blood test, and breathing test.&#xD;

      This document presents the protocol for conducting the Head-off Environmental Asthma in&#xD;
      Louisiana (HEAL) study in New Orleans, Louisiana. The goal of the HEAL study is to implement&#xD;
      and test an Asthma Counselor (AC) intervention program that addresses the multidimensional&#xD;
      impact of hurricane Katrina on children with asthma in New Orleans. HEAL is a prospective,&#xD;
      controlled trial in which children will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups.&#xD;
      Group 1 children will receive an AC intervention focused on case management, adherence to&#xD;
      medications and education on allergen avoidance. The responsibilities of the AC in this study&#xD;
      are enhanced relative to previous initiatives such as the National Cooperative Inner City&#xD;
      Asthma Study (NCICAS) AC intervention to also provide families with education aimed at&#xD;
      reducing mold, allergens, and moisture in their homes, and materials to aid this effort&#xD;
      (dehumidifiers and HEPA air filters). Since 90% of children with asthma in New Orleans are&#xD;
      sensitive to dust allergens, established allergen control measures will be incorporated into&#xD;
      the AC intervention as well. Group 2 children will receive a high quality standard of care&#xD;
      based on the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP)-NIH guidelines. An&#xD;
      abbreviated AC intervention will be provided to children in Group 2 at the conclusion of the&#xD;
      study. Both treatments will be administered over a 12-month period during which the children&#xD;
      in both groups will receive an extensive clinical evaluation (at baseline and 12-months) and&#xD;
      three environmental home evaluations (focused on moisture, mold and other allergens). In&#xD;
      addition to monitoring the effectiveness of the AC at environmental remediation education,&#xD;
      the environmental home evaluations will also allow some characterization of the relationships&#xD;
      between allergens, post-Katrina environmental exposures and asthma morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the enhanced AC intervention, a separate school based survey will be&#xD;
      administered to a sample population of children to examine asthma prevalence and assess&#xD;
      living conditions and stress levels that may have been influenced by hurricane Katrina. The&#xD;
      survey population will consist of a sample of the families of Orleans Parish school children&#xD;
      stratified by age, schools and geographic area of the Parish. The results of the survey, in&#xD;
      combination with the results of the AC intervention, will give us an overview of the extent&#xD;
      and severity of the asthma problem in post hurricane Katrina New Orleans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HEAL project is a collaborative multi-institutional research project conducted by the&#xD;
      Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine and the New Orleans&#xD;
      Department of Health. To support those efforts, Rho, Inc. will provide for coordination of&#xD;
      data and study activities.&#xD;
