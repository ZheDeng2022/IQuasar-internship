      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as fludeoxyglucose F 18 (^18FDG) positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET)/CT scans, may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and&#xD;
      help plan the best treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying ^18FDG PET/CT scans to see how well they predict&#xD;
      response in patients undergoing chemotherapy for stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether a metabolic response, defined as a 25% decrease in peak tumor&#xD;
           standardized uptake value (SUV) after the first course of chemotherapy, provides early&#xD;
           prediction of treatment outcome (tumor response and patient survival) in patients with&#xD;
           stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer undergoing platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the test-retest reproducibility of quantitative assessment of tumor&#xD;
           fludeoxyglucose F 18 (^18FDG) uptake in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the time course of treatment-induced changes in tumor ^18FDG uptake in these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine, in an exploratory analysis, changes in tumor volume during chemotherapy by&#xD;
           multislice CT scanning in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group I: Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 (^18FDG) positron emission tomography&#xD;
           (PET)/CT scanning twice and 1-2 volumetric CT scanning (1-7 days apart) before starting&#xD;
           treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients undergo additional ^18FDG PET/CT&#xD;
           scan and a volumetric CT scan once between the first and second course of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group II: Patients undergo ^18FDG PET/CT scan and volumetric CT scanning once before&#xD;
           starting treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients undergo additional ^18FDG&#xD;
           PET/CT scan and volumetric CT scanning once between the first and second course of&#xD;
           chemotherapy, and may undergo once between the second and third course of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group III: Patients undergo ^18FDG PET/CT scanning twice (up to 1 week apart) before&#xD;
           starting any treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In groups I and II, patients also undergo standard follow-up CT scanning every 6 weeks (i.e.,&#xD;
      every other chemotherapy course) for up to 18 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of chemotherapy, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 1 year.&#xD;
