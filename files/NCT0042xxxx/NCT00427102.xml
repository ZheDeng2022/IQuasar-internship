      Rationale for Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral mucositis is a major complication arising from contemporary chemoradiation treatment of&#xD;
      patients with head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No effective therapy exists to prevent this complication in this population. MRX-1024 is an&#xD;
      investigational agent that has demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo experiments to have the&#xD;
      potential to exert a protective effect in normal mucosa cells, without interfering with the&#xD;
      intended antitumor effect of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot Phase 1 study of MRX-1024 was conducted in India in patients with head and neck&#xD;
      cancer receiving radiation alone or radiation in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin.&#xD;
      MRX 1024 doses of 100 mgkg given orally twice a day, five days a week during radiation&#xD;
      treatment cycles, were well tolerated and appeared to exert a protective effect against the&#xD;
      development of severe mucositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twice daily doses of MRX 1024 impose a certain level of inconvenience to the patient, to&#xD;
      their clinic companion, and to the general work flow within radiation oncology clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to study the safety and pharmacokinetics of both single daily dose and&#xD;
      twice daily dose regimens of oral MRX 1024 given in conjunction with daily radiation&#xD;
      fractions and intermittent high-dose cisplatin to patients with high-risk for recurrence head&#xD;
      and neck cancer following surgical resection. The study will also document the incidence and&#xD;
      severity of oral mucositis that occurs following such therapy. The results will be&#xD;
      instrumental in determining the regimen of MRX 1024 to use in subsequent definitive clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;

      TREATMENT PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Phases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient progresses through five study phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRX 1024 Cohorts, Dose Levels and Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five successive dose levels are planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRX 1024 Combination Treatment Phase Cohort Combination Treatment Phase MRX 1024 Schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRX 1024 Dose Level once daily in cohorts 1, 2, and 3 twice daily in cohorts 4 and 5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Cohort Size 1 One daily dose given 30 minutes before each dose of RT 50 mg kg 3&#xD;
      patients 2 One daily dose given 30 minutes before each dose of RT 75 mg kg 3 patients 3 One&#xD;
      daily dose given 30 minutes before each dose of RT 100 mg kg 3 patients 4a Two daily doses:&#xD;
      one given 30 minutes before and one given 30 minutes after each dose of RT 75 mg kg 3&#xD;
      patients 5a Two daily doses: one given 30 minutes before and one given 30 minutes after each&#xD;
      dose of RT 100 mg kg 3 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the logistics of delivering radiation therapy, the two daily doses of MRX 1024&#xD;
      given to patients in cohorts 4 and 5 will be approximately 75 to 90 minutes apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure accurate and compliant dosing, MRX-1024 treatment must be administered in the&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning on Day 1 of Week 1 of the Combination Phase, patients will begin receiving MRX 1024&#xD;
      in conjunction with radiation and cisplatin or carboplatin, chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRX 1024 will be given prior to each day's radiation fraction, and again following each day's&#xD;
      radiation fraction for patients being treated in cohorts 4 and 5. If a scheduled radiation&#xD;
      treatment is not given, the MRX 1024 dose should not be given on that day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalations will occur in successive cohorts as indicated in Table 5 above, based on the&#xD;
      rules for dose level escalation as described in Table 6, below. Intra-patient dose escalation&#xD;
      is not permitted. No dose adjustments of MRX 1024 are permitted. If a patient experiences a&#xD;
      DLT that precludes further treatment with MRX 1024, MRX 1024 treatment will be discontinued.&#xD;
      That patient will continue on study, receive radiation therapy and cisplatin or carboplatin,&#xD;
      according to the protocol, and be followed on study through the Follow Up Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next higher dose level will be opened for enrollment after:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the preceding dose level has enrolled three patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. two of these patients have completed Days 1 through 42&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the third patient has completed four weeks of the Combination treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. none of these patients experiencing a dose limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If one patient being treated in an open dose level experiences a DLT during this interval,&#xD;
      then 3 more patients must be enrolled and all six patients in that dose level must be&#xD;
      followed for a minimum of the 42 day interval described above before a decision can be made&#xD;
      regarding further enrollment and escalation to the next higher cohort. If no additional&#xD;
      patient experiences a DLT in that cohort, then the next higher cohort will be opened for&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If greater than 2 patients in a cohort experience a DLT, then that cohort is considered to&#xD;
      have exceeded the maximum tolerable dose level. Three additional patients will then be&#xD;
      enrolled to the next lower cohort using that treatment schedule The objective of the dose&#xD;
      escalation scheme is to identify a safe, tolerable and potentially efficacious dose level&#xD;
      using the once daily dosing schedule and a potentially efficacious dose level using the twice&#xD;
      daily dosing schedule of MRX-1024 in which less than 1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Level Escalation Rules&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients in a cohort with DLTa at a Given Dose Level Escalation Dose Rule 0 out of&#xD;
      3. Enter 3 patients at the next higher dose level. If cohort 3 and or cohort 5 are completed&#xD;
      with 0 out of 3 patients experiencing a DLT, then enroll 3 additional patients to each&#xD;
      respective cohort. greater than 2 Dose escalation will be stopped. This dose will be declared&#xD;
      to have exceeded the maximum tolerable dose. Enroll 3 additional patients at the next lower&#xD;
      cohort using that MRX 1024 dosing schedule. If this occurs in cohort 1, 25 mg kg will be used&#xD;
      as the next lower dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 out of 3 Enter 3 more patients in this cohort at this dose level. If 0 of these 3&#xD;
      additional patients experience a DLT , then begin enrollment at the next higher cohort. If 1&#xD;
      or more of these 3 additional patients experience a DLT then dose escalation will be stopped.&#xD;
      This dose will be declared to have exceeded the maximum tolerable dose. Enroll 3 additional&#xD;
      patients at the next lower cohort using that MRX 1024 dosing schedule. If this occurs in&#xD;
      cohort 1, use 25 mg kg as the next lower dose level. Less than 1 out of 6 at the highest&#xD;
      tolerable dose level&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is generally the Recommended Dose for subsequent clinical trials. a See Section 4.5 for&#xD;
      the definition of Dose-Limiting Toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient does not complete the Combination Treatment Phase for any reason related to&#xD;
      intolerance of MRX 1024, this will constitute a DLT and the patient will not be replaced in&#xD;
      the study. If a patient does not complete the Combination Treatment Phase for any reason&#xD;
      unrelated to MRX 1024 and the patient did not experience a DLT, an additional patient will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. Data from the original patient will remain as part of the study&#xD;
      database but that patient's adverse event experience will not be used to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      of MRX 1024 at that dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the study has ended, an additional analysis of the safety data will be performed to&#xD;
      evaluate potential alternate dosing schemes. The doses used in the five dose levels described&#xD;
      above will be converted on an individual patient basis to approximate fixed doses and also to&#xD;
      mg body surface area dosing. Based on the additional analyses, a preferred dosing scheme will&#xD;
      be recommended for subsequent clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation therapy begins on Day 1 of Week 1 of the Combination Treatment Phase. Radiation&#xD;
      therapy will be administered using daily fractions of 2 Gy given Monday through Friday, five&#xD;
      consecutive days each week, followed by two days of no therapy. Radiotherapy will continue&#xD;
      weekly in this fashion until the total planned radiation dose of 60 to 66 Gy has been&#xD;
      delivered over a 6-week period. The toxicology studies of MRX-1024 were conducted exposing&#xD;
      animals for a maximum duration of 27 days. Therefore MRX 1024 can be administered only during&#xD;
      the first five weeks of radiation therapy . The sixth week of radiation therapy is not&#xD;
      accompanied by treatment with MRX 1024 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin or Carboplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin will be administered intravenously on Day 1 of Week 1, Day 1 of Week 4 , and on Day&#xD;
      1 of Week 7 using a dose of 100 mg per square meter of body-surface area for cisplatin and&#xD;
      AUC5 6 for carboplatin. On these days, the preferred sequence of treatments will be MRX 1024&#xD;
      Radiotherapy . This sequence should allow the MRX 1024 doses to be absorbed before the&#xD;
      patient potentially develops vomiting from the chemotherapy. See Section 4.6 for guidelines&#xD;
      regarding the use of antiemetics in conjunction with cisplatin or carboplatin dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin therapy will include pre- and post treatment hydration requirements according to&#xD;
      standard practices within the institution. An example of such hydration procedures follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to receiving cisplatin, each patient must receive vigorous hydration and diuresis. A&#xD;
      suggested regimen is pre-hydration with a 1 liter of D5NS over 2 to 4 hours and mannitol 12.5&#xD;
      g intravenously bolus immediately prior to cisplatin. Then cisplatin 100 mg m2 in 500 ml NS&#xD;
      is administered over 1 to 2 hours with an additional 1 to 1.5 liters of fluid given&#xD;
      post-hydration. The type, volume, and rate of fluid administration may vary based on the&#xD;
      patient's clinical status and ability to handle the hydration requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carboplatin therapy will also include the pre- and post-treatment hydration. For the regimen&#xD;
      that allows for 21 days recovery the AUC 5-6 dose will be used. The carboplatin dose will be&#xD;
      administered with 250 mL NS at 5 mg min mL over 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of cisplatin given on Day 1 of Weeks 4 and 7 is to be adjusted based on the&#xD;
      parameters shown below. Laboratory tests used to determine the adjusted cisplatin dose are to&#xD;
      be obtained within 3 days prior to the scheduled cisplatin dose. For carboplatin, dose&#xD;
      adjustments will be based on laboratory test results obtained within 7 days prior to&#xD;
      carboplatin dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absolute neutrophil count less than 1500 µl: Cisplatin should be held if the ANC less than&#xD;
      1500 µl. After the ANC recovers above this value, the cisplatin dose should be adjusted based&#xD;
      on the ANC nadir that was achieved following the preceding cisplatin dose, as shown in Table&#xD;
      7. If the ANC has not recovered within 14 days of when the third cisplatin dose is scheduled&#xD;
      , the patient should complete the final Follow-Up Visit without receiving the third dose of&#xD;
      cisplatin. For carboplatin, the adjustment will be made if the neutrophil count is less than&#xD;
      1300 mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet count less than 100,000 µl: Cisplatin and carboplatin should be held if the platelet&#xD;
      count is less than 100,000µl. After the platelet count recovers above this value, the&#xD;
      cisplatin dose should be adjusted based on the platelet count nadir that was achieved&#xD;
      following the preceding cisplatin dose, as shown in Table 7. If the platelet count has not&#xD;
      recovered within 14 days of when the third cisplatin dose is scheduled , the patient should&#xD;
      complete the final Follow Up Visit without receiving the third dose of cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin Dose Adjustment Based on Absolute Neutrophil Count and Platelet Count Nadirs&#xD;
      Following the Preceding Cisplatin Dose Nadir percentage of 100 Cisplatin Dose to Give.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal Toxicity: Cisplatin will not be given if the serum creatinine is greater than 1.6 mg&#xD;
      dL. Reduce the cisplatin dose for transient rises in serum creatinine as shown in Table 8.&#xD;
      Adjustments in the carboplatin dose or or delay in administration will occur if the serum&#xD;
      creatinine is greater than 2.0 mg dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver toxicity: An adjustment in dose or delay in administration will occur if the t. bili is&#xD;
      greater than 1.5 mg dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin Dose Adjustment Based on Highest Serum Creatinine Value Obtained Following the&#xD;
      Preceding Cisplatin Dose Serum Creatinine Peak (mg dL)percentage of 100 Cisplatin Dose to&#xD;
      Give.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients whose serum creatinine does not return to less than 1.6 mg dL by the scheduled&#xD;
      day of cisplatin treatment , carboplatin will be substituted and continued at 3 week&#xD;
      intervals in lieu of cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurotoxicity: Cisplatin should be discontinued if any of the following signs of&#xD;
      neurotoxicity occur following the first dose of cisplatin: Grade 3 hearing loss in the speech&#xD;
      frequency range, Grade 3 myopathy, Grade 3 weakness, Grade 3 neuropathy, seizure or paralysis&#xD;
      . If in the Investigator's opinion, said adverse events are related solely to cisplatin, they&#xD;
      would not qualify as DLTs. If in the Investigator's opinion, said adverse events may possibly&#xD;
      be related to co-administration of MRX 1024, they would qualify as DLTs.&#xD;
