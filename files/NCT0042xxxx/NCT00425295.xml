      The main purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of human simulation in the&#xD;
      training of the leadership, cognitive, and psychomotor skills required to lead medical crisis&#xD;
      management teams. All participants in the study are trainees in the University of Pittsburgh&#xD;
      Medical Center (UPMC) Multi-Disciplinary Critical Care Training Program (MCCTP.) All trainees&#xD;
      will have received the standard critical care medicine-training curriculum including basic&#xD;
      airway management, management of hypotension, unstable cardiac arrhythmias, difficult airway&#xD;
      management and crisis team training. The participants will have also completed six months of&#xD;
      baseline clinical training, which includes responding to medical emergencies at UPMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the effectiveness of Human Simulation Training (HST) as an educational tool&#xD;
           for teaching medical crisis management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effect of HST on objective measures of performance in the domains of&#xD;
           communication, leadership, cognition and psychomotor skills.&#xD;

      The use of Medical Emergency Teams (METS) for handling in-hospital medical crisis decreases&#xD;
      mortality and improves patient safety. Adverse in-hospital events occur in about 4-17% of&#xD;
      hospital admissions. Of these, 70% are thought to be preventable. The most serious adverse&#xD;
      in-hospital event is unexpected cardiac arrest which carries a mortality rate of 50-80% [1].&#xD;
      One approach to reducing this adverse event is the use of METS. Unlike traditional&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation teams, which respond to cardiac arrests, METS respond to&#xD;
      medical crises early on and aim to prevent the progression of problems into unstable&#xD;
      situations. The implementation of METS have been found to decrease the number of unexpected&#xD;
      cardiac arrests, intensive care unit transfers and in-hospital mortality [1]. Bellomo et al.&#xD;
      further found that the implementation of a MET not only decreases hospital mortality but also&#xD;
      decreases incidence of post-operative complications [2]. As an integral part of the MET, a&#xD;
      critical care physician must have the communication and leadership skills to effectively&#xD;
      manage the team, the cognitive skills to adequately assess/judge the situation and guide plan&#xD;
      of actions, and the psychomotor skills to perform necessary procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing methods for teaching medical crisis management are inadequate. The instruction of&#xD;
      medical trainees in the management of acute medical crisis is often done through didactic&#xD;
      teaching, problem based learning, and apprenticeship. It is not uncommon for a trainee's&#xD;
      first experience managing medical crisis to be on a real patient who is experiencing a real&#xD;
      medical crisis with significant consequences. This form of training is limited and clearly&#xD;
      sub-optimal for many reasons. Didactic training and problem based learning may be useful in&#xD;
      instilling medical knowledge but is often inadequate in teaching the communication skills and&#xD;
      critical thinking that is involved in managing medical crises. Further, the urgency and&#xD;
      complexity of medical crisis is not well understood without first-hand experience. In&#xD;
      general, although medical crises are relatively common, trainees get limited opportunities&#xD;
      for the repetition required to hone their management skills. Some medical crises, such as&#xD;
      respiratory distress with difficult airway, are extremely rare and will not often be&#xD;
      experienced by most trainees. Moreover, when they do occur, trainees may not have enough&#xD;
      supervision and hence do not receive appropriate feedback. Thirdly, clinical apprenticeship&#xD;
      does not provide for standardization of training and feedback for the trainees. Lastly, most&#xD;
      trainees are not allowed to view the consequences of the errors made while managing medical&#xD;
      crises as most supervisors will intervene to prevent patient injury or harm [3-6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      HST can be used as an educational tool for teaching medical crisis management. Simulation&#xD;
      training has been used in other fields, such as aviation and the military, to train people to&#xD;
      do complex tasks with potentially dangerous consequences [7-13]. A curriculum using HST may&#xD;
      be a useful at surpassing some of the limitations of traditional training noted above[14].&#xD;
      The full body human simulator such as Laerdal's Sim Man, can be programmed to present a wide&#xD;
      range of physiologic conditions and physical exam findings. Using this human simulator, a&#xD;
      wide variety of medical crises can be programmed to recreate real-life situations. The human&#xD;
      simulator also allows the re-creation of clinically important but rare situations. The human&#xD;
      simulator will also allow trainees to manage medical crises repetitively until a satisfactory&#xD;
      level of proficiency can be reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most importantly, HST allows trainees to repetitively experience dangerous situations and&#xD;
      practice their crisis management skills. Trainees can now benefit by seeing their management&#xD;
      errors run their course without placing patients at risk. HST allows for providing immediate&#xD;
      feedback. This technology is portable and hence allows for trainees from various institutions&#xD;
      within a particular region to have standardized training and feedback. The 1999 Institute of&#xD;
      Medicine Report, &quot;To Err is Human,&quot; challenged the medical community to confront the issue of&#xD;
      medical error. One innovative approach that was mentioned for performance improvement and&#xD;
      healthcare training was the use of human simulators [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human Simulators are a valuable and valid performance evaluation tool. Human simulators have&#xD;
      long been used in the field of medicine for evaluation. In particular, the field of&#xD;
      anesthesia has taken the lead in terms of using advanced full body simulators for resident&#xD;
      and physician training and evaluation. Instructors in the field of anesthesia have used human&#xD;
      simulators to re-create dangerous and complex intra-operative crises to help their trainees&#xD;
      acquire, test, and practice skills of crisis resource management without placing patients at&#xD;
      risk [16-18]. By using evaluation techniques such as videotaped review and checklists,&#xD;
      anesthesia instructors have been able to assess the behavioral and technical performances of&#xD;
      trainees[18-21].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of HST as a training tool in medical crisis management needs to be&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the success of human simulation as an educational tool for anesthesia crisis, HST is&#xD;
      now being used as a tool for training medical emergency teams for dealing with medical&#xD;
      crisis. Lighthall et al. has showed that HST can be used to teach crisis management to&#xD;
      internal medicine residents[22]. This study showed that the majority of participants felt&#xD;
      that simulator training had an educational value, but did not quantify their performance of&#xD;
      technical and non-technical skills. DeVita et al. looked at the effect of HST on improving&#xD;
      crisis team skills. This study found that repeated experience using the simulator with&#xD;
      immediate feedback improved team performance in terms of correctly completing the steps&#xD;
      necessary for patient/simulator survival[23]. There are no studies, which look at whether HST&#xD;
      improves crisis management skills in a randomized study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Significance The field of simulation education is highly evolved in other high-risk&#xD;
      industries such as aviation and nuclear power plants. Its time is coming in medical&#xD;
      education, particularly with the emerging emphasis on improved patient safety. Proven and&#xD;
      practical outcome based educational programs are needed to support the cultural changes&#xD;
      necessary to influence the changes in fields of education in clinically relevant domains such&#xD;
      as medical crisis resource management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical crisis management skills are essential to the function of METS. HST is a useful tool&#xD;
      that can safely re-create medical crises to teach and evaluate trainees in these skills.&#xD;
      Although HST has been widely studied in anesthesia crisis management, there are no studies&#xD;
      that look at the effect of HST on medical crisis management skills. We feel that this study&#xD;
      will help to determine what effect if any, HST has on the communication, leadership,&#xD;
      cognitive and psychomotor skill level needed to be effective at medical crisis management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants for this prospective, blinded, randomized cross over trial will be&#xD;
      consenting critical care trainees from the MCCTP at UPMC(Appendix 1 for consent forms). All&#xD;
      participants will have similar baseline education in basic airway management, management of&#xD;
      cardiovascular emergencies, and difficult airway management before testing occurs. Further,&#xD;
      each participant will have similar clinical experience as a critical care trainee&#xD;
      participating in METS at UPMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will undergo baseline testing using HST . Using 4 simulated clinical&#xD;
      scenarios using the human simulator will test each participant. Participants will then be&#xD;
      randomized into two groups. Control group (A) will receive no further training, while the&#xD;
      intervention group ( B) will receive HST curriculum for medical crisis management. The groups&#xD;
      will then be tested again after an interval of 1 month using 4 different simulated clinical&#xD;
      scenarios. The groups will then be crossed over. The original control group (A) will now&#xD;
      receive HST and the original intervention group ( B) will receive no further training. These&#xD;
      two groups will again be tested using a third new set of simulated clinical scenarios. This&#xD;
      study design is summarized in Appendix 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both testing and the intervention will occur at the Peter Winter Institute for Simulation,&#xD;
      Education and Research (WISER Center). All instructors and evaluators will be critical care&#xD;
      faculty or senior fellows who have undergone training at WISER and are familiar with&#xD;
      simulation teaching and evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four medical crisis scenarios used for testing are designed to represent the most common&#xD;
      medical crises experienced at UPMC. Each scenario will be programmed into the Laerdal SimMan&#xD;
      human simulator. The basic physiologic problem and expected responses will be the same for&#xD;
      all participants and all phases of testing; however, the scripted presentation will be varied&#xD;
      to prevent pattern recognition. Participant performance will be evaluated using a checklist&#xD;
      of expected actions as determined by the investigators. Each item will represent a&#xD;
      communication skill, cognitive skill or a psychomotor skill. A total score as well as domain&#xD;
      specific scores will be recorded at the end of each testing session for each participant.&#xD;
      Blinded evaluators will perform all evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention for this study will be a HST Curriculum. The curriculum will consist of two&#xD;
      parts. One is a didactic review of crisis management principles. The second part is a&#xD;
      simulation-based curriculum consisting of two scenarios. Each participant will undergo both&#xD;
      scenarios and receive immediate feedback regarding their communication, cognitive and&#xD;
      psychomotor performance.&#xD;
