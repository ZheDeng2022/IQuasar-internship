    <textblock>
      Patients who have stents placed in their coronary arteries require treatment with at least&#xD;
      two medications to prevent platelets from sticking to the stainless steel stent and forming a&#xD;
      blood clot that can result in a heart attack. The 2 anti-platelet medications used for most&#xD;
      patients with stents are aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix). These are usually prescribed for&#xD;
      1-12 months (the length of time depends on the number and types of stents implanted).&#xD;
      Although the typical long-term dose of clopidogrel is 75 mg by mouth once daily, a larger&#xD;
      dose (known as a loading dose) is usually given at the start of treatment to help the&#xD;
      medication take effect more quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to January 2006, most patients at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) who&#xD;
      were undergoing PCI and who had not already been taking clopidogrel would receive a loading&#xD;
      dose of 300-600 mg of clopidogrel in the cardiac catheterization procedure room immediately&#xD;
      after the angioplasty and stenting portion of the procedure. However, several recent studies&#xD;
      suggest that administering clopidogrel 600 mg at least two hours prior to an angioplasty&#xD;
      procedure can reduce the rate of complications afterwards (especially reducing the chances of&#xD;
      detectable damage to the heart muscle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to see whether giving a loading dose of clopidogrel 600 mg&#xD;
      to outpatients scheduled to undergo cardiac catheterization with coronary angiography can&#xD;
      decrease the risk of procedure-related complications during the 14 days following the cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization compared to a strategy of giving clopidogrel 600 mg after the procedure only&#xD;
      to those who undergo angioplasty. We will focus our attention particularly on detecting&#xD;
      damage to heart muscle following angioplasty (which might be expected to improve with a&#xD;
      loading dose of clopidogrel before the procedure) and on bleeding and other groin&#xD;
      complications (which might worsen with clopidogrel loading before the procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug clopidogrel has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in&#xD;
      patients with a recent or ongoing heart attack, narrowings in major blood vessels outside the&#xD;
      heart, or recent stroke with a loading dose of 300 mg followed by 75 mg once daily. It has&#xD;
      been used in several large studies with a loading dose of 600 mg without a significant&#xD;
      increase in major adverse effects. However, we do not yet know if it is useful or safe when&#xD;
      given as a loading dose of 600 mg before cardiac catheterization for outpatients with stable&#xD;
      symptoms and who are not thought to be in the midst of a heart attack.&#xD;

      SIGNIFICANCE AND BACKGROUND FOR THE STUDY The benefits of dual anti-platelet therapy with&#xD;
      full dose aspirin and a thienopyridine have been firmly established in patients undergoing&#xD;
      coronary stenting. Leon showed reduction in the combined end-point of death, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, target vessel revascularization and stent thrombosis from 3.5% with aspirin alone&#xD;
      to 2.3% with aspirin and ticlopidine. This benefit was associated, however, with an increased&#xD;
      rate of bleeding and vascular complications of 5.5% with aspirin+ticlopidine versus 1.8% with&#xD;
      aspirin alone. Multiple other studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      thienopyridine clopidogrel in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In patients at&#xD;
      intermediate risk (without elevation of troponin-T prior to PCI), pretreatment with&#xD;
      clopidogrel several hours before the procedure reduced the event rate and obviated the need&#xD;
      for additional glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibition (ISAR-REACT). In the Clopidogrel for&#xD;
      the Reduction of Events During Observation (CREDO) Study, investigators showed that the&#xD;
      benefit of pretreatment with 300 mg of clopidogrel was only seen when the pretreatment was&#xD;
      instituted at least 12 hours pre-procedure (optimally 24 hours before the PCI). However,&#xD;
      survival analysis in this study showed a cumulative event rate at 30 days of 8.3% in the&#xD;
      placebo arm, 7.8% in those administered clopidogrel within 15 hours of the procedure, and&#xD;
      3.5% in those administered clopidogrel more that 15 hours before the index PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the benefit of higher doses of clopidogrel was studied both ex vivo and in&#xD;
      clinical studies (PRONTO). A 600 mg dose of clopidogrel achieved adequate platelet inhibition&#xD;
      within 2 hours of administration, unlike 300 mg that required at least 3 to 6 hours to&#xD;
      achieve full effect Subsequent data from the ISAR-REACT investigators in 2,159 patients&#xD;
      showed that the benefit of 600 mg of clopidogrel was not time dependent. The trial focused on&#xD;
      the possible additional benefit of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition in these patients who had&#xD;
      all been pre-treated with 600 mg of clopidogrel. More recently, ISAR-REACT-2 showed that&#xD;
      clopidogrel pretreatment in moderate to high risk PCI patients reduced the combined endpoint&#xD;
      event rate (relative to placebo) from 11.7% to 5.7% in patients treated with glycoprotein&#xD;
      IIb/IIIa inhibitors and from 15.5% to 7.6% in those not receiving glycoprotein IIb/IIIa&#xD;
      inhibition. The recently published Assessment of the Best Loading Dose of Clopidogrel to&#xD;
      Blunt Platelet Activation, Inflammation and Ongoing Necrosis (ALBION) Trial showed in a low&#xD;
      risk group of patients that 600 mg and 900 mg doses of clopidogrel provide faster and greater&#xD;
      platelet inhibition than 300 mg as assessed by biochemical assays. The study was underpowered&#xD;
      to demonstrate clinical benefits, but it showed a trend towards reduction in troponin-I&#xD;
      release as a marker of necrosis from 58% to 42% in the higher dose clopidogrel groups. There&#xD;
      was no demonstrable increase in major bleeding complications (2.9% in both 300 and 900 mg&#xD;
      groups), but there was a statistically insignificant increase in minor bleeding in the 900 mg&#xD;
      dose group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our investigation will evaluate the safety and efficacy of pre-treatment (â‰¥2 hours) with 600&#xD;
      mg of clopidogrel in 600 outpatients undergoing elective cardiac catheterization with&#xD;
      coronary angiography in our institution who have no evidence of high risk features such as&#xD;
      ischemic ST segment deviations, unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction, or abnormal&#xD;
      troponin-T levels. The benefit of clopidogrel in patients who undergo interventions may be&#xD;
      offset by the bleeding complications encountered, especially in patients who do not undergo&#xD;
      coronary angioplasty. Our trial is designed to assess this potential benefit-risk trade-off.&#xD;
      Unlike the ALBION trial, we will focus on clinical outcomes using a larger sample size. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that pretreatment with 600 mg of clopidogrel will significantly reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of ischemic complications in patients undergoing PCI, but with possible increase in&#xD;
      hemorrhagic and vascular complications in the overall population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we will also examine whether the use of 5 French arterial sheaths in cases that&#xD;
      do not go onto intervention offsets the increase in bleeding risk, if any, associated with&#xD;
      pretreatment with 600 mg of clopidogrel. Very large diameter arterial sheaths (e.g., 10&#xD;
      French) have been associated with higher vascular complication rates, but whether 5 French&#xD;
      sheaths offer lower vascular complication rates than 6 French sheaths is uncertain. Nearly&#xD;
      all PCIs at our institution are performed using 6 French sheaths (which have larger lumens,&#xD;
      more accommodating of angioplasty equipment and higher injection rates of iodinated&#xD;
      contrast). Patients who undergo PCI following diagnostic angiography using a 5 French sheath&#xD;
      will require exchange for a larger 6 French arterial sheath. On the other hand, patients who&#xD;
      do not need angioplasty after coronary angiography will not require any exchange of their&#xD;
      arterial sheath, and those with smaller sheath sizes may well have less vascular and bleeding&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH PROTOCOL Design: This is a prospective randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      comparing ischemic, hemorrhagic and vascular outcomes in outpatients undergoing elective&#xD;
      cardiac catheterization with coronary angiography following 1:1 randomization to pretreatment&#xD;
      with 600 mg clopidogrel vs. no pretreatment (and clopidogrel dosing post-procedure if a PCI&#xD;
      is performed). Patients will provide written informed consent prior to enrollment and&#xD;
      randomization. Since some operators may feel strongly about using glycoprotein IIb/IIIa&#xD;
      inhibition in patients who did not receive clopidogrel well in advance of the PCI, blinding&#xD;
      of the loading strategy and use of a placebo are not feasible. A separate 1:1 randomization&#xD;
      will assign patients to undergo cardiac catheterization using 5 or 6 French arterial&#xD;
      introducing sheaths. Since the arterial sheath sizes are color-coded, catheter sizes are&#xD;
      imprinted on each catheter, and the operator must know the arterial sheath size in case&#xD;
      alternate catheters are required, blinding of sheath size assignment is also not feasible.&#xD;
      The investigator adjudicating and abstracting the outcomes data such as bleeding and ischemic&#xD;
      complications for analysis will be blinded, however, to the clopidogrel reimen and&#xD;
      randomization in order to avoid any bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses to be tested: The primary hypothesis being examined is that clopidogrel 600 mg&#xD;
      given â‰¥2 hours prior to cardiac catheterization will reduce the frequency of post-procedural&#xD;
      ischemic events in the subset of patients who undergo ad hoc coronary interventions compared&#xD;
      with those who do not receive clopidogrel pre-procedure. The risk of hemorrhagic and vascular&#xD;
      complications by preloading strategy will be evaluated in all patients randomized&#xD;
      (encompassing those who do and those who do not undergo PCI). Additional analyses will be&#xD;
      performed to see if the size of the initial arterial introducing sheath also has an effect on&#xD;
      the rate of hemorrhagic and vascular complications and if there is any interaction of sheath&#xD;
      size with preloading strategy on these outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population: All outpatients undergoing elective cardiac catheterization with planned&#xD;
      coronary angiography with possible ad hoc PCI (if lesion anatomy suitable) and who have not&#xD;
      received clopidogrel or ticlopidine during the 14 days prior to the procedure are eligible.&#xD;
      Patients with high-risk clinical features, contraindications to clopidogrel, or planned&#xD;
      upcoming invasive procedures will be excluded (vide infra).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedural factors: The decision to perform ad hoc PCI after diagnostic coronary angiography&#xD;
      (vs. medical therapy or bypass surgery) will be made by the interventional cardiologist&#xD;
      performing or overseeing the cardiac catheterization, in consultation with the patient's&#xD;
      clinical cardiologists. The specific angioplasty techniques, devices, equipment,&#xD;
      anti-thrombin and anti-platelet pharmacological regimen to be utilized are NOT specified by&#xD;
      this protocol and are at the discretion of the interventional cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to 5 French arterial sheaths and NO clopidogrel preloading will be&#xD;
      allowed to ambulate 2 hours after arterial hemostasis is achieved (with delayed ambulation if&#xD;
      bleeding or orthostatic hypotension occurs). All other participants (i.e., 6 French arterial&#xD;
      sheaths, or 5 French arterial sheaths with clopidogrel preloading) will be allowed to&#xD;
      ambulate no earlier than 4 hours after hemostasis occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables of interest include baseline demographic and clinical characteristics (including&#xD;
      age, gender, left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, chronic renal insufficiency, serum creatinine level, tobacco use, extent of&#xD;
      coronary disease, symptom severity, prior myocardial infarction, prior PCI, prior CABG),&#xD;
      angiographic lesion characteristics (e.g., bifurcation location, lesion class), procedural&#xD;
      factors (e.g., pharmacological antithrombin regimen, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor use),&#xD;
      and post-procedural tests (including serum creatinine, serum creatine kinase and its MB&#xD;
      isoform, troponin-T, and radiological imaging studies). Information will be gleaned from the&#xD;
      Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Quality Assurance Database, from electronic medical&#xD;
      records, from review of the procedural angiograms, and conversations with the patient (or if&#xD;
      the patient cannot be located, their family or health care providers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: All endpoints will be assessed at 14 days post-procedure (and divided for&#xD;
      analytical purposes into in-hospital and post-discharge events). See Endpoint section of this&#xD;
      document for details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Written and electronic medical records will be reviewed to identify clinical&#xD;
      events occurring during the hospitalization (through the 1st 14 days post-procedure if the&#xD;
      length of stay is prolonged). Participants will have provided written informed consent for&#xD;
      clinical follow-up at 14 days post-procedure prior to entry into this study, and contact&#xD;
      information for the patient, his/her primary care provider, his/her cardiologist, and his/her&#xD;
      next of kin will be collected before discharge. The patient, his/her physicians, or his/her&#xD;
      next of kin will be contacted by telephone at 14 or more days post-procedure and asked if the&#xD;
      patient was treated after discharge for any heart-related, bleeding, or vascular access site&#xD;
      problems (i.e., any of the clinical events detailed above). If yes, attempts will be made,&#xD;
      with the patient's authorization, to obtain more information about the event, including&#xD;
      requests for documentation from other health care facilities and providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Monitoring and Safety Plan: A independent data safety monitoring committee (DSMC)&#xD;
      comprised of Murray Mittleman, MD, DrPH (BIDMC cardiovascular epidemiologist, serving as&#xD;
      Chair), David J. Cohen, MD, MSc (interventional cardiologist at the Mid America Heart&#xD;
      Institute), and Shiva Gautam, PhD (BIDMC biostatistician) will review the rates of the 4&#xD;
      composite endpoints enumerated above after 14 day follow-up has been completed on the 1st 300&#xD;
      subjects enrolled. The DSMC will advise the principal investigator whether the study should&#xD;
      terminated because of concerning and striking differences in the ischemic or&#xD;
      vascular/bleeding complication rates between treatment strategies or if the study should be&#xD;
      allowed to continue to the planned enrollment of 600 participants. Study recruitment will be&#xD;
      suspended during the DSMC's review and deliberations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management: Much of the data required for this study is routinely collected as part of&#xD;
      current clinical care, quality assurance and regulatory processes and stored in the Cardiac&#xD;
      Catheterization Laboratory Quality Assurance Database (residing a commercial application&#xD;
      named Apollo and manufactured by Lumedx). The fields of interest for patients randomized in&#xD;
      this study will be queried form the Apollo database and transferred directly to the Access&#xD;
      database that serves as the primary electronic data repository for this study. This database&#xD;
      will be housed on a network server within the BIDMC firewall with restricted access (password&#xD;
      and valid user identification required). Additional information (from medical records or&#xD;
      patient contacts) will be collected on paper case report forms prior to entry into the Access&#xD;
      database. All case report forms and paper clinical information with patient identifiers will&#xD;
      be stored in a locked file drawer within a locked office. Angiograms will be reviewed using&#xD;
      clinical workstations in physically secured areas, and electronic copies of angiograms will&#xD;
      be made with all patient identifiers electronically removed. Medical record numbers and names&#xD;
      will be removed prior to creation of final analytical dataset. All paper and electronic&#xD;
      information will be destroyed in a HIPAA-compliant fashion after completion and publication&#xD;
      of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations Randomization: A randomization scheme will be prepared using&#xD;
      1:1:1:1 ratios (for the 2 clopidogrel dosing strategies combined independently with 5 vs. 6&#xD;
      French arterial sheaths) with permuted blocks of random sizes of 4 or 8. The treatment&#xD;
      assignment will be designated in opaque, tamper-resistant randomization envelopes provided by&#xD;
      the Statistical Department of the Harvard Clinical Research Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS for Windows v9.&#xD;
      The primary analysis will compare the cumulative incidence at 14 days of the primary&#xD;
      composite endpoint (any death, myocardial infarction, or myocardial necrosis) in patients&#xD;
      with PCI attempted between those randomized to clopidogrel loading vs. those randomized to&#xD;
      standard clopidogrel administration using the Fisher's exact test. A p value of 0.05 or less&#xD;
      will be required for statistical significance. The secondary endpoint of stent thrombosis&#xD;
      among those who undergo stent deployment will also be evaluated using Fisher's exact test.&#xD;
      The other endpoints (including vascular and bleeding) will be examined in all patients&#xD;
      randomized (and not just subsets who had PCI attempted or stents deployed). Two group&#xD;
      comparisons (clopidogrel loading vs. standard dosing; 5 French vs. 6 French arterial sheaths)&#xD;
      and 4 group comparisons (the 4 combinations of clopidogrel dosing strategy and arterial&#xD;
      sheath size; or subgroups with PCI or no PCI by clopidogrel dosing strategy) will be&#xD;
      performed using Fisher's exact test, t-tests, ANOVA, or analogous non-parametric tests as&#xD;
      appropriate. Since multiple exploratory analyses will be performed, p-values for everything&#xD;
      other than the primary analysis delineated above must be interpreted with caution. Logistical&#xD;
      regression models will also be constructed to identify pre-procedural predictors of ischemic&#xD;
      and of bleeding or vascular complications.&#xD;

          7. Woman of child-bearing potential who does not have a negative pregnancy test&#xD;
             immediately prior to the scheduled procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participation in another non-observational clinical study that has not yet completed&#xD;
             all mandatory follow-up (i.e., patients who are participating in a &quot;natural history&quot;&#xD;
             observational registry where no active therapy is being investigated may participate)&#xD;
