      The current study analyses the LV geometry of failing LVs measured by MRI scanning with&#xD;
      respect to systolic versus diastolic function. A new surgical method for remodelling enlarged&#xD;
      left ventricles is introduced.An apical remodelling stitch led to significant remodelling&#xD;
      which was accompanied by improvement in ventricular function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a common disease and remains a growing cause of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      worldwide. The poor prognosis of dietetic and medical treatment has led to Increasing&#xD;
      interest in interventional and surgical techniques for improvement of LV function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides heart transplantation surgical interventions in heart failure patients focussed on&#xD;
      mitral valve repair, biventricular stimulation and correction of coronary artery disease. A&#xD;
      partial ventriculectomy as a true remodelling procedure has been invented by Battista with&#xD;
      varying clinical results and reported high mortalities up to 20%. More commonly used is the&#xD;
      Dor procedure , which is applicable for anterior wall aneurysms and has excellent short and&#xD;
      long term results. On the other hand it has been designed for chronic aneurysms and is not&#xD;
      suitable for dilated cardiomyopathies or subacute infarctions. More recently medical devices&#xD;
      like the Acorn™ net or the Myosplint™ have been invented. Both require implantation of&#xD;
      significant foreign material and are combined with inherent disadvantages. The Acorn™ device&#xD;
      prevents progressive dilatation, but does not support systolic ventricular function, whereas&#xD;
      the Myospilnt™ creates a less spherical geometry but not a physiological shape of the left&#xD;
      ventricle (LV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed knowledge of the underlying geometrical changes in failing left ventricles is a&#xD;
      prerequisite to achieve improvement in function by surgery . It has been described that with&#xD;
      progressive heart failure, the oval form changes towards a more spherical geometry. To&#xD;
      classify the shape and amount of deformation, several indices have been defined . The&#xD;
      classical sphericity index (SI) as the ratio between the short and long axis is commonly used&#xD;
      and is able to predict volume increases e.g. after myocardial infarctions . Furthermore, it&#xD;
      has been used for evaluation of remodelling surgery and mitral valve repair in heart failure&#xD;
      patients . This index serves well for an overall judgement of the left ventricular geometry,&#xD;
      but does not pay attention to asymmetrical aspects of remodelling in heart failure, which is&#xD;
      present e.g. after myocardial infarctions. Especially the apex is not considered&#xD;
      sufficiently, although it can be reshaped ideally in procedures like the Dor operation .&#xD;
      Therefore a focus on this region of the left ventricle is desirable from a surgical point of&#xD;
      view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cine MRI scanning of the heart has gained increasing acceptance in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      ventricular geometry changes , as it is highly accurate in determining global myocardial&#xD;
      function without using ionising radiation or assumptions of ventricular shape , which are&#xD;
      major drawbacks of other imaging modalities such as nuclear ventriculography or&#xD;
      echocardiography , respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study analyses the LV geometry of failing LVs measured by MRI scanning with&#xD;
      respect to systolic versus diastolic function. A new surgical method for remodelling enlarged&#xD;
      left ventricles is introduced.&#xD;
