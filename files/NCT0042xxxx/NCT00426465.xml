      This study will explore the optimum training schedule for stroke patients to learn motor&#xD;
      skills. It will see if motor training is more effective when training sessions are&#xD;
      distributed over time (spaced training) or when the sessions are scheduled close together&#xD;
      (massed training). The results of this study may help researchers devise the best training&#xD;
      schedule for patients to derive the maximum benefit from rehabilitation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and people who have had a stroke may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Patients must be 3 months post-stroke. All participants must be right-handed and between 18&#xD;
      and 80 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants practice a pinch motor task and receive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).&#xD;
      Hand muscle activity is measured using surface electromyography (EMG). Pinch training&#xD;
      involves training the participant to pinch as strongly as possible, using a device that&#xD;
      records the force. For TMS, a wire coil is held on the subject s scalp. A brief electrical&#xD;
      current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The&#xD;
      subject hears a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. There may&#xD;
      be a twitch in the muscles of the face, arm or leg. For surface EMG, electrodes (small metal&#xD;
      disks) are filled with a conductive gel and taped to the skin over the muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following one practice session of pinch task training and TMS, participants have four&#xD;
      training sessions, which are scheduled 24 hours, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months after the&#xD;
      practice session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 4- to 5-hour practice session, subjects do the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform a single session of pinch motor task for familiarization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Undergo TMS to measure brain activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Practice five 6-minute blocks of pinch motor task with rest periods between sessions and&#xD;
           perform a calculation task (addition and subtraction tasks) during each rest period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Receive TMS over 15 minutes. (Some sessions may have sham TMS.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Read books and magazines during a 45-minute rest period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform a single block of the pinch motor task&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Undergo TMS to measure brain activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a questionnaire that measures attention, fatigue and mood&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the remaining four sessions, participants perform one practice block and TMS. Each&#xD;
      session lasts about 2 hours.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In cognitive psychology, practice is most effective when training sessions are distributed&#xD;
      over time (spaced), rather than when they are close to each other (massed). This phenomenon,&#xD;
      thought to engage long-term potentiation-like mechanisms in animal models and described as&#xD;
      spacing effect, has not been investigated in the motor domain. It is not known if spaced&#xD;
      motor training elicits longer lasting learning effects than massed motor training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective and Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this investigation is to assess the relevance of the spacing effect in motor&#xD;
      skill learning in healthy volunteers and in patients with chronic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 1: Determination of long term learning in healthy volunteers with spaced and&#xD;
      massed practice:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first hypothesis is that spaced practice will enhance long-lasting learning of a motor&#xD;
      task (defined as performance improvements measured 1 and 3 months post training) to a larger&#xD;
      extent than massed practice in separate groups of healthy volunteers. Healthy volunteers will&#xD;
      practice a well-characterized pinch force task following spaced or massed schedules in a&#xD;
      factorial design (n=26). If this hypothesis is proven correct, we will proceed as suggested&#xD;
      by PIRC, to Experiments 2 and 3, to gain information on the mechanisms underlying the&#xD;
      superior training strategy in healthy volunteers (Exp 2) and to determine if this training&#xD;
      strategy is also superior to massed practice in stroke patients (Exp 3), an issue of crucial&#xD;
      importance in neurorehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 2: Study of mechanisms underlying superior effects of spaced over massed practice&#xD;
      in healthy volunteers, rTMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous work demonstrated the involvement of the primary motor cortex (M1) in consolidation&#xD;
      of motor learning and the importance of top-down attentional control by the prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex. It is possible that an enhanced recruitment of these two regions mediates the&#xD;
      superior performance levels reached with spaced training. Here, we plan to study the effects&#xD;
      of inhibitory 1 Hz TMS applied to M1 and PFC on performance improvements with spaced&#xD;
      training. We hypothesize that the superiority of spaced practice, relative to massed&#xD;
      practice, will be cancelled by down regulation of activity in M1 and PFC but not by sham or&#xD;
      posterior parietal cortex (PPC) stimulation (n=104).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 3: Determination of long term learning in stroke patients with spaced and massed&#xD;
      practice:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that motor learning in chronic stroke patients will improve to a larger extent&#xD;
      with spaced than with massed practice (n=42).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is expected to delineate the role of the spacing effect on human motor learning&#xD;
      and identify two of the possible neural cortical substrates in healthy volunteers and its&#xD;
      possible beneficial effects on motor learning after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment 4: Determination of whether original findings with the spacing effect in explicit&#xD;
      motor learning generalized to implicit/procedural motor learning:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to generalize to implicit motor learning is important because implicit learning&#xD;
      (also known as procedural learning), which is defined as learning which occurs without&#xD;
      awareness and without intention, underlies the development of automaticity which&#xD;
      characterizes all well-learned motor skills (Reber, 1993; Squire, 2004). Hence, for the&#xD;
      purposes of stroke rehabilitation, it is important to determine if and how the spacing effect&#xD;
      occurs for implicit (procedural) learning which underlies the development of automaticity&#xD;
      that characterizes all well-learned motor skills. In addition, using explicit motor&#xD;
      sequencing tasks, it is difficult to determine if the spacing effect helps general motor&#xD;
      skill or sequence-specific skill. In other words, performance benefits from the spacing&#xD;
      effect can derive from improvements in the visuomotor transformation required to push the&#xD;
      keys on the board independently of the presence or absence of sequence, or from motor&#xD;
      sequencing improvements. Both of these issues can be addressed using the serial reaction time&#xD;
      task (or SRTT), a well-studied implicit motor sequence learning task which is described in&#xD;
      more detail in this protocol (Nissen and Bullemer, 1984).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the spacing effect occurs in a sequence-specific manner for implicit&#xD;
      motor sequence learning. We hypothesize that an SMA-based motor network underlies the&#xD;
      superiority of the spacing effect for implicit motor sequence learning. We will show this by&#xD;
      using 1Hz TMS to create virtual lesions and establish a cause-effect link between the SMA (or&#xD;
      M1 but not CZ or sham) and superior motor skill with Spaced over Massed training (n=80).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be improvement in pinch force. Secondary outcome&#xD;
      measurements will be measures of motor cortical excitability including motor evoked potential&#xD;
      amplitudes, intracortical inhibition and facilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For procedural/implicit motor sequence learning, the primary outcome measure will be an&#xD;
      improvement in skill as seen by a difference in reaction time between sequenced and randomly&#xD;
      ordered trials.&#xD;
