  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is study of LMC, phenylephrine, and placebo in subjects with SAR. There are three&#xD;
      visits: At Visit 1, subjects will be evaluated for participation and, if they qualify, will&#xD;
      attend Visit 2 for priming. At Visit 2, ragweed pollen will be fed continuously and dispensed&#xD;
      into the environmental exposure unit to induce an allergic reaction. Pollen counts will be&#xD;
      monitored and recorded. During the priming visit(s), subjects will be evaluated to determine&#xD;
      if they qualify. If qualified, they will return for Visit 3, where ragweed pollen will be fed&#xD;
      continuously and dispensed into the environmental exposure unit to induce an allergic&#xD;
      reaction. Pollen counts will be monitored and recorded as in the Priming Session. Subjects&#xD;
      will complete symptom evaluations and if qualified, they will receive study medication and&#xD;
      remain in the environmental exposure unit where symptoms will be evaluated for 8 hours after&#xD;
      dosing. PNIF will be evaluated only during the treatment session. Four nasal symptoms&#xD;
      (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sneezing, and nasal itching) and three non-nasal symptoms&#xD;
      (itching/burning eyes, tearing/watery eyes, and itching of ears/palate) will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Adverse events will be collected throughout the study to assess safety and tolerability, and&#xD;
      vital signs will be collected at Visit 1 and at the end of Visit 3.&#xD;

             diagnosed by the investigator, another physician, or subject-provided history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive skin prick test to ragweed allergen to be used in the EEU, unless previously&#xD;
             done within 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minimum scores (diary evaluation time) must be achieved during pollen exposure during&#xD;
