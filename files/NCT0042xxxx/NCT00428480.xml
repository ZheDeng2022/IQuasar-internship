    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the effects of reinforcement of walking&#xD;
      speed on recovery of walking speed over the course of inpatient rehabilitation for people&#xD;
      after stroke. The study will also examine the relationship between short distance walking&#xD;
      speed and walking distance over a fixed time.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-blind, randomized, multi-center trial design. People who are admitted&#xD;
      post-stroke for inpatient rehabilitation will be examined for eligibility by the treating&#xD;
      physician. Subjects who satisfy the selection criteria and who agree to participate will be&#xD;
      randomized to either the experimental group or the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive usual therapy during their inpatient rehabilitation stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the experimental group (Daily Reinforcement of Speed or DRS group) will receive&#xD;
      encouragement to walk faster with feedback on their performance every day for the duration of&#xD;
      their inpatient stay. During one of the daily therapy sessions (preferably morning), the&#xD;
      experimental subjects will be encouraged by their physical therapist to walk at least 10 m&#xD;
      (25 feet) along a straight hallway. Subjects in the experimental group will be timed with a&#xD;
      stopwatch by their treating physical therapist each day during the 10-meter walking task. If&#xD;
      a subject is not able to walk 10 meters, then a shorter distance is used until the 10-meter&#xD;
      distance can be achieved (if possible). Before starting the timed walk, the therapist will&#xD;
      remind the subject to &quot;walk as fast as safely possible&quot; and to try to walk the distance &quot;a&#xD;
      few seconds faster than what you were able to do in the past few days&quot;. The therapist can&#xD;
      provide the assistance of another person and use aids, and whatever is needed for safety. The&#xD;
      timed test should be stopped or not performed on any one day if this is best for patient&#xD;
      care. The subject's safety must not be compromised. At the end of the timed walk, the&#xD;
      therapist will provide the results for that day in a positive tone, such as &quot;Very good! You&#xD;
      walked that in xx seconds&quot;. Then, (a) 'This is better by x seconds', or (b) 'This shows you&#xD;
      are holding your own', or (c) 'I believe that you will soon be able to walk a bit faster with&#xD;
      a better walking pattern'.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are randomized to the control group (No Reinforcement of Speed or NRS group)&#xD;
      will not be timed during a daily 10-meter walk, nor specifically encouraged to walk faster&#xD;
      each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is walking speed, measured with a stopwatch over 15.2 m (50&#xD;
      feet).3 A blinded evaluator (i.e. a physical therapist or other trained person who is not&#xD;
      involved in the subject's treatment and does not work on the inpatient unit) will conduct all&#xD;
      assessments. The treating physical therapist will assist the subject during the gait speed&#xD;
      assessments as necessary. The subject will employ his or her usual assistive devices for that&#xD;
      stage of recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gait speed assessment will be conducted on a flat tiled surface along a walkway that is&#xD;
      not within sight of other patients. A chair will be placed at either end of the 15 m straight&#xD;
      walkway. The subject starts approximately 3 steps behind the start line to allow for&#xD;
      acceleration. The blinded assessor instructs the subject to &quot;walk as fast as you safely can&#xD;
      until I tell you to stop. If you have to sit or rest, tell me.&quot; When the subject's lead toe&#xD;
      crosses the line, timing begins. When the lead toe crosses the 15.2-meter (finish) line,&#xD;
      timing stop. The subject is told to stop walking once both feet cross the line. This ensures&#xD;
      that the subject does not decelerate until he or she has traversed the full 15.2 meters. Data&#xD;
      is recorded as time in seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At entry to the study, it is anticipated that some subjects may not be able to walk&#xD;
      continuously for 15 meters. In these cases, a timed 5-meter walk can be substituted at study&#xD;
      entry and designated so on the data entry form, and if still necessary, at discharge. If a&#xD;
      subject at study entry cannot walk 5 meters without stopping to rest or needs maximal&#xD;
      assistance, the test is marked &quot;unable&quot; on the data recording sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait speed measurements will be collected by the blinded evaluator at study entry (if&#xD;
      possible), at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after entry if still an inpatient, within one day of&#xD;
      inpatient discharge, and, if possible, 3 months and 6 months after study entry. The&#xD;
      Functional Ambulation Classification Index will be completed by the blinded evaluator after&#xD;
      each gait speed assessment. Thus, a FAC score will be recorded at the same time points as&#xD;
      each gait speed evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measure is distance walked in 3 minutes. The subject will be instructed&#xD;
      by the blinded assessor to walk as many laps of the walkway as possible in 3 minutes. A&#xD;
      straight 25-meter walkway will be used. The patient turns at each end and continues walking&#xD;
      for the 3 minutes. The distance covered in 3 minutes is measured in meters. The subject may&#xD;
      halt to rest at any time and continue walking when ready. If the subject must sit down to&#xD;
      rest, the test is discontinued and the time and distance are recorded. The 3-minute walking&#xD;
      test will be conducted at up to 4 time points: 4 weeks after entry if still an inpatient,&#xD;
      within 2 days of inpatient discharge, 3 months post study entry, and 6 months post study&#xD;
      entry. If the evaluator believes that the test was not an accurate reflection of the walking&#xD;
      distance (some interruption occurred or the subject stopped when distracted), the test can be&#xD;
      repeated and the best distance recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blinded observer should find an isolated and convenient place to perform the tests.&#xD;
      Before the trial begins, the observer should practice the timed walking speed and distance&#xD;
      test with 3 hemiparetic inpatients and their therapists for 4 repeated tests within 1-2 days&#xD;
      to try to obtain reproducible data. The walking speeds and distances should not differ by&#xD;
      more than 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive data and further assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will have data recorded by site and randomization number, not by name, birth&#xD;
      date or other identifying characteristics. In addition to the results from the gait speed and&#xD;
      walking distance assessments (collected and entered by the blinded evaluator), basic&#xD;
      descriptive information for each subject will also be collected in order to adequately&#xD;
      characterize the study population. This information will be obtained by the study physician&#xD;
      or designated person from the medical record and from interview with the subject or family.&#xD;
      The following information will be collected for each subject: age, gender, handedness; dates&#xD;
      of stroke onset, admission for rehabilitation, entry into the trial, and discharge from in&#xD;
      patient care; and (selected from a list) type of stroke, general location of stroke, and side&#xD;
      of hemiparesis. Severity of stroke at the time of entry into the study will be characterized&#xD;
      using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale,4-5 the modified Rankin Scale, and the&#xD;
      Functional Ambulation Classification Index, which are well accepted measures. The&#xD;
      investigators will also ask subjects to record the number of falls they had from discharge to&#xD;
      3 months and from 3 months to 6 months after entry using a calendar that they will bring with&#xD;
      them to each follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data entry&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data entry will be via a web-based system. The blinded observer will enter all&#xD;
      walking-related data and will be given a password to access the data entry site that differs&#xD;
      from the password and access by the study physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      For an anticipated effect size of 0.4, a conservative estimate using a two-tailed alpha of&#xD;
      0.01 and power of 0.9, we will need a sample size of 150 subjects in each group. An ideal&#xD;
      sample size for this varied population and for the primary and secondary outcomes will be 250&#xD;
      subjects in each arm to allow for dropouts and to gather enough subjects who are also tested&#xD;
      at 3 and 6 months study entry. This would make the trial the largest prospective&#xD;
      neurorehabilitation study ever attempted.&#xD;
