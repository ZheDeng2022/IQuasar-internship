  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Membranous glomerulopathy (MN) is a common immune-mediated glomerular disease and the leading&#xD;
      cause of nephrotic syndrome in Caucasian adults. 1 Because of its frequency, it remains the&#xD;
      second or third cause of end-stage renal disease caused by a primary glomerulonephritis. 2 At&#xD;
      presentation, 70% to 80% of patients have the nephrotic syndrome. 1, 3, 4 Proteinuria greater&#xD;
      than 2.0 grams per day is found in &gt; 80% of patients at presentation, with greater than 10&#xD;
      grams found in as many as 30%. 5 The disease affects patients of all ages, but it is most&#xD;
      often diagnosed in middle age with the peak incidence during the fourth and fifth decades of&#xD;
      life. There is close to a two-to-one predominance of males to females diagnosed with the&#xD;
      disease. Idiopathic MN affects all races. Current therapeutic options include corticosteroids&#xD;
      alone or in combination with alkylating agents, cyclosporin A, and mycophenolate mofetil. The&#xD;
      most widely recognized, and best-validated regimen is combination therapy with&#xD;
      corticosteroids and an alkylating agent, but its use is associated with significant adverse&#xD;
      effects. Recent meta-analysis confirmed that present day treatments are far from ideal 6&#xD;
      Thus, it should not come as a surprise that the outcome of MN has not substantially improved&#xD;
      over the past 30 years, and up to 40% of patients still progress to end-stage renal failure.&#xD;
      7 Like in other glomerular diseases the amount of protein in the urine correlates well with&#xD;
      long term prognosis. Thus, this parameter has been used in previous studies, and will be used&#xD;
      in this study, as the primary indicator of effectiveness of therapy. We proposed to do a&#xD;
      pilot study to test the hypothesis that selective B lymphocyte depletion will result in&#xD;
      disappearance of pathogenic antibodies and induction of remission of the nephrotic syndrome&#xD;
      in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy. Our population will be 10 adults. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted between our Nephrology Divisions at Mayo Clinic Rochester,&#xD;
      Jacksonville, and Scottsdale. We will enroll patients with a GFR 25 ml/min as estimated by&#xD;
      creatinine clearance and proteinuria &gt; 4g/24h, while receiving an ACEI or ARB and with BP&#xD;
      controlled of &lt; 130/80 mmHg. Patients will receive Rituximab 1g on Day 1 and 15. Patients&#xD;
      followed for 1 years following completion of treatment. The primary outcome will be change in&#xD;
      urinary protein excretion at 6 months. Secondary outcomes will be changes in serum albumin,&#xD;
      serum lipid?s profile, the number of partial remissions, time to remission, and incidence of&#xD;
      relapses. We will also perform a pharmacokinetic study to evaluate the effect of proteinuria&#xD;
      on the bio-availability and effects of the drug.&#xD;

      There is convincing evidence from both experimental and human studies that MN is mediated by&#xD;
      the deposition of IgG antibodies in the subepithelial aspect of the GBM. More debatable, is&#xD;
      the mechanism(s) of deposition of these antibodies in that location. Given the key role of&#xD;
      IgG antibodies in MN, it is reasonable to postulate that suppression of antibody production&#xD;
      by depleting B cells and/or plasma cells may improve or even resolve the glomerular pathology&#xD;
      as reflected by a reduction in proteinuria. There is evidence that this strategy is effective&#xD;
      in the treatment of other antibody-mediated diseases and preliminary studies in MN are&#xD;
      promising. Data from animal studies suggest that immune deposition resulting from B cell&#xD;
      activation promote injury to the glomerular filtering barrier and proteinuria.103 In humans,&#xD;
      as discussed above, there is evidence that therapy directed against B cells, e.g.&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, is effective in MN. Cyclophosphamide has striking direct effects on B cell&#xD;
      function, and suppresses the secretion of immunoglobulins.104 Thus, a case could be made for&#xD;
      using an agent capable of depleting B cells, and therefore halting the production of&#xD;
      nephrotoxic immunoglobulins. This approach could stop the pathogenic events at their initial&#xD;
      stages and potentially result in resolution of the pathological process. The rationale for&#xD;
      using such an approach can be further substantiated by the fact that Th2 pathway for antibody&#xD;
      response is activated and that inhibition of B cells and of pathogenic antibodies is strictly&#xD;
      associated with beneficial effects of immunosuppressive drugs in experimental MN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a open-label Phase I/II pilot study. Patients will receive Rituximab at a total dose&#xD;
      of 1g on Day 1 and Day 15 according to infusion guidelines. Patient experience complete&#xD;
      clinical response (as per response criteria outlined below), AND Patient subsequently&#xD;
      experiences clinical relapse, defined as return of proteinuria to 4 g/24h, and in whom CD20+&#xD;
      cell count have normalized, will receive a second course of Rituximab. Patients who relapse&#xD;
      but who remain B cell depleted will not be retreated.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients must meet the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for study entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Membranous Nephropathy with diagnostic biopsy performed within the last 3 years. Renal&#xD;
             biopsy slides and electron photomicrographs will be reviewed by study investigators,&#xD;
             and must confirm a diagnosis of MN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &amp;#61619; 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Proteinuria as measured via Uprot/UCr ratio &gt; 4.0 on a spot sample of a 24-hour urine&#xD;
             collection, despite ACE inhibitor / ARB treatment. The choice of urine&#xD;
             protein/creatinine ratios is in accord with recently developed National Kidney&#xD;
             Foundation Chronic Kidney Disease (NKF-CKD) guidelines.107 The NKF-CKD guidelines&#xD;
             advocate urine protein/creatinine ratios as the preferred method for evaluation of&#xD;
             urinary protein excretion in both adults and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients need to be treated with an ACEI and/or ARB, for at least 3 months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment with adequately controlled blood pressure (BP &lt;140/80 mm Hg in &gt;75% of the&#xD;
             readings).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must be post-menopausal, surgically sterile or practicing a medically approved&#xD;
             method of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with thromboembolic complications and/or clinical signs of NS that are not&#xD;
             controlled with conventional medical treatment will enter the immunosuppressive&#xD;
             portion of the protocol (Rituxan treatment) without the 3 months of ACE/ARB treatment&#xD;
             (high risk patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to give written informed consent and comply with the requirements of&#xD;
             the study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate renal function as indicated by estimated GFR &amp;#8805; 25 ml/min per 1.73m2&#xD;
             and/or or serum creatinine &lt;4.0 mg/dL in the presence of ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy.&#xD;
             The GFR will be estimated using the 4 variable MDRD equation as published in the&#xD;
             NKF-CKD guidelines. The same NKF-CKD guidelines also promote the use of estimated GFR&#xD;
             (GFRest) values rather than serum creatinine levels or creatinine clearance&#xD;
             measurements as the preferred non-invasive method of determining glomerular filtration&#xD;
             rates.107 We have opted to use this approach rather than the much more expensive and&#xD;
             more invasive techniques that employ clearance measurements of exogenous substances&#xD;
             (such as inulin or iothalamate) since the likelihood of detecting significant changes&#xD;
             in GFR in this short term study is remote - no matter which method is chosen. The&#xD;
             inclusion of and/or serum creatinine &lt;4.0 mg/dL is to cover possibility of incomplete&#xD;
             24-hour collection at time baseline creatinine clearance.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate liver function, as indicated by bilirubin, AST, and alkaline phosphatase&#xD;
             levels (up to &lt; 2.5 times the upper normal limit).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative serum pregnancy test (for women of child bearing age)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women of reproductive potential must agree to use an acceptable method of&#xD;
             birth control during treatment and for twelve months (1 year) after completion of&#xD;
             treatment or a period of 21 months for those undergoing retreatment.&#xD;
