  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Graves' Dysthyroid ophthalmopathy is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory&#xD;
      changes of the periocular and orbital region often in association with an underlying thyroid&#xD;
      abnormality. These changes can be extremely debilitating and may lead to visual loss.&#xD;
      Attempts at limiting or reversing the phenotypic expression of Graves' ophthalmopathy through&#xD;
      aggressive orbital decompression surgery or targeting the inflammatory disease, using high&#xD;
      dose systemic corticosteroids and/or orbital radiotherapy, have been limited to date by&#xD;
      treatment ineffectiveness and co-morbidities. Selective B-cell depletion therapy offers a&#xD;
      potential treatment alternative. This study is designed to treat patients with Graves'&#xD;
      disease with Rituximab in an attempt to prevent or reverse the physically deforming and&#xD;
      debilitating consequences of this disease.&#xD;
