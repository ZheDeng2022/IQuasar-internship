  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed study is to assess endothelial function and IMT, as correlates of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), in young adult Hodgkin's disease (HD) survivors, and to relate&#xD;
      endothelial function to other risk factors including obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia&#xD;
      and fasting glucose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disease free survival of Hodgkin's disease (HD) patients has improved dramatically over the&#xD;
      past few decades. With the dramatic advance in patient's survival, the prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of long-term adverse effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy has become a major&#xD;
      focus of interest. HD survivors have excess mortality compared with the age-matched general&#xD;
      population, even after excluding disease relapse. A considerable proportion of the excess&#xD;
      mortality is due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), principally ischemic heart disease and&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will assess endothelial function in HD survivors, using the non-invasive&#xD;
      technique of brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), by high-resolution&#xD;
      ultrasonography. We will also assess IMT. The results of these tests are independent&#xD;
      predictors of atherosclerosis disease progression and cardiovascular event rates. This is a&#xD;
      prospective study comprising 40 young-adult (aged 18-30 years) . The study will comprise 40&#xD;
      survivors of HD: 20 patients treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy to the chest and 20&#xD;
      patients treated with chemotherapy alone. The patients will be compared to age and&#xD;
      sex-matched patients from the data base of the endothelial function laboratory at the heart&#xD;
      institute of the Sheba Medical Center. In addition to brachial artery endothelial function&#xD;
      assessment, the patients will also undergo a physical examination including anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements (height, weight, waist and hip circumference), and blood pressure. The&#xD;
      evaluation will also include blood tests for glucose, lipid profile, CRP, AST, ALT and&#xD;
      insulin. A medical history including smoking history and family history of CVD and&#xD;
      dyslipidemia will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients treated with radiotherapy to the chest will be compared to patients treated with&#xD;
      chemotherapy alone and both patients will be compared to healthy controls. The patients will&#xD;
      be characterized by age, risk factors for coronary heart disease and endothelial function as&#xD;
      assessed by brachial artery FMD. We will establish the rate of endothelial function&#xD;
      abnormalities in survivors of HD and its correlation with the other risk factors.&#xD;
