  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the largest cause of death and disability in the world.&#xD;
      Besides medicines, the principle treatment of this condition requires opening of the narrowed&#xD;
      arteries, responsible for angina and other symptoms of the disease, by angioplasty or&#xD;
      surgery. Introduction of metal scaffolds called 'stents' in the past few decades&#xD;
      revolutionised the angioplasty technique, and has made it the most popular treatment today&#xD;
      for CAD. However these stents are prone to becomin narrow and obstructed after implanataion,&#xD;
      causing symptoms and non-fatal heart attacks in some patients. Introduction of stents that&#xD;
      slowly release drugs locally to minimize this process, called 'drug-eluting stents'(DES)he&#xD;
      past few years has been one of the biggest breakthroughs in the field of cardiology. However&#xD;
      ven the current available DES are still prone to narrowing in high-risk patients, like those&#xD;
      with diabetes, and also have a higher chance for sudden blockage by a blood clot even many&#xD;
      years later after insertion. Thus it is important to develop technology for more efficacious&#xD;
      and safer DES.This includes safer drugs, better stent design and delivery, and more inert&#xD;
      platforms for drug release We hypothesise that a new stent made with nanoporous particle with&#xD;
      better polymer for drug release will prove to be safer and more efficacious alternative to&#xD;
      currently available DES.&#xD;
