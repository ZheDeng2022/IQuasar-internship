  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine whether education provided in community pharmacies and monthly&#xD;
      reminder calls can improve compliance with asthma medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that those pediatric patients with asthma 12 months to 12 years of age who&#xD;
      receive comprehensive asthma care as part of a validated intervention (1) who are randomized&#xD;
      to receive enhanced community pharmacy care will have significantly greater compliance with&#xD;
      inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) six months after enrollment when compared with patients&#xD;
      receiving usual pharmacy care. As secondary outcomes, we further hypothesize that they will&#xD;
      have less unscheduled healthcare utilization and improved functional outcomes and QOL.&#xD;

      IMPACT DC has been funded by the National Association of Chain Drug Stores Foundation&#xD;
      (NACDSF) to undertake a project regarding coordination between the existing IMPACT DC Asthma&#xD;
      Clinic and certain community pharmacies in Northwest, Northeast, and Southeast DC that&#xD;
      provide patients with asthma medications, devices, and education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single blind prospective randomized clinical trial in which eligible patients with&#xD;
      asthma aged 12m to 12y, inclusive, seen in the current IMPACT DC Asthma Clinic and prescribed&#xD;
      ICS as controller medications is randomized to either &quot;usual pharmacy care&quot; or &quot;enhanced&#xD;
      pharmacy care.&quot; The IMPACT DC Asthma Clinic is an ED-based follow-up clinic that has been&#xD;
      shown to improve outcomes. (1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be assessed by blinded and structured patient phone interview at 1, 3, and 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to usual pharmacy care will fill prescriptions by their usual preferred&#xD;
      method, whereas patients randomized to enhanced pharmacy care will have these same&#xD;
      prescriptions electronically transmitted to specifically trained pharmacists at one of the&#xD;
      participating community pharmacies. Both &quot;usual pharmacy care&quot; and &quot;enhanced pharmacy care&quot;&#xD;
      will be provided within all participating pharmacy sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community pharmacies located in five zip codes in Northeast and Southeast DC with the highest&#xD;
      absolute numbers of pediatric ED asthma visits to hospital in the District (20019, 20020,&#xD;
      20032, 20002, 20011) will be selected for the program based on their geographic distribution&#xD;
      and ability to meet programmatic expectations. Pharmacies will receive electronically&#xD;
      transmitted, faxed or verbal prescriptions from the IMPACT DC Asthma Clinic staff for&#xD;
      patients identified as study participants in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacists will then provide real-time, targeted education around the purpose and use of the&#xD;
      new and refilled ICS medications to study participants and their families at each point of&#xD;
      contact, including rationale for their use, device teaching, dosage review, and importance of&#xD;
      compliance. Families randomized to &quot;enhanced care&quot; will also be contacted monthly by phone&#xD;
      and mail with reminders to fill their controller medications prescriptions and to seek&#xD;
      ongoing longitudinal asthma care with their primary care providers.&#xD;
