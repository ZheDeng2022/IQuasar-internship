        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female subjects/patients from 18-60 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) must be within the range of 18 and 30 kg/mÂ². Subjects/patients&#xD;
             must weigh a minimum of 50 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects/patients must either have been surgically sterilized or&#xD;
             hysterectomized at least 6 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject/patient must be able to provide written informed consent prior to study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values at the screening evaluation or at&#xD;
             the baseline re-evaluation, for patients excluding those normally associated with&#xD;
             severe degree of renal impairment or the primary cause of renal insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any over-the-counter medications or herbal / natural supplements during 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to dosing. (acetaminophen is acceptable, but must be documented in the&#xD;
             Concomitant Medications / Non-Drug Therapies page of the CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in any clinical investigation within 4 weeks prior to dosing or longer&#xD;
             if required by local regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donation or loss of 400 mL or more of blood within 8 weeks prior to dosing or other&#xD;
             amount considered to compromise the health of the subject/patient if previous history&#xD;
             of anemia exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant acute illness within the two weeks prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any significant cardiovascular events (M.I., angioplasty, angina) within 6&#xD;
             months of study start.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A past medical history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities or a family history&#xD;
             of a prolonged QT-interval syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hyponatremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the&#xD;
             absorption,distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs other than renal impairment&#xD;
             or which may jeopardize the subject/patient in case of participation in the study. The&#xD;
             investigator should be guided by history of any of the following: inflammatory bowel&#xD;
             syndrome, gastritis, ulcers, gastrointestinal or rectal bleeding gastropathy&#xD;
             (gastroparesis) or enteropathy major gastrointestinal tract surgery such as&#xD;
             gastrectomy, gastroenterostomy, or bowel resection clinical evidence of pancreatic&#xD;
             injury or pancreatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of immunocompromise, including a positive HIV (ELISA and Western blot) test&#xD;
             result.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C test result .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within the 6 months prior to dosing or evidence of&#xD;
             such abuse as indicated by the laboratory assays conducted during the screening or&#xD;
             baseline evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply&#xD;
