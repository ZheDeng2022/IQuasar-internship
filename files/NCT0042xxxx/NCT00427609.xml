      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy for Bicillin L-A, administered&#xD;
      intramuscularly in a dose of 2.4 million units every three (3) weeks, for the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic, plaque-type psoriasis unresponsive to topical medications or when other systemic&#xD;
      therapies are contraindicated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disorder most commonly manifested by&#xD;
      well-demarcated, erythematous and/or scaling plaques on the elbows, knees, scalp, and trunk.&#xD;
      Psoriasis is a common disease with overall incidence of 1-3% of the general population. The&#xD;
      estimated prevalence varies from 1-2%. There is significant geographical variability with the&#xD;
      lowest incidence of the disease around the equator and increasing towards the poles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psoriasis is now considered an autoimmune disease mediated by activated T-cells, releasing&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines, predominately TNF-a and IFN-y. The key role for T-cells in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of psoriasis was supported by reported beneficial effects of specific T cell&#xD;
      targeted therapies including cyclosporin A and certain recently marketed immune response&#xD;
      modifiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While disease pathogenesis is still not completely understood, the factors that may trigger&#xD;
      or worsen psoriasis have been systematically studied and well described in the medical&#xD;
      literature. Psychological stress, mechanical trauma to the skin, certain medications and&#xD;
      Streptococcus strains are the most common disease triggers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was first reported in 1916 that the onset of psoriasis is often preceded by throat&#xD;
      infections with hemolytic streptococci and the role of M-protein positive beta hemolytic&#xD;
      streptococci in triggering guttate psoriasis has been confirmed in subsequent studies.&#xD;
      Exacerbation of chronic plaque type psoriasis has been reported in association with&#xD;
      tonsillitis in retrospective studies. Moreover, high frequency of remission after&#xD;
      tonsillectomy or antibiotic treatment has been documented.&#xD;
