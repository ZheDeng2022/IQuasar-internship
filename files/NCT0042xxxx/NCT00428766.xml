  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the safest dose of MORAb-003 in subjects with&#xD;
      advanced ovarian cancer. MORAb-003 is an antibody directed to an antigen on the surface of&#xD;
      ovarian cancer cells.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Female subjects, ≥18 years of age, with a histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian,&#xD;
             fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma, with or without elevation of CA&#xD;
             125, confirmed at the Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject must have disease, as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
             (RECIST) or evaluable by clinical signs/symptoms (e.g., ascites, pleural effusion, or&#xD;
             lesions of less than 2 cm) supported by CA-125, radiologic, or pathologic studies&#xD;
             conducted within 4 weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject must have failed at least a standard (platinum-containing) chemotherapy&#xD;
             regimen and be considered platinum refractory or resistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Life expectancy ≥3 months, as estimated by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Karnofsky performance status ≥70%.&#xD;

             infarction within 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ECG demonstrating clinically significant arrhythmias (Note: Subjects with chronic&#xD;
             atrial arrhythmia, i.e., atrial fibrillation or paroxysmal SVT, are eligible).&#xD;
