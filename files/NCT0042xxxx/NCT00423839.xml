  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study Design: The study is a non-randomized clinical trial. Twelve volunteers will be&#xD;
      recruited. They would be given 5x107 pfu of the MVA85A vaccine intradermally. The subjects&#xD;
      will be required to stay in the unit for an hour after the vaccination. Local and systemic&#xD;
      adverse events would be recorded. Blood samples will be taken at the screening visit, day of&#xD;
      immunisation, 1 week after the vaccination, then at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks after the&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of the study will be carefully discussed with the subjects and informed consent&#xD;
      approved by the combined MRC/Gambian government ethics committee prior to any study-related&#xD;
      evaluations being performed. The subjects that agree to enroll and have signed consent&#xD;
      documentation will be assessed at the AFTBVAC clinic at MRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited at the MRC AFTBVAC clinic. Subjects will be screened in the eight&#xD;
      weeks prior to entering the study. The screen will consist of checking subject eligibility&#xD;
      and a full physical examination. The following will be carried out: height, weight, vital&#xD;
      signs, haematology (haemoglobin, packed cell volume, white cell counts, platelets, blood film&#xD;
      for malaria parasites), serum chemistry (electrolytes and creatinine, liver enzymes, serum&#xD;
      bilirubin and proteins), Mantoux test, ELISPOT, Chest X-ray, anti-vaccinia antibodies,&#xD;
      anti-HBV antibodies, , anti-HIV antibodies, urinalysis. All chest X-rays will be reviewed by&#xD;
      two clinicians to confirm no radiological sign of Tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations during study: Scheduled follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccination Day 0: after a pysician has confirmed that the volunteers are ESAT-6 and CFP-10&#xD;
      nagative. The following assessments will be performed pre-dosing: vital signs (20 minutes&#xD;
      pre-dose) and blood samples collected for heamatology (haemoglobin, packed cell volume, white&#xD;
      cell counts, platelets, blood film for malaria parasites), serum chemistry (electrolytes and&#xD;
      creatinine, liver enzymes, serum bilirubin and proteins) and immunological assays. Provided&#xD;
      vital signs are is satisfactory, subjects will receive the first vaccination. Subjects will&#xD;
      have a dressing applied over the injection site, which will remain for at least one hour&#xD;
      after the vaccination. Post vaccination vital signs will be taken at 30 and 60 minutes. Any&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs) noted by the study personnel or described by the volunteer will be&#xD;
      documented. Concomitant medication given will be documented. The volunteer will remain at the&#xD;
      clinical area for one hour following vaccination and will then be allowed to return home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 and 2: On the first and second day after vaccination subjects will be visited at home&#xD;
      by a field worker or they will return to the clinical area. The injection site will be&#xD;
      examined and the subjects will be questioned for AEs and use of any concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 7: Subjects will be visited at home by a field worker or they will return to the clinical&#xD;
      area. Vital sign assessments will be performed. Blood samples will be taken for&#xD;
      haematology(haemoglobin, packed cell volume, white cell counts, platelets, blood film for&#xD;
      malaria parasites), serum chemistry (electrolytes and creatinine, liver enzymes, serum&#xD;
      bilirubin and proteins) and immunological assays. The injection site will be examined and the&#xD;
      subjects will be questioned for AEs and concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At day 14, 28, 56, 84 and 189, subjects will return to the clinical area. Vital sign&#xD;
      assessments will be performed. Blood samples will be taken prior to dosing for haematology&#xD;
      (haemoglobin, packed cell volume, white cell counts, platelets, blood film for malaria&#xD;
      parasites), serum chemistry (electrolytes and creatinine, liver enzymes, serum bilirubin and&#xD;
      proteins) and immunological assays. The injection site will be examined and the subjects will&#xD;
      be questioned for AEs and concomitant medications. Day 22 and 23: On the first and second day&#xD;
      after vaccination a field worker will visit subjects at home or they will return to the&#xD;
      clinical area. The injection site will be examined and the subjects will be questioned for&#xD;
      AEs and concomitant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post study Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injection site will be examined and the subjects asked about AEs. It is possible that&#xD;
      they will be asked in the future to provide samples for genetic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING AND ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING&#xD;
&#xD;
      Records to be kept and a regulatory folder will contain:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCC document Project Management plan Protocol with appendices Letter of ethical approval&#xD;
      Information sheets and blank forms Signed consent forms for each subject&#xD;
&#xD;
      All filled in paper forms will be filed. Individual medical records will be filed together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data on the Case Report Forms (CRF) must be legibly recorded in blue or black ink or&#xD;
      typed. A correction should be made by striking through the incorrect entry with a single line&#xD;
      and entering the correct information adjacent to it. The correction must be initialed and&#xD;
      dated by the investigator or a designated, qualified individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any requested information that is not obtained as specified in the protocol should have an&#xD;
      explanation noted on the CRF as to why the required information was not obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of Data Management&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Data manager will be responsible for receiving, entering, querying, analysing, and&#xD;
      storing the data which accrues from the study. He will be responsible for linking the&#xD;
      epidemiological and clinical data from the field and the clinic with the laboratory data from&#xD;
      the immunology, microbiology, haematology and genetics laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events (AE) Reporting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events, however minor, will be recorded as observed by the Investigators or as&#xD;
      volunteered by the subject. Full details will be documented in the CRF whether or not the&#xD;
      Investigator or his deputies consider the event to be related to the trial substance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Events (SAE) Reporting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse events (SAEs) that occur during the study or within six months of the final&#xD;
      vaccination will be notified immediately (within 24 hours) by telephone to the Safety&#xD;
      Monitor, Ethics Committee, collaborators and funding agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious adverse event are defined as an event that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in death;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is life-threatening (i.e., the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  requires or prolongs in-patient hospitalization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is a cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proven malaria events will not be included as an SAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimum details to be given in a telephone report are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Name of reporting doctor and contact telephone number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nature of adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject details (number, initials, sex, date of birth, weight and age).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date and time of event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date and time of MVA85A administration and dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other drug history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other relevant history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Causality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The event will be documented on the SAE page of the CRF and reported to the Safety Monitor,&#xD;
      Ethics Committee, Collaborators and funding agency as appropriate. Other adverse events will&#xD;
      be graded. After the ethics committee's response to the SAE is received, the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator, Clinical Monitor and available co-investigators will meet to determine the&#xD;
      future plan for the study, which could involve amending the protocol, discontinuing the&#xD;
      vaccinations, or continuing unchanged for the other volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Design Issues&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 12 subjects will be sufficient to provide descriptive data. As some of the&#xD;
      subjects may drop out of the study, 12 subjects. However, only 10 individuals will be given&#xD;
      the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes of interest&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of the Vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be determined by the degree and number of adverse events reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity of this vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the vaccine will stimulate T cell responses, which will be measured by&#xD;
      interferon -gamma Elispot assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Accrual&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formal sample sizing calculations have not been performed but it is believed that the sample&#xD;
      size of 10 subjects will be sufficient for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No attempt will be made in the study to conceal the allocation group of the subjects either&#xD;
      from the subjects themselves, the investigators or laboratory personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data manager will be responsible for monitoring the trial. This will include confirming&#xD;
      the existence of the appropriate documents in the regulatory folder and of source documents&#xD;
      for all entered data. He would also assess the consistency of data. The data manager will be&#xD;
      responsible for data entry and for initial analysis of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main analyses will be descriptive and comparative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HUMAN SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review and Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been approved by the joint MRC/ Gambia government ethical committee. Written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained from the subject (or parent, legal guardian, or person with&#xD;
      power of attorney for subjects who cannot consent for themselves, such as, those below the&#xD;
      legal age). The subject's assent must also be obtained if he or she is able to understand the&#xD;
      nature, significance and risks associated with the study. The informed consent will describe&#xD;
      the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and the risks and benefits of&#xD;
      participation. A signed copy of the consent form will be given to the subject (or parent or&#xD;
      legal guardian).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      All records will be kept in a secure place. All data on computer files will have restricted&#xD;
      access. Clinical information will not be released without written permission of the subject,&#xD;
      except as necessary for monitoring.&#xD;
