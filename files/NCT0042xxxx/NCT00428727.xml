    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus constitutes one of the most important public health problems due to its&#xD;
      high prevalence and enormous social and economic consequences. Diabetic foot ulcers are one&#xD;
      of the chronic complications of diabetes mellitus and constitute the most important cause of&#xD;
      non-traumatic amputation of inferior limbs. It is estimated that 15% of diabetic population&#xD;
      will develop an ulcer sometime in their life. Although novel therapies have been proposed,&#xD;
      there is no effective treatment for this pathology. Naturally produced nitric oxide&#xD;
      participates in the wound healing process by stimulating the synthesis of collagen,&#xD;
      triggering the release of chemotactic cytokines, increasing blood vessels permeability,&#xD;
      promoting angiogenic activity, stimulating the release of epidermal growth factors, and by&#xD;
      interfering with the bacterial mitochondrial respiratory chain. Topically administered nitric&#xD;
      oxide has demonstrated to be effective and safe for the treatment of chronic ulcers secondary&#xD;
      to cutaneous leishmaniasis. However, due to their unstable nitric oxide release, the topical&#xD;
      donors needed to be applied frequently, diminishing the adherence to the treatment. This&#xD;
      difficulty has led to the development of a multilayer polymeric transdermal patch produced by&#xD;
      electrospinning technique that guarantees a constant nitric oxide release. The main objective&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this novel nitric oxide&#xD;
      releasing wound dressing for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, including 100 diabetic patients was&#xD;
      designed. At the time of enrollment, a complete medical evaluation and laboratory tests will&#xD;
      be performed, and those patients who meet the inclusion criteria randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      two groups. During 90 days group 1 will receive active patches and group 2 placebo patches.&#xD;
      The patients will be seen by the research group at least every two weeks until the healing of&#xD;
      the ulcer or the end of the treatment. During each visit the healing process of the ulcer,&#xD;
      the patient's health status and the presence of adverse events will be assessed. Should the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the patches be demonstrated an alternative treatment would then be available&#xD;
      to patients.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM) constitutes one of the most important public health problems with a&#xD;
      worldwide impact due to its high prevalence and enormous social and economic consequences. It&#xD;
      is believed that there are more than 135 million diabetics, and this number is expected to&#xD;
      increase to 300 million in the next 25 years (30% in developed and 70% in developing&#xD;
      countries) [1;2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      This epidemic is related to several factors like ethnicity, the longer life expectancy, and&#xD;
      the epidemiological and nutritional transition in developing countries due to the&#xD;
      urbanization process that brings about obesity and sedentarism [3;4]. In Colombia, the 2002&#xD;
      basic health indicators showed a 2% prevalence of DM. However, it is believed that these&#xD;
      numbers are underestimated [5]. Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) are one of the chronic&#xD;
      consequences of DM which constitute the most important cause of non-traumatic amputation of&#xD;
      the Inferior Limbs (IL), and are associated with high human, social and economic costs&#xD;
      [6-11]. It is estimated that approximately 15% of the diabetic population will develop a DFU&#xD;
      some time in their life [12-16].&#xD;
&#xD;
      DFU is a consequence of two of the most frequent chronic complications of DM: Peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy and vascular insufficiency [12]. The combination of these factors in association&#xD;
      with mechanic extrinsic and intrinsic aggressions, like feet bone deformations, triggers the&#xD;
      ulcer formation. This polyfactorial etiopathology explains the multidisciplinary approach&#xD;
      required for this disease [17-19].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The early detection of risk factors for DFU may prevent their appearance [20-28]. This is why&#xD;
      the monitoring of neuropathic, vascular and muscle-skeletal functions [29], the reinforcement&#xD;
      of self care [30], the control of glycemic levels and the prevention of traumatic foot&#xD;
      lesions [31-34], have a positive impact on the prevention of this pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wound healing process involves the interaction of multiple cellular groups, extra&#xD;
      cellular matrix molecules and growth factors [35], and is affected by vascular insufficiency,&#xD;
      the severity of the lesion and the presence of infection [18;36].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune and wound healing mechanism dysfunctions have been described in diabetic patients&#xD;
      [37]. This alteration of the immune response is characterized by a decrease in the adherence&#xD;
      of leukocytes to the capillary endothelium, chemotaxis damage and a reduction in the ability&#xD;
      of polymorphonuclear cells to phagocyte and destroy bacteria due to a minor production of&#xD;
      Nitric Oxide (NO) [38;39]. Diabetic patients also show a diminution in fibroblasts activity&#xD;
      provoked by the unavailability of glucose for the aerobic metabolism, leading to inadequate&#xD;
      fibrous collagen tissue proliferation [40]. The imbalance in these processes has been&#xD;
      described as the main cause for the appearance and persistence of DFU [41].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative therapies for DFU have been proposed, such as tissue engineering, growth factors,&#xD;
      hyperbaric oxygen therapy [42;43] and ketanserine [44;45]. Various types of products have&#xD;
      also been used to keep the wound dry and covered (hydrogels, hydrocolloids, alginates and&#xD;
      foams [46], however, there is no effective treatment for this pathology [47;48].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In normal conditions, NO is continuously produced [49] and is tightly linked to many&#xD;
      physiological processes, among which wound healing. It has been described that NO stimulates&#xD;
      collagen synthesis [50], triggers the release of chemotactic cytokines [51], and has an&#xD;
      important microbicidal effect by interfering with the enzymatic processes of the bacterial&#xD;
      mitochondrial respiratory chain [52]. It also increases blood vessels permeability [53-56],&#xD;
      promotes angiogenic activity, and stimulates the release of epidermal growth factors [57;58].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various studies , performed in murine models, have demonstrated the role of NO in the healing&#xD;
      process. The levels of the final metabolic products from NO (nitrite and nitrate) rise during&#xD;
      the first two days more than subsequently in the liquid recovered from the sponges previously&#xD;
      placed in the subcutaneous tissue of healthy subjects' wounds [59], increase that is not&#xD;
      observed in diabetic subjects [60], suggesting an impairment in the cutaneous production of&#xD;
      NO in diabetic individuals. The topical use of NO accelerates the wound healing process of&#xD;
      excisional wounds while NO inhibitors increase the healing time of these lesions [61;62]. The&#xD;
      use of colloid NO donors in diabetic subjects shows an adequate granulation and closing of&#xD;
      wounds [63;64].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our experience in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis with&#xD;
      s-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), a NO donor, shows a beneficial effect without adverse&#xD;
      events [65]. Moreover, a clinical trial is being conducted to study the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      controlled NO releasing patch in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis [66]. Currently,&#xD;
      there are no studies using topical NO donors in humans with diabetic ulcers. Though the use&#xD;
      of NO donors in healthy volunteers has shown an adequate NO diffusion rate to dermis, and an&#xD;
      increase in the microcapillar blood flow [67], this method has demonstrated not to be&#xD;
      effective due to the short half life and release span of NO [68].&#xD;
&#xD;
      This difficulty in controlling the stability and release of NO has led to the development of&#xD;
      a new NO releasing patch (NOP). This device, produced by the electrospinning technique [69],&#xD;
      is a multilayer polymeric transdermal patch in which the principal components are stabilized&#xD;
      and encapsulated in nanofibers which guarantees a constant NO release upon its hydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since it is well known that the system generates NO almost immediately, nitrite ions are&#xD;
      bound to an ionic exchange resin (DOWEX®) in order to stabilize them, allowing a constant&#xD;
      release of 3.5 µmol of NO during 12 hours [69] or more depending upon the dosage. This device&#xD;
      has been tested by our group for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis obtaining&#xD;
      encouraging results in the healing process with no report of serious adverse events [70].&#xD;
      Since there is no specific effective treatment for DFU our group proposes to investigate the&#xD;
      topical use of NOP, elaborated by the electrospinning technique, for the treatment of DFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of NOP for the treatment of DFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the healing process of DFU using a NOP compared with placebo.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study Development&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistic phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase will be managed by the physician in charge of the study and a professional nurse&#xD;
      and will include the following activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Acquisition of the materials required for the development of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Elaboration of flyers, promotional and educative material, procedures manual and Case&#xD;
           Report Format (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Training of personnel that will participate in the study. 5. Treatment randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment randomization will be realized by the epidemiologist of the Fundación&#xD;
      Cardiovascular de Colombia (FCV). This randomization will be done in blocks in order to avoid&#xD;
      long sequences of patients assigned to the same group and to reduce when possible, some of&#xD;
      the bias inherent to the simple randomization process. Additionally, this randomization in&#xD;
      blocks will facilitate the execution of interim analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will attend the screening visit at the FCV or at the offices of the physicians&#xD;
      involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this visit a complete medical check-up, based on universally accepted techniques, will&#xD;
      evaluate risk factors, DM complications, vascular and neuropathic compromise, medications and&#xD;
      other therapies used for the treatment of DFU. The ankle/arm index will be obtained to rule&#xD;
      out the presence of critical IL ischemia. The inclusion/exclusion criteria will be applied&#xD;
      and the selected candidates informed about the study after which they will sign an informed&#xD;
      consent form. A blood sample will be withdrawn to determine the percentage of glycosylated&#xD;
      hemoglobin (HbA1c), the levels of creatinine and fasting glucose, the hemogram, and the lipid&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laboratory of the Research Institute of FCV and the laboratories of every other center&#xD;
      will be in charge of the processing of blood samples. All the tests will be elaborated using&#xD;
      standard techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Glycosylated hemoglobin: Chromatography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Creatinine: Spectrophotometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hemogram: Manual method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Lipid profile: Spectrophotometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Fasting glucose: Spectrophotometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected patients will be scheduled for the initial visit. In this visit the patients&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Group 1 will receive NOP and Group 2&#xD;
      placebo patches. A complete medical evaluation will be performed, the ulcers measured, and&#xD;
      their pictures taken. Neuropathy will be assessed using the modified validated neuropathic&#xD;
      impairment score (NDS) [71]. Before taking the pictures, a graduated ruler will be placed&#xD;
      next to the ulcers with a sticker marked with the identification code of the participant and&#xD;
      the date of the visit. The first patch (active or placebo) will be applied on the lesion. All&#xD;
      the information obtained will be registered in the CRFs. The treatment previously prescribed&#xD;
      for DM or other concomitant pathologies, and the medical, surgical or orthopedic therapies&#xD;
      for DFU will be continued with the exception of topical treatment. The researchers will&#xD;
      follow the guidelines of the International Diabetic Foot Consensus (CIPD). The patient and&#xD;
      his/her family will receive information regarding the treatment of DFU, the correct technique&#xD;
      for the daily application of the patches and the identification and notification of adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will last 90 days. During this period, the patients will be seen by the&#xD;
      research group at least every two weeks until the healing of the ulcer or the end of the&#xD;
      treatment. The frequency of the visits will vary depending on the clinical evolution of the&#xD;
      patients. During each visit the healing process of the ulcer, the patient's health status and&#xD;
      the presence of adverse events will be assessed. The patch will be applied and the evolution&#xD;
      of the ulcers photographically registered. The maximum and minimum diameters of the ulcer&#xD;
      will be measured using a graduated ruler and then registered in the CRF. The technique for&#xD;
      the application of the patches, the identification of adverse events and the importance of&#xD;
      reporting them, will be emphasized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final visit will take place at the end of the treatment or before in case of complete&#xD;
      healing of the ulcer. A thorough medical evaluation, including laboratory tests will be&#xD;
      performed along with the assessment of vascular and neuropathic compromise. The presence of&#xD;
      adverse events will also be evaluated. The evolution of the ulcers will be documented by&#xD;
      measuring their maximum and minimum diameters and by photographing them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      National Coordination from Monitoring Center: Every six months a researcher from FCV will&#xD;
      visit each center to evaluate the fulfillment of the protocol and the accomplishment of the&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data base depuration phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing all the data entry to the CRF the results will be audited and the detected&#xD;
      errors evaluated and corrected. The information will be entered in two different databases by&#xD;
      two different people and the records compared to detect any discrepancy using a statistical&#xD;
      software (Epi-Info 6.04). The mistakes will be corrected according to the CRF, and the&#xD;
      corrections registered. Each patient will be identified using an internal code. All the&#xD;
      photographs will be processed using a digital edition software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the statistical analysis, Stata 8.0 will be used. The descriptive analysis will be&#xD;
      composed of medians and proportions according to the nature of the variables, with their&#xD;
      respective 95% confidence intervals. As a dispersion measurement the standard deviation will&#xD;
      be calculated. The distribution of the variables will be studied using the Shapiro-Wilk test&#xD;
      and the homoscedasticity of the variances with the Levene test. To detect any difference&#xD;
      between the groups, a T-test or a Mann Whitney test will be performed according to the&#xD;
      distribution of the variables. The categorical variables will be compared using the Chi2 test&#xD;
      or the exact Fisher's test. If required, a model of multiple logistic regressions or a&#xD;
      covariance analysis will be realized. Two interim analyses will be performed when 35 and 70%&#xD;
      of the total sample is collected to determine differences in effectiveness and safety between&#xD;
      the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the treatment the following endpoints will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Healing of the ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Complete cure of the infection that was present before the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Infection of the ulcers during the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Presence of adverse events related to the application of the patches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final report&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the study will be evaluated and discussed and a final report presented to the&#xD;
      Federación Diabetológica Colombiana (FDC), entity that is sponsoring the project. The results&#xD;
      will be submitted for publication and presented in congresses and scientific meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Aspects&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with the&#xD;
      Colombian legislation as per the Resolution 8430/93 from the Ministry of Health. Prior to the&#xD;
      admission of the patients in the study, the objectives and the methodology will be explained&#xD;
      and a written informed consent obtained. The study was approved by the Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of the FCV (Act# 075/April 27/2004). The patients' right to confidentiality will be&#xD;
      maintained in all the phases of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation and management of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the visits the patients will be asked about adverse events. Each adverse event will be&#xD;
      classified by the physician as serious or non-serious. A serious adverse event should meet&#xD;
      one or more of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Death&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Life-threatening&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of a serious adverse event that puts the patient's life at risk and/or requires&#xD;
      immediate medical or surgical procedure will call for the discontinuation of the treatment&#xD;
      and the initiation of the pertinent medical management. The investigator will notify the&#xD;
      Adverse Event Committee (AEC) of the FCV of any serious adverse event within 24 hours of&#xD;
      learning about it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-serious adverse event will be classified as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mild: The patient is aware of his/her symptoms and/or signs, but those are tolerable.&#xD;
           Medical intervention or specific treatment is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Moderate: The patients present troubles that interfere with his/her daily activities.&#xD;
           Medical intervention or specific treatment is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Severe: The patient is unable to work or to attend his/her daily activities. Medical&#xD;
           intervention or specific treatment is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible relationship between the adverse events and the tested medication will be&#xD;
      classified by the investigator on the basis of his/her clinical judgment and the following&#xD;
      definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Definitely related: Event can be fully explained by the administration of the tested&#xD;
           medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Probably related: Event is most likely to be explained by the administration of the&#xD;
           tested medication rather than other medications or by the patient's clinical state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Possibly related: Event may be explained by the administration of the tested medication&#xD;
           or other medications or by the patient's clinical state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Not related: Event is most likely to be explained by the patient's clinical state or by&#xD;
           the use of other medications, rather than the tested one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the events will be reported to the AEC that, depending on its criteria, will decide the&#xD;
      continuity of the patient in the study and therefore the breaking of the code. Although the&#xD;
      project has been designed to minimize the inherent risks, any adverse event related to the&#xD;
      study medication will be carefully evaluated by the AEC and the costs generated by the&#xD;
      required treatment covered by the study.&#xD;
