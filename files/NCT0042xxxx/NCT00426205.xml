  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the addition of a vaccine after&#xD;
      participants reduced intensity transplant will be safe and beneficial. The vaccine used in&#xD;
      this trial, called GVAX, will be made from the participants own leukemia cells, and will be&#xD;
      given between 1-4 months after transplant. In recent years, researchers have discovered that&#xD;
      GVAX vaccine made from the patient's own cancer calls that have been engineered in the&#xD;
      laboratory to produce a protein called GM-CSF, can be effective in stimulating a powerful&#xD;
      immune response specific to that cancer.&#xD;

      -  This trial can be divided into three phases: 1) Pre-transplant phase; 2) Reduced&#xD;
           intensity transplant phase; 3) Vaccination phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-transplant phase: Once a suitable donor has been identified, the participant will&#xD;
           undergo a battery of standard pre-transplant tests and procedure to collect their&#xD;
           leukemia cells for vaccine generation. Blood tests, heart function test, pulmonary&#xD;
           function test, tuberculosis test, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and leukemia cell&#xD;
           collection through leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allogeneic reduced intensity stem cell transplant phase: The transplant phase of the&#xD;
           study will begin when the participant is admitted to the hospital to receive the&#xD;
           chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. The minimum duration of hospitalization for the&#xD;
           procedure is approximately 8 days. In the week before the participant receives the stem&#xD;
           cells, they will be treated with chemotherapy through a central line. The goal of&#xD;
           chemotherapy is to both control the cancer and suppress the immune system so that the&#xD;
           body will not reject the donor stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Just prior to and immediately following the infusion of stem cells, participants will&#xD;
           receive medications to help prevent graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a common&#xD;
           complication of transplant where the donor's immune cells attack the body. After the&#xD;
           transplant, participants will also take antibiotic medication to help prevent possible&#xD;
           infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sargramostim (GM-CSF, leukine), a white blood cell growth factor, will be given daily&#xD;
           subcutaneously starting the day after the stem cell transplant until blood counts have&#xD;
           recovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the stem cell infusion, participants will be examined and have blood tests weekly&#xD;
           for 1 month. Between 30-45 days after the transplant, a bone marrow biopsy will be&#xD;
           performed to assess the status of the disease and to look for evidence of the donor's&#xD;
           cells in the bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccination Phase: After the bone marrow biopsy 30-45 days after the transplant, the&#xD;
           participant will begin to receive the vaccinations. The vaccine will be administered&#xD;
           subcutaneously and intradermally on the arm, leg, or abdomen 6 times over a period of 9&#xD;
           weeks. The first 3 vaccinations will occur once a week for 3 consecutive weeks, and the&#xD;
           last 3 vaccines will be given once every other week over 6 weeks. All vaccinations may&#xD;
           be given as an outpatient in the clinic. During this period of time, participants will&#xD;
           be closely monitored on a weekly basis to monitor for side effects. Before the first and&#xD;
           after the fifth and sixth vaccinations, a small amount of the participants leukemia&#xD;
           cells will be injected under the skin to see if the immune system will react against it&#xD;
           and cause redness and swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About 4 weeks after the last vaccination (6th), a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will&#xD;
           be performed to assess the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the 1st and 5th vaccinations, a skin biopsy will be performed to assess for&#xD;
           response at the vaccine site. These biopsies are relatively simple outpatient&#xD;
           procedures.&#xD;
