  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Development of a safe and effective vaccine against leishmaniasis started more than 10 years&#xD;
      ago under WHO/TDR supervision. An autoclaved L. major vaccine (ALM) mixed with BCG has been&#xD;
      tested in human in Iran, Pakistan and Sudan. Long term follow up of the vaccinees showed no&#xD;
      untoward reactions except the skin reaction at the site of injection. The efficacy results of&#xD;
      ALM was not satisfactory. In order to enhance immunogenicity of the vaccine, ALM was adsorbed&#xD;
      to alum (Aluminum hydroxide). Alum-ALM plus adjuvant showed to induce protection in Rhesus&#xD;
      monkeys against cutaneous leishmaniasis and in Languor monkeys against visceral&#xD;
      leishmaniasis. Two trials of a single injection of different doses of Alum-ALM mixed with&#xD;
      1/10th of normal dose of BCG was carried out in healthy volunteers from a non endemic area of&#xD;
      Sudan. The safety/immunogenicity parameters of the volunteers were closely monitored and the&#xD;
      results showed that side effects were minimal and confined to the site of injection in the&#xD;
      form of mild local pain, induration and ulceration, all associated with BCG vaccination. The&#xD;
      immunogenicity results showed the strongest immune response seen in any Leishmania vaccine&#xD;
      trials so far. It seems that this new formulation is an appropriate candidate for further&#xD;
      development. Inoculation with live virulent Leishmania to produce a lesion for the purpose of&#xD;
      preventing natural infection is known as leishmanization. The induced lesion heals and the&#xD;
      person is usually protected against further infections. This method of prevention was&#xD;
      practiced for centuries in the region. In this study volunteers with response to leishmanin&#xD;
      will be injected twice (30 days apart) with Alum-ALM 200 ug + 1/10 of BCG (n = 50) or diluent&#xD;
      alone (n = 50) as control. All volunteers will be leishmanized on day 60 post vaccination. In&#xD;
      this trial, volunteers are protected either by vaccine or by leishmanization. The&#xD;
      leishmanized volunteers will be visited by weekly and the development and healing process of&#xD;
      the lesion will be monitored until complete healing of every volunteer. The immune responses&#xD;
      of the volunteers will be evaluated. Vaccine efficacy is defined by the percent reduction in&#xD;
      the number of volunteers developing a lesion following leishmanization as compared to&#xD;
      controls on days 240.&#xD;
