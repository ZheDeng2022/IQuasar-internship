  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PCI (coronary angioplasty) is a procedure performed through a catheter to open up blockages&#xD;
      in the coronary arteries using balloons and stents for the treatment of angina or myocardial&#xD;
      infarction. The balloon catheters and stents are moved to the coronary arteries through a&#xD;
      &quot;sheath&quot; (a small tube used for placing of balloon and stent catheters in the body) placed in&#xD;
      a major artery passing through the groin. After the PCI procedure and the removal of sheath,&#xD;
      an &quot;arterial closure device&quot; is commonly placed to stop bleeding and allow you to get out of&#xD;
      bed sooner. Although the usefulness of &quot;closure devices&quot; has been documented before their&#xD;
      approval by the regulatory authorities, it is unclear if one device is better compared to&#xD;
      other commercially available devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to compare the two approved arterial closure devices, &quot;Angioseal&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;Starclose&quot;. This study will help us identify the better of the two devices to improve&#xD;
      patient comfort after the procedure.&#xD;

      All patients scheduled to undergo percutaneous coronary interventions will be screened for&#xD;
      inclusion into the study. Informed consent will be obtained and patients will be randomized&#xD;
      to the placement of either Angioseal or a Starcloseï€  vascular closure device to achieve&#xD;
      hemostasis after the PCI procedure. The randomization will take place after a femoral&#xD;
      angiogram has confirmed the suitability of the femoral artery for placement of arterial&#xD;
      closure device. All patients will be monitored for bleeding or hematoma formation for twelve&#xD;
      hours after the procedure. Patients will be ambulated at two hours after placement of the&#xD;
      arterial closure device. A complete blood count and a vascular ultrasound will be performed&#xD;
      in all patients before discharge to assess blood loss and detect vascular complications such&#xD;
      as hematoma, arteriovenous fistula or femoral artery pseudoaneurysm. A written quality of&#xD;
      life survey will be completed before discharge and at four weeks. A nursing survey will be&#xD;
      completed by the nursing staff to determine nurse-sensitive outcomes and nurse resource&#xD;
      utilization.&#xD;
