  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the comparative effects of two different ways of&#xD;
      enhancing long-term adherence to and benefits associated with participation in the&#xD;
      evidence-based, Fit and Strong multi-component exercise intervention for older persons with&#xD;
      lower extremity osteoarthritis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common condition affecting older people today. It is the&#xD;
      leading cause of disability among older people and its impact is projected to increase&#xD;
      substantially with the aging of the U.S population from 43 million currently to 60 million by&#xD;
      2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Promising 2- and 6-month outcomes have recently been reported from a randomized trial of a&#xD;
      multi-component exercise intervention targeted at older adults with lower extremity OA. The&#xD;
      Fit and Strong intervention, developed and tested as part of the Midwest Roybal Center for&#xD;
      Health Maintenance, coupled strength training and aerobic walking with health education for&#xD;
      sustained behavior change. Improvements have been found in confidence in ability to exercise,&#xD;
      confidence in ability to continue exercising over time, lower extremity stiffness, lower&#xD;
      extremity pain, and 6-minute distance walk. Importantly, the average adherence rate in the&#xD;
      people who participated in the exercise intervention at six months was twice that reported by&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are to use a multi-site randomized controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      to replicate the Fit and Strong intervention and to test the comparative effectiveness of a&#xD;
      negotiated/tailored follow-up maintenance strategy vs. a mainstreaming, facility-based&#xD;
      maintenance strategy, both of which will be tested with and without telephone reinforcement&#xD;
      as an enhancement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled participants will participate in the 8-week Fit and Strong exercise program&#xD;
      designed specifically for older adults with lower-extremity OA. Prior to the conclusion of&#xD;
      Fit and Strong participants will be randomly assigned to one of two follow-up maintenance&#xD;
      groups. There is no more than minimal risk associated with this program.&#xD;

    <description>Treatment Arm A will develop tailored/negotiated contracts with the exercise instructor to maintain post intervention exercise adherence at home or in the community. Half of the participants in this &quot;negotiated maintenance&quot; arm will be randomly assigned to receive telephone calls to reinforce adherence and half will be assigned to a no telephone calls group.</description>

    <description>Fit and Strong! is an 8-week (24 sessions) multi-component exercise and health education intervention, including flexibility, aerobic conditioning, strength training, and group discussion/problem solving for lifestyle change. Following participation in Fit and Strong!, all study participants are randomly assigned to one of 2 maintenance treatment follow-up groups.</description>
