      The purpose of this study is to determine if pre-treating donor lymphocytes with an&#xD;
      investigational drug known as L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLME, prior to donor&#xD;
      lymphocyte infusion (DLI) will improve the recovery of the immune system following stem cell&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;

      If you agree to participate in this research study you will be evaluated during the 4th-6th&#xD;
      week after your transplant to determine the number of CD4 cells in your circulation and to&#xD;
      determine that your body has eliminated all of the immune suppressing medicines used around&#xD;
      the time of your transplant. This will be performed by studying the cells from two tubes of&#xD;
      blood. Thereafter, blood cells will be obtained from your donor (the same donor as used for&#xD;
      the transplant). These cells from the donor will be treated with LLME in the laboratory. The&#xD;
      cells will then be washed to eliminate the LLME, counted, and the desired number will be&#xD;
      administered to you by transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four to six weeks later, you will have additional blood drawn (2-3 teaspoons) to determine&#xD;
      the number of CD4 cells in your blood. If the number is below 100, you will be given another&#xD;
      transfusion of LLME treated cells, but you will receive a larger number of cells. Above 100&#xD;
      CD4 cells, the risk of infections appears to decrease. This will be repeated every 8 weeks&#xD;
      provided that you and your donor remain willing to continue until one of three things&#xD;
      happens. The three things that would cause us to stop further DLI would be: (1) you develop a&#xD;
      CD4 count of over 100, (2) you develop evidence of GVHD, or (3) we reach the maximum&#xD;
      practical number of cells which your donor could provide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your donor will also be reevaluated by medical history, physical examination, and blood tests&#xD;
      to ensure that he/she remains healthy and can undergo the cell donation procedure safely. He&#xD;
      or she will donate the first doses of white cells by drawing a small amount of blood. Later&#xD;
      donations, if necessary, will be collected in a manner that is very similar to how platelets&#xD;
      are normally collected from volunteer donors by the blood bank. The manner in which the&#xD;
      transfusions are given will be similar to that in which you have received red blood cell and&#xD;
      platelet transfusions in the past.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To be treated on this study, patients must have recently undergone a T-cell depleted&#xD;
             allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplant from an HLA-matched&#xD;
             sibling donor, an HLA matched unrelated donor, or an HLA partially matched (single&#xD;
             antigen mismatched, two antigen mismatched, or haplodisparate) donor. Patients will be&#xD;
             counseled and will sign informed consent for this study prior to their transplant. Our&#xD;
             intention is to analyze the effectiveness of LLME treated DLI (Donor Lymphocyte&#xD;
             Infusion) on an intent to treat basis. To proceed with this therapy after HSCT,&#xD;
             patients must meet the other selection criteria below at the time of first DLI.&#xD;
             Additionally, discussion prior to transplant helps present the patient (and donor) a&#xD;
             picture of the proposed therapy in its entirety, rather than in piecemeal fashion. A&#xD;
             patient or donor's unwillingness to participate in this study will in no way affect&#xD;
             their eligibility for transplant therapy at our center.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the time of initial DLI therapy, patients must be between 28 and 42 days post&#xD;
             allogeneic HSCT or between 28 and 42 days after the last dose of ATG if that agent was&#xD;
             used after the transplant as part of their graft rejection prophylaxis. They must also&#xD;
             meet the following criteria during the week prior to first infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have achieved primary engraftment with an absolute neutrophil count of&#xD;
             at least 1000 per l for 3 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a CD4+ lymphocyte count of less than 200 per l. An absolute&#xD;
             lymphocyte count of less than 200 per l will be taken as prime facie evidence that the&#xD;
             CD4+ lymphocyte count meets this criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not exhibit overt hematologic manifestations of relapse or persistent&#xD;
             disease. Evidence of recurrent/persistent disease based primarily on flow cytometry,&#xD;
             cytogenetics, chimerism analysis, or other molecular studies does not by itself&#xD;
             represent grounds for exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be 16 years of age or older. There is no upper age limit for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have any documented graft-versus-host disease.&#xD;
