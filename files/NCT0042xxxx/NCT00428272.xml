      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HGS-ETR2 is a monoclonal antibody, produced in the laboratory from human genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HGS-ETR2 targets a protein called the TRAIL receptor that is located on the surface of&#xD;
           some tumor cells. When the TRAIL receptor is activated, it can cause the tumor cell to&#xD;
           self-destruct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the highest dose of HGS-ETR2 that can be given safely in children and young&#xD;
           adults with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the pharmacology (how the body handles the drug) of HGS-ETR2 by measuring the&#xD;
           amount of drug in the bloodstream over time before and after a dose is given to the&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if HGS-ETR2 can stop or slow tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether proteins in tumor tissue before treatment can predict whether the&#xD;
           tumor will respond to HGS-ETR2 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients 1 to 21 years of age with solid cancers that do not respond to standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HGS-ETR2 is given through a vein (intravenously, IV) once every 14 days. Each treatment&#xD;
           cycle is 28 days long and consists of two doses of HGS-ETR2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The dose of HGS-ETR2 is increased in successive small groups of patients until the&#xD;
           maximum tolerated dose (highest dose with acceptable side effects) is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the treatment period, patients have a physical examination at least once a week,&#xD;
           and routine blood tests at least twice a week. These tests are done less frequently in&#xD;
           later treatment cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional blood samples are drawn for immunology and pharmacology studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests to monitor the size of the tumor (X-rays, CT scans, MRI, PET scans) are done&#xD;
           periodically throughout the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may continue to receive HGS-ETR2 until unacceptable side effects develop or the&#xD;
           tumor grows.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric solid tumors represent approximately one fourth of cancer diagnoses in children.&#xD;
      Despite intensive regimens, patients with metastatic or recurrent tumors have unsatisfactory&#xD;
      survival rates. Therefore new therapies are needed to improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of the TNF ligand superfamily induce death in tumor cells through direct ligation of&#xD;
      death receptors and apoptosis induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand) has specific anti-tumor activity against a wide&#xD;
      range of tumor cells without inducing death in normal cells. TRAIL-induced apoptosis has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in a wide variety of pediatric solid tumors, including Ewing's sarcoma,&#xD;
      osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HGS-ETR2 (Human Genome Sciences; human monoclonal antibody) is a fully human monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody that agonistically binds TRAIL receptor 2 and, like TRAIL itself, induces apoptosis&#xD;
      in a variety of malignant cell types with little effect on normal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limited caspase 8 expression is a primary factor in limiting to TRAIL mediated cell death in&#xD;
      some tumors; interferon gamma has been shown to be effective in increasing caspase-8&#xD;
      expression in tumors and in restoring sensitivity of tumors to TRAIL mediated cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the tolerance of the adult maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities&#xD;
      of lexatumumab in patients with refractory pediatric solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the MTD of lexatumumab in the presence of fixed dosing of interferon gamma 1b at&#xD;
      25 mcg/m(2) SC three times/week, which is less than the FDA approved dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the pharmacokinetics of lexatumumab or lexatumumab in combination with interferon&#xD;
      gamma 1b in patients with pediatric malignant tumors refractory to standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must be 1-30 years of age with solid malignant tumors refractory to standard&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Phase I dose escalation study with 4 planned dose levels of lexatumumab starting at 30% of&#xD;
      the adult MTD and escalating up to 100% of the adult MTD, followed by a second dose&#xD;
      escalation using five lexatumumab dose levels in patients concomitantly receiving interferon&#xD;
      gamma 1b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three (expanded to six if DLT occurs) patients will be enrolled at each dose level of&#xD;
      lexatumumab until the adult MTD is reached and 6 patients will be enrolled at the adult MTD&#xD;
      dose. The MTD cohort of lexatumumab alone and combined regimen will be expanded to include 12&#xD;
      patients, which should include a minimum of 6 patients less than or equal to 12 years of age.&#xD;
      Once 6 patients greater than 12 years of age have completed lexatumumab alone, new patients&#xD;
      greater than 12 years of age will be enrolled in the combined regimen. Similarly, once 6&#xD;
      patients complete lexatumumab alone who are less than or equal to 12 years of age, new&#xD;
      patients less than or equal to 12 years of age will be enrolled in the combined regimen. A&#xD;
      final dose escalation of interferon gamma 1b will be performed with the maximum dose level of&#xD;
      lexatumumab, to a dose level wherein archival tissue demonstrated upregulation of caspase 8.&#xD;

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness, such as serious infections or organ&#xD;
        dysfunction, which in the judgment of the Principal or Associate Investigators would&#xD;
        compromise the patient s ability to tolerate the agents in this trial or are likely to&#xD;
        interfere with the study procedures or results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a history of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Patients who have&#xD;
        received autologous stem cell transplantation are eligible greater than 3 months after&#xD;
        completion of therapy if they meet other eligibility requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with hepatic tumors or metastases are excluded due to the potential for&#xD;
        hepatotoxicity with agents that target the TRAIL-R pathway. Patients with primary CNS&#xD;
        tumors will be excluded due to unknown penetration into the CNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Untreated CNS metastases will render the patient ineligible however patients with a&#xD;
        previous history of CNS metastases are eligible if: the metastases have been treated with&#xD;
        surgery and/or radiotherapy, are clinically stable as evidenced by no requirements for&#xD;
        corticosteroids, the patient has no evolving neurologic deficits and no change in residual&#xD;
        brain abnormalities without specific therapy over 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant or breastfeeding females are excluded because the risks of lexatumumab to the&#xD;
        developing fetus or nursing child are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients currently receiving other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of any infection requiring hospitalization or parenteral antibiotics within 2 weeks&#xD;
        of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Co-existing medical illness that would place the subject at undue risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        On immunosupressant therapy (with the exception of prednisone up to 10 mg/day, or&#xD;
        dexamethasone up to 4 mg/day), or with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection&#xD;
        or hepatitis B or C. Subjects with immune deficiency are excluded due to their increased&#xD;
        risk of life threatening toxicity when treated with anticancer agents.&#xD;
