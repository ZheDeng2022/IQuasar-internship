      This study will collect heart tissue that is routinely removed and discarded during&#xD;
      open-heart surgery. The Cardiology Branch of the NHLBI is conducting a variety of laboratory&#xD;
      experiments that require a sample of heart tissue. A segment of tissue is routinely cut out&#xD;
      of the right atrial appendage of the heart during open-heart surgery to allow the heart-lung&#xD;
      bypass machine to be attached to the heart for protection during surgery. This small tissue&#xD;
      sample is not re-attached after the bypass machine is removed, but usually destroyed as&#xD;
      medical waste.'&#xD;
&#xD;
      People between 18 and 80 years of age who are scheduled to undergo coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      surgery or aortic valve replacement surgery may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants donate the right atrial appendage of the heart, which would normally be&#xD;
      destroyed after their open-heart surgery. The tissue will be used by NHLBI investigators in&#xD;
      studies directed at learning how to make the heart less sensitive to damage from a heart&#xD;
      attack. The samples may be used, for example, to evaluate the effectiveness of known&#xD;
      therapies, refine treatment approaches, identify potential new therapies, or explore&#xD;
      opportunities for disease prevention.&#xD;

      Transient non-lethal ischemia followed by reperfusion activates a cell survival program&#xD;
      resulting in increased tolerance to subsequent ischemic injury. This biological phenomenon is&#xD;
      termed ischemic preconditioning and is a powerful cell survival program that is operational&#xD;
      in the human heart. This program is triggered by signaling intermediates activated in&#xD;
      response to the transient ischemia/hypoxia and reperfusion of preconditioning.&#xD;
      Characterization of these signaling intermediates should enable us to identify therapeutic&#xD;
      agents to augment tissue tolerance to ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, nitrite, which is an endogenous reservoir for nitric oxide (NO), undergoes&#xD;
      bioconversion to NO via hypoxia-dependent signaling. Whether nitrite accumulation and&#xD;
      bioconversion are components of the ischemic preconditioning program is unknown. Recently Dr.&#xD;
      Gladwin and colleagues in the Vascular Medicine Branch unequivocally demonstrated that&#xD;
      exogenous nitrite administration is cytoprotective against ischemia-reperfusion injury in&#xD;
      murine liver and heart and in the canine heart. Establishing a mechanistic link between the&#xD;
      ischemic preconditioning program and nitrite biology would promote nitrite as an attractive&#xD;
      compound for future therapeutic interventions. To evaluate this link, we propose to use&#xD;
      cardiac right atrial appendage tissue that is routinely excised to facilitate right atrial&#xD;
      cannulation for heart-lung bypass. This excised tissue is then usually discarded as medical&#xD;
      waste.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that nitrite administration to atrial tissue in an ex-vivo study will&#xD;
      demonstrate increased tolerance to ischemic stress compared to atrial tissue not exposed to&#xD;
      nitrite. Furthermore, we propose that this cytoprotective effect of nitrite administration&#xD;
      will demonstrate equivalency to cytoprotection in response to ischemic preconditioning.&#xD;
      Finally, we would employ this tissue to identify nitrite mediated genomic, proteomic and&#xD;
      metabolomic modifications in human myocardium, thereby identifying the biological programs&#xD;
      orchestrating the cytoprotective properties of nitrite in the human heart.&#xD;
