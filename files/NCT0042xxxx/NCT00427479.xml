  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increasing number of people have an allergy to birch pollen, which manifests itself as&#xD;
      Springtime hayfever. Some will also have cross-reactions to fruits, vegetables and nuts, a&#xD;
      condition known as Oral Allergy Syndrome (OAS). Research has demonstrated that the most&#xD;
      effective method of diagnosing this problem is by taking a good clinical history and&#xD;
      performing skin prick tests using fresh foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study will be therefore to investigate the prevalence of OAS in a&#xD;
      birch-sensitive population using a simple screening tool and establish the range of foods&#xD;
      involved. The objective will be to maximise effective treatment for the patients in our large&#xD;
      respiratory allergy clinic by using the screening tool to identify patients with OAS and&#xD;
      advise them on the usual foods involved. A further objective will be to use the data to&#xD;
      discover if there are any patterns of particular foods involved in OAS in UK sufferers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypotheses are therefore that there is a high prevalence of oral allergy in people&#xD;
      with birch pollen allergy; the best way of diagnosing the problem is by using a screening&#xD;
      tool and that there is a core set of foods that are commonly involved in OAS in patients seen&#xD;
      in the allergy clinic.&#xD;

      Patients will be recruited both prospectively and retrospectively from the Royal Brompton&#xD;
      Hospital allergy clinic and through advertisement. Subjects will be identified by diagnosis&#xD;
      of birch pollen allergy, either routinely in the RBHT adult allergy clinic or by looking back&#xD;
      at patient records. Suitable patients will be invited to participate in the study, with fully&#xD;
      informed consent obtained, if they understand written English and fulfil the following&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of Springtime hayfever&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positive skin prick test (  3mm) to Birch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FEV1.&gt; than 70% predicted or greater than 1.5L&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aged 16 years or more&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Existing medical condition which could be affected by a severe response on challenge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aged under 16&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FEV1.&lt; than 70% predicted or greater than 1.5L&#xD;
&#xD;
      On recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a full explanation of the study given, patients who agree to participate will be asked&#xD;
      to sign the consent form, a copy of which will be placed in the medical notes, and a second&#xD;
      copy sent to the Ethics Committee Administrator. Participants will then be booked in for&#xD;
      visit one and advised to avoid short acting antihistamines for 72 hours and long acting ones&#xD;
      for a week, prior to their prick prick test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OAS screening tool will be completed for every patient. A venous blood sample will be&#xD;
      taken and stored for the measurement of total IgE and specific IgE RAST tests for birch,&#xD;
      apple, celery and hazelnuts. A questionnaire will be completed by the patient assessing the&#xD;
      effect any food reactions is having on their diet and social life. The researcher will then&#xD;
      complete a 24-hour food recall questionnaire with the patient, to ascertain their normal&#xD;
      dietary intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will then be asked whether they have taken anti-histamines in the last 72 hours,&#xD;
      and if they have not then prick prick tests can be performed using a range of different fresh&#xD;
      fruits, vegetables, nuts and Birch and Grass reagent. The tests will be undertaken according&#xD;
      to EAACI recommendations, with a positive and negative control. The allergen content of fresh&#xD;
      foods is unknown, but using data from previous studies, a wheal of 3mm will be considered&#xD;
      positive, and a wheal of 5 mm strongly positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will then be invited to return to undergo one single blind, placebo food&#xD;
      challenge. Those classed as negative responders will then undergo two double blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC), one being an active substance and one a control&#xD;
      substance. Following these challenges, those still classed as negative responders will&#xD;
      undergo an open challenge with the active substance. The only exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      those subjects who have previously reported an anaphylactic response to the active challenge&#xD;
      material.&#xD;
