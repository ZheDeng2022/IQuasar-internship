      We hypothesize that glaucoma patients demonstrate an impaired retinal vascular response to&#xD;
      the flicker stimulus, and that this disturbance is predictive of the progression of&#xD;
      glaucomatous damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The response of a major temporal superior and inferior retinal artery and vein to a 60&#xD;
      seconds 12.5 Hz flicker light stimulation in 50 glaucoma patients, 50 ocular hypertensives&#xD;
      and 50 controls (using the Retinal Vessel Analyzer) and to investigate how intraocular&#xD;
      pressure relates to neurovascular coupling. In addition, 50 glaucoma patients and 50 ocular&#xD;
      hypertension patients will be followed for 3 years for functional (visual field, automated&#xD;
      perimetry with Octopus device) and morphological (retinal nerve fiber layer thickness,&#xD;
      Optical Coherence Tomography Stratus (OCT) device) glaucomatous damage progression, in order&#xD;
      to test the predictive power of the retinal vascular flicker response for glaucoma&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;

      Rationale: The term neurovascular coupling refers to the vascular response to an increased&#xD;
      neuronal activity. The contact of the nerve terminals to the cortical blood vessels is mostly&#xD;
      realized through astrocytes. A major defining property of glaucoma, cupping of the optic&#xD;
      disc, implies tissue remodeling of the optic nerve head and involves an astrocytic responses.&#xD;
      A malfunction of the astrocytes in glaucoma may lead not only to the hallmark of glaucoma,&#xD;
      cupping and death of retinal ganglion cells, but also to an accompanying or even preceding&#xD;
      disturbance in ocular neurovascular coupling. The retinal vascular bed was chosen because of&#xD;
      the high reproducibility of the dynamic retinal vessel diameter analysis and because recently&#xD;
      the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α was found not only in the glia of the optic nerve head but&#xD;
      also in the retina of glaucomatous donor eyes and predominantly in retinal locations closely&#xD;
      concordant with the locations of visual field defects recorded in these eyes, raising&#xD;
      questions about the site of primary damage in glaucoma. It is hoped that this research&#xD;
      project will help provide a workable tool and a model able not only to identify a risk factor&#xD;
      for glaucoma, but in the future to explore possible therapeutic avenues to modify the course&#xD;
      of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working hypothesis: We hypothesize that glaucoma patients demonstrate an impaired retinal&#xD;
      vascular response to the flicker stimulus, and that this disturbance is predictive of the&#xD;
      progression of glaucomatous damage Subjects and Methods The present protocol intends to&#xD;
      explore the response of a major temporal superior and inferior retinal artery and vein to a&#xD;
      60 seconds 12.5 Hz flicker light stimulation in 50 glaucoma patients, 50 ocular hypertensives&#xD;
      and 50 controls (using the Retinal Vessel Analyzer) and to investigate how intraocular&#xD;
      pressure relates to neurovascular coupling. In addition, 50 glaucoma patients and 50 ocular&#xD;
      hypertension patients will be followed for 3 years for functional (visual field, automated&#xD;
      perimetry with Octopus device) and morphological (retinal nerve fiber layer thickness,&#xD;
      Optical Coherence Tomography Stratus OCT device) glaucomatous damage progression, in order to&#xD;
      test the predictive power of the retinal vascular flicker response for glaucoma progression.&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited in the University Eye Clinic Basel, a notification in the&#xD;
      University Hospital of Basel and/or advertisement in a newspaper will inform potential&#xD;
      healthy volunteers of the opportunity to participate in a scientific research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Course: Study is divided in the cross-sectional and in the cohort part. In the former,&#xD;
      first the screening examination will be performed, to establish an eligibility of a patient /&#xD;
      control subject for the study. Thereafter, the measurements described above will follow,&#xD;
      which will conclude the cross-sectional part of the study. Glaucoma patients and patients&#xD;
      with ocular hypertension will be offered a possibility to enter the cohort-study, with a&#xD;
      3-year follow-up embedded in the clinical routine and consisting of biannual repeated&#xD;
      measurements outlined above.&#xD;
