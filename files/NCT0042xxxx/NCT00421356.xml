  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Ossur Prosthetic Power Knee claims to assist in helping people with transfemoral&#xD;
      amputation to walk up stairs and stand up from sitting. We expect to find that this product&#xD;
      has the ability to help unload the sound knee during these tasks. We plan to collect force&#xD;
      and motion data while people stand up from a chair. We will compare the data from people&#xD;
      using several types of prosthetic knees, including the power knee as well as from people who&#xD;
      are not amputees to see what the force and motion contributions are from the different knees&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  7 control subjects with normal lower extremity function: mentally independent adults&#xD;
             with intact extremities. These individuals shall have no significant medical history&#xD;
             that would impair their ability to perform 3, repeated, sit to stand trials.&#xD;
             Exclusionary examples might include history positive for total joint arthroplasty of&#xD;
             the hip or knee and significant cardiomyopathy. Control subjects will be non-amputee,&#xD;
             generally healthy individuals, mentally capable of providing informed consent. They&#xD;
             will have no significant medical history that could be perceived by investigators to&#xD;
             hinder the ability to transfer. Anyone not meeting these criteria cannot be a control&#xD;
             subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  28 subjects with unilateral amputation at the level of the thigh. 7 each in four&#xD;
             groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Active Extension Group: Power Knee&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Microprocessor Stance Control Group: C-Leg, Rheo, Adaptive&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Non-Microprocessor Stance Control Group: Mauch, Catech or other stance control&#xD;
                  units&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Non-Microprocessor and Non-Stance Control units: WASB, polycentrics, pneumatics&#xD;
                  Each subject must have a prosthesis for which they have had for a minimum of 90&#xD;
                  days in its present condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must be:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. at least 21 years of age,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. mentally independent, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects are not candidates if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. are under 21 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. are mentally dependent and unable to provide their own informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. have worn the present prosthesis for less than 90 days in the current condition&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. have bilateral amputation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with an amputation are not candidates if they only use a prosthesis for&#xD;
             transfers or therapy (K0 or K1 Medicare functional class). They must be independently&#xD;
             ambulatory, at some level in the community (Medicare functional class &quot;K2-K4&quot;). They&#xD;
             are furthermore not a candidate for this study if they have bilateral amputation (at&#xD;
             any level) of the lower extremity as the purpose is to determine sound versus involved&#xD;
             side loading, then against control. If all of the latter criteria are satisfied, the&#xD;
             final piece is the 90 day prosthetic accommodation period. Candidacy then hinges upon&#xD;
             the fact that they are accommodated to their current prosthesis as evident by having&#xD;
             worn the current device, unaltered for the 90 days prior to testing.&#xD;
