      This is a Phase II open-label study of weekly Taxoprexin® Injection in patients with advanced&#xD;
      primary cancers of the liver, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or carcinoma of the&#xD;
      gallbladder or biliary tract (BTC), who have not received prior systemic cytotoxic therapy&#xD;
      for advanced disease. Patients may have previously received radiation and/or systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy. Patients may not have been treated previously with a&#xD;
      taxane. Patients may have been previously treated with up to two immunological and/or&#xD;
      biologic agents (e.g., interferon, monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors).&#xD;
      Patients will receive Taxoprexin® Injection at a dose of 500mg/m2 (400mg/m2 for patients with&#xD;
      an elevated bilirubin at baseline) intravenously by 1-hour infusion weekly for the first five&#xD;
      weeks of a six week cycle. Treatment will continue until progression of disease, intolerable&#xD;
      toxicity, refusal of continued treatment by patient or Investigator decision.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have histologic or cytologic confirmation of primary cancer of the&#xD;
             liver, including HCC or adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder or bile ducts and advanced&#xD;
             (unresectable and/or metastatic) disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have at least one measurable lesion by RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients may have received up to two prior systemic non-cytotoxic regimens for their&#xD;
             disease. Prior treatment with immunologic and/or biologic agents is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. At least 6 weeks (42 days) since any prior immunologic or biologic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. At least 4 weeks (28 days) since prior radiotherapy to &gt;20% of the bone marrow or&#xD;
             prior adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Lesions being used to assess disease status may not have been radiated or if so, must&#xD;
             have progressed during or after radiation therapy.&#xD;
