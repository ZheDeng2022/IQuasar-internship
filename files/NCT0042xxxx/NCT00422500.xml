      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the severity of symptoms, their impact on affective and health-related&#xD;
           functional status, and symptom interference among patients with advanced-stage lung&#xD;
           cancer following initiation of chemotherapy by disease status, tumor response to&#xD;
           chemotherapy, and adequacy of symptom management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the relationship of disease-related and treatment-related physical symptoms&#xD;
           to affective impairment and the patient's reported symptom interference and functional&#xD;
           impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare symptom severity, adequacy of symptom management, and interference with&#xD;
           affective status and health-related function by patient's minority status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the serum level of inflammatory cytokines during chemotherapy among lung&#xD;
           cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure DNA repair capacity (DRC) in lymphocyte cultures of all patients enrolled in&#xD;
           the protocol at baseline (before treatment) and during each follow-up blood draw. The&#xD;
           hypothesis is that patients with suboptimal DRC will do better with chemotherapy than&#xD;
           patients with efficient DRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To extract DNA and genotype for polymorphisms in genes involved in the nucleotide&#xD;
           excision repair pathway and in those involved in response to pain (opioid receptors,&#xD;
           dopamine receptors, COMT). We hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Polymorphisms in NER genes that modulate DNA repair capacity will also effect&#xD;
                response to chemotherapy and to outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Cytokine gene polymorphisms account for variations in symptom outcomes (specific&#xD;
                symptoms and symptom clusters) before, during and after chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The COMT val/met polymorphism affects the metabolism of catecholamines on the&#xD;
                modulation of response to sustained pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Dopamine receptor polymorphisms that result in decreased density of dopamine&#xD;
                receptors will result in a deficit in the dopamine pathway. that will also affect&#xD;
                response to pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate neurocognitive function to determine the prevalence, severity, and pattern&#xD;
           of cognitive symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the ways to learn about the symptoms of chemotherapy is by looking at how certain&#xD;
      proteins called cytokines (found in the blood) change during therapy. Another way is to look&#xD;
      at how symptoms change during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before therapy starts, you will be asked to complete several questionnaires during a visit to&#xD;
      the thoracic clinic at M. D. Anderson. These questionnaires measure physical and emotional&#xD;
      (mental) symptoms. The questionnaires should take about 60 minutes to finish. You will also&#xD;
      be asked to complete some cognitive (mental) questionnaires that take about 25 minutes to&#xD;
      complete. During this visit, the research nurse will teach you how to use an interactive&#xD;
      voice response telephone system for measuring symptoms. The research nurse will ask you the&#xD;
      most convenient time for the telephone calls, and make sure the system is programmed to call&#xD;
      you at that time. The date of the call will be at the same or close to the date of your&#xD;
      weekly clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms will be monitored weekly during chemotherapy treatment using this interactive voice&#xD;
      response telephone system. The automated telephone system will call you once a week, and&#xD;
      using the numeric key pad on your telephone, you will rate the severity of your symptoms and&#xD;
      how much they interfere in your daily life. Once you complete therapy, the phone system will&#xD;
      call every two weeks for up to six months. The information collected by these calls is only&#xD;
      being used for this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the telephone calls, the research nurse will arrange to meet you approximately&#xD;
      every 6 weeks at your clinic visit. She will ask you to complete some surveys about your&#xD;
      symptoms, mood, and quality of life. This meeting will take about 45 minutes. You will also&#xD;
      be asked again to complete some cognitive (mental) questionnaires that take about 25 minutes&#xD;
      to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research staff will also obtain from your medical record clinical information and lab values&#xD;
      during your treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have agreed to participate in the companion caregiver study, the study staff will use&#xD;
      your demographic and clinical data to study the influence of your symptoms on your&#xD;
      caregiver's physical and mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You are encouraged to report your symptoms to your treating physicians during the study,&#xD;
      especially if you have any symptom that you rate greater than 7 on the 0 to 10 scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. A total of up to 224 patients will take part in this&#xD;
      multicenter study. Up to 112 will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
