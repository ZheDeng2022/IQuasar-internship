      The TURNS is a National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) funded contract for the evaluation&#xD;
      of new compounds for the treatment of cognitive impairments in schizophrenia (HHSN 27820044&#xD;
      1003C; P.I.: Steve Marder, M.D.). Despite advances in the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      effectiveness of antipsychotic medications for the treatment of schizophrenia, many patients&#xD;
      continue to be plagued by impairments in social and work functioning. Persons with&#xD;
      schizophrenia commonly show deficits in a number of areas of cognition that include&#xD;
      impairments in attention, memory, and executive functioning (the ability and organize one's&#xD;
      behavior). Importantly, a large body of literature now shows a link between cognition and&#xD;
      community functioning in schizophrenia. It is believed that treatments that improve cognitive&#xD;
      deficits may lead to improvements in work and social functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A promising approach to improve the community functioning of patients with schizophrenia is&#xD;
      to develop new agents that treat the cognitive deficits of the illness. One type of&#xD;
      pharmacological compound that has shown promise at improving cognition is a group of drugs&#xD;
      called ampakines. These drugs are believed to improve the activity of a neurotransmitter&#xD;
      system in the brain called the glutamate system. Increased activity of this system has been&#xD;
      linked to improvements in cognitive functioning. The current study is an eight-week trial&#xD;
      comparing two doses of the ampakine drug, Org 24448, that will be added to patients' current&#xD;
      atypical antipsychotic medication. One hundred thirty-five patients with schizophrenia, drawn&#xD;
      from seven sites, will participate in the study. Cognition will be measured using a variety&#xD;
      of paper-and-pencil and computerized measures from the consensus-derived NIMH Measurement and&#xD;
      Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) cognitive battery.&#xD;
      Psychiatric symptoms and the ability to perform community-based tasks of daily living will&#xD;
      also be measured. Because previous trials with this drug and other similar drugs have&#xD;
      detected lasting cognitive benefits, this trial will also repeat clinical assessments four&#xD;
      weeks after completion of the study medication.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is an eight-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, fixed dose trial&#xD;
      comparing two doses of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)&#xD;
      receptor positive modulator, Org 24448, added to a stable dose of atypical antipsychotic&#xD;
      medication in 135 patients with schizophrenia studied at seven sites. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      for this trial is a composite score derived from the MATRICS cognitive battery. Measures of&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms and functioning are secondary endpoints. Because previous trials in&#xD;
      animals and humans with this and other AMPA modulators detected persistence of cognitive&#xD;
      benefits, this trial will also repeat clinical assessments at follow-up, four weeks after&#xD;
      completion of the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the effects of an eight-week trial of Org 24448 250 mg BID, 500 mg BID and&#xD;
           placebo upon cognitive function as assessed by the MATRICS cognitive battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the effects of an eight-week trial of Org 24448 250 mg BID, 500 mg BID and&#xD;
           placebo upon level of functioning as measured by the SCoRS and UPSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare effects of Org 24448 250 mg BID, 500 mg BID and placebo on overall symptoms&#xD;
           measured by the BPRS total, psychotic symptoms measured by the BPRS positive symptom&#xD;
           items, and negative symptoms measured by the SANS total.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate tolerability of Org 24448 250 mg BID and 500 mg BID compared to placebo&#xD;
           measured by the Side Effect Checklist, AIMS, SAS, study completion rates, and frequency&#xD;
           of abnormal laboratory values.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tertiary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluate persistence of effects on clinical ratings 4 weeks after completion of the&#xD;
           8-week trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Locations: This study will be coordinated by the study PI, Dr. Goff, and the TURNS&#xD;
      Treatment Management Unit under the direction of Dr. Buchanan. Patients will be recruited&#xD;
      from the Massachusetts General Hospital and Massachusetts Mental Health Center in Boston (Dr.&#xD;
      Goff), the Lemuel Shattuck Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Dr. Seidman),&#xD;
      the Nathan Kline Institute (Drs. Javitt and Nolan), Washington University Medical Center&#xD;
      (Drs. Csernansky and Barch), the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center (Drs. Buchanan and&#xD;
      Gold), Duke School of Medicine (Drs. McEvoy and Keefe), the University of California at Los&#xD;
      Angeles (Drs. Marder and Green) and Columbia University (Drs. Lieberman and Kimhy). The TURNS&#xD;
      is a NIMH-funded contract for the evaluation of new compounds for the treatment of cognitive&#xD;
      impairments in schizophrenia (HHSN 27820044 1003C; P.I.: Steve Marder, M.D.). Data management&#xD;
      will be performed by the Clinical Trials Data Management Unit of the Nathan Kline Institute&#xD;
      under the direction of Jim Robinson, M.S., and statistical analysis will be performed by Dr.&#xD;
      Robert McMahon of the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center. Org 24448 and matching placebo&#xD;
      capsules will be provided by Organon Pharmaceuticals. Laboratory assays will be performed by&#xD;
      Quest Diagnostics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Subjects will include 135 inpatients or outpatients with schizophrenia treated for&#xD;
      at least 8 weeks with a stable dose of an atypical antipsychotic other than clozapine. Prior&#xD;
      to enrollment, it will be determined that the clinician has optimized the dose of the&#xD;
      antipsychotic and maintained the medication at a constant dose for at least 4 weeks.&#xD;
      Diagnoses will be confirmed using the SCID. Patients will be excluded for significant medical&#xD;
      illness, seizure disorder, substance abuse, or inability to provide informed consent. Because&#xD;
      our primary hypothesis is that Org 24448 will improve measures of attention and memory,&#xD;
      patients must be capable of completing the neuropsychological battery, but no minimum&#xD;
      threshold of cognitive impairment is required for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: The diagnosis of schizophrenia will be confirmed by a research psychiatrist using&#xD;
      a modified version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM IV (SCID). The BPRS, SANS,&#xD;
      CDRS and SAS will be administered to verify that inclusionary criteria are met. A physical&#xD;
      examination, including neurological exam, will be performed and medical history, vital signs&#xD;
      (weight, heart rate, oral temperature, sitting and standing blood pressure), and demographic&#xD;
      information will be obtained. Laboratory assessments will include standard screening blood&#xD;
      tests: electrolytes, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), fasting glucose, liver enzymes,&#xD;
      T4, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, albumin and complete blood count (CBC) with differential&#xD;
      and platelet count. A pregnancy test will be done in all premenopausal women. A routine&#xD;
      urinalysis, drug screen, EKG and EEG with hyperventilation and photic stimulation will also&#xD;
      be performed. The screening visits will collect all data required to complete inclusionary&#xD;
      and exclusionary criteria except for performance on the MATRICS battery and WTAR, which will&#xD;
      be administered as a baseline measurement at week 1 of the stabilization phase to minimize&#xD;
      practice effects. In addition, subjects must continue to meet inclusionary and exclusionary&#xD;
      criteria on baseline symptom ratings which will be performed at the completion of the&#xD;
      stabilization phase (stabilization week 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stabilization Phase: After informed consent is obtained and screening completed, subjects&#xD;
      will enter a two-week, single-blind placebo lead-in stabilization phase. Placebo will be&#xD;
      administered as two capsules twice daily dispensed in blister packs identical to those that&#xD;
      will be used during the randomized, double-blind treatment phase. Baseline assessments will&#xD;
      be completed during the stabilization phase and compliance with study medication will be&#xD;
      assessed. Plasma will be obtained for assay of antipsychotic concentrations at week 2 of the&#xD;
      stabilization phase. The plasma sample will be drawn as a trough level. This phase is&#xD;
      intended to reduce placebo-response during the double-blind treatment phase, allow completion&#xD;
      of baseline assessments, and provide an opportunity for investigators to identify and resolve&#xD;
      potential problems with compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR),&#xD;
      the Schizophrenia Cognitive Rating Scale (SCoRS), and the University of California San Diego&#xD;
      (UCSD) Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA) will be completed at stabilization week 1;&#xD;
      the clinical scales (described under &quot;Assessments&quot;) will be completed at stabilization week&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-Blind Phase: Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to placebo, Org 24448 250 mg&#xD;
      BID or Org 24448 500 mg BID administered in identical-appearing capsules for eight weeks.&#xD;
      Study drug will be dispensed weekly in blister packs containing placebo or Org 24448 250 mg&#xD;
      capsules after completing the stabilization phase (stabilization week 2 and baseline&#xD;
      assessments). Subjects will be given three extra days of medication in case of a missed&#xD;
      appointment. All subjects will take two capsules twice daily. The antipsychotic dose will be&#xD;
      unchanged during the trial. Patients will be asked to bring their previous blister pack to&#xD;
      each visit; a count of remaining capsules will be performed and recorded. Patients will&#xD;
      return for follow-up at week 12, four weeks after completing the double-blind trial.&#xD;
      Investigators may reduce the morning (AM) dose of study drug by one capsule (250 mg) if&#xD;
      necessary due to poor tolerance. Subjects may continue at the reduced dose or, after one&#xD;
      week, the investigator may attempt to resume the full dose (two capsules BID). If the reduced&#xD;
      dose (three capsules daily) is not tolerated, subjects will be discontinued from the study.&#xD;
      Patients who miss 7 consecutive days of study drug or who are found to have taken 75% or&#xD;
      fewer study doses at two or more pill counts will be dropped from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: The following scales will be completed at stabilization week 2 (baseline) and at&#xD;
      weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 &amp; 12 and will comprise the clinical assessment battery: Brief Psychiatric&#xD;
      Rating Scale (BPRS), Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), Calgary Depression&#xD;
      Rating Scale (CDRS) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI). In addition, the Abnormal&#xD;
      Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and the Simpson Angus Scale for Extrapyramidal Symptoms&#xD;
      (SAS) will be performed at baseline and weeks 4, 8 &amp; 12. Assessment of functioning will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline, weeks 4 &amp; 8 (or end of study) using the Schizophrenia Cognitive Rating&#xD;
      Scale (SCoRS) and UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment (UPSA). The SCoRS will be repeated&#xD;
      at week 12. Cognitive functioning will be assessed at baseline, week 4 and week 8 (or end of&#xD;
      study) using the MATRICS battery plus the NAB Daily Living Memory and a Delayed Recall Trial&#xD;
      of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test. A one-week window (up to 3 days before or 4 days after&#xD;
      the scheduled visit) will be allowed for the completion of assessments to accommodate unusual&#xD;
      or unavoidable circumstances only. All sites will be certified in the administration of the&#xD;
      MATRICS, SCoRS and UPSA assessments prior to initiation of study. Inter-rater reliability&#xD;
      will be established for the BPRS and SANS before the start of the study and will be&#xD;
      reassessed every three months by the circulation of videotaped interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Assessments: Vital signs and the Side Effects Checklist will be performed and adverse&#xD;
      events recorded weekly during the two-week stabilization phase and the 8 week trial and&#xD;
      weekly for 4 weeks following completion of the trial . Laboratory assessments, including&#xD;
      urinalysis, will be repeated at weeks 4, 6 and 8 (or end of study). An EKG will be repeated&#xD;
      at weeks 2, 4 and 8. A white blood count (WBC) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) will be&#xD;
      repeated weekly during the 8 week trial and weekly for 4 weeks following completion of the&#xD;
      trial. A physical examination, including neurological examination, will be repeated at week 8&#xD;
      (or end of study).Drug Plasma Concentrations: Plasma will be obtained at baseline and weeks 4&#xD;
      and 8 for assay of antipsychotic concentrations. Plasma samples will be drawn as trough&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
