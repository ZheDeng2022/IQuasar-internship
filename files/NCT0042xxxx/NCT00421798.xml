    <textblock>
      This study will test a method of detecting tuberculosis-causing bacteria that are resistant&#xD;
      to current medication treatments. Blood samples will be collected from patients from 3 sites&#xD;
      and 3 mainly Hispanic populations in Texas, Mexico, and Colombia. Up to 780 males and&#xD;
      females, ages 18-85 years, will participate. The study population will consist of 390 people&#xD;
      with any of 3 forms of tuberculosis (TB) and 390 people who are either healthy or with a&#xD;
      disease initially thought to be one of these 3 forms of TB but then ruled out. Volunteers&#xD;
      will only be contacted, invited to participate and interviewed at the beginning of their&#xD;
      evaluation for possible TB.The study team will follow up with the health department to&#xD;
      determine if the volunteer was indeed diagnosed with TB, and with the laboratory to determine&#xD;
      the results of TB tests at diagnosis and during the course of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Global challenges to tuberculosis (TB) control are multidrug resistance TB (MDR-TB) and the&#xD;
      increased susceptibility of populations such as elderly, those with HIV infection, type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and other immunosuppressive chronic diseases. The first primary study objective is&#xD;
      to examine the potential of the investigators' new DNA extraction/qPCR protocol as a&#xD;
      non-invasive tool to study pathogenesis in a range of paucibacillary specimens. The&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate their DNA extraction/qPCR assays prospectively in specimens from&#xD;
      patients with paucibacillary TB, including extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB) and smear-negative&#xD;
      pulmonary TB. Investigators will determine the number of mycobacterial genomes, presence of&#xD;
      intact mycobacteria, and precise location within plasma, PBMCs or PMNs in blood, or other&#xD;
      fluid or cells in a range of specimens. The second primary study objective is to standardize&#xD;
      and validate a qPCR assay for early detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) drug&#xD;
      resistance directly from specimens. The investigators will further establish the feasibility&#xD;
      of using this highly sensitive assay to determine the ratio of Rifampin (RIF)-resistant to&#xD;
      RIF-susceptible bacteria in a given specimen. The investigators will adapt a simple and&#xD;
      effective method, similar to their qPCR technology, for detection of mutations in the rpoB&#xD;
      gene. MTB-positive specimens, identified by either qPCR or direct smear, will be screened for&#xD;
      RIF resistance using molecular beacons as probes in qPCR. The concordance between the&#xD;
      molecular beacon-qPCR assays and resistance phenotype from culture will be established. The&#xD;
      investigators will then utilize the capacity of qPCR to quantitate ratios of RIF-resistant to&#xD;
      -sensitive mycobacteria in a clinical specimen. The investigators hypothesize that current&#xD;
      assays are limited to indicating &quot;presence&quot; of drug susceptibility but in the patient the&#xD;
      situation is more complex, with dynamic mixtures of resistant and sensitive bacteria,&#xD;
      depending on local exposure to drugs. Developing a tool that detects minor populations of&#xD;
      drug-resistance cells will open new avenues of investigation to help understand development&#xD;
      of resistance and treatment failures. Primary study outcomes include: anticipation that the&#xD;
      qPCR in blood WBCs will provide substantially improved sensitivity and precision&#xD;
      (mycobacterial species information) in the diagnosis of paucibacillary TB, specifically&#xD;
      tuberculous lymphadenitis, pleural TB and smear-negative (early) pulmonary TB, when compared&#xD;
      with standard microbiological and clinical diagnosis; anticipation that molecular beacon-qPCR&#xD;
      will predict RIF-resistance with 100% sensitivity and at least 86% sensitivity in their study&#xD;
      site, providing a new tool for early suspicion of MDR, and hence, prompt modification in the&#xD;
      treatment schedule of the patient; and investigators will learn about the biology of&#xD;
      emergence of RIF resistance in a population of mycobacteria from serial patient specimens.&#xD;
      Specimens will be collected from patients from 3 sites, all with predominantly Hispanic&#xD;
      populations, located in South Texas, adjacent northeast Mexico, and Colombia. A maximum of&#xD;
      780 males and females, ages 18-85 years, will be recruited. The study population will consist&#xD;
      of 390 people with tuberculosis (62 with TB lymphadenitis, and at most 164 with pleural TB&#xD;
      and 164 with smear-negative pulmonary TB) and 390 controls (either healthy controls or with a&#xD;
      disease initially thought to be one of the three forms of TB described for cases, but then&#xD;
      ruled out). Subjects will have 1 study related visit. Patients will only be contacted,&#xD;
      invited to participate and interviewed at the beginning of their evaluation for possible TB.&#xD;
      The study team will follow-up with the health department to determine if the patient was&#xD;
      indeed diagnosed with TB, and with the laboratory to determine the results of serial direct&#xD;
      smear, culture and sensitivity at diagnosis and during the course of treatment.&#xD;
