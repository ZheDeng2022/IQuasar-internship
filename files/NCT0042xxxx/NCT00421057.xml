      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Determine if a specific exercise regimen (combined strength training/functional endurance)&#xD;
      reduces the level of fatigue among women with breast cancer while undergoing adjuvant or&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment as compared to a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if a specific exercise regimen (combined strength training/functional&#xD;
           endurance) increases the overall ability to perform daily physical activities (ADLs)&#xD;
           among women with breast cancer while undergoing adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
           treatment as compared to a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if a specific exercise regimen (combined strength training/ functional&#xD;
           endurance) increases mobility in women with breast cancer while undergoing adjuvant or&#xD;
           neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment as compared to a control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer-related fatigue has been described as the most common and troubling side effect of&#xD;
      cancer and cancer treatment. Researchers want to see if a strength-training and walking&#xD;
      exercise regimen may help reduce severe fatigue and increase patients' ability to perform&#xD;
      activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete a questionnaire, provide contact&#xD;
      information, and participate in 1 of 2 groups. For the questionnaire, you will be asked&#xD;
      information about your age, ethnic origin, marital status, education, exercise habits, and&#xD;
      cancer diagnosis. It should take about 5 minutes to complete. For the contact information,&#xD;
      you will be asked to provide the name, address, and telephone number of someone to call in&#xD;
      case of an emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the questionnaire and providing the contact information, you will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. Participants in the exercise&#xD;
      group will be taught to perform a specific regimen for strength-training and walking&#xD;
      exercises. Participants in the nonexercise group will follow the usual routines of standard&#xD;
      care but will not be taught to perform a specific regimen for strength-training and walking&#xD;
      exercises. Participants in the nonexercise group will be asked to keep a record of any&#xD;
      exercises that are done for the participant's personal regimen that are not a part of this&#xD;
      study. You will have an equal chance of being assigned to either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in this study will be asked to complete questionnaires (the Schwartz Fatigue&#xD;
      Scale, Karnofsky Performance Scale, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire&#xD;
      [IPAQ]) in the Breast Center Clinic before beginning chemotherapy treatment. The Schwartz&#xD;
      Fatigue Scale and IPAQ will also be completed after chemotherapy treatment. All of these&#xD;
      questionnaires will be used to provide information about your physical activities and how&#xD;
      much time you spend doing them. It should take about 25-30 minutes to complete all 3&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No matter what group you are in, after these questionnaires are completed, a physical&#xD;
      therapist will then escort you to the exercise room located in the Physical Therapy and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Clinic. The therapist will perform a lymphedema (excess fluid collection)&#xD;
      evaluation that will involve measuring the size of your arms and hands by placing a tape&#xD;
      measure around your arms and hands at 5 different points. The lymphedema evaluation will be&#xD;
      done at each clinic visit when you come in for chemotherapy and 2 weeks after completing your&#xD;
      therapy. You will also be asked to complete exercise testing, the Estimated Timed-Get-Up and&#xD;
      Go test (ETGUPGo) and a 6-minute walk test, to check your level of fatigue and physical&#xD;
      ability. This exercise testing will be performed before you begin chemotherapy and within 2&#xD;
      weeks after you finish your last chemotherapy treatment. The exercise testing will be done&#xD;
      after your chemotherapy treatment so that researchers can compare your level of fatigue and&#xD;
      physical performance to what you were experiencing before your therapy began.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ETGUPGo test will measure how fast you can rise from a chair, walk about 4 yards,&#xD;
      turnaround and return to the chair, and sit down. For the 6-minute walk test the therapist&#xD;
      will ask you to walk around in the exercise room at your own pace while the therapist counts&#xD;
      the total time you were able to walk. Two (2) weeks after you have finished all of your&#xD;
      treatments, you will re-take the Schwartz Fatigue Scale, Karnofsky Scale, IPAQ, ETGUPGo, and&#xD;
      6-minute walk test. Your exercise testing will be done in private, which means that no one&#xD;
      other than the study staff will be allowed to enter the room while you are being tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are assigned to the group that will have a specific exercise regimen, you will be&#xD;
      taught a strengthening and walking exercise. For the strengthening regimen, you will be&#xD;
      taught to stretch a Theraband (material that looks like a big rubber band) as far as your&#xD;
      arms or legs can stretch. You will be taught to perform this exercise at home. You will be&#xD;
      able to look at pictures of these exercises in a booklet that will be provided to you. You&#xD;
      will be asked to perform these exercises 3-5 times per week. For the walking regimen, you&#xD;
      will be taught the proper posture for walking for exercise. You must walk at least once per&#xD;
      day, but otherwise you may walk as often and as long as you feel like.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also have exercise testing. The therapist will measure the length of your arms and&#xD;
      legs to see how much force it takes for you to stretch the rubber band beyond the length of&#xD;
      your arms and legs. The therapist will test your current muscle strength by asking you to sit&#xD;
      and rise from a chair, walk a certain distance, and return to the chair. You will also be&#xD;
      asked to walk a certain distance until you get tired. The therapist will record how much time&#xD;
      it takes you to complete both exercises (strengthening and walking).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you begin the exercises at home, the research nurse will call you every 2 weeks and ask&#xD;
      you how many times you performed the strengthening exercises throughout the week as well as&#xD;
      the average amount of time you walked each day. The phone call should last about 10-15&#xD;
      minutes each time. You will be asked to check the box on an exercise calendar (that will be&#xD;
      provided to you) showing which exercises you were able to perform each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All exercise testing will be given on the day of your routine visits to the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation will be complete in this study after you perform your last exercise&#xD;
      testing (about 2 weeks after your last chemotherapy treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. However, if you begin to experience some emotional distress&#xD;
      that is directly related to this study, you may be referred for professional counseling here&#xD;
      at M. D. Anderson in the Social Work Department. The social services staff will be available&#xD;
      to assist you with the referral outside of the M. D. Anderson system. Up to 58 patients will&#xD;
      take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
