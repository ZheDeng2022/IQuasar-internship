  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Child Health Initiative for Lifelong Eating and Exercise (CHILE) is a trans-community&#xD;
      multidisciplinary site-specific intervention and evaluation plan for a Head Start and&#xD;
      family-based culturally and developmentally appropriate intervention. The primary goals are&#xD;
      to increase physical activity and improve dietary intake through increased consumption of&#xD;
      fruits, vegetables and whole grain and decrease consumption of sweetened drinks and high-fat&#xD;
      foods,decrease television and other screen time, and decrease obesity in three to five year&#xD;
      old Hispanic and American Indian children enrolled in Head Start programs in rural New&#xD;
      Mexico. The trans-community intervention includes: A classroom curriculum for children; an&#xD;
      in-service training program for Head Start teachers and educational aides; a school food&#xD;
      service component; a family intervention; a community leader/local health care provider&#xD;
      component; and a grocery store component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants include 16 Head Start programs serving Hispanic and Native American children and&#xD;
      families from underserved communities in rural New Mexico. This is a randomized trial with an&#xD;
      Intervention Condition and Control Condition. One cohort of three-year old Head Start&#xD;
      students will be followed and measured for two years. During the two years in Head Start&#xD;
      those children, their teachers, and families enrolled in the Intervention Condition will&#xD;
      receive a program of activities to modify their dietary, physical activity, and screen&#xD;
      viewing behaviors. Also addressed are the Head Start and community environments and policies,&#xD;
      local grocery stores, and health care providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHILE uses an ecological framework including social cognitive theory, intervention mapping,&#xD;
      environmental and policy changes, developmental theory, and sound educational practices. The&#xD;
      approach includes in from the community to ensure acceptability, cultural appropriateness,&#xD;
      feasibility, sustainability, and later transferability to similar communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures include changes in physical activity levels, dietary fiber&#xD;
      intake, dietary fat intake, intake of sugared drinks, television viewing and other screen&#xD;
      time, in BMI. Secondary measures include changes in the Head Start and community environments&#xD;
      and policies related to physical activity, school food service, school snacks, and&#xD;
      availability of healthful options. We will also examine the role of community leaders,&#xD;
      especially health care providers, in raising awareness and creating a supportive and&#xD;
      sustainable environment for the prevention of obesity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to design, implement, and evaluate a culturally appropriate,&#xD;
      multi-level trans-community obesity prevention for Head Start staff, children, and their&#xD;
      families in rural American Indian and Hispanic communities in New Mexico. The intervention,&#xD;
      Child Health Initiative for Lifelong Eating and Exercise (CHILE) includes policy changes to&#xD;
      address environmental determinants of healthful eating and physical activity behaviors, as&#xD;
      well as individual and interpersonal level strategies to influence behavioral determinants.&#xD;
      CHILE will promote increased moderate to vigorous physical activity; increased consumption of&#xD;
      fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; decreased consumption of sweetened beverages and&#xD;
      high-fat foods; and decreased television viewing and other screen time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will employ a nested design in which 16 Head Start programs are randomly assigned&#xD;
      to the intervention (n=8) or the control condition (n=8). Two cohorts of 3-year-old children&#xD;
      within each Head Start center will be followed for two years post randomization. Participants&#xD;
      will be assessed using a measurement interview protocol a total of four times:&#xD;
      pre-intervention, twice during intervention, and two years post intervention. One of the&#xD;
      midpoint time points will collect height and weight measurements only. This longitudinal&#xD;
      component of the design will allow for an in-depth understanding of the processes at work in&#xD;
      the intervention and an exploration of the hypothesized mediating effects, as well as&#xD;
      potential moderators, such as individual characteristics of participants that may influence&#xD;
      intervention exposure or efficacy. In order to more efficiently address these goals, the&#xD;
      study has been divided into three phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I will take place over the first 16 months of the study. During this time the focus&#xD;
      will be on the identification and recruitment of Head Start centers, formative assessment&#xD;
      with all Head Start centers, randomization of Head Start centers to the intervention or&#xD;
      control condition, obtaining institutional review board approvals, intervention planning with&#xD;
      intervention Head Start centers and their communities, and preparation and pilot testing of&#xD;
      the measurement protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixteen rural Head Start centers in predominately American Indian (6 centers) and Hispanic&#xD;
      (10 centers) communities in NM are being recruited with the assistance of our community&#xD;
      partners and through site visits, phone calls, and letters. In order to participate in this&#xD;
      study, the Head Start Director will sign a memorandum of agreement (MOA), with the&#xD;
      understanding that they may be randomized into an intervention or control condition. The MOA&#xD;
      outlines the responsibilities of the research team and the participating sites and a list of&#xD;
      benefits of participation. Eligibility criteria for Head Start centers will be: a) students&#xD;
      are predominantly American Indian or Hispanic; b) a minimum of 20 3-year olds are enrolled&#xD;
      each year; and c) the center retains at least 80% of its students for two years. Head Start&#xD;
      children and their families will be recruited for CHILE upon their enrollment in the&#xD;
      participating Head Start centers. For Head Start children to be eligible for the study, they&#xD;
      must be enrolled in one of the participating Head Start centers, be 3 years old at baseline,&#xD;
      and have an active consent form completed by their parent or legal guardian. The primary&#xD;
      caregiver for each participating Head Start student will also participate in the study. In&#xD;
      addition, Head Start teachers, aides, and food service workers/cooks affiliated with the 16&#xD;
      Head Start centers will be involved in the study, through participation in intervention&#xD;
      training and implementation, periodic interviews and/or focus groups, and completion of&#xD;
      written logs. In intervention Head Start communities, grocery store managers and owners, as&#xD;
      well as the Head Start teachers, aides, and food service workers/cooks, will be involved in&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formative assessment will take place during the first six months of the study to ensure that&#xD;
      the intervention will meet the needs, context, and the daily realities of working in Head&#xD;
      Start centers and communities in rural New Mexico. Similar to the principles set by the UNM&#xD;
      PRC in other community-based participatory research efforts, and consistent with the aims of&#xD;
      this study, the formative assessment will examine Head Start barriers and resources, and&#xD;
      identify with Head Start staff the opportunities for integrating physical activity and&#xD;
      nutrition into the curricula, food service, and general Head Start environment. The&#xD;
      information gathered during this period will be used to adapt and/or design&#xD;
      developmentally-appropriate, organizationally-feasible physical activity and nutrition&#xD;
      interventions for the schools. Priority will be given to intervention components that have&#xD;
      proven to be feasible in other studies. After developing and signing an MOA with each&#xD;
      intervention and control Head Start center that outlines research study aims and roles and&#xD;
      responsibilities, study staff will use a modified version of the Environmental Checklist&#xD;
      developed for Pathways to identify potential environmental foci for change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observations of Head Start students during recess, before school, at lunch, and at other&#xD;
      &quot;open&quot; times will be conducted by members of the research team at Head Start centers to gain&#xD;
      information about their level and intensity of physical activity during the school day, as&#xD;
      well as to identify locations used for physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, during the formative assessment phase, height and weight data will be collected for&#xD;
      current Head Start students (not study participants), so that Head Start centers can be&#xD;
      grouped by median BMI percentile values for randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the formative assessment, Head Start centers will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention or control condition. To ensure that the baseline average BMI percentile will be&#xD;
      similar in control and intervention groups, Head Start centers will be assigned by a&#xD;
      stratified randomization process. We expect 10 predominantly Hispanic Head Starts and 6&#xD;
      predominantly American Indian Head Starts. Pre-intervention baseline measurements made at&#xD;
      each Head Start center will be used to stratify Head Start centers in each ethnic&#xD;
      subpopulation into lower and upper BMI percentile strata. Random allocation will be used to&#xD;
      assign intervention status in strata defined by BMI and ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the intervention Head Start centers have been determined, intervention planning will be&#xD;
      conducted with these centers. The interventionists will coordinate efforts to integrate Head&#xD;
      Start staff, community leaders, health providers, and grocery store managers and owners in&#xD;
      the strategic planning process for the intervention. The purpose of this phase is to&#xD;
      establish a collaborative relationship with study participants and to ensure that the&#xD;
      intervention materials and curriculum reflect the cultural context of each community. While&#xD;
      the study team has collectively conducted research in many of the proposed communities, it is&#xD;
      essential to establish a participatory framework that can be sustained throughout the&#xD;
      duration of the study and beyond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategies will include: hands-on food preparation and taste-testing of fruits, vegetables,&#xD;
      and whole grain foods; and story telling, poems, songs, games, crafts, and/or puppets to&#xD;
      reinforce familiar and introduce new fruits, vegetables and whole grain foods. Materials will&#xD;
      be sent home with students so that the intervention activities can be reinforced with the&#xD;
      families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Head Start staff play a critical role in the intervention. They will receive in-service&#xD;
      training on a quarterly basis designed to prepare and support them in implementing the&#xD;
      classroom curriculum. We anticipate that frequent training for shorter periods of time than&#xD;
      Pathways teacher training will keep the intervention fresh and the content more manageable.&#xD;
      Topics will include the importance of obesity prevention, the role of fruits, vegetables, and&#xD;
      whole grains in maintaining weight and preventing obesity, the role of physical activity in&#xD;
      maintaining weight and preventing obesity, developmentally appropriate physical activity, and&#xD;
      strategies for limiting television viewing and other screen time. Much of the training will&#xD;
      be hands-on and experiential learning, like many of the activities they will be conducting in&#xD;
      the classroom. We will also work with the Head Start program staff to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of our training sessions contributing to the credentialing process for Head Start&#xD;
      teachers and other staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to use a training program for the Head Start cooks of the intervention schools&#xD;
      similar to the successful school food service training program used with the Pathways&#xD;
      intervention. The focus will be on preparing and serving meals that meet the recently revised&#xD;
      Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2005). Annual training sessions will be reinforced by&#xD;
      monthly visits to each intervention Head Start school. Our experience with the Pathways&#xD;
      program suggests that federally mandated nutrition programs (such as the National School&#xD;
      Lunch and School Breakfast Programs) are not necessarily followed precisely at individual&#xD;
      sites, so we will emphasize the Dietary Guidelines and reinforce the NSLP and SBP&#xD;
      requirements during training sessions and follow-up visits to the centers. As with schools&#xD;
      participating in the Pathways program, we anticipate the training sessions and visits will be&#xD;
      met with enthusiasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To engage family support and involvement in CHILE, the intervention will include both home-&#xD;
      and Head Start-based activities for families. The home-based component will include&#xD;
      activities that parents can do with their children at home, such as preparing healthful&#xD;
      snacks, taking a walk, and playing active games together. These activities will be introduced&#xD;
      at the Family Events, which will be held four times each year, and will be re-enforced with&#xD;
      take home material. Families will be asked to limit television viewing and other screen time&#xD;
      to 2 hours or less per day. This too will be introduced and re-enforced at Family Events.&#xD;
      Family Events will include such activities as hands-on food preparation and taste-testing of&#xD;
      fruits, vegetables, and whole grain foods, label reading, grocery store field trips, &quot;Ask the&#xD;
      Doctor&quot; (a special one-on-one interaction with a local participating health care provider),&#xD;
      and booths demonstrating concepts and content children are learning in the classroom.&#xD;
