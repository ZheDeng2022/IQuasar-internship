  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BMEC-1217B is an abbreviated version of an old Chinese formulation. The ratio of each&#xD;
      component was adopted by the sponsor following the observation that BMEC-1217B prepared from&#xD;
      this ratio resulted in best pharmacological profile and in vitro bioactivities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMEC-1217B was studied for the pharmacological activity on the release of cysteinyl&#xD;
      leukotrienes, IL-4 and TNF-alpha in vitro and the airway hyperreactivity. The result&#xD;
      indicated that BMEC-1217B can inhibit the synthesis of several key pro-inflammatory mediators&#xD;
      involved in the pathophysiology of allergic asthma and can also improve lung function in a&#xD;
      mouse model of allergic asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of increasing dose of&#xD;
      BMEC-1217B when administered orally in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
