      The study will be conducted over 24 weeks on active therapy followed by a four-week&#xD;
      observational visit. The total length of the study will be 28 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur at Screening, Baseline (Week 0), Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 followed&#xD;
      by an observational visit. Additionally, all subjects will be contacted by phone 1 week&#xD;
      following the Baseline visit to ensure daily pain assessments are being recorded. If any&#xD;
      signs or symptoms are reported at the time of the call, an unscheduled study visit will be&#xD;
      conducted to assess whether an infection is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be collected throughout the study.&#xD;

      An Open-label Single Center Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of SILIQ™ (brodalumab) for the&#xD;
      Treatment of Moderate Hidradenitis Suppurativa. In this Single-Center study a total of 20&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized for a period of 24 weeks of treatment, Followed by an&#xD;
      observational four-week post treatment visit. Study visits will occur at Screening ,&#xD;
      Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, Week 24 and Week 28 (4 weeks off&#xD;
      therapy). Additionally, all subjects will be contacted by phone 1 week following the Baseline&#xD;
      visit to ensure daily pain assessments are being recorded. If any signs or symptoms are&#xD;
      reported at the time of the call, an unscheduled study visit will be conducted to assess&#xD;
      whether an infection is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 4 or Week 8, if PGA is greater or equal to 2 points of baseline, antibiotic rescue is&#xD;
      permitted (minocycline or doxycycline up to 100 mg bid).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and efficacy measurements will be performed throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the screening period will be a minimum of 7 days and a maximum of 30 days&#xD;
      during which time all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have up to 30 days to return to the site for the Baseline visit from the date&#xD;
      of the Screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study drug will be administered at the final visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may discontinue treatment at any time during study participation. Subjects who&#xD;
      prematurely discontinue will be asked to complete a early termination visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who initially screen fail for the study may be permitted to re-screen following&#xD;
      re-consent. All screening procedures with the possible exceptions noted below will be&#xD;
      repeated. The subject must meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria at the time&#xD;
      of re-screening in order to qualify for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol of the study will be approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or the&#xD;
      Ethics Committee (EC) of the participating study sites. Depending on the participating&#xD;
      countries both local and central IRB/EC approvals will be granted. The study will be&#xD;
      registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov before the enrollment of the first patient. The trial&#xD;
      will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and all applicable regulatory&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Proportion of subjects achieving Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) at&#xD;
      week 16, defined as a 50% reduction in the total number of abscess and inflammatory nodule&#xD;
      count as long as the fistulae and abcess count remains the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of patients achieving a one point reduction in PGA score at week 16&#xD;
