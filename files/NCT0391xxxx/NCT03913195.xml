    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of 800 mg Trogarzo&#xD;
      once every two weeks administered via &quot;IV Push&quot;. An initial &quot;Sentinel Group&quot; of 5&#xD;
      participants will begin receiving 800mg Trogarzo on a gradual schedule of increasing&#xD;
      concentration and decreasing administration time until undiluted IV Push over 30 seconds is&#xD;
      achieved, while safety and pharmacokinetics are evaluated. If no safety signals are seen, the&#xD;
      Core Group of 15 participants will be enrolled. The Core Group will receive 800mg Trogarzo&#xD;
      via undiluted IV Push over 30 seconds while safety and pharmacokinetics are monitored.&#xD;

      This goal of this Phase 3 is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of administering&#xD;
      Trogarz 800 mg once every two weeks as an undiluted IV Push over 30 seconds in clinically&#xD;
      stable HIV-1 infected patients currently receiving treatment with a stable Trogarz-containing&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first five (5) patients enrolled will comprise the Sentinel Group. Patients six (6)&#xD;
      through twenty (20) (the Core Group) will not be screened until the Sentinel Group has&#xD;
      completed Day 99 (14 weeks) of the study and the DSMB has reviewed the data accumulated and&#xD;
      given approval for enrollment of the Core Group to proceed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sentinel Group will receive 2 successive doses of Trogarzo in accordance with the&#xD;
      prescribing information. Safety and pharmacokinetic data from these administrations will&#xD;
      serve as the comparator for each study participant. Beginning at Day 29 and continuing&#xD;
      through Day 85, Sentinel Group participants will begin receiving the prescribed dosage of&#xD;
      Trogarzo once every two weeks through Day 85 of the study on a schedule of increasing drug&#xD;
      concentration and decreasing administration time at each visit to achieve an undiluted IV&#xD;
      Push administration of Trogarzo over 30 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After review of data from the Sentinel Group by a DSMB, if approved the study will continue&#xD;
      with enrollment of the Core Group. The Core Group will receive 2 successive doses of Trogarzo&#xD;
      in accordance with the prescribing information. Safety and pharmacokinetic data from these&#xD;
      administrations will serve as the comparator for each study participant. Thereafter, Core&#xD;
      Group participants will receive the prescribed dosage of Trogarzo via undiluted IV Push over&#xD;
      30 seconds through Day 71 of the study.&#xD;
