  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted in 64 patients with T1D of which 26 had the onset in 2017, and 38 in&#xD;
      2016, 2015 and 2014. All received vitamin D 1000 IU /day since disease's onset. Moreover in&#xD;
      the 2017 group omega-3 were supplemented, starting within 3 and 6 months from the disease's&#xD;
      outbreak, and those were considered cases; the other 38 were enrolled as controls. Four cases&#xD;
      and one control dropped out. Finally in 59/64 were compared data of glycosylated hemoglobin&#xD;
      percentage (HbA1c%), average insulin daily requirement (IU/Kg/day), and IDAA1c [Insulin Daily&#xD;
      dose Adjusted for HbA1c, a surrogate index of residual endogen insulin secretion, calculated&#xD;
      as insulin daily dose (IU/Kg/24 h) x 4 + HbA1c%] at recruitment (T0), and 3 (T3), 6 (T6), 12&#xD;
      (T12) months after. T0 in cases was at the start of supplementation of omega-3, and&#xD;
      consequently 3, 6 and 12 months after; in controls were found data in clinical records of&#xD;
      outpatient beginning from the 3rd month and 3-6-12 months thereafter. Then 22 cases and 37&#xD;
      controls were compared.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Was assessed the comparability of cases and controls at baseline for gender, age, body&#xD;
      weight, HbA1c% and device for insulin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preparation of omega-3 administered was a highly purified fish oil to avoid pollutants,&#xD;
      containing a mixture of omega-3 long chain fatty acids standardized for contents of&#xD;
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in a 2: 1 ratio, in capsules or in&#xD;
      liquid form. The liquid preparation was used in the case of difficulties in swallowing&#xD;
      capsules or concomitant celiac disease because it was certified as gluten-free (Ener Zone&#xD;
      Omega 3 RX® Equipe Enervit). The preparations contained antioxidants to preserve omega-3&#xD;
      LCFA, tocopherol (1 mg in 1 g of omega-3 LCFA), palmitate, and rosemary extract. EPA and DHA&#xD;
      were administered at 50-60 mg/kg/day for 12 months. The investigation of Arachidonic Acid&#xD;
      (AA)/EPA ratios was performed in cases on recruitment (T0), and repeated after 3 (T3), 6&#xD;
      (T6), and 12 months (T12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholecalciferol supplementation was fixed at 1000 IU/day (25 mcg/day), both in cases and&#xD;
      controls. Vitamin D level was determined as 25(OH)D level at the clinical onset of T1D, at&#xD;
      T0, T3, T6, and T12 in cases, and at clinical onset of controls.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A cohort study was performed in 2017, in all T1D patients 1-18 years old with onset in the years 2014-2017. Supplementation with omega3 was proposed to all subjects with onset in 2017. Patients with onset in 2014-2015-2016 were enrolled only as control subjects. The work was performed on retrospectively collected data in medical records for patients with start of the disease in 2014-2016. Patients enrolled since 2017 have been studied prospectively.</intervention_model_description>
