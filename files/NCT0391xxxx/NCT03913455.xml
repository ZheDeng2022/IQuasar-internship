        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female subjects, age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological or cytological diagnosis of small cell lung cancer. Subjects must have&#xD;
             extensive-stage disease is defined as disease beyond the ipsilateral hemithorax,&#xD;
             mediastinum and ipsilateral supraclavicular area and including malignant pleural or&#xD;
             pericardial effusion or hematogenous metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient should not have received more than 1 prior line of chemotherapy (could have&#xD;
             received immunotherapy which does not count as chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG PS 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease as per RECIST v1.1. Subjects may have bone-only disease. NOTE:&#xD;
             Bone-only subjects are eligible if their disease can be documented/evaluated by bone&#xD;
             scans, CT or MRI. Their disease will be assessed using MD Anderson criteria. NOTE:&#xD;
             Previously irradiated lesions are eligible as a target lesion only if there is&#xD;
             documented progression of the lesion after irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function, as assessed by the following&#xD;
             laboratory requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). For subjects with Gilbert's&#xD;
                  Disease, total bilirubin ≤ 3 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ALT and AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN. For subjects with documented liver metastases, ALT and&#xD;
                  AST ≤ 5×ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤1.5, if not therapeutically anticoagulated.&#xD;
                  Subjects who are being therapeutically anticoagulated may be included provided&#xD;
                  that the anticoagulation regimen is stable and closely monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/minute/1.73 m2 as determined&#xD;
                  using the Cockcroft-Gault formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must not be pregnant or breastfeeding and must have a&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female subjects of child- bearing potential must agree to use an effective&#xD;
             method of birth control from the screening visit through 6 months after the last dose&#xD;
             of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platinum refractory disease defined as disease progression during first line platinum&#xD;
             containing chemotherapy regimen. Progression following platinum based therapy is&#xD;
             allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy with a hypomethylating agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously untreated (non-irradiated), symptomatic brain metastases. No prior&#xD;
             treatment is required for non-symptomatic brain metastases. Previously treated&#xD;
             symptomatic brain metastases are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable or clinically significant concurrent medical condition, psychiatric illness&#xD;
             or social situation that would, in the opinion of the investigator, jeopardize the&#xD;
             safety of a subject and/or their compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant acute infection requiring systemic antibacterial, antifungal,&#xD;
             or antiviral therapy. (Suppressive therapy for chronic infections allowed, for&#xD;
             example: Subjects with HIV/AIDS with adequate antiviral therapy to control viral load&#xD;
             would be allowed. Subjects with viral hepatitis with controlled viral load would be&#xD;
             allowed while on suppressive antiviral therapy.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to (IMP) or components of the study treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treated with any investigational drug within 3 weeks of first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Second malignancy currently requiring active therapy except breast or prostate cancer&#xD;
             stable on or responding to endocrine therapy.&#xD;
