  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multiple-dose trial conducted at a single center. The&#xD;
      treatment period will consist of three 6 g doses (18 g) of ZTI-01 as a 1-hour intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) infusion (+10 minute window). A total of 30 enrolled subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      undergo a single standardized bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at one of five&#xD;
      sampling times. A total of 6 subjects will be assigned to each BAL-sampling time. Up to ten&#xD;
      additional enrolled subjects will act as alternates to obtain 30 evaluable subjects. An&#xD;
      evaluable subject is defined as a subject who receives all doses of ZTI-01, undergoes BAL at&#xD;
      the randomized sampling timepoint with BAL return volume adequate for testing, and undergoes&#xD;
      at least the one blood sampling timepoint that is concurrent with the assigned BAL sampling&#xD;
      timepoint, with blood sampling volume that is adequate for testing. The objectives of the&#xD;
      study are to assess safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) for a multiple dose regimen of&#xD;
      IV-infused ZTI-01.&#xD;
