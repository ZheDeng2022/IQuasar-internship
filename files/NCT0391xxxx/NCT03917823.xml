    <textblock>
      Rib fractures are one of the most common injuries in trauma patients. These fractures are&#xD;
      associated with significant pain as well as decreased ability to inspire deeply or cough to&#xD;
      clear secretions, which together lead to pulmonary complications and a high degree of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Peripheral nerve blocks as well as epidural blocks have been used&#xD;
      with success to improve pain control in rib fracture patients and have been associated with&#xD;
      decreased pulmonary complications and improved outcomes. However, a single-injection nerve&#xD;
      block lasts less than 24 hours; and, even a continuous nerve block is generally limited to&#xD;
      3-4 days. The pain from rib fractures usually persists for multiple weeks or months. In&#xD;
      contrast to local anesthetic-induced nerve blocks, a prolonged block lasting a few&#xD;
      weeks/months may be provided by freezing the nerve using a process called &quot;cryoneurolysis&quot;.&#xD;
      The goal of this randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      potential of cryoanalgesia to decrease pain and improve pulmonary mechanics in patients with&#xD;
      rib fractures.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rib fractures represent a significant source of morbidity in trauma patients, with&#xD;
      approximately 10% of trauma patients presenting with rib fractures.1 Pain from rib fractures&#xD;
      is associated with decreased ability to cough and inspire deeply, predisposing patients to&#xD;
      atelectasis and pulmonary complications. Neuraxial blocks, both thoracic epidurals and&#xD;
      paravertebral blocks, have been associated not only with decreased pain, but also decreased&#xD;
      pulmonary complications and overall mortality in patients with rib fractures.2 Furthermore,&#xD;
      intercostal nerve blocks with local anesthetic have been shown to improve pain scores, peak&#xD;
      expiratory flow rates, and arterial oxygen saturation on room air.3 However, intercostal&#xD;
      nerve blocks are not without risk and incidence of pneumothorax has been reported as 1.4% for&#xD;
      each individual intercostal nerve that is blocked.4 Although it is possible that the use of&#xD;
      in-plane ultrasound guidance may decrease the risk of pneumothorax, this has not been&#xD;
      evaluated. Additionally, intercostal blocks with bupivacaine have been reported to resolve in&#xD;
      as little as six hours,5 likely due to the high vascularity and consequent uptake of local&#xD;
      anesthetic from the intercostal space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative analgesic technique is cryoneurolysis, consisting of the application of&#xD;
      exceptionally low temperatures to reversibly ablate peripheral nerves, resulting in temporary&#xD;
      pain relief termed &quot;cryoanalgesia&quot;.6 The intense cold temperature at the probe tip produces&#xD;
      Wallerian degeneration-a reversible breakdown of the nerve axon-subsequently inhibiting&#xD;
      transmission of afferent and efferent signals. Because the nerve endoneurium, perineurium,&#xD;
      and epineurium remain intact, the axon regenerates along the exoskeleton at a rate of&#xD;
      approximately 1-2 mm/day. While cryoneurolysis of peripheral nerves through surgical&#xD;
      incisions has been commonly used to treat pain since 1961, the development of cryo probes&#xD;
      that may be inserted percutaneously promise a revolution in the use of this modality. The&#xD;
      combination of newly-designed narrow-gauge probes (upper right) and ultrasound now make&#xD;
      percutaneous cryoanalgesia as simple as placing a peripheral nerve block: the probe tip is&#xD;
      inserted adjacent to the target nerve under ultrasound guidance, and a series of 2-minute&#xD;
      freezing cycles are administered followed by probe withdrawal. The procedure is essentially&#xD;
      the same as placing an ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block; however, instead of&#xD;
      injecting local anesthetic, a gas circulates through the probe, inducing cold at the tip and&#xD;
      freezing the target nerve. Nothing remains within the patient and there is no external&#xD;
      equipment to prepare or manage. Importantly, cryoneurolysis and the probes are already&#xD;
      approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acute and&#xD;
      chronic pain, so no additional regulatory approval is required for the proposed clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretical benefits of cryoneurolysis include an ultra-long duration of pain control without&#xD;
      opioid involvement, no catheter management/removal (reducing infection risk), the lack of an&#xD;
      infusion pump and anesthetic reservoir to carry, an extraordinarily-low risk of infection&#xD;
      (approaching zero), and no risk of local anesthetic toxicity, catheter dislodgement or&#xD;
      leakage. With a single 8-minute percutaneous cryoneurolysis procedure consisting of several&#xD;
      freeze/defrost cycles, a truncation of sensory nerve conduction is induced for 6-8 weeks,&#xD;
      with the complete restoration of nerve structure and function following remyelination.&#xD;
      Cryoneurolysis offers the possibility of potent, side effect-free analgesia outlasting the&#xD;
      surgical pain, and obviating the need for postoperative opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects would continue to receive standard and customary analgesics, so there is no risk&#xD;
      of subjects receiving a lower degree of analgesia than if they otherwise did not enroll in&#xD;
      the study. The cryoneurolysis procedure will be done in addition to the investigator's&#xD;
      current UCSD standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 0 Subjects randomized and cryoneurolysis/sham procedure administered&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 0-4, 7, 14, 21, and Months 1, 3, 6 Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be individuals who present to one of the UCSD hospitals with rib fracture(s)&#xD;
      and significant pain. Those who consent to participate in this study will have standard&#xD;
      intercostal nerve blocks administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment group assignment (randomization). Subjects will be allocated to one of two possible&#xD;
      treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. cryoneurolysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. sham procedure (placebo control)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer-generated randomization lists will be used to create sealed, opaque randomization&#xD;
      envelopes with the treatment group assignment enclosed in each envelope labeled with the&#xD;
      randomization number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific intercostal nerves targeted will depend on the injury site. The cryoneurolysis&#xD;
      sites will be cleansed with chlorhexidine gluconate and isopropyl alcohol. Using the optimal&#xD;
      ultrasound transducer for the specific anatomic location and subject anatomy (linear vs&#xD;
      curvilinear array), the target nerves will be identified in a transverse cross-sectional&#xD;
      (short axis) view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cryoneurolysis Procedure: Cryoneurolysis probes are available for a console neurolysis device&#xD;
      (PainBlocker, Epimed, Farmers Branch, Texas) that either (1) pass nitrous oxide to the tip&#xD;
      inducing freezing temperatures; or, (2) vent the nitrous oxide at the base of the probe so&#xD;
      that no gas reaches the probe tip, resulting in no temperature change. The latter is a sham&#xD;
      procedure since without the temperature change, no ice ball forms and therefore the target&#xD;
      nerve is not affected. An angiocatheter/introducer may be inserted beneath the ultrasound&#xD;
      transducer and directed until the probe tip is immediately adjacent to the target nerve&#xD;
      (lidocaine 1% will be administered, as needed, to anesthetize the angiocatheter track). The&#xD;
      target nerves will be the intercostal nerves above and below each fractured rib. The&#xD;
      angiocatheter needle will be removed, leaving the angiocatheter through which the appropriate&#xD;
      Epimed probe will be inserted until it is adjacent to the target nerve. The cryoneurolysis&#xD;
      device will be triggered using 3 cycles of 2-minute gas activation (active or sham) separated&#xD;
      by 1-minute defrost periods. For active probes, the nitrous oxide will be deployed to the tip&#xD;
      where a drop in temperature to -70°C will result in cryoneurolysis. For the sham probes, the&#xD;
      nitrous oxide will be vented prior to reaching the probe shaft, resulting in a lack of&#xD;
      perineural temperature change. The process will be repeated with the same treatment probe for&#xD;
      any additional nerves (e.g., all nerves will receive either active cryoneurolysis or&#xD;
      sham/placebo, and not a mix of the two possible treatments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: The primary endpoint is average pain score the day following treatment.&#xD;
      The primary inference will be based on the Mann-Whitney U test of the difference between&#xD;
      groups with an exact test with two-sided Type I error of 5%. Highest spirometry reading for&#xD;
      each period of time will be the secondary end point of highest interest [so designated after&#xD;
      the 4th subject was enrolled on September 23, 2019].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient baseline characteristics will be summarized by group with mean, standard deviation,&#xD;
      quartiles, range, and boxplots for continuous data; and counts and percentages for binary and&#xD;
      categorical data. Group differences will be assessed with Mann-Whitney U test for continuous&#xD;
      data and Pearson chi-square test for categorical data. If any key characteristics are&#xD;
      significantly different between groups, a proportional odds model will be used to test for a&#xD;
      group difference in the primary outcome adjusting for the potential confounding variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot parameters for sample size justification are based on Osinowo et al (2004).3 Of the&#xD;
      initial pain scores for n=21 patients, n=18 (86%) had scores of 3.0 and n=3 (14%) had scores&#xD;
      of 2.0 (mean 2.86 ± 0.36). After 24 hours n=13 (62%) had scores of 0 and n=8 (38%) had scores&#xD;
      of 1.0 (mean 0.38 ± 0.50).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To simulate power with Mann-Whitney U test, we simulate controls groups assuming the&#xD;
      distribution of initial average pain scores from Osinowo et al. scores in the cryoneurolysis&#xD;
      groups are simulated assuming a score distribution 10% 0, 15% 1, 25% 2, and 50% 3 (resulting&#xD;
      in mean 2.12 ± 1.04 compared to control group mean 2.86 ± 0.36).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under these assumptions a sample size of n=25 per group attains power 84% with two-sided Type&#xD;
      I error 5%. To allow for drop-outs, we will enroll up to a maximum of 60 subjects.&#xD;
