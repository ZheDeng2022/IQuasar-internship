      This is a single arm window of opportunity trial conducted in patients with early stage&#xD;
      triple negative breast tumors to evaluate if treatment with a Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase&#xD;
      (PARP) inhibitor will increase expression of programmed cell death-1 with ligand (PD-L1) in&#xD;
      triple negative breast tumors.&#xD;

      This is a single arm window of opportunity trial conducted in patients with early stage&#xD;
      triple negative breast tumors. Patients who are planning to undergo surgery as part of their&#xD;
      initial treatment will be eligible for this study. They will be treated with single agent&#xD;
      rucaparib for 3 weeks and then proceed to surgery. Core-biopsies obtained at the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis and tumor from the surgical resection will be assessed for change in expression of&#xD;
      PD-L1 by Immunohistochemical assay (IHC).&#xD;
