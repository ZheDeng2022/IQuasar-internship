      : GREFFE_ELASTO IRM will evaluate Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) in renal transplant&#xD;
      patients with suspected interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy lesions requiring biopsy graft&#xD;
      sampling under ultrasound control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to search a correlation between renal graft parenchymal elasticity&#xD;
      values obtained in vivo by MRE, and the histological data of renal fibrosis by biopsy&#xD;
      sampling, and providing a non-invasive tool capable of detecting and monitoring this&#xD;
      development over time, making possible in the future to reduce the number of renal biopsies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The natural history of interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA) is a common mechanism of&#xD;
      disease progression of transplanted kidneys. The process has been well studied through&#xD;
      protocol biopsies. The early phase is characterized by fibrogenesis and the emergence of&#xD;
      tubulo-interstitial damage due to immunologic phenomena; the late phase is characterized by&#xD;
      the worsening of parenchymal lesions and the occurrence of glomerular sclerosis leading to&#xD;
      graft loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, non-invasive markers of these pathological changes are missing and the protocol&#xD;
      biopsies are still the only reliable tool for the diagnosis of IF/TA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elasticity imaging has already been proven in the management of chronic liver diseases with&#xD;
      Fibroscan. In the field of renal diseases, several studies have been carried out in&#xD;
      ultrasound elastography on renal grafts but the renal elastography is more difficult due to&#xD;
      the complexity of the kidney (deep organ, two compartments, high vascularity). All these&#xD;
      parameters have an influence on the elasticity measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elastography imaging is also performed in MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging): The Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Elastography (MRE). MRE is less subject to variations in depth, to the experience&#xD;
      of the operator and to allow an overall evaluation of the graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potentially eligible patients will be recruited by the nephrologist during a consultation&#xD;
      in which renal biopsy is scheduled (as part of current practice). Patients meeting the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and having no exclusion criteria will be offered to participate in this&#xD;
      study. If accepted, the only examination specific to this research, the MRE, will be&#xD;
      scheduled to be performed the same day as the renal biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This MRE is painless, non-irradiating, and does not require the injection of contrast medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participation of the patient ends when he leaves the hospital after the biopsy procedure.&#xD;
