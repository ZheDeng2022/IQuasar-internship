      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Umbralisib as a treatment for&#xD;
      any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has approved Rituximab as a treatment option for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Umbralisib is an investigational drug which blocks a protein called PI3K. PI3K is a protein&#xD;
      that plays a role in the way cells grow. In this type of cancer, PI3K is increased and more&#xD;
      active than usual. This helps the cancer cells to grow and survive. Early clinical trials&#xD;
      have shown that Umbralisib can kill cancer cells in some patients and cause their tumors to&#xD;
      shrink.&#xD;

             hepatitis B vaccination; or positive serum Hepatitis B antibody) or chronic active&#xD;
             Hepatitis C infection (HCV), active cytomegalovirus (CMV), or known history of HIV. If&#xD;
             HBc antibody is positive, the patient must be evaluated for the presence of HBV DNA&#xD;
             (by PCR). If HCV antibody is positive, the subject must be evaluated for the presence&#xD;
             of HCV RNA by PCR. If the patient is CMV IgG or CMV IgM positive, the subject must be&#xD;
             evaluated for the presence of CMV DNA by PCR. Patients with positive HBc antibody and&#xD;
             negative HBV DNA via PCR are eligible, but prophylaxis with entecavir or lamivudine is&#xD;
             recommended. Subjects who are CMV IgG or CMV IgM positive but who are CMV DNA negative&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic, or history of documented congestive heart failure (New York Heart&#xD;
             Association functional classification III-IV [see Appendix: NYHA Classifications])&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias,&#xD;
             CHF, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant use of medication known to cause QT prolongation or torsades de pointes&#xD;
             should be used with caution and at investigator discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poorly controlled or clinically significant atherosclerotic vascular disease including&#xD;
             cerebrovascular accident (CVA), transient ischemic attack (TIA), symptomatic&#xD;
             peripheral arterial disease, angioplasty, cardiac or vascular stenting within 6 months&#xD;
             of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;

             steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, ongoing extrahepatic obstruction caused by&#xD;
             stones, cirrhosis of the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because rituximab is an agent with known&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with rituximab or umbralisib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with rituximab or umbralisib. These potential risks may also apply&#xD;
             to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
