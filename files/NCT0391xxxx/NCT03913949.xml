    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic properties of APG-2575 in patients with relapse or refractory chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia and non-hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, single-agent, open-label, Phase I study of APG-2575. The study&#xD;
      consists of the dose escalation stage and the dose expansion stage. APG-2575 will be&#xD;
      administered orally, once daily for consecutive 4 weeks as one cycle. Initially, the start&#xD;
      dose is 20mg. Single patient cohorts will be evaluated, the dose of APG-2575 will be&#xD;
      increased in subsequent cohorts, to 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 600mg and 800mg&#xD;
      accordingly. If there is any one of the following event is observed, a dose-limiting toxicity&#xD;
      (DLT), two drug related Grade 2 toxicities or one drug related ≥ Grade 3 toxicity, or&#xD;
      laboratory or clinical tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), or suspected hypersensitivity reaction&#xD;
      occur in Cycle 1, the dose escalation will convert to the standard 3+3 design, If ≥ 2/6&#xD;
      patients develop DLT at any dose level dose escalation will cease and the dose level&#xD;
      immediately below will be expanded to 6 patients. If ≤ 1/6 patients develop a DLT at the&#xD;
      highest dose reached this will be declared the MTD. After the MTD/Recommended Phase II Dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) is defined, a maximum of 40 patients will be treated at that dose level.&#xD;
