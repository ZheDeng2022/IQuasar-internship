      This is a multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, parallel group, multiple-dose study to&#xD;
      assess the pharmacokinetic, safety, and tolerability of balovaptan in male and female&#xD;
      subjects with moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects with normal hepatic&#xD;
      function matched by age (±10 years), sex, and body mass index (BMI; ±20%).&#xD;
