  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Artery Compliance measurements will be obtained with the Respirix device in&#xD;
      patients with congestive heart failure decompensation. Echocardiogram, weight measurements,&#xD;
      and BNP will also be gathered as independent measures of decompensation in the clinic.&#xD;
      Pulmonary Artery Compliance measurements will be made daily during the hospital stay.&#xD;
      Patients can continue using the device at home for the next 3 weeks. Each patient will serve&#xD;
      as their own control and relative changes from their baseline will be recorded for each&#xD;
      parameter.&#xD;
