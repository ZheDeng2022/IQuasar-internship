  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a First-in-Human, single site, prospective, randomized, controlled evaluation&#xD;
      of the safety and effectiveness of the Healionics STARgraft AV hemodialysis access graft. The&#xD;
      STARgraft has been demonstrated in preclinical studies to have improved resistance to the&#xD;
      common failure mode of venous anastomosis stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance of the STARgraft AV will be compared against control implants of commercially&#xD;
      available standard ePTFE grafts approved for the same use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is enrolling patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis&#xD;
      via a prosthetic vascular graft. The study proposes to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demonstrate improved primary patency of the investigational STARgraft AV compared to the&#xD;
           ePTFE controls over a period of 6 months, with extended results to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Verify safety of the STARgraft AV multilayer construction in extended vascular access&#xD;
           use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is intended to enroll 25 subjects each for the investigational devices and the controls&#xD;
      respectively (50 total) with randomized device allocation at subject presentation for implant&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
