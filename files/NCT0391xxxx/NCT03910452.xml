  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CGD causes infections and inflammation. The only cure currently is a bone marrow transplant.&#xD;
      Most often a perfectly matched bone marrow donor is used. Researchers want to see if they can&#xD;
      lower the risks of using a mismatched donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if it is safe to use a related bone marrow donor who is only a partial match to a&#xD;
      person with CGD. To see how well drugs given to a person before and after transplant help the&#xD;
      body accept the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 4-65 with CGD for whom stem cell transplant may be a cure and who do not have a&#xD;
      perfectly matched donor, related or unrelated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the hospital about 2 weeks before the transplant. They will&#xD;
      have blood, urine, breathing, and heart tests. They may have CT and/or MRI scans. They will&#xD;
      have a needle inserted into their hipbone to remove marrow. They will have dental,&#xD;
      neurologic, and psychologic tests. They will have a central catheter placed: A line will be&#xD;
      placed into a vein in their upper chest. They will get drugs, chemotherapy, and radiation to&#xD;
      prepare for the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the donated cells through their catheter. The cells will be from&#xD;
      one of their relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in the hospital about 6 weeks after the transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After they leave the hospital, participants will have to stay in the area with visits about 2&#xD;
      times a week for approximately 100 days post transplant. Then visits will be every 3 to 6&#xD;
      months for 2 years. Then visits will be once a year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic transplant using human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched donors, both related and&#xD;
      unrelated, has proven curative for patients with various immunodeficiencies, including those&#xD;
      with ongoing infections. However, donor availability remains a limiting factor in the&#xD;
      application of this treatment modality. For this protocol, a haploidentical donor is a&#xD;
      related donor with more than 1 HLA antigen mismatch. The use of haploidentical related donors&#xD;
      has in the past been fraught with a greater rate of complications related to both higher&#xD;
      rates of graft versus host disease (GvHD) and delayed immunorecovery. Newer transplant&#xD;
      regimens appear to have diminished these risks and improved outcomes. We propose using a&#xD;
      reduced intensity novel conditioning regimen using alemtuzumab, targeted busulfan, and low&#xD;
      dose total body irradiation (see schema below) followed by post-transplant cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      for patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) who do not have an HLA matched donor&#xD;
      but whose circumstances necessitate the use of a potentially curative, albeit high-risk&#xD;
      treatment modality. However, patients with CGD have high rates of Crohn s Disease-like&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease, predominantly colitis, where uncontrolled severe IBD may increase&#xD;
      risk of GvHD. For this reason, the first 10 patients enrolled will exclude those deemed to&#xD;
      have intestinal inflammation in the severe category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the study design, the protocol will enroll patients sequentially.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have sufficient complications from underlying disease to warrant undergoing&#xD;
             transplantation. (History of one or more life threatening infection. Ongoing&#xD;
             inflammation. Oxidase level of quartile 1 or 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are deemed to have colitis in the severe category (severe colitis) as&#xD;
             defined below in the Subject Exclusion Criteria, who are at high risk for GvHD, will&#xD;
             be included in enrollment to the protocol after 10 patients have completed the&#xD;
             protocol regimen successfully. Patients among the first 10 may have colitis that is&#xD;
             not deemed in the severe category. The success of the regimen will be determined as&#xD;
             engraftment with a maximum GvHD of grade 2 (See the exclusion criteria for patients&#xD;
             with severe colitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are 4 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HLA mismatched related (more than 1 mismatch) donor graft available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to comprehend and willingness to sign the informed consent or have a&#xD;
             parent/guardian consent if the donor is a minor; assent being obtained from minors as&#xD;
             appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be HIV negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be able to stay within one hour s travel of the NIH for the first 3 months after&#xD;
             transplantation and have a family member or other designated companion to stay with&#xD;
             during the post-transplant period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must provide a durable power of attorney for health care decisions to an appropriate&#xD;
             adult relative or guardian in accordance to NIH Form-200 NIH Durable Power of Attorney&#xD;
             for Health Care Decision Making.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Where appropriate, subjects must agree to use contraception for 3 months&#xD;
             post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: Alemtuzumab (IV formulation) is no longer distributed commercially. In order to&#xD;
        receive product, the physician must contact the program for the patient. If the subject is&#xD;
        not willing to consent to submit their info (address, date of birth and gender) to the&#xD;
        program such that we can obtain the drug, then we cannot proceed with conditioning&#xD;
        therefore no transplant will occur on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participation of Women:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contraception: The effects of the combination of conditioning medications (alemtuzumab,&#xD;
        busulfan, cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil) and total body irradiation on the&#xD;
        developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, men and women of childbearing&#xD;
        potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth&#xD;
        control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for at least one year post transplant.&#xD;
        Females of childbearing-age must have a negative pregnancy test result prior to receiving&#xD;
        any chemotherapy or conditioning agents. During the course of the study, if a woman becomes&#xD;
        pregnant or suspects she is pregnant, she should inform the study staff and her primary&#xD;
        care physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participation of Children:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children greater than or equal to 4 years of age may participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject cannot have a 9/10 or 10/10 HLA matched related or unrelated donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) or equivalent performance status greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with inflammatory bowel disease deemed in the severe category (severe&#xD;
             colitis), because they are at higher risk for GvHD, will be excluded from the protocol&#xD;
             until there are 10 patients without severe colitis that have successfully completed a&#xD;
             regimen, as determined by engraftment and acute GvHD of a maximum of grade 2. Severity&#xD;
             of colitis will be determined in consultation with a gastroenterologist specialist.&#xD;
             However, severe colitis will be evaluated within 4 months of transplant and defined as&#xD;
             any of the following (where this screening may be performed on a natural history or&#xD;
             screening protocol):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The consultant gastroenterologist clinically determines that the patient has&#xD;
                  severe colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient adult CDAI score is in the 350-450 range and Pediatric CDAI score is&#xD;
                  greater than 30 within the month before initiation of conditioning Crohn s&#xD;
                  Disease Activity Index (CDAI) for transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient has been requiring 1 mg/kg/day or more of prednisone or equivalent&#xD;
                  steroid for control of colitis within 1 month of the CDAI scoring used to&#xD;
                  determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient requires continuing treatment with a biologic that consists of&#xD;
                  anti-TNF alpha (e.g. infliximab, Humira, certolizumab and others of this family),&#xD;
                  anti-interleukin 12 (e.g. Ustekinumab) or anti-integrin (e.g. Vedolizumab) for&#xD;
                  control of colitis within 2 months of the CDAI scoring used to determine&#xD;
                  eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If the patient had a colonoscopy within 6 months of transplant which revealed&#xD;
                  findings of a simplified endoscopic score of Crohn s Disease (SES-CD) greater&#xD;
                  than 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Transaminases &gt; 5x upper limit of normal based on the participant s clinical situation&#xD;
             and at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric disorder or mental deficiency severe enough as to make compliance with the&#xD;
             HSCT treatment unlikely, and/or making regulatorily and legally effective informed&#xD;
             consent impossible. This will include adult patients that are unable to consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major anticipated illness or organ failure incompatible with survival from AlloPBSC&#xD;
             transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled seizure disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants older than 65 are excluded. It is known from standard transplantation&#xD;
             that these participants have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality related to&#xD;
             transplantation. Given the investigational nature of this protocol, the risk benefit&#xD;
             ratio is not warranted to include these participants at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are not willing to submit their information as part of the&#xD;
             alemtuzumab (Campath ) Distribution Program application or participants whom the&#xD;
             Distribution Program committee has determined are not qualified to receive&#xD;
             alemtuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition or circumstance, which the Principal Investigator (PI) feels, would&#xD;
             create difficulty in maintaining compliance with the requirements of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any active infectious disease, whether CGD-related or not, that is deemed to be&#xD;
             incompatible with successful tolerance to the rigors of transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  C-reactive protein of greater than 100 Units within 6 weeks of anticipated transplant.&#xD;
