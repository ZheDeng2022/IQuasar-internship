  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed to determine the feasibility of providing a mindfulness&#xD;
      meditation program to patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma during standard of care&#xD;
      chemoradiation. Newly diagnosed malignant glioma patients will participate in six 1-hour&#xD;
      mindfulness sessions over the phone, followed by one 1-hour in-person mindfulness session.&#xD;
      Patients will complete various Quality of Life questionnaires and distress measuring tools&#xD;
      prior to initiating the mindfulness sessions, at the clinic visit following the mindfulness&#xD;
      intervention, and ~2 months after completing the mindfulness intervention. Additionally,&#xD;
      patients will be provided with supplemental materials including website references and guided&#xD;
      audiotape meditations to guide their individual practice outside of the weekly guided&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of a mindfulness meditation&#xD;
      intervention program, designed to mitigate the distress associated with the disease and first&#xD;
      line treatment of patients with malignant glioma, and to determine whether it merits&#xD;
      additional research in a subsequent trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no risks associated with participation in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifteen newly diagnosed WHO grade III or IV malignant glioma patients will be enrolled to&#xD;
      this pilot feasibility study. Following completion of informed consent, patients will&#xD;
      complete a baseline assessment consisting of various QoL/distress assessments including the&#xD;
      Trail Making Test, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog),&#xD;
      the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness&#xD;
      Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br), the&#xD;
      Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire - short form (FFMQ-SF), the Functional Assessment of&#xD;
      Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being (FACIT-Sp12), the NCCN Distress Thermometer with&#xD;
      Symptom Inventory, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). They will then begin&#xD;
      the mindfulness intervention, consisting of six weekly telephone-based mindfulness sessions&#xD;
      followed by one in-person mindfulness session. Post-treatment measures and an Exit Survey&#xD;
      will be administered following the one in-person mindfulness session. Two months later, the&#xD;
      QoL, cognition and distress assessments will be repeated and a Final Exit Survey will be&#xD;
      administered. The Exit Survey will ask the patient about their individual mindfulness&#xD;
      practice during the intervention, their intention to continue the practice beyond&#xD;
      participation in this study, their satisfaction with the services received, and their&#xD;
      perception of the effectiveness of the program. The Final Exit Survey will ask the patient&#xD;
      about their mindfulness practice since the Exit Survey, and their intention to continue with&#xD;
      the mindfulness practice. The investigators will also collect demographic data such as age,&#xD;
      marital status, education, employment, date of diagnosis and death, tumor grade, histology,&#xD;
      and type of treatment from the patient.&#xD;
