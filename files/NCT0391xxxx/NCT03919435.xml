  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; Wegener's) is a multi-organ autoimmune disease&#xD;
      characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and vasculitis. Upper respiratory&#xD;
      involvement occurs in up to 90% of patients with GPA and is often the first manifestation of&#xD;
      the disease. Patients with upper respiratory tract disease are more at risk of local and&#xD;
      systemic relapse. Microbial organisms may be involved in inducing disease activity in GPA.&#xD;
      Previous culture-dependent studies found that patients with GPA were more likely to be&#xD;
      chronic nasal carriers of Staphylococcus aureus compared to non-GPA chronic rhinosinusitis&#xD;
      and healthy controls; additionally, GPA patients with S. aureus colonization are more likely&#xD;
      to experience a future relapse. This led to a randomized placebo-controlled trial of&#xD;
      trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) which showed this antibiotic/antifungal was effective&#xD;
      in preventing relapse in GPA. Whether the benefits of TMP-SMX are related to its&#xD;
      antimicrobial properties versus anti-inflammatory effects is still unknown. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to prospectively evaluate the changes in the nasal microbiome, mycobiome, and&#xD;
      host immunity in patients with GPA before, during, and after receipt of TMP-SMX for 4 weeks.&#xD;
      The target enrollment number is 30 participants, and the investigators will include patients&#xD;
      seen at the Penn Vasculitis Center with GPA (diagnosed according to the American College of&#xD;
      Rheumatology Classification Criteria or based on investigator's judgment). To analyze nasal&#xD;
      microbiome and host immunity, participants will be swabbed with nasal swab and cytobrush for&#xD;
      DNA sequencing and other studies. An optional research blood draw is also included. The&#xD;
      investigators and coordinators will follow each patient longitudinally over a 6-month period.&#xD;
