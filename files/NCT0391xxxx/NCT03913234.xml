    <textblock>
      Survival benefit and quality of life are two key elements that should be kept in mind in the&#xD;
      treatment of metastatic breast cancer. In this regards, endocrine therapy (ET) is strongly&#xD;
      recommended in hormone receptor (HR) positive patients unless there is visceral crisis even&#xD;
      though there is no concrete evidence that it is better than chemotherapy in terms of&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HER2 positive breast cancer is a subtype of breast cancer that showed the greatest&#xD;
      improvement in terms of survival during the last decade due to trastuzumab based therapy.&#xD;
      Recently, taxane and HER2 directed doublet including trastuzumab and pertuzumab (THP) is&#xD;
      considered as standard of therapy based upon randomized phase 3 clinical trial (CLEOTATRA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HER2 positive breast cancer can be divided into HER2 enriched subgroup (HR-HER2+) and luminal&#xD;
      B subgroup (HR+HER2+) in biologic viewpoint because they are distinctly different subgroups&#xD;
      in gene expression analysis. Accordingly, we are currently treating biologically different&#xD;
      subtypes in a same way, which is CTx and anti-HER2 combination therapy (THP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Luminal HER2+ subgroup has actually been tested with endocrine therapy (ET) and anti-HER2&#xD;
      therapy showed better PFS than ET alone (TAnDEM trial and trial comparing lapatinib plus&#xD;
      letrozole versus letrozole alone) [2],[3] confirming existence of cross talk between ER and&#xD;
      HER2 pathways in clinical setting. However, the combination regimen between ET and anti-HER2&#xD;
      therapy is not widely used in current practice in ER+HER2+ MBC patients because PFS seemed to&#xD;
      be relatively shorter compared with chemotherapy based combination with anti-HER2 therapy&#xD;
      even though several guidelines recommend it to be used as an initial treatment unless there&#xD;
      is visceral crisis as they recommended ET alone first in ER+HER2- MBC (NCCN 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, various CDK4/6 inhibitors including palbociclib, abemaciclib, and ribociclib were&#xD;
      approved by FDA based on the clinical trial results demonstrating prolonged PFS over ET alone&#xD;
      when it was combined with ET in ER+ advanced breast cancer [4]. In PALOMA 2 biomarker study,&#xD;
      it was beneficial regardless of ER and Ki67 expression status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reflecting quite durable PFS prolongation (10 month in PALOMA2) shown in ER+ disease (luminal&#xD;
      A and luminal B subtype except HR+HER2+ patients) with CDK4/6 inhibitor on top of ET, the&#xD;
      hypothesis of this trial is whether CDK4/6 inhibitor could prolong survival in luminal HER2&#xD;
      breast cancer as it did in ER+HER2-patients. In preclinical study, palbociclib showed&#xD;
      activity in not only ER+ cell lines but also HER2 positive cell lines [5]. Also, in phase Ib&#xD;
      trial, a CDK4/6 inhibitor from Lilly, abemaciclib showed acceptable toxicity with endocrine&#xD;
      therapy or trastuzumab with response rate of around 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, as of today, it could be justified and warranted to conduct a prospective trial of&#xD;
      ribocicib+letrozole+trastuzumab in order to take a look at its efficacy and toxicity in&#xD;
      HR+HER2 + advanced breast cancer.&#xD;

      This trial is performed in a multicenter, single-group, and phases IB and II clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-group clinical trial of the effects of ribociclib, letrozole and trastuzumab&#xD;
      in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2+ advanced breast cancer. This trial consists of two&#xD;
      parts. The first part is a phase IB study of increasing the dose of ribociclib from 200mg to&#xD;
      600mg in combination with letrozole 2.5mg and trastuzumab (8mg/kg followed by 6mg/kg every 3&#xD;
      weeks). In phase IB study, three to six patients will be enrolled for each dose group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the IB phase ends, patient enrollment will be discontinued for intermediate safety&#xD;
      analysis, and after DLT analysis will determine recommended phase II phase II part will be&#xD;
      started. The recommended phase II dose of ribocicib determined in phase IB part with&#xD;
      ribociclib and trastuzumab (8mg/kg followed by 6mg/kg every 3 weeks) will be administered.&#xD;
      Treatment is discontinued in the following cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncontrolled toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawal of consent In phase II part, 61 patients will be enrolled and the first 20&#xD;
           patients will be analyzed for run-in phase to confirm the safety of the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of treatment cycle, the disease will be evaluated in the same manner as the method&#xD;
      used at the time of registration at intervals of 8 weeks for the first 18 months and at&#xD;
      intervals of 12 weeks after that. If the progress of the disease is clinically suspected,&#xD;
      additional tests can be performed&#xD;
