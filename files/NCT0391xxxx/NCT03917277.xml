  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erysipelas-like erythema (ELE) and arthritis are common manifestations affecting the ankle in&#xD;
      Familial Mediterranean Fever. Musculoskeletal ultrasound examination of the ankle has never&#xD;
      been performed during an episode of ELE. We hypothesize that ELE is associated with&#xD;
      underlying musculoskeletal pathology. In order to support this hypothesis, ankle&#xD;
      musculoskeletal ultrasound will be performed within 24 hours of onset of ELE in 15 patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with FMF. Results will be correlated with clinical parameters, serum inflammatory&#xD;
      markers, and ankle radiography.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Erysipelas-like erythema (ELE) is the pathognomonic cutaneous manifestation of familial&#xD;
      Mediterranean fever (FMF). It typically presents with painful, well-demarcated, and&#xD;
      unilateral erythema overlying the ankle, and resolves spontaneously within 24 to 72 hours.&#xD;
      Its incidence varies from 1% to 48% in the literature, depending on gender and ethnicity.&#xD;
      Joint involvement during FMF is more common than ELE, affecting between 17% and 77% of&#xD;
      patients. It is most often monoarticular and involves the ankles in almost half of cases.&#xD;
      Concomitant ELE is described in up to 43% of patients. However, the overlap between the&#xD;
      clinical presentation of ELE and ankle arthritis in FMF poses a diagnostic challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Musculoskeletal ultrasound is a simple and sensitive technique for the evaluation of&#xD;
      articular and peri-articular structures. Only one study described sonographic articular&#xD;
      involvement in FMF. In 29 asymptomatic patients, an increased prevalence of knee effusion,&#xD;
      retrocalcaneal bursitis and medial tenosynovitis of the ankle was noted compared with the&#xD;
      control group. Irrespective of joint involvement, an increased prevalence of enthesopathy has&#xD;
      also been documented by ultrasound in patients with FMF, thus strengthening its association&#xD;
      with spondyloarthropathy. However, no study has evaluated by ultrasound the articular and&#xD;
      peri-articular involvement of the ankle during an episode of ELE. To date, the treatment of&#xD;
      ELE involves ankle offloading and administration of analgesics. By allowing a better&#xD;
      understanding of its pathogenesis, sonographic confirmation of articular and peri-articular&#xD;
      involvement of the ankle during an episode of ELE will potentially allow to optimize its&#xD;
      therapeutic management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population involves over 600 patients with FMF followed at Tenon Hospital, which is&#xD;
      part of the French Reference center for rare auto-inflammatory diseases and amyloidosis&#xD;
      (CEREMAIA). Eligible patients will be contacted by mail or email to inform them of the study.&#xD;
      Those interested in participating will be advised to contact the investigators by email or&#xD;
      phone at the onset of ELE. Patients presenting with ELE during their visit in the internal&#xD;
      medicine department of Tenon Hospital will also be screened for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A visit between the participant and attending physician will be scheduled within 24 hours of&#xD;
      the onset of ELE. The usual management of ELE will not be altered. The visit will include a&#xD;
      questionnaire and physical examination to assess the presence of typical manifestations of&#xD;
      FMF attacks, such as chest and/or abdominal pain, as well as to exclude systemic toxicity in&#xD;
      favor of an alternative infectious diagnosis. It will involve a blood test for complete blood&#xD;
      count and C-reactive protein measurement to confirm the inflammatory syndrome, as well as an&#xD;
      x-ray of the ankles to exclude an underlying structural pathology. Analgesics will be&#xD;
      prescribed for symptomatic relief. The patient will be advised to go the emergency room if&#xD;
      ELE and/or fever persist beyond 72 hours, or if symptoms suggestive of an infectious process&#xD;
      develop (significant worsening of general state, cardiorespiratory symptoms, pre-syncope or&#xD;
      syncope, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion visit for the study will be integrated to this medical consultation. Once free&#xD;
      and informed consent is obtained, the following clinical data will be collected: age, sex,&#xD;
      weight, height, body mass index, ethnicity, age at onset of FMF symptoms, age at diagnosis of&#xD;
      FMF, genotype, frequency of attacks, diagnosis of amyloidosis, spondyloarthropathy,&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease and/or vasculitis, previous episodes of ankle arthritis, duration&#xD;
      and location of ELE at inclusion, total duration of ELE, presence of fever, serositis and/or&#xD;
      myalgia, and current treatment for FMF. In search of potential confounding factors for&#xD;
      sonographic musculoskeletal abnormalities, the following data will also be collected:&#xD;
      professional occupation, physical activity (type and frequency), presence of pes planus or&#xD;
      cavus, pre-existing ankle pain, and chronic ankle edema. Sonographic evaluation of the&#xD;
      articular and periarticular structures of the two ankles will be performed using the Samsung&#xD;
      UGEO H60 echograph, in operation since 2016. In order to ensure reproducibility, the&#xD;
      evaluation will be completed by a single examiner throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the inclusion visit, a follow-up by email or phone will be done within one week of&#xD;
      inclusion in order to confirm the exact duration of ELE. This information will allow us to&#xD;
      confirm the diagnosis of ELE, which normally resolves spontaneously within 72 hours, in&#xD;
      contrast to its main differential diagnosis, namely erysipelas. Thereafter, there will be no&#xD;
      additional follow-up as part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient inclusion phase will last 8 months, followed by 3 months of data analysis. We&#xD;
      estimate that 8 months will be sufficient to recruit 15 patients among our study population.&#xD;
      The number 15 was arbitrarily chosen because FMF is a rare disease, and the incidence of ELE&#xD;
      in this population is highly variable and therefore poorly defined in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding data analysis, clinical, biological, radiographic and sonographic data will be&#xD;
      presented as medians (± interquartile interval) when these are continuous variables, and as&#xD;
      absolute numbers with proportion when these are categorical variables. Sonographic and&#xD;
      radiographic findings will be compared between the ankles ipsilateral and contralateral to&#xD;
      ELE. Continuous variables will be compared with the Mann-Whitney test. Categorical variables&#xD;
      will be compared with the Fisher test. In order to determine whether clinical and&#xD;
      paraclinical parameters are correlated with the presence of sonographic musculoskeletal&#xD;
      pathologies, univariate and multivariate analyses will be performed using a logistic&#xD;
      regression model. A p value ≤ 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
