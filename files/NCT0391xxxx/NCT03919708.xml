  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to compare the accuracy of two products at detecting amblyopia&#xD;
      and strabismus in children. The devices will be Rebiscan's &quot;blinq&quot; (Pediatric Vision Scanner;&#xD;
      PVS) and Rebiscan's RBI (Retinal Birefringence Imager).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rebiscan is proposing a two-cohort study. The first cohort will include a population enriched&#xD;
      for pathology in amblyopia to best assess device sensitivity, while a second cohort will be&#xD;
      based in a primary care setting to best assess device specificity. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in busy, ethnically and economically diverse cites affiliated with the Retina&#xD;
      Foundation of the Southwest (RFSW) in greater Dallas, TX area. Each child will be screened&#xD;
      with Rebiscan's RBI device and it's PVS device in sequence, with results compared to the PVS&#xD;
      as well as a comprehensive ophthalmic examination performed by a certified pediatric&#xD;
      ophthalmologist in a statistically appropriate subset of screened subjects. Testing times&#xD;
      will be assessed to compare the efficiency of the PVS and the RBI screening experiences. The&#xD;
      percentage of children successfully completing the screening process will also be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RBI is expected to identify children with amblyopia and strabismus, without referring&#xD;
      children who will not benefit from early treatment&#xD;

    <description>Children between the ages of 2-8 who present to an eye clinic. Eligible and recruited children will be scanned with a PVS device and an RBI device, and then be provided with a full, gold standard eye exam by a pediatric ophthalmologist. All scans and exam should be performed within a single visit. Scans should take no longer than 20 seconds each, and ophthalmic exam should take approximately 30 minutes.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Unenriched Population</arm_group_label>
    <description>Children between the ages of 2-8 who present to a general pediatric clinic, with no history of eye disorders or amblyopia. Eligible and recruited children will be scanned with a PVS device and an RBI device, and then be provided with a full, gold standard eye exam by a pediatric ophthalmologist. All scans will be performed at a single visit, but the exam may require a follow up visit, depending on the availability of a pediatric ophthalmologist at the clinic at the time of study enrollment. Scans should take no longer than 20 seconds each, and ophthalmic exam should take approximately 30 minutes.</description>

    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Retinal Birefringence Imager</intervention_name>
    <description>Device is a hand-help object approximately the size of a brick, and is held, by the user, 30cm away from the patient/subject. The subject peers in to an aperture that includes a fixation target that is in the shape of a smiley face. During this time, a ring of LED lights illuminates the eye and captures an image of the retina in approximately 3 seconds. The results instantaneously identify the presence of amblyopia / strabismus.</description>
