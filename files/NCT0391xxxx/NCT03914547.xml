      Investigators developed REDCHiP (Reducing Emotional Distress for Childhood Hypoglycemia in&#xD;
      Parents), an innovative video-based telemedicine intervention. In the pilot work,&#xD;
      investigators found preliminary efficacy for REDCHiP in reducing parental FH, parenting&#xD;
      stress, and children's HbA1c. The objective of this clinical trial is to conduct a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial (RCT) comparing REDCHiP to a relevant attention control intervention (ATTN) in&#xD;
      families of young children, thereby continuing to establish its efficacy. The proposed R01&#xD;
      aims are: 1) To evaluate whether parents who receive REDCHiP report reductions in FH and&#xD;
      parenting stress at post-treatment compared to parents who receive the ATTN; 2) To evaluate&#xD;
      whether children of parents who receive REDCHiP have a lower HbA1c and less glycemic&#xD;
      variability at post-treatment compared to children of parents who receive ATTN; 3) To examine&#xD;
      whether families who receive REDCHiP maintain reductions in FH, parenting stress, and child&#xD;
      HbA1c at a 3-month followup compared to families who receive ATTN.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to examine the efficacy of a real-time video-based telemedicine&#xD;
      intervention addressing parental fear of hypoglycemia (FH) in families of young children with&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes (T1D). Hypoglycemia is a common negative event associated with intensive&#xD;
      insulin therapy in children with T1D. Young children with T1D are particularly vulnerable to&#xD;
      episodes of hypoglycemia because they tend to be more insulin sensitive, may engage in&#xD;
      unpredictable eating and physical activity patterns, and may be less able to recognize and&#xD;
      report symptoms. Parents and young children living with T1D quickly learn to fear&#xD;
      hypoglycemia because it is uncomfortable, embarrassing, seemingly unpredictable, and&#xD;
      potentially dangerous. Indeed, research shows that parents of young children report high&#xD;
      rates of moderate to severe FH. Unfortunately, FH leads to two problems: impaired quality of&#xD;
      life and compensatory behaviors that raise children's blood glucose levels leading to&#xD;
      on-going poor metabolic control (HbA1c) and an increased risk for long-term vascular&#xD;
      complications. Responding to a critical need for interventions to treat parental FH in&#xD;
      families of young children, investigators developed an innovative video-based telemedicine&#xD;
      intervention, called REDCHiP (Reducing Emotional Distress for Childhood Hypoglycemia in&#xD;
      Parents). REDCHiP uses cognitive behavioral therapy, T1D education, and behavioral parent&#xD;
      training in a 10-session individual and group-based telemedicine program, to reduce parental&#xD;
      FH and to teach parents how to change hypoglycemia avoidance behaviors. In the pilot work,&#xD;
      investigators found preliminary efficacy for REDCHiP in reducing parental FH, parenting&#xD;
      stress, and children's HbA1c. The objective of the proposed R01 is to conduct a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial (RCT) comparing REDCHiP to a relevant attention control intervention (ATTN) in&#xD;
      families of young children, thereby continuing to establish its efficacy. The proposed R01&#xD;
      aims are: 1) To evaluate whether parents who receive REDCHiP report reductions in FH and&#xD;
      parenting stress at post-treatment compared to parents who receive the ATTN; 2) To evaluate&#xD;
      whether children of parents who receive REDCHiP have a lower HbA1c and less glycemic&#xD;
      variability at post-treatment compared to children of parents who receive ATTN; 3) To examine&#xD;
      whether families who receive REDCHiP maintain reductions in FH, parenting stress, and child&#xD;
      HbA1c at a 3-month followup compared to families who receive ATTN. Investigators will recruit&#xD;
      180 families with the goal of retaining at least 144 through the 3-month followup. After&#xD;
      informed consent, investigators will randomize parents to either REDCHiP or ATTN and have&#xD;
      them complete baseline measures (e.g., parent surveys, child glucose sensing, child/parent&#xD;
      accelerometry, and child HbA1c). Then, parents in both groups will participate in 10&#xD;
      video-based telemedicine sessions matched for time and format (group v individual). At&#xD;
      post-treatment, parents and children will repeat the baseline assessment; at the 3-month&#xD;
      followup, parents will complete surveys and children will undergo glucose sensing and an&#xD;
      HbA1c. Primary outcomes of the revised trial are: parents' FH, parenting stress, children's&#xD;
      HbA1c levels and children's glycemic variability (measured by percent time above, below and&#xD;
      within-range). Secondary measures include child physical activity and sleep, parent sleep,&#xD;
      parent depressive symptoms and anxiety, and parent psychopathology.&#xD;

    <description>REDCHiP includes seven group-based sessions and three individual sessions. REDCHiP uses a three-pronged approach to reduce parents' FH. It uses T1D education and problem-solving to enhance parents' knowledge and skills. It uses child age-appropriate behavioral parent training to promote parents' skills and confidence in managing disruptive child behaviors and reducing their reliance on hypoglycemia avoidance behaviors. It uses cognitive-behavioral therapy strategies to help parents reduce maladaptive thinking/coping related to hypoglycemia fear.</description>
