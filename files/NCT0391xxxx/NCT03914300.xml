  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib, nivolumab, and ipilimumab work in treating&#xD;
      patients with differentiated thyroid cancer that does not respond to radioactive iodine and&#xD;
      that worsened after treatment with a drug targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      receptor (VEGFR), a protein needed to form blood vessels. Cabozantinib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system&#xD;
      attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;
      Giving cabozantinib, nivolumab and ipilimumab may work better than the usual approach&#xD;
      consisting of chemotherapy with drugs such as doxorubicin, sorafenib, and lenvatinib for this&#xD;
      type of thyroid cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the objective response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who have had&#xD;
      a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) within the first 6 months after initiation&#xD;
      of therapy with cabozantinib S-malate (XL184 [cabozantinib]), nivolumab, and ipilimumab&#xD;
      (CaboNivoIpi).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess duration of objective response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and&#xD;
      overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess tolerability and adverse events of CaboNivoIpi in patients with differentiated&#xD;
      thyroid cancer (DTC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate treatment response (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]&#xD;
      version [v]1.1) with tumor mutation status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate treatment response (RECIST v1.1) with frequency of tumor infiltrating&#xD;
      lymphocytes in biopsies taken pre-treatment and after 12 weeks of CaboNivoIpi therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the effect of CaboNivoIpi on T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and to&#xD;
      identify the frequency of shared T cell clones between tumor and peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the effect of XL184 (cabozantinib) alone and of the CaboNivoIpi combination&#xD;
      on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and to correlate their frequency with treatment&#xD;
      response (RECIST v1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the effect of XL184 (cabozantinib) alone and of the CaboNivoIpi combination on&#xD;
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and to correlate their frequency with treatment&#xD;
      response (RECIST v1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To correlate treatment response (RECIST v1.1) with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)&#xD;
      / programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in the primary/metastatic tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cabozantinib S-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -14 to -1 prior to&#xD;
      cycle 1, days 1-42 of cycles 1-4 and days 1-28 of subsequent cycles. Patients also receive&#xD;
      nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 of cycles 1-4 and day 1 of&#xD;
      subsequent cycles and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of cycles 1-4. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 42 days for cycles 1-4 and every 28 days for subsequent cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks for up to 2 years.&#xD;

             study therapy. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity: 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin [hCG]) within 24 hours prior to the start of study therapy. Women must&#xD;
             not be breastfeeding. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any&#xD;
             contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year. Men who receive study&#xD;
             therapy and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to&#xD;
             contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of study therapy. Women who&#xD;
             are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile)&#xD;
             as well as azoospermic men do not require contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone&#xD;
             surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not&#xD;
             postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman&#xD;
             over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, women&#xD;
             under the age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&#xD;
             level &lt; 40 mIU/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WOCBP and men who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to&#xD;
             contraception for a period of 5 and 7 months, respectively, after the last dose of&#xD;
             study therapy. These durations have been calculated using the upper limit of the&#xD;
             half-life for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that WOCBP&#xD;
             use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 30 days and men who are sexually active with&#xD;
             WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 90 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she (or the participating partner) must inform the&#xD;
             treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to swallow tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to understand be willing to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) will be eligible if they have a&#xD;
             legally authorized representative (LAR) or caregiver available to assist them&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have had prior treatment with XL184 (cabozantinib), any&#xD;
             MET-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), or any MET-targeting monoclonal&#xD;
             antibody (MetMAb), such as onartuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have had prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2,&#xD;
             anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T cell&#xD;
             co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have a tumor invading or encasing any major blood vessels, and must&#xD;
             not have evidence of tumor invading the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (esophagus,&#xD;
             stomach, small or large bowel, rectum, or anus), or any evidence of endotracheal or&#xD;
             endobronchial tumor within 28 days before the first dose of XL184 (cabozantinib)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have a diagnosis of another malignancy within 2 years before the&#xD;
             first dose of study treatment, except for superficial skin cancers, or localized, low&#xD;
             grade tumors deemed cured and not treated with systemic therapy. Adjuvant hormonal&#xD;
             therapy for history of prostate or breast cancer is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received cytotoxic chemotherapy (including investigational&#xD;
             cytotoxic chemotherapy) or biologic agents (e.g., cytokines or antibodies) within 4&#xD;
             weeks, or nitrosoureas/ mitomycin C within 6 weeks, before the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment. Patients may continue on bone-modifying agents (denosumab or&#xD;
             bisphosphonates) with caution&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received radiation therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  To the thoracic cavity, abdomen, or pelvis within 4 weeks before the first dose&#xD;
                  of study treatment;&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  To any other sites within 4 weeks before the first dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have clinically relevant, ongoing complications from prior radiation&#xD;
             therapy. Palliative (limited-field) radiation therapy is permitted as long as the&#xD;
             patient does not have disease progression according to RECIST v 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received any type of small molecule kinase inhibitor (including&#xD;
             investigational kinase inhibitors) within 4 weeks before the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have received any other type of investigational agent within 4 weeks&#xD;
             before the first dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula&#xD;
             (QTcF) &gt; 500 msec by electrocardiogram (EKG) within 28 days before the first dose of&#xD;
             study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: if a single EKG shows a QTcF with an absolute value &gt; 500 msec, two&#xD;
                  additional EKGs at intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed within 30&#xD;
                  min after the initial EKG, and the average of these three consecutive results for&#xD;
                  QTcF will be used to determine eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should not have known, untreated brain metastases or leptomeningeal&#xD;
             metastases because of poor prognosis and concerns that progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction could confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
             However, patients will be eligible if metastases have been treated, and there is no&#xD;
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks after&#xD;
             treatment for metastases is complete and within 28 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not require concomitant treatment with oral anticoagulants (e.g.,&#xD;
             warfarin, direct thrombin, and factor Xa inhibitors) or platelet inhibitors (e.g.,&#xD;
             clopidogrel). The following anticoagulants are allowed:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection (per local applicable guidelines),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Low-dose low molecular weight heparins (LMWH),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Therapeutic doses of LMWH are allowed in patients without known brain metastases&#xD;
                  who are on a stable dose of LMWH for at least 6 weeks before the first dose of&#xD;
                  study treatment, and who have had no clinically significant hemorrhagic&#xD;
                  complications from the anticoagulation regimen or the tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not require systemic corticosteroids treatment (&gt;= 10 mg/day prednisone&#xD;
             equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days prior to study drug&#xD;
             administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &lt; 10 mg/day&#xD;
             prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.&#xD;
             Patients are permitted to use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and&#xD;
             inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Physiologic&#xD;
             replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted, even if &gt;= 10 mg/day&#xD;
             prednisone equivalents. A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis or for&#xD;
             treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction&#xD;
             caused by contact allergen) is permitted, as is steroid pre-medication for contrast&#xD;
             allergy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to any&#xD;
             monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of&#xD;
             similar chemical or biologic composition to agents used in study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not require concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g.,&#xD;
             dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin,&#xD;
             phenobarbital, or St. John's wort). Because lists of these agents are constantly&#xD;
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list. Medical&#xD;
             reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this&#xD;
             information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, patients will be&#xD;
             counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness&#xD;
             including, but not limited to, the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cardiovascular disorders:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3 or 4,&#xD;

                    -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained blood pressure (BP) &gt; 140 mm&#xD;
                       Hg systolic or &gt; 90 mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive&#xD;
                       treatment within seven days prior to the first dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Stroke (including transient ischemic attack [TIA]), myocardial infarction&#xD;
                       (MI), or other ischemic event, or thromboembolic event (e.g., deep venous&#xD;
                       thrombosis [DVT], pulmonary embolism [PE]) within 6 months before first dose&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  GI disorders including those associated with a high risk of perforation or&#xD;
                  fistula formation:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The patient has evidence of tumor invading the GI tract, active peptic ulcer&#xD;
                       disease, inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease), diverticulitis,&#xD;
                       cholecystitis, symptomatic cholangitis or appendicitis, acute pancreatitis,&#xD;
                       acute obstruction of the pancreatic duct or common bile duct, or gastric&#xD;
                       outlet obstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Abdominal fistula, GI perforation, bowel obstruction, or intra-abdominal&#xD;
                       abscess within 6 months before first dose. Complete healing of an&#xD;
                       intra-abdominal abscess must be confirmed before first dose&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clinically significant hematuria, hematemesis, or hemoptysis or other history of&#xD;
                  significant bleeding (e.g., pulmonary hemorrhage) within 12 weeks before first&#xD;
                  dose&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cavitating pulmonary lesion(s) or known endotracheal or endobronchial disease&#xD;
                  manifestation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Lesions invading or encasing any major blood vessels&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other clinically significant disorders that would preclude safe study&#xD;
                  participation&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Serious non-healing wound/ulcer/bone fracture&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Uncompensated/symptomatic hypothyroidism&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have had major surgery (e.g., GI surgery or removal or biopsy of&#xD;
             brain metastasis) within 8 weeks before first dose of study treatment. Complete wound&#xD;
             healing from major surgery must have occurred 1 month before the first dose of study&#xD;
             treatment and from minor surgery (e.g., simple excision or tooth extraction) at least&#xD;
             10 days before the first dose. Patients with clinically relevant ongoing complications&#xD;
             from prior surgery are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because XL184 (cabozantinib) has the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects, and the effects of nivolumab and&#xD;
             ipilimumab on the developing fetus are not well known. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother,&#xD;
             breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is treated with XL184 (cabozantinib),&#xD;
             nivolumab, or ipilimumab&#xD;
