      This study is to evaluate the correlation of adenoma missing rate and quality indicators of&#xD;
      colonoscopy including adenoma detection ratee (ADR), polyp detection rate (PDR), adenoma per&#xD;
      colonoscopy rate (APC), adenoma per positive participant (APP), ADR-Plus, and to find out the&#xD;
      surrogate indicators of ADR. This study is a prospective observational multi-center study.&#xD;
      Correlation between AMR and quality indicators of colonoscopy based on the previous studies,&#xD;
      8 endoscopists participated in this study and will enroll 50 screening colonoscopies&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruit research participants who want to participate in research in outpatient clinics.&#xD;
      Perform colonoscopy in the morning after colon cleansing with split method. Colonoscopy is&#xD;
      performed by back-to-back two consecutive colonoscopies. When the first colonoscopy is&#xD;
      performed, the colonoscope is retracted after inserting the cecum, and all colon polyps are&#xD;
      removed. After retracting to the anus of the first colonoscopy, the second colonoscopy is&#xD;
      performed immediately. In case of newly detected colon polyps except for the small polyps and&#xD;
      S-colon and rectal polyps which were left as photographs during the first colonoscopy with&#xD;
      the second colonoscopy, we regard them as an overlooked lesion during the first colonoscopy.&#xD;
      After the procedure, the histologic examination is confirmed and classified as benign lesions&#xD;
      (all adenomas, advanced adenomas, dysplasia, and colorectal cancer) and non-lesion lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the back-to-back colonoscopy results of the participants during the study period,&#xD;
      calculate the quality indicators including ADR, PDR, APC, ADR-plus, APP and AMR for each&#xD;
      endoscopist. And then, evaluate the correlation between AMR and other quality indicators.&#xD;

      Background Colonoscopy reduces the risk of colorectal cancer by 77% and reduces mortality&#xD;
      from colorectal cancer by more than 30%. However, in spite of the advantages of colonoscopy,&#xD;
      the meta-analysis reported an incidence of intermediate cancer of 3.7%. In the case of&#xD;
      proximal colon, the incidence of intermediate cancer was 2.4 times higher than that of the&#xD;
      distal colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several possible causes of intermediate cancers, such as missed lesion during the&#xD;
      previous colonoscopy, early-growth tumors before the follow-up period, and incomplete&#xD;
      resection of the lesions. About 70-80% intermediate cancers are known to be originated from&#xD;
      an missed lesion on endoscopy, and 10 ~ 27% is known to be caused by incomplete resection of&#xD;
      the lesion on the previous colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of colonoscopy for the prevention of intermediate cancer was first reported by&#xD;
      the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) / American College of&#xD;
      Gastroenterology (ACG) Task Force on Quality in Endoscopy in 2006 and the recently revised&#xD;
      Quality indicators for colonoscopy (Quality index of colonoscopy) '.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most popular and practically being used quality indicator of colonoscopy is an adenoma&#xD;
      detection rate (ADR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADR is calculated as the number of colonoscopy with â‰¥1 adenoma detected during the&#xD;
      colonoscopy divided by the total number of colonoscopies. ACGTF recommended the criteria of&#xD;
      the quality index of the colonoscopy prior to the revision ADR was defined as 25% or more for&#xD;
      men and 15% or more for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, a Polish study reported a 10-fold higher risk of intermediate cancer when ADR was&#xD;
      below 20%, and a recent large study by Corley showed that the incidence of colorectal cancer&#xD;
      could be reduced by 3% and the mortality rate of colorectal cancer by 5% or more, especially&#xD;
      when the ADR is increased by 1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the evidence that the higher the ADR and the lower the risk of colorectal cancer,&#xD;
      the quality index of colonoscopy was revised in 2015. Currently, the recommended ADR is 30%&#xD;
      for men and 20% for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although ADR appears to be a perfect quality marker, it requires a diagnosis of adenoma of&#xD;
      the pathologic outcome in order to obtain ADR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the calculation of ADR is based on the assumption that more than one adenoma&#xD;
      is diagnosed during colonoscopy. However, even if the number of adenomas diagnosed during&#xD;
      colonoscopy is different for each endoscopist, the concept of ADR does not distinguish this&#xD;
      difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, many recent studies have reported that endoscopist with an ADR more than 40% showed&#xD;
      more than 20% adenoma missing rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent proposed measures to replace ADR include polyp detection rate (PDR) and adenoma&#xD;
      per colonoscopy rate (APC). As with ADR, PDR is a measure of the rate at which more than one&#xD;
      colorectal polyps are found in a colonoscopy practitioner aged 50 years or older. Unlike ADR,&#xD;
      PDR does not need pathologic result. Recently, several studies have been reported that PDR&#xD;
      can replace ADR and can be correlated with colorectal cancer prevention. The APC is different&#xD;
      from that of ADR, and it is considered to be one of the alternative indicators that can&#xD;
      compensate the shortcomings of &quot;one and done&quot; concept of ADR, because it can reflect the&#xD;
      number of all adenomas found in the entire colon. According to a single-institution study&#xD;
      using more than 20,000 colonoscopy analyzes that the recommended values for ADR 20% for men&#xD;
      and women with ADR 15% for men over 50 years of age were APC 0.3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to APC, Adenoma per positive participants (APP), the total number of adenomas of&#xD;
      participants divided by the number of examinees of adenomas detected (positive APPs), and the&#xD;
      number of ADR-plus (ADR-plus) in the average number of additional found adenomas per test&#xD;
      case divided by total colonoscopy were also introduced as quality indicators to predict the&#xD;
      overlook of the lesion substitute for ADR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, various substitute factors such as PDR, APC, and recently reported APP and&#xD;
      ADR-plus have been introduced as an index parameter that can be used as a quality index to&#xD;
      reflect the neglect of adenomas during colonoscopy. However, there is a very limited study of&#xD;
      the direct comparison of correlation between each quality indicators and adenoma miss rate&#xD;
      (AMR), and also the investigators have very limited knowledge which quaility incidator can&#xD;
      well reflect the AMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of quality indicators which could best&#xD;
      reflect the AMR and to find surrogate markers of ADR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the relationship between known quality&#xD;
      markers such as ADR, PDR, APC, APP, ADR-Plus, and AMR is examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed as a cross-sectional study with prospective design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total of eight expert colonoscopists will participate in this study, and collecting the 50&#xD;
      colonoscopy data in each endoscopist. All enrolled cases will be subject for screening&#xD;
      colonoscopy aged 50-75 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study excluded the colonoscopy cases with inappropriate bowel preparation, inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel disease patients, and high-risk patients with family history of hereditary colorectal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colon cleansing will be performed by the split method. Colonoscopy is performed by&#xD;
      back-to-back two colonoscopies. When the first colonoscopy is performed, the colonoscope is&#xD;
      retracted after inserting the cecum, and all colon polyps are removed. Only small polyps less&#xD;
      than 5 mm located in the S-colon and rectum are left after photographing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After performing the first colonoscopy, the second colonoscopy is performed immediately. A&#xD;
      newly founded polyp (except polypoid and S-colon and rectal polyp which was left as a&#xD;
      photograph at the time of 1st colonoscopy when performing a second colonoscopy) will be&#xD;
      considered as a missed lesion and will be removed. After the procedure, confirm the presence&#xD;
      of adenomatous polyps by pathologic results and record them on the case record. Using the&#xD;
      back-to-back colonoscopy results of the participants during the study period, calculate the&#xD;
      quality indicators including ADR, PDR, APC, ADR-plus, APP, and AMR. The correlations between&#xD;
      ADR, PDR, APC, ADR-plus, APP, and AMR are compared using Pearson correlation constants.&#xD;
