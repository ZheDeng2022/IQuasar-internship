      and around 800 subjects not included in the Trekkers Family Project in Hong Kong, recruited&#xD;
      base on pre-defined inclusion criteria. Health empowerment interventions consisting of three&#xD;

      The Health Literacy Programme aims to improve the knowledge on health and health services in&#xD;
      order to promote health, prevent disease, and the proper use of services. It consists of four&#xD;
      seminars per year on common health problems, mental health and cognitive health, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Self-Care Enablement Programme is to enable participants to keep themselves healthy, to&#xD;
      build up self-efficacy and proper help-seeking skills, and to generate a spirit of mutual&#xD;
      support among families. Two programmes will be delivered yearly, each with six 2.5 hour&#xD;
      workshops facilitated by professional and lay leaders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Health Ambassador Programme aims to train up a group of adults recruited from the&#xD;
      Trekkers families to act as a lay-advisor to other families on health issues. Participants&#xD;
      who have completed the Health Literacy and Self-care Enablement programme will be given&#xD;
      priority to take part in the Health Ambassador training programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures are health enablement, health status, health-related quality of life,&#xD;
      life style, cardiovascular risk factors, illnesses rates, and health service utilization&#xD;
      pattern. All subjects in the cohort study will be surveyed on enrolment, and then yearly for&#xD;
      5 years. An age-gender appropriate health assessment will be carried out at baseline and at&#xD;
      the end of five years for each subject. Changes in the outcomes will be evaluated and&#xD;
      compared between groups. The impact of the health intervention programmes will be assessed.&#xD;
