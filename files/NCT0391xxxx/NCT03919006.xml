    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), saliva and serum Netrin 1&#xD;
      and Unc5b levels in periodontal health and disease. A total of 60 individuals, 20 patients&#xD;
      with periodontitis, 20 with gingivitis and 20 periodontally healthy individuals were&#xD;
      included. Whole-mouth and site-specific clinical periodontal parameters including probing&#xD;
      depth, clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing, gingival index, plaque index and&#xD;
      papillar bleeding index were recorded. GCF, salivary and serum Netrin 1 and Unc5b levels were&#xD;
      measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Statistical analysis was performed by using&#xD;
      non-parametric tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 individuals, comprising 20 patients with Periodontitis (P Group), 20 patients&#xD;
      with gingivitis (G Group), and 20 periodontally healthy controls (H Group) were involved in&#xD;
      the study. The patients were diagnosed according to the new classification scheme. Stage and&#xD;
      extent of periodontitis were also determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical periodontal criteria for the diagnosis of the groups were as follows: the&#xD;
      periodontitis group had interdental clinical attachment loss (CAL) ≥5 mm at site of greatest&#xD;
      loss and periodontal probing depth (PD) ≥ 6 mm in one or more sites of the 2 non-adjacent&#xD;
      teeth in at least two quadrants of the mouth. Accordingly, Stage III generalized&#xD;
      periodontitis patients were included in the study. Patients were diagnosed as gingivitis with&#xD;
      bleeding on probing ≥ 50 %, PD ≤3 mm, and no radiographic bone loss or CAL. Periodontally&#xD;
      healthy individuals had no recorded history of periodontal problems, with PD ≤3 mm, no&#xD;
      radiographic bone loss, good oral hygiene, no gingival inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) aged &gt;18 years, (2) having at least 16 natural teeth&#xD;
      (excluding third molar),(3) nonsmokers with no history of smoking, (4) not having any&#xD;
      diagnosed medical illness or drug intake that could affect the periodontal condition. The&#xD;
      patients who had (1) taken antibiotics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory or any other drugs&#xD;
      within the past 3 months,(2) received nonsurgical or surgical periodontal treatment, (3) a&#xD;
      restorative and endodontic therapy requirement, (4) a removable partial denture and/or having&#xD;
      orthodontic therapy were excluded from the study. Current pregnancy or lactation and having&#xD;
      serum C reactive protein (CRP) &gt; 3mg/L were also the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals were examined at baseline and four weeks after non-surgical periodontal&#xD;
      treatment including, whole mouth probing depth (PD), CAL, presence of bleeding on probing&#xD;
      (BOP), papillar bleeding index (PBI), gingival index (GI) and plaque index (PI) except the&#xD;
      third molars. PD and CAL were measured at six sites per tooth using a manual periodontal&#xD;
      probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-surgical periodontal treatment for periodontitis group included supra- and&#xD;
      subgingival scaling, root planing and oral hygiene instructions. Subgingival scaling and root&#xD;
      planing were performed under local anesthesia in two sessions within the 48-72 h. Gingivitis&#xD;
      group had supra-and subgingival scaling, polishing and oral hygiene instructions. The&#xD;
      treatment of gingivitis and periodontitis patients were performed by a periodontist (BM)&#xD;
      using hand and ultrasonic instruments. All measurements were performed by the same calibrated&#xD;
      examiner (SG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole unstimulated saliva samples were collected. Each participant was asked first to rinse&#xD;
      the mouth completely with tap water for 1 minutes, wait for 10 minutes, and then expectorate&#xD;
      into sterile polypropylene tube for 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      GCF samples were obtained from two nonadjacent interproximal sites in one single- rooted and&#xD;
      one multi-rooted teeth by standardized filter paper strips. GCF was sampled from two sites&#xD;
      with GI &lt; 1, PD ≤ 3 mm and without BOP in the healthy group; two sites with GI ≥ 2, PD ≤ 3 mm&#xD;
      and positive BOP (visible signs of inflammation) in the gingivitis group; and two deepest&#xD;
      pocket (≥ 5 mm) with GI ≥ 2 and positive BOP in periodontitis group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum samples were taken following saliva and GCF sampling before the periodontal treatment.&#xD;
      Six milliliters of venous blood were obtained by a standard venipuncture method and the serum&#xD;
      was separated from blood by centrifugation at 1,500 g for 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of Netrin 1 and Unc5b levels in GCF, Saliva and Serum Samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Netrin 1 and Unc5b levels in GCF, saliva and serum samples were measured by the enzyme-linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using commercial kits according to the manufacturer's guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data analyses were performed using a statistical software package. Comparisons of&#xD;
      clinical and biochemical parameters between the study groups were performed using the&#xD;
      Kruskal- Wallis with Mann Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction method. The intragroup&#xD;
      comparisons (at baseline and first month) were performed using Wilcoxon test for paired&#xD;
      samples. Associations among levels of the GCF, saliva and serum biomarkers and clinical&#xD;
      parameters were also examined using the Spearman rank correlation analysis.&#xD;
