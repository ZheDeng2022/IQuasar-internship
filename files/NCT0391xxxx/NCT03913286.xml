  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to develop a new medical device prototype to restore&#xD;
      functional movement of an arm made weak due to a chronic stroke&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Microelectrode arrays implanted into the brain will decode signals to drive motors on the&#xD;
      powered brace worn on the arm so that the patient can &quot;power steer&quot; his or her own arm. The&#xD;
      ultimate goal is to create a fully implantable medical device that will restore movement in&#xD;
      all parts of the body affected by a stroke. Independent movement will have functional&#xD;
      benefits (e.g., being able to lift a fork to eat) and health benefits (e.g., decreasing the&#xD;
      frequency of skin infections and preventing the formation of painful joint contractures).&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) score at 4 months</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) measures specific changes in the arm function in people who sustained cerebral damage resulting in arm weakness. The ARAT consists of 19 items grouped into four subscales: grasp, grip, pinch and gross movements. Each sub scale has items ordered according to ascending difficulty: 0- can not perform any part of the test, 1- performs the test partialy, 2- completes the test, but takes abnormally long time, 3- performs the test normally. The sum of all subscales are added to compute the total score. The total score ranges between 0 to 57. The higher score is considered to be better outcome.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline ADL, Hand and Recovery Scales within Stroke Impact Scale, at 4 months</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroke Impact Scales assess how having a stroke impacts a person's life. The scale has 8 subscales which ask questions regarding a person's physical limitations, memory and thinking, emotions and mood, ability to communicate, daily activities, mobility at home and in the community, use of hand most affected by stroke, and ability to participate in meaningful life activities. Each subscale item is rated on a scale from 5-1 (5= None of the time, 4=a little of the time, 3=Some of the time, 2=Most of the time, 1=All of the time).&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline &quot;Giving Them A Hand&quot; ADL at 4 months</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;Giving Them A Hand&quot; ADL scale measures a person's ability to perform four functional tasks emphasizing proximal movement of the weak arm and some limited movement of the distal areas given a myoelectric elbow-wrist-hand orthosis' capabilities to assist with flexion and extension of the first two fingers. The tasks are: (1) turning on a light switch,(2) lifting a laundry basket bilaterally, (3) bringing a spoon to the mouth, and (4) drinking from a cup. Quality of movement for both grasp and elbow components of each of these is individually rated using a 3-point ordinal scale (where 0 is performs no part of task and 3 is performs normally), and performance of each component is timed with a 120-second limit&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline Braden skin health score at 4 months</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
