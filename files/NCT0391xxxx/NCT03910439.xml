      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple myeloma is a cancer that forms from plasma cells which normally produce important&#xD;
      immune response antibodies. It cannot be cured. Researchers hope the combination of radiation&#xD;
      combined with the drug avelumab causes the immune system to kill myeloma cells more&#xD;
      effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if avelumab given with radiation treatment helps treat multiple myeloma. Also to see&#xD;
      if giving the treatments together is safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with multiple myeloma that has come back after treatment and has&#xD;
      spread to other parts of the body&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible tumor biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow testing: A needle will be stuck into the participants hipbone to take out a small&#xD;
      amount of marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography (PET)/Computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI): Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get avelumab through an intravenous (IV). An IV is a small plastic tube put&#xD;
      into an arm vein. They will get avelumab every 2 weeks for 2 doses. Then they will get&#xD;
      radiation each day for 5 days. They will continue to get avelumab every 2 weeks as long as&#xD;
      they do not have bad side effects and the treatment is helping their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood and urine tests, bone marrow biopsies, scans, and X-rays&#xD;
      repeated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit 30 days after their last treatment dose. Then they&#xD;
      will have visits every 3-6 months for up to 5 years....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a hematologic neoplasm of the plasma cells defined by an M-&#xD;
           protein greater than or equal to 3.0 g/dL or bone marrow plasma cells greater than or&#xD;
           equal to 10% and presence of end-organ disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although significant advances in treatment have been made in the past decade, MM remains&#xD;
           incurable with median survivals of 5-8 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  While therapeutic strides have been made with approvals of immunomodulatory drugs&#xD;
           (IMiDs), proteasome inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies, treatment of relapsed&#xD;
           refractory MM (RRMM) remains an unmet need for patients who have exhausted available&#xD;
           therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extramedullary plasmacytomas arising either from focal bone involvement or from&#xD;
           hematogenous spread occur in 7-18% of newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) with an additional 6-20%&#xD;
           in RRMM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune checkpoint inhibitors are being evaluated in combination regimens and evidence&#xD;
           exists that radiation therapy (XRT) may synergize with immune checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To assess the response rate of avelumab in combination with XRT (BavXRT) in RRMM patients&#xD;
      with plasmacytomas or lytic lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have previously treated RRMM refractory to, ineligible for, or intolerant&#xD;
           of available therapeutic regimens known to provide clinical benefit (e.g,&#xD;
           immunomodulatory [IMiD], proteasome inhibitor, and anti-cluster of differentiation&#xD;
           (CD)38 monoclonal antibody-based treatments).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of greater than or equal to 1 extramedullary plasmacytoma and/or lytic lesion&#xD;
           amenable to XRT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function, and without serious comorbidity or disease (e.g., autoimmune&#xD;
           disease), that would preclude concurrent systemic treatment or radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will consist of a 4-week lead-in with avelumab, followed by concurrent XRT 5&#xD;
           gray (Gy) x 5 days). Monotherapy avelumab will continue indefinitely until progressive&#xD;
           disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity; 28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine safety and MM-specific clinical labs will be assessed. Additional research&#xD;
           bloods will be collected for evaluating immune-subsets, endosomes, and peripheral blood&#xD;
           T cell repertoire prior to and following treatment (lead-in and prior to XRT, at disease&#xD;
           re- evaluations at at time of response [i.e., complete remission (CR)/progressive&#xD;
           disease (PD)]).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow biopsies will be evaluated for Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1)/ligand 1&#xD;
           (L1) expression, and B and T cell subsets using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Flow&#xD;
           cytometry will also be used to evaluate stimulatory and inhibitory immune subsets along&#xD;
           with endosomes. Standard clinical histopathology and flow cytometry will also be&#xD;
           evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single arm, Simon minimax two-stage phase II trial design. The first stage will enroll&#xD;
           13 patients; if futility is not met, second stage will enroll another 14 patients to&#xD;
           define the response rate to BavXRT in this population. Early stopping rules for safety&#xD;
           will also be applied.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to the following that may&#xD;
             limit interpretation of results or that could increase risk to the patient in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with a positive hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb] and negative surface&#xD;
                  antigen (HBsAg) may be included if hepatitis B virus (HBV) deoxyribonucleic acid&#xD;
                  (DNA) is undetectable&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who are positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody must be negative&#xD;

                  requirements of the trial or confound the results or interpretation of the&#xD;
                  results of the trial and, in the opinion of the treating investigator, would make&#xD;
                  the patient inappropriate for entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy (Grade &gt; 1); however, alopecia, sensory&#xD;
             neuropathy Grade less than or equal to 2, or other Grade less than or equal to 2 not&#xD;
             constituting a safety risk based on investigator s judgment are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vaccination with live vaccines within 4 weeks of the first dose of avelumab and while&#xD;
             on study is prohibited (inactivated vaccines may be administered).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating females. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for&#xD;
             adverse events in nursing infants, on-study breastfeeding is not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions or hypersensitivity to avelumab or any component in its&#xD;
             formulations, including known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal&#xD;
             antibodies (Grade greater than or equal to 3) unless felt to be in the best interests&#xD;
             of the patient at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known additional malignancy that is symptomatic or requires active systemic treatment&#xD;
             (at the discretion of the principal investigator (PI), exceptions may be made if in&#xD;
             the best interest of the patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including immune colitis,&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease, immune pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric&#xD;
             conditions including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or&#xD;
             behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study&#xD;
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make&#xD;
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;

        <title>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</title>
        <description>ORR is defined as participants who experience a partial response (PR), very good partial response (VGPR), complete response (CR), or stringent complete response (sCR) per International Myeloma Working Group Criteria (IMWG) 2016 criteria. Complete Response is defined as negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and &lt;5% plasma cells in bone marrow aspirates. Stringent Complete Response is defined as complete response as noted previously plus normal free light chain (FLC) ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow biopsy by immune-histochemistry. Partial Response is ≥50% reduction of serum M-protein plus reduction in 24 hour(h) urinary M-protein by ≥90% or to &lt;200 mg per 24 h. Very Good Partial Response is serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or ≥90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level &lt;100 mg per 24 h.</description>

Minimal Response is ≥25% but ≤49% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-h urine M-protein by 50-89%; in addition, if present at baseline, a ≥50% reduction in the size (SPD) of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required. Stable Disease is not meeting criteria for complete response, very good partial response, partial response, minimal response, or progressive disease. And Progressive Disease is appearance of a new lesion(s), ≥50% increase from nadir in sum of the products of diameters (SPD) of &gt;1 lesion, or ≥50% increase in the longest diameter of a previous lesion &gt;1 cm in short axis; ≥50% increase in circulating plasma cells (minimum of 200 cells per microliter (μL) if this is the only measure of disease.</description>
