  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with physiological declines that could impair the ability to perform&#xD;
      activities of daily living and thus impair the quality of life of older adults. Golf is an&#xD;
      activity that challenges the balance, flexibility, and muscular systems of the golfer and&#xD;
      could have important implications in addressing the physiological declines associated with&#xD;
      aging. Golf also challenges the cognition of golfer and is typically performed in groups of&#xD;
      2-4 people; therefore, it could also have important implications for the cognitive and social&#xD;
      health of older adults. This research will investigate the effects of an introductory,&#xD;
      therapeutic golf program on the physiological, cognitive, and social well-being of older&#xD;
      adults. 25 older adults (60-80 years) will participate in a 10-week introductory golf program&#xD;
      specifically designed with older adults in mind. The intervention will be led by Professional&#xD;
      Golf Association (PGA) professionals with experience in teaching older adults to golf. In&#xD;
      order to assess the effectiveness of the intervention, the functional, physiological, and&#xD;
      cognitive abilities of the participants will be evaluated as well as the overall well-being&#xD;
      before and after the completion of the golf program. We will also examine the inflammatory&#xD;
      response changes associated with the golf program. These adaptations will be evaluated&#xD;
      through the use of biomechanical analysis, standardized older adult functional tests,&#xD;
      validated surveys and questionnaires, validated cognitive assessments, and analyses of&#xD;
      markers of inflammation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Implementing a ten-week introductory golf intervention designed for older adults will allow&#xD;
      us to evaluate the usefulness of golf as a means to promote physical activity and well-being&#xD;
      across the lifespan. Golf, while studied from a performance perspective, has not been studied&#xD;
      as an intervention to promote physical activity and health in older adults. This study will&#xD;
      contribute to our knowledge about the feasibility and effectiveness of golf as a means to&#xD;
      promote wellness across the lifespan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that, following the intervention, the older adults will demonstrate&#xD;
      improved functional, cognitive, and physiological abilities. It is also hypothesized that the&#xD;
      participants will demonstrate improvements in golf skill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE The purpose of this study is to quantify the changes in&#xD;
      functional, cognitive,and physiological abilities following a ten-week introductory golf&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 OBJECTIVE 1: Quantify the changes in the functional, cognitive, and physiological&#xD;
      abilities of older adults following a 10-week introductory golf intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Older adults will demonstrate improved functional, cognitiveand physiological&#xD;
      abilities following the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 OBJECTIVE 2: Quantify golf demands and performance including a biomechanical analysis of&#xD;
      golf swings, putting and picking up a ball following a 10-week introductory golf&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The demands of the golf intervention will be similar to or greater than the&#xD;
      demands during commonly utilized older adult balance and strengthening exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 OBJECTIVE 3: Evaluate the safety and feasibility of a 10-week introductory golf&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3A: Adverse events associated with the intervention will be minor and not more&#xD;
      frequent than AE's associated with other activity programs in seniors (e.g. GeroFit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3B: Adherence to the program will greater than the adherence associated with other&#xD;
      activity-intervention programs in seniors (e.g. GeroFit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a longitudinal study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Twenty-five older adults will be recruited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential participants will be recruited by flyers, word of mouth and through the USC&#xD;
      Institute of Senior Golf Science webpage. Flyers will be placed at various community centers&#xD;
      and senior centers in the cities of South Pasadena, Monterey Park, and the surrounding areas.&#xD;
      The flyers will also be placed at both the Arroyo Seco and Monterey Park Golf Courses. The&#xD;
      flyer will also be placed on the Institute for Senior Golf Science Facebook Page. Dr. George&#xD;
      J. Salem, Kiran Kanwar, Hyun Ji Lee, and Jared Moore will be recruiting potential&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A flyer containing general study information will be utilized (see Golf for Healthy Aging&#xD;
      Flyer). Included on the flyer is the contact information for the study coordinator, Ms. Kiran&#xD;
      Kanwar. Participants will also be recruited through the USC Institute of Senior Golf Science&#xD;
      webpage located at http://pt.usc.edu/golfscience. The information included on this webpage is&#xD;
      also included (see Golf Healthy Aging Website Recruitment Information). Participants will&#xD;
      also be recruited using social media (see Facebook Announcement). Finally, participants will&#xD;
      be recruited by word of mouth through a designated personal communication script (see Golf&#xD;
      for Healthy Aging Recruitment Script).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During recruitment, potential participants will be informed of the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria through a two-part screening process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phone Screen: Screening (see Golf for Healthy Aging Phone Screen) will consist of a series of&#xD;
      questionnaires assessing the potential participant's eligibility for the study. During the&#xD;
      initial phone screening, the potential participant will complete the Telephone Memory&#xD;
      Impairment Screen validated to assess for dementia and Alzheimer's Disease [21]. The&#xD;
      telephone screen will also consist of a series of questions regarding both the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria described in section 5.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Clearance: Following the phone screen, all eligible individuals will be sent a&#xD;
      medical clearance form to be taken to their primary care physician. This form will describe&#xD;
      the physical requirements of the study so the physician can either approve or deny&#xD;
      participation in the study. Included with the form is a description of the study details (see&#xD;
      Golf for Healthy Aging Study Information Form), a stamped envelope and one self-addressed&#xD;
      envelope to Kiran Kanwar, Golf for Healthy Aging Study Coordinator at the Unversity of&#xD;
      Southern California. The participants may either bring in or mail the medical clearance form&#xD;
      to their physician and once complete the form will either be mailed or faxed to Kiran Kanwar&#xD;
      by the potential participant's primary care physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the medical clearance form is received, it will be reviewed to confirm whether the&#xD;
      participant qualifies. Regardless, the potential participant will be contacted to notify&#xD;
      him/her of his/her status in the study. If the participant qualifies, a screening consent&#xD;
      enrollment appointment at the University of Southern Calfornia MBRL will be scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The functional assessments include activities that are regularly conducted throughout the day&#xD;
      and have been utilized regularly as part of common clinical practice for assessing functional&#xD;
      abilities. In more challenging activities, the participants will be appropriately spotted to&#xD;
      ensure safety during the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential risks are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Assessment: Fatigue (very minimal risk) - Rest will be provided as needed for the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle soreness (minimal risk) - This is no greater than performing normal activities of&#xD;
      daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Joint or muscle injury (minimal risk) - This is no greater than performing normal activities&#xD;
      of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of falling (minimal risk) - On the more challenging tasks, participants will be spotted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Assessment: Questionnaires (minimal risk) - Participants will be given the option&#xD;
      to skip or stop answering any questions that make them uncomfortable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory Markers: Infection from blood draws (minimal risk) - A licensed phlebotomist&#xD;
      will be making the blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Golf Intervention: Joint or muscle injury (minimal risk) - The participants will be gradually&#xD;
      introduced to the activities associated with the sport of golf. Each golf session will&#xD;
      include a sport specific warm-up and exercises that prepare the participants for the daily&#xD;
      activities. Additionally, the golfers will be supervised by a PGA Professional who&#xD;
      specializes in instructing older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigue (very minimal risk) - Participants will also be allowed rest as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events: Any unanticipated problem will be recorded via an incident report (see Golf&#xD;
      for Healthy Aging Incident Report). Protocols for the USC MBRL have been developed (see USC&#xD;
      Adverse Event Protocol). Any serious adverse event will be reported to the Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board at the University of Southern California Health Science Campus using the flow&#xD;
      chart below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continual Safety Monitoring: Researchers will have weekly meetings with the PGA instructors&#xD;
      to keep informed about the intervention and participant safety. Additionally, each week,&#xD;
      Kiran Kanwar, Dr. George Salem, Jared Moore, or Hyun Ji Lee, will check in with participants&#xD;
      according to the Problem Reports and Tracking Problems Protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.0 CLINICAL AND LABORATORY EVALUATIONS AND STUDY CALENDAR&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration and Locations: The study from consent enrollment to final data collection will occur&#xD;
      over a 12-week period. The study consists of two to four data collection visits to the&#xD;
      Jacquelin Perry Musculoskeletal Biomechanics Research Laboratory (MBRL) in the Division of&#xD;
      Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy located on the University of Southern California Health&#xD;
      Science Campus. Participants will have the option to complete two of their visits (days 2 and&#xD;
      3) at the golf course in a private room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      University of Southern California MBRL Visits Participants will visit the USC MBRL on four&#xD;
      separate occasions. Day 1 will occur following the consent enrollment. Data collection at the&#xD;
      MBRL will consist of biomechanical analysis, and functional and physiological testing on two&#xD;
      of the days and standardized assessments and questionnaires of cognition and self-efficacy,&#xD;
      and a blood draw on the other two days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomechanical Analysis (minimal risk): Laboratory kinematics and kinetics will be collecting&#xD;
      using an 11-camera digital motion capture system (Qualysis, AB, Gothenberg, Sweden). 14 mm&#xD;
      reflective markers will be used to define body segments and track motion during the trials.&#xD;
      The trunk will be modeled as 4 rigid segments: pelvic, lumbar, thoracic and head segments.&#xD;
      The lower extremity will be modeled as 3 rigid segments: thigh, shank and foot. The upper&#xD;
      extremity will be modeled as 3 rigid segments: upper arm, forearm and hand. The trunk will be&#xD;
      modeled as 2 rigid segments: upper and lower trunk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Inflammation Markers (blood draw minimal risk):&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will assess the chronic immune response to the golf-training program by examining the&#xD;
      inflammation markers C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor-alpha (TNF-a). Older adults show signs of increased low-grade, chronic inflammation by&#xD;
      exhibiting higher blood plasma levels of these cytokines (Franceschi &amp; Campisi, 2014). These&#xD;
      elevated, sub-clinical levels could cause detriments to physical functionality (such as grip&#xD;
      strength), which we will be testing further in our study (Brinkley et al., 2009). Previous&#xD;
      reports show that aerobic exercise can help to attenuate these elevated levels in older&#xD;
      adults (Colbert et al., 2004; Kohut et al., 2006). We will be examining the effect of a&#xD;
      golf-program intervention study on the chronic levels of these cytokines to promote golf as a&#xD;
      unique intervention for the maintenance of plasma cytokines and functional ability in older&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting (12h) blood will be drawn from the antecubital vein (~20cc) by a licensed&#xD;
      phlebotomist at the second baseline and 10-week follow-up visits. Participants will receive&#xD;
      refreshment after blood draw and prior to further testing. Plasma will be harvested into&#xD;
      500ul cryovials and stored in -80oC at the Harlyne J. Norris Research Tower (HNRT) on the USC&#xD;
      Health Sciences Campus.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Golf Training Visits Participants will participate in golf training programs at the Arroyo&#xD;
      Seco Golf Course in South Pasadena or the Monterey Park Golf Club in Monterey Park.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Arroyo Seco Golf Course is an 18-hole, community golf course located in South Pasadena,&#xD;
      CA. During the intervention, golfers will be allowed to play as many or as few holes as&#xD;
      desired. The Arroyo Seco Golf Course also has a driving range where participants will be able&#xD;
      to practice their swings before progressing to golf play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Monterey Park Golf Club is a 9-hole, 3-park golf course (beginner course) located in&#xD;
      Monterey Park, CA. During the intervention, golfers will be allowed to play as many or as few&#xD;
      holes as desired. The Monterey Park Golf Clib also has a driving range where participants&#xD;
      will be able to practice their swings before progressing to golf play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be divided into groups of 2-4 golfers and will meet with a PGA Professional&#xD;
      two times per week for ten weeks. Training sessions will last 1-2 hours. The program is&#xD;
      specifically designed for older adults not currently playing golf. Training will include a&#xD;
      warm-up that prepares the participants for the activities to be practiced, flexibility and&#xD;
      strengthening exercises to prepare the participants for the golf activities, and a gradual&#xD;
      introduction to golf play. The first set of sessions will include introduction to the&#xD;
      different forms of the golf swing beginning with partial swings and then gradually&#xD;
      progressing to a full swing. Swing modifications will be provided on an individual basis to&#xD;
      address needs of the participant. Golf play will begin on holes that are flatter and close to&#xD;
      the clubhouse and will begin by only playing 1-2 holes. The golfers will then be&#xD;
      appropriately progressed to longer golf play as the PGA Professional feels it is appropriate.&#xD;
      All equipment and fees will be included and there will be no cost to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tasks (minimal risk):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Warm-up: Each training session will begin with a sport specific warm-up that prepares&#xD;
           the participants for the activities of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supplementary Exercises: Additional strengthening and flexibility exercises will be&#xD;
           included in training sessions to prepare the participants for golf-related activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Golf swings and putting: These movements will be introduced in a progressive nature&#xD;
           beginning with partial swings of the least forceful swing type and eventually&#xD;
           progressing to the more forceful swings (drives). Swings with the following equipment&#xD;
           will be included: putters, pitching or sand wedges, irons, and woods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Picking up a ball: The participants will be introduced to techniques to picking up a&#xD;
           golf ball which will be individualized to the needs of the participants based off&#xD;
           current research in the MBRL (HS-15-00038).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Walking: Participants will gradually increase walking distance. Practice will begin on&#xD;
           flat holes and will progress to holes with more challenging terrain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Golf play: Participants will be gradually introduced to regular golf play beginning with&#xD;
           play on a single, low difficulty hole and progressing to multiple holes. Skill&#xD;
           difficulty will also be gradually increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the intervention, walking distance will be tracked via fitness trackers. Golf&#xD;
           performance will be tracked as well.&#xD;

      Composition Score&#xD;
&#xD;
      13.2 POWER ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, this study has not been conducted and thus no preliminary data was available for a&#xD;
      power analysis. 25 subjects are requested to ensure for adequate sample size and account for&#xD;
      study attrition, based on other exercise intervention studies in older adults [36, 37].&#xD;
&#xD;
      13.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Within subject, pre-intervention and post-intervention comparisons&#xD;
      will be made for variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14.0 REGISTRATION GUIDELINE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following confirmation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, all potential participants&#xD;
      will be consented before enrollment in the study. Dr. George J. Salem, Kiran Kanwar, Hyun Ji&#xD;
      Lee, and Jared Moorewill be obtaining consent. George J. Salem, Kiran Kanwar, Hyun Ji Lee,&#xD;
      and Jared Moore have undergone CITI Training for human subjects' research. In order to&#xD;
      participate in the study, participants must be English speaking and have the ability to&#xD;
      follow instructions (as assessed by the Telephone Memory Impairment Screen); therefore, there&#xD;
      is no need of a legally authorized representative during the consent process. Participants&#xD;
      will be consented using a USC Informed Consent form after being explained the details of the&#xD;
      study and allowing for adequate time to ask questions and make a decision.&#xD;
