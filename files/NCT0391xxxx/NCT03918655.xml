    <textblock>
      This study is an observational study of MIF involvement in retrospectively and prospectively&#xD;
      included adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Standard care samples collected at diagnosis,&#xD;
      after one course of treatment, at time of remission controls, and at time of relapse will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective is to determine which AMLs have pre-leukemic stem cells that overexpress&#xD;
      MIF. Cytogenetic and molecular (NGS) profiling will be performed at diagnosis. Blood and bone&#xD;
      marrow plasma, as well as bone marrow mononuclear cells will be collected and stored. The&#xD;
      expression of MIF and its receptor (CD74 and CXCR4) will be analysed. Their prognostic value&#xD;
      will be also tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objective is to test whether patients in complete remission have persistent&#xD;
      pre-leukemic stem cells that overexpress MIF. Blood and bone marrow plasma, bone marrow&#xD;
      mononuclear cells from patients in complete remission will be collected. MIF, CD74, and CXCR4&#xD;
      expression by hematopoietic cells at time of diagnosis and remission will be compared to&#xD;
      determine which patients have a persistent overexpression/secretion of MIF. In the meantime,&#xD;
      the persistence of initiating lesions in complete remission samples will be tested by NGS,&#xD;
      digital PCR, FISH, or RT-PCR methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third objective is to develop a pre-clinical model to target MIF in immuno-compromised&#xD;
      mice (NSG mice) transplanted with primary AML cells and cells with pre-leukemic lesions. TET2&#xD;
      depletion leads to MIF over-expression/secretion by hematopoietic cells and improved&#xD;
      multi-lineage NSG-repopulation capacity. MIF inhibitors and anti-MIF antibodies will be&#xD;
      tested in these pre-clinical TET2-depleted models. Xenotransplantation of selected primary&#xD;
      AML samples and xenotransplantation of TET2 depleted hematopoietic stem cells into NSG mice&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fourth objective is to understand how MIF is deregulated in pre-leukemic stem cells and&#xD;
      how the MIF-dependent crosstalk between mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and pre-leukemic&#xD;
      stem cells or normal hematopoietic cells works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The molecular mechanisms of MIF overexpression will be analyzed in hematopoietic stem and&#xD;
      progenitor cells from normal and leukemic bone marrow, with a focus on cells depleted in TET2&#xD;
      or DNMT3A. To study the cross-talk between hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells,&#xD;
      pre-leukemic stem cells, and bone marrow MSCs, co-culture experiments will be performed using&#xD;
      available MSC cell lines and primary MSCs from healthy donors.&#xD;

      The study aims at studying the involvement of MIF in adult AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. DESCRIPTION OF THE ELEMENT OR ELEMENTS UNDER INVESTIGATION 1.1. Measurement of MIF&#xD;
      concentrations Plasma and BM supernatant from patients and controls (100 age-matched controls&#xD;
      for blood and BM plasma, available at Tours Hospital, ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT02789839 ) will&#xD;
      be analyzed by ELISA. BM supernatants will be obtained after a 2-step centrifugation&#xD;
      procedure: 1 mL of fresh BM from AML patients or control BM will be centrifuged at 540 g for&#xD;
      5 min to recover viable cells in the pellet (for cytometric and expression studies); the&#xD;
      supernatant will be centrifuged at 1000 g/15 min/4°C to prepare the plasma. MIF&#xD;
      concentrations in BM and blood plasma will be systematically compared. As MIF concentrations&#xD;
      may be affected by different factors, including inflammation, leukocytosis, and monocytosis,&#xD;
      blood cell counts and plasma C-reactive protein levels will be measured and taken into&#xD;
      account in the interpretation of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2. Measurement of MIF, CD74, and CXCR4 expression Hematopoietic stem cells, progenitor&#xD;
      cells and blasts from AML patients will be sorted according to the expression of CD34, CD38,&#xD;
      CD90, CD45-RA, IL-3R antigens, taking into account the initial immunophenotype of the&#xD;
      disease. Hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from control BM samples will be sorted&#xD;
      similarly. MIF, CD74 and CXCR4 RNA expression will be studied by quantitative RT-PCR in&#xD;
      sorted cell subpopulations. The surface expression of CXCR4 and anti-CD74 as well as&#xD;
      intracellular CD74 will be studied by multiparametric flow with cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3. Analysis of MIF, CD74, CXCR4 expression, and MIF concentrations at time of complete&#xD;
      remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses performed in a) and b) will be repeated in complete remission samples in 30 to&#xD;
      50 selected patients. Patients will be selected according to their response to therapy&#xD;
      (assessment of complete remission and normal blood counts), and to the genotype of their&#xD;
      disease (15-25 patients with either TET2 or DNMT3A mutations at diagnosis vs 15-25 patients&#xD;
      without these mutations). Samples will be collected after two chemotherapy courses at time of&#xD;
      remission evaluation. Whenever possible, bone marrow controls of patients in long term&#xD;
      remission (&gt; 1 year post diagnosis) will be collected and studied. In the meantime, NGS,&#xD;
      ddPCR, FISH or RT-PCR techniques will be used to assess the persistence or absence of the&#xD;
      initial AML lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that complete material will be obtained for 80% of included patients making&#xD;
      the objective of 240 patients achievable in less than three years. Cell purification may be&#xD;
      an issue in the context of AML with aberrant immunophenotype: this will be taken into account&#xD;
      by the use of appropriate FACS protocols. Regarding the focus on MIF pathway, it cannot rule&#xD;
      out that other chemokines/cytokines, or others molecules may be involved in the communication&#xD;
      of AML cells and their micro-environment. Thus, aliquots of BM and blood plasma will be&#xD;
      cryopreserved to allow a refinement of our strategy (for example to perform cytokine arrays,&#xD;
      ELISA, or MS analyses which are available at Saint-Antoine Hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4. Xenotransplantation model of primary AML in NSG mice Xenotransplantation models of&#xD;
      primary AML cells has been developed in a cohort of 70 AMLs in which MIF expression will be&#xD;
      analysed, the cytogenetic and molecular genotype, and correlate these parameters to different&#xD;
      engrafting phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5. MIF inhibition in NSG mice transplanted with AML cells and in NSG mice transplanted with&#xD;
      TET2-depleted or DNMT3A-depleted cord blood HSPCs The role of MIF on leukemia development in&#xD;
      NSG mice xenotransplanted with primary cells will be accessed. In these experiments, primary&#xD;
      AML patient cells from 6 patients with TET2 mutations of our cohort that engraft will be used&#xD;
      to generate leukemia. When leukemic development will be seen in blood (between 8 to 10&#xD;
      weeks), MIF expression will be measured in the serum of mice. Mice will be randomized into&#xD;
      three groups with 7 mice per group: One group will be treated with a commercially available&#xD;
      MIF inhibitor (ISO-1) and a second group with an anti MIF antibody and one group will be&#xD;
      treated by the vehicle for three weeks (one injection a week). Mice will then be monitored to&#xD;
      detect pre-leukemic engraftment and AML development using weekly blood sampling and&#xD;
      anti-human CD45 staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A model of xenotransplantation by cord blood CD34+ cells transduced with lentivectors&#xD;
      expressing TET2 shRNAs have been developed. These engineered CD34 positive cells showed&#xD;
      increased MIF expression and secretion and demonstrate enhanced multilineage NSG engraftment.&#xD;
      Il will be tested whether inhibition of MIF using MIF inhibitor or anti MIF antibody leads to&#xD;
      a correction of the enhanced multilineage NSG engraftment by TET2-depleted cells when&#xD;
      compared to control cells. Similar experiments will be performed with a DNMT3A-depleted model&#xD;
      using DNMT3A shRNAs that are currently available in the laboratory. In addition, the effects&#xD;
      of MIF inhibition (inhibitor and antibody) and recombinant human MIF will be analyzed in NSG&#xD;
      repopulation assays of unprocessed normal cord blood CD34+ cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.6. MIF inhibition in NSG mice transplanted with cells from patients in complete remission&#xD;
      with persistent clonal hematopoiesis (DNMT3A / TET2 mutant) Complete remission samples from&#xD;
      six patients with persistent clonal hematopoiesis in complete remission will be selected and&#xD;
      treated as in a) to test whether MIF inhibition is also able to counteract NSG repopulation&#xD;
      by residual pre-leukemic stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that MIF inhibition will impair AML development in mice. However, stability&#xD;
      and side effects of anti MIF antibody or inhibitors may be an issue in treated animals. In&#xD;
      this case, shRNAs will be used to knock-down MIF in AML cells before injection to NSG mice.&#xD;
      Another issue may be the need for co-injection of MSCs at time of xenotransplantation to&#xD;
      increase the relevance of the model. If needed, normal MSCs and AML MSCs will be collected,&#xD;
      prepared, and co-injected with AML cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.7. Full characterization of the up-regulation of MIF in TET2 depleted cells How TET2 might&#xD;
      impact gene regulation remains still not completely understood. Recently, Cao X's team has&#xD;
      shown that loss of Tet2 resulted in the upregulation of several inflammatory mediators. In&#xD;
      this model, Tet2 recruited Hdac2 and repressed transcription of Il6 via histone&#xD;
      deacetylation. It has been found that TET2 binds the proximal promoter of MIF gene which is&#xD;
      enriched in CpG islands in Kasumi cells. Loss of TET2 results in MIF accumulation in several&#xD;
      leukemic models through EGR1. i) MIF promoter methylation will be analyzed by sequencing&#xD;
      after bisulfite treatment in normal CD34+ cells (20 samples) and cell populations from AMLs&#xD;
      sorted as in c)(150 samples) ii) EGR1 mRNA expression will be analyzed by qRT-PCR in normal&#xD;
      and AML pre-leukemic stem cells to see if there is a correlation with MIF expression as&#xD;
      observed in other models iii) ChIP-PCR analyses focusing on MIF promoter will be performed&#xD;
      for EGR1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and HDAC2 in control and AML patient samples. If EGR1 is not&#xD;
      involved in this system, MIF promoter luciferase assay will be used to identify transcription&#xD;
      factor sites that are essential for its up-regulation in AML samples and validate the targets&#xD;
      by ChIP-PCR. All these technologies are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.8. bidirectional communication between MSCs and AML cells or normal HSPCs The impact of MIF&#xD;
      overexpression in AML cells will be tested on the physiology of normal MSCs (differentiation,&#xD;
      sustain of hematopoiesis, production of cytokines / chemokines, interactome). For this aim,&#xD;
      normal primary MSCs from adult bone marrow (already available) will be isolated and expanded&#xD;
      as described (Reinisch A et al, Blood 2015, 125:249-260). The Cells will be amplified up to&#xD;
      passage 2 (P2). MSCs will be treated with different concentrations of recombinant MIF for 24&#xD;
      and 48 hours and the proliferation, production of cytokines/ chemokines will be evaluated. As&#xD;
      it has been reported that MIF stimulates glycolysis, the effects of MIF will also decipher&#xD;
      will be also deciphered in the energetic metabolism of MSCs by measuring mitochondrial&#xD;
      respiration and glycolysis of MSCs (Seahorse XF extracellular flux analyzer) and by&#xD;
      determining their MIF-induced metabolic signature using high throughput multiplexed&#xD;
      fingerprinting (Omnilog Biolog). To model the effects of MIF overexpression by AML cells,&#xD;
      will perform co-culture experiments between human primary AML cells (5 samples) that express&#xD;
      or not (shRNA) of MIF. After 24 and 48 hours, MSCs will be sorted and their proliferation,&#xD;
      cell cycle and differentiation potential into osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes will&#xD;
      be evaluated. Previous studies indicate that MIF-CXCR4 is a novel axis for MSC recruitment to&#xD;
      tumors in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus it will be studied whether recombinant MIF may recruit MSCs using in vitro transwell&#xD;
      assays. Effect of MIF production by AML cells on MSCs recruitment will be tested using AML&#xD;
      conditioned medium. AML cells engineered with MIF shRNA will be used in this context. As it&#xD;
      cannot rule out that MSCs may also contribute to MIF production, mRNA expression will be&#xD;
      tested by primary normal MSC cocultured with AML cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that recombinant MIF will have an impact on either proliferation, cell cycle,&#xD;
      differentiation potential or migration of MSCs. However, MIF produced in BM microenvironment&#xD;
      could also modify the biology of other populations of the stem cell niche including&#xD;
      osteoblasts, endothelial cells or macrophages. To investigate alternative cells on which MIF&#xD;
      may have an impact, it will be test its effects on these populations. MSCs will be induced to&#xD;
      differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes or chondrocytes. MIF will then be added to&#xD;
      investigate proliferation, cell cycle and migration of populations of interest. Effect on&#xD;
      osteoblasts and endothelial cells will be modelized using MG63 and Huvec cell lines,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.9. Study population 1.9.1. Participant recruitment 300 adult patients (&gt;18) newly diagnosed&#xD;
      with AML will be included in the study. 85 patients diagnosed since novembe 2015 at&#xD;

      year) and Tours University Hospital for AML (&gt;30 patients per year)].&#xD;
