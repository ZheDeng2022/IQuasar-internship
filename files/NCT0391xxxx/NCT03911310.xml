  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently occurring male cancer in Belgium. After&#xD;
      treatment with surgery and/or radiotherapy, almost half of the patients suffer from a tumor&#xD;
      recurrence, often diagnosed by an increase in serum tumor marker Prostate Specific Antigen&#xD;
      (PSA) within the first few years after primary treatment. However, for salvage therapy to be&#xD;
      successful, precise localization of metastases is necessary to determine the most appropriate&#xD;
      treatment. In so-called oligo-metastatic disease targeted therapy may still be curative and&#xD;
      prevent the disease from spreading to distant locations. Therefore it is of paramount&#xD;
      importance to have an accurate tool of medical imaging to localize all possible locations to&#xD;
      be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has gained interest for PCa-specific&#xD;
      imaging. Due to overexpression of PSMA in both primary and metastatic PCa, radiotracers&#xD;
      targeting this protein have shown an increased selectivity and sensitivity compared to&#xD;
      conventional imaging. The main objective of this phase 3 trial is to determine the position&#xD;
      of [18F]PSMA-11 PET/CT within the field of available radiotracers for diagnosis of prostate&#xD;
      cancer. For this, the diagnostic performances of [18F]PSMA-11 will be compared to those of&#xD;
      the current state-of-the-art radiotracer [68Ga]PSMA-11.&#xD;

    <intervention_model>Crossover Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>The trial encompasses a double-blind randomized cross-over design whereby each patient will be subjected to a [18F]PSMA-11 scan and a [68Ga]PSMA-11 scan, with an interscan period of four days to maximum three weeks. Half of the patients will be first scanned with [18F]PSMA-11 and subsequently (maximum three weeks later) with [68Ga]PSMA-11. The scan order in the remaining group of patients will be reversed. Randomization of patients to one of these groups will be performed using a block randomization design with block sizes of six.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The assigned scan order will be blind to the recruiting physicians and the nuclear medicine physicians interpreting the images.&#xD;
Next to the clinical trial coordinators, also the staff members responsible for the preparation of the individual [18F]PSMA-11 and [68Ga]PSMA-11 dose and the IV injection of this dose are aware of the scan order which means that they are NOT blinded. However, these staff members do not carry out any further study specific handlings.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of the non-inferiority of [18F]PSMA-11 compared to [68Ga]PSMA-11 with respect to the number of positive PET scans. Hereby, a positive PET scan is defined as a scan showing at least one suspected lesion.</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 100 minutes post injection for both [18F]PSMA-11 and [68Ga]PSMA-11</time_frame>
    <description>The non-inferiority of [18F]PSMA-11 will be investigated based on a Tango's score two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for a difference of proportions of positive scans of [18F]PSMA-11 compared to [68Ga]PSMA-11 with matched pairs. Non-inferiority will be concluded if the lower limit of this CI is larger than 0.10 (non-inferiority limit).</description>

    <description>Superiority of [18F]PSMA-11 compared to [68Ga]PSMA-11 with respect to the number of positive PET scans will be statistically assessed by applying a McNemar's test on the proportions of positive PET scans in each group. Hereby, superiority is defined as a difference of minimum 10% in the proportions of positive PET scans ([18F]PSMA-11 &gt; [68Ga]PSMA-11).</description>

    <description>This endpoint will be examined in the total group of patients, as well as in a subgroup of patients with a specific disease stage including primary diagnosis, castrate sensitive biochemical recurrence, and castrate resistant biochemical recurrence.

    <description>This endpoint will be evaluated in a descriptive way, more specifically by a description of the number of positive scans (and/or positive lesions) that can be confirmed via an anatomopathological diagnosis, changes in PSA concentration or via MRI, and by comparison of these numbers between [18F]PSMA-11 and [68Ga]PSMA-11.</description>

    <time_frame>0 to 24 h post [18F]PSMA-11 and [68Ga]PSMA-11 administration</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be reported and scored (CTCAE 4.0 criteria) between the first dose administration of trial medication and the last trial related activity. From the time of radiotracer injection till completion of the PET/CT scan (for both [18F]PSMA-11 and [68Ga]PSMA-11), the site staff will visually observe and actively ask the patient whether or not he has observed any adverse effects. Although [18F]PSMA-11 is totally eliminated from the body within 9 hours post injection (= 10 x half-life of 47 Â± 5 minutes), AE's occurring up to 24h after the second PET/CT scan will also be handled as such if spontaneously reported by the patient to the investigator.</description>
