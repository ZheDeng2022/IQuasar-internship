  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rare systemic auto inflammatory diseases are a group of diseases that can be inherited and&#xD;
      have non specific symptoms (fevers, rashes, joint pain, etc.). These diseases can be divided&#xD;
      into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diseases for which genetic mutations have been identified&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The so-called genetically undetermined diseases for which no genetic mutation has been&#xD;
           identified and for which the diagnosis is based on the elimination of other causes of&#xD;
           disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the causes and mechanisms of these diseases are poorly understood and their&#xD;
      diagnosis is difficult, often leading to misdiagnosis. The usual care integrates&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory treatments (aspirin, colchicine, cortisone, biotherapies, etc.) and support&#xD;
      for patients and their families by health professionals (doctors, nurses, physiotherapists,&#xD;
      etc.). To date, a patient with one of these diseases can receive up to 5 inappropriate or&#xD;
      ineffective treatments before the right diagnosis is made and the right therapy is put in&#xD;
      place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to develop rapid and effective diagnostic methods for these&#xD;
      diseases by the identification of biological markers present in blood, urine or stool of&#xD;
      patient in order to develop a rapid and efficient diagnostic method.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to develop rapid and effective diagnostic methods for these&#xD;
      diseases by the identification of biological markers present in blood, urine or stool of&#xD;
      patient in order to develop a rapid and efficient diagnostic method. To this end,&#xD;
      investigators are building a collection of biological samples derived from blood (plasma,&#xD;
      serum, cells and DNA) as well as urine and stool to perform biological assays and multiple&#xD;
      analyses so-called &quot;omics&quot;: genomics (on the entire genome), proteomics (on all proteins)&#xD;
      etc...This will make it possible to identify the genetic mutations or biological markers&#xD;
      present or absent in these diseases, making it possible to confirm a diagnosis or to&#xD;
      eliminate differential diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand and identify the abnormalities leading to the onset of auto-inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases, four groups will be constituted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a group of patients with auto-inflammatory diseases for which a genetic mutation has&#xD;
           been identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a group of subjects free from any auto-inflammatory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a group of patients suffering from an auto-inflammatory disease, poorly characterized;&#xD;
           i.e. auto-inflammatory diseases for which clinicians are not certain on mechanisms&#xD;
           leading to the onset of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a group of parents of patients suffering from an auto-inflammatory disease, poorly&#xD;
           characterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a routine follow-up visit, the investigator will inform the participant about the nature&#xD;
      and purpose of the study research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant agree, the participant will sign the consent to participate in this study&#xD;
      and the tests investigators will administer for this study will take place during a&#xD;
      consultation of approximately 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to carry out the biological assays as well as the multiple &quot;omics&quot; analyses&#xD;
      (genomics (on the whole genome), proteomics (on all proteins)), a blood sample will be taken&#xD;
      depending on your weight and age and according to the recommendation in force (maximum of 11&#xD;
      × 7 mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will also be asked to collect urine and stool using a kit designed for this&#xD;
      purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research requires collecting from participant medical file the personal demographic&#xD;
      data, medical data, medical imaging results and biological and genetic analyses. All these&#xD;
      analyses will have been carried out as part of the diagnosis and management of participant&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will collect participant laboratory test results (immunology, serology,&#xD;
      biochemistry, genetics...) in order to describe the characteristics of their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During patient participation and in order to assess your quality of life, particiapnts will&#xD;
      be asked to complete a specific questionnaire (SF-36, about 15 minutes). During this&#xD;
      consultation you will also be asked to complete (i) a simple questionnaire that describes&#xD;
      your functional abilities (HAQ, about 10 minutes), (ii) the AIDAI (Auto-inflammatory Disease&#xD;
      Activity Index) score that allows you to evaluate the activity of your auto-inflammatory&#xD;
      disease and (iii) a questionnaire focusing on your diet and gut function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the case, a follow-up consultation at 3 months may be offered by the&#xD;
      investigator. This visit will last a maximum of one hour and will be combined with a new&#xD;
      blood test, a urine and stool collection and the completion of a questionnaire on diet and&#xD;
      gut function .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, a 12-month follow-up survey may be conducted by the investigator (by telephone or by&#xD;
      medical file) to ensure your health status, for the sole purpose of the research.&#xD;
