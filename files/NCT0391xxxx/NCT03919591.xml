  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to infect healthy volunteers aged 60-75 years old with&#xD;
      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) to confirm how safe and well tolerated the use of an&#xD;
      experimental RSV virus is in a population that has not previously received the virus.&#xD;
      Additionally, this study will also look at various components of the volunteers' blood, the&#xD;
      lining of their noses and other samples in order to measure the effects of the virus on the&#xD;
      body, in particularly the immune system before, during and after viral infection.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RSV is a common virus that affects all human age groups. Typical RSV illness is identified by&#xD;
      symptoms such as runny nose, stuffy nose, sneezing, sore throat, earache, malaise or&#xD;
      tiredness, cough, shortness of breath, headache, muscle ache, joint ache or stiffness,&#xD;
      chilliness and feverishness. RSV spreads easily from person to person through the eyes, nose&#xD;
      or mouth when droplets containing the virus, such as those from coughing or sneezing, are&#xD;
      inhaled or passed to others. Adults with risk factors, like another illness or disease, may&#xD;
      experience an RSV illness that is more severe or lasts longer. RSV may also start a worsening&#xD;
      of health in frail adults, people with weak immune systems, and those with chronic&#xD;
      cardio-pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No treatment or vaccine to treat or prevent RSV disease is available in the UK. Vaccination&#xD;
      against RSV has the potential to be a highly beneficial and effective approach to reduce RSV&#xD;
      disease in older adults as well as other high-risk adult and paediatric populations. The use&#xD;
      of RSV human viral challenge model provides an important tool to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of new RSV vaccines. Specifically, a RSV human viral challenge in 60 to 75-year-old&#xD;
      individuals would enable measuring the effectiveness of RSV vaccines in a population that is&#xD;
      thought to be less responsive to vaccines than the 18-45-year-old population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to infect up to 74 healthy subjects aged 60 to 75 years old with&#xD;
      RSV in a controlled quarantine environment to confirm how safe and well tolerated the use of&#xD;
      an experimental RSV virus infection is in a population that has not previously received the&#xD;
      virus. Additionally, the investigators will also look at various components of the subjects'&#xD;
      blood, the lining of their noses and other samples in order to measure the effects of the&#xD;
      virus on the body, in particularly the immune system before, during and after viral&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 3 phases: 1) Screening, 2) Quarantine and 3) Follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrolment of the subjects will be staggered with safety data reviews performed between&#xD;
      groups. Each volunteer will be in the study for approximately 3 months from screening to&#xD;
      their last scheduled clinic visit.&#xD;
