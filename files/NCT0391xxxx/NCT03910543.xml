  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open-label clinical trial of tofacitinib in cutaneous sarcoidosis and GA. The hypothesis&#xD;
      is that Janus Kinase (JAK) 1/3 inhibition with tofacitinib will be effective for the&#xD;
      treatment these two diseases. Tofacitinib will be administered at a dose of 5 mg twice daily&#xD;
      and response to therapy will be assessed at months 1, 3, and 6 of therapy. The primary&#xD;
      outcomes will be improvement in the Cutaneous Sarcoidosis Activity and Morphology Instrument&#xD;
      (CSAMI) and Granuloma Activity Scoring Index (GASI) after 6 months of tofacitinib therapy.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include improvement in internal organ sarcoidosis (i.e. lung,&#xD;
      cardiac) and skin related quality of life. Pre- and on treatment PET-CT scans will be&#xD;
      performed in patients with sarcoidosis with internal organ involvement. Pre- and on treatment&#xD;
      blood collection and skin biopsies will be performed for correlative scientific studies using&#xD;
      RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and cytokine profiling.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 - 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>For patients with sarcoidosis: change in CSAMI score after 6 months of treatment with tofacitinib compared to baseline.&#xD;
The activity portion of the CSAMI score will be utilized. The range of scores is from 0 to 165. Higher scores correspond with higher cutaneous disease burden.&#xD;
The percentage change in CSAMI score will be calculated as follows:&#xD;
change in CSAMI score = [baseline CSAMI - final CSAMI] / baseline CSAMI&#xD;
Higher percentage change corresponds to more improvement on therapy (0% = no change, 100% = complete disease resolution) Negative percentage change corresponds to disease worsening (-25% = 25% worsening of disease)</description>

The range of BSA involvement for this study is from 5% to 100%. Higher BSA involvement corresponds with higher cutaneous disease burden.&#xD;
The percentage change in BSA will be calculated as follows:&#xD;
Change in BSA = [baseline BSA- final BSA] / baseline BSA Higher percentage change corresponds to more improvement on therapy (0% = no change, 100% = complete disease resolution) Negative percentage change corresponds to disease worsening (-25% = 25% worsening of disease).</description>
