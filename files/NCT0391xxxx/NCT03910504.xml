  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled trial the investigators want to assess if, compared to&#xD;
      controls, the administration of one single low-dose of rocuronium would increase the&#xD;
      occurrence of absent or weak (i.e. amplitude &lt;100 μV) signal at V1 and R1, indicating a&#xD;
      residual NMBA activity. In addition, we also recorded: 1) the occurrence of difficult&#xD;
      laryngoscopy; 2) the time-to-intubation; 3) the occurrence of difficult intubation; 4) the&#xD;
      number of intubation attempts; 5) the intubation failure rate; 6) the need for oxygenation&#xD;
      between intubation attempts; 7) the lowest peripheral saturation in oxygen (SpO2); 8) the&#xD;
      number of severe desaturations; 9) the time-to-V1 and 10) the number of post-surgical&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The lesion of laryngeal nerves is one of the most severe complications, which could be&#xD;
      observed during the thyroid and parathyroid surgery. The recent clinical review, relative the&#xD;
      problem and based on 27 articles and 25000 patients involved, shows that the incidence of the&#xD;
      temporary paralysis of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) was 9,8%, and the permanent&#xD;
      paralysis of the nerve was 2,3%. In the most cases the typical reasons of lesions of RLN are:&#xD;
      section, clamping, electrothermic damage, stretching or entrapment of the nerve. The lesions&#xD;
      of the RLN could lead to voice disturbance, breathing and swallow alterations. It is also one&#xD;
      of the most frequent reasons for legal medicine disputes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intraoperative nerve-monitoring (IONM) of the RLN and of the external branch of superior&#xD;
      laryngeal nerve (EBSLN) has been suggested as an instrument to limit the risk of&#xD;
      post-operative damaging. It was introduced in the 60's, and the method was accepted by&#xD;
      surgical community with the great enthusiasm. This technique is based on employment of&#xD;
      special electrode, which transmits electrical signal of low amperage and stimulates directly&#xD;
      the RLN, evaluating the muscle response. The stimulation of the EBSLN is commonly identified&#xD;
      by contractions of cricothyroid muscle. On the other hand, the stimulation of the RLN leads&#xD;
      to the response of the relative vocal cord, which could be palpated or observed by means of&#xD;
      electromyography (EMG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For implementation of the good IONM the collaboration between the surgeons and the&#xD;
      anaesthesiologists is strongly required, e.g. the vocal cords are been monitored during the&#xD;
      operation by means of laryngoscopy or a special endotracheal tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The particular role for the anaesthesiologists during the operation is the way of using of&#xD;
      muscle relaxants. In fact, long-action agents should be generally avoided to prevent the&#xD;
      absence of adequate muscle response, during the IONM.&#xD;

    <description>One hour before the operation the patient will receive the midazolam from 1 to 5 mg intravenous. After the adequate preoxigenation and denitrogenation, the induction phase will be performed with the propofol 2 mg/kg intravenous bolus (for the sedation). At the same time continues infusion of remifentanyl (up to 1 mcg/kg/min) will guarantee the adequate anaesthesia.&#xD;
Patients, who have been randomized to this group, will be obtained single reduced dose of rocuronium (0,3 mg/kg) once intravenous bolus. The dose of rocuronium will be prepared by an external investigator, to leave the anesthesiologist blinded of the group treatment. The drug will be diluited in a syringe with 20 ml of solution.</description>
