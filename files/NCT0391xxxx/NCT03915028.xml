  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive disease with a high prevalence in France,&#xD;
      with significant public health consequences. The benefit of spa treatments on the quality of&#xD;
      life in this population has not been evaluated. The methods of study in clinical pharmacology&#xD;
      can be a scientific methodological model for the evaluation of thermal practices and it is in&#xD;
      this perspective that investigators want to lead this project.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive disease with a high prevalence in France,&#xD;
      and its consequences in terms of public health are important. In this disease, the alteration&#xD;
      of the quality of life (QoL) is constant and multifactorial : pain, fatigue, decrease in&#xD;
      functional capacities, sleep disorders, cognitive disorders, vesico-sphincterian disorders,&#xD;
      anomolytic disorders. -rectal and genito-sexual. The benefit of thermal cures on the quality&#xD;
      of life in this population has not been evaluated, even if there is some literature in the&#xD;
      literature suggesting a benefit of hydrotherapy on equilibrium or on pain.&#xD;

    <measure>Benefit of spa treatment on quality of life assessed by the scale SEP-59</measure>
    <time_frame>within 15 weeks after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Difference of the score of quality of live assessed by the scale SEP-59 between the patient will receive the immediat spa therapy and the second group which won't receive the spa therapy immediately. SEP-59 is built on the basis of a generic scale, the SF-36. The analysis of SEP-59 is done by computer processing in order to calculate the score of the various axes (pain, physical activity, general wellbeing ...) which are independent (there is no overall score).</description>

    <measure>Benefit of a thermal cure based on depression and anxiety assessed by the scale Hospital Anxiety and depression scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 to 17 weeks after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Difference of the level of pain assessed by the scale Hospital Anxiety and depression between the patient will receive the immediat spa therapy and the second group which won't receive the spa therapy immediately.HADS is a self-administered scale of 14 items, divided into 2 subscales of 7 items (Anxiety or HADS-A, Depression or HADS-D). It contains no somatic item that can be confused with symptomatic manifestations of a disease.&#xD;
Each item is scored on a scale of 0 to 3. A score is generated for each of the two sub-scales and for the entire HADS (HADS-T).&#xD;
Limit scores distinguish between: non-cases or asymptomatic cases (score ≤ 7); probable or borderline cases (score 8-10); clearly or clinically symptomatic cases (score ≥ 11).</description>

    <measure>Benefit of a thermal cure based on tiredness assesed by the fatigue impact scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 to 17 weeks after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Difference of the level of pain assessed by the fatigue impact scale between the patient will receive the immediat spa therapy and the second group which won't receive the spa therapy immediately. It is a self-assessment tool in which the patient is asked to note the extent to which fatigue has caused them problems in certain situations. (0 = no problem, 4 = extreme problems). A maximum score of 160 is obtained for the 40 items.</description>
