    <textblock>
      Neuraxial anesthesia has been associated with delayed brainstem conduction and decreasing&#xD;
      afferent sensory transmission, thereby modifying reticulo-thalamo-cortical mechanisms&#xD;
      regulating arousal. The state of entropy measured by EEG-monitors has detected sedative&#xD;
      effects associated with neuraxial anaesthesia in healthy volunteers, as well as during&#xD;
      caesarean delivery. Entropy is a measure of the irregularity or disorder of a brains activity&#xD;
      - sedation leading to a decrease of irregularity or disorder in the EEG.The aim of this pilot&#xD;
      study is to prospectively assess the effect of spinal anaesthesia in healthy and preeclamptic&#xD;
      parturients on brain activity. Decreased epileptiform activity in patients with preeclampsia&#xD;
      would suggest that early neuraxial analgesia in labouring preeclamptic patients is&#xD;
      beneficial, and may protect against neurological complications.&#xD;

      Neuraxial anesthesia has been associated with delayed brainstem conduction and decreasing&#xD;
      afferent sensory transmission, thereby modifying reticulo-thalamo-cortical mechanisms&#xD;
      regulating arousal. The state of entropy measured by EEG-monitors has detected sedative&#xD;
      effects associated with neuraxial anaesthesia in healthy volunteers, as well as during&#xD;
      caesarean delivery. Entropy is a measure of the irregularity or disorder of a brains activity&#xD;
      - sedation leading to a decrease of irregularity or disorder in the EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EEG activity in general can be separated into background activity, focal abnormalities,&#xD;
      and intermittent and paroxysmal activity.8 Background electrical activity measured with the&#xD;
      EEG by surface electrodes, are characterized by their corresponding frequency wave bands,&#xD;
      ranging from slow waves (&lt; 1 Hz), Delta (1 - 4 Hz), Theta (4 - 8 Hz), Alpha (8 - 12 Hz), Beta&#xD;
      (12 - 30 Hz) and Gamma (&gt; 30 Hz). In healthy volunteers, neuraxial anaesthesia was linked to&#xD;
      increased activity - the so-called state of paradoxical excitation. This pattern is similar&#xD;
      to the sedative low-dose GABAergic effects known to occur in response to the benzodiazepine&#xD;
      midazolam. Epileptic potentials as paroxysmal EEG activity are typically seen with seizures,&#xD;
      but they can be a sign of other changes of brain state as well (e.g. (pre)eclampsia or high&#xD;
      doses of opioids).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preeclampsia constitutes a heterogeneous multisystemic disorder defined by the new onset of&#xD;
      hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation, affecting 2-8 % of all pregnancies&#xD;
      world-wide. In this condition the nervous system is commonly affected, being the cause of&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality, when seizures occur resembling an epileptic grand-mal&#xD;
      convulsion. Significantly, cerebral white matter lesions are described several years after&#xD;
      eclamptic episodes. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is also suggested to&#xD;
      be a core component of eclampsia. In this condition is associated extensive white matter&#xD;
      changes have been detected, using advanced neuroimaging techniques. EEG changes can be&#xD;
      detected before clinical signs of PRES are present, and before ischemia leads to irreversible&#xD;
      brain damage.14 In preeclampsia EEG changes are also common, consisting of slow waves in the&#xD;
      occipital lobe, as well as spike discharges. These EEG changes have been reported in&#xD;
      eclampsia and in severe preeclampsia, with some differences between the two conditions. The&#xD;
      prevention of eclampsia, which can occur pre-, intra-, or postpartum, is thus a critical&#xD;
      management goal. Current literature only describes the use of EEG entropy - reflecting the&#xD;
      state of arousal - during neuraxial anaesthesia in parturients. So far no study has assessed&#xD;
      the quantitative (qEEG) or paroxysmal EEG changes induced by neuraxial anaesthesia in&#xD;
      parturients undergoing caesarean delivery, and such monitoring has particular relevance in a&#xD;
      high-risk patient population with preeclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this pilot study is to prospectively assess the effect of spinal anaesthesia in&#xD;
      healthy and preeclamptic parturients on brain activity. Decreased epileptiform activity in&#xD;
      patients with preeclampsia would suggest that early neuraxial analgesia in labouring&#xD;
      preeclamptic patients is beneficial, and may protect against neurological complications.&#xD;
