  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study will investigate the difference in ocular characteristics between contact&#xD;
      lens wear and spectacle wear among habitual contact lens wearers, using a 2-treatment by&#xD;
      2-period cross-over design. There will be a 1-week washout between the two study periods to&#xD;
      eliminate any potential carryover effect.&#xD;

    <measure>Non-Invasive Break Up Time (NIBUT) or Non-Invasive Keratograph Break Up Time (NIKBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>NIBUT/NIKBUT was measured as the time interval in seconds after the final blink to the first appearance of distortion in the reflected rings; or to the time that the participant has to blink due to discomfort. NIBUT is measured by a topographer (e.g. Medmont) via observation by the investigator and a stopwatch. NIKBUTis measured by the Oculus Keratograph and reported by the instrument. Different instrumentation was used depending on site availability. Combined measurements of pre-lens data collected for the interventional arm are reported. Only the interventional arm was reported since the primary analysis was conducted among habitual contact lens users. The average NIKBUT was reported for each treatment. Higher values indicate better performance</description>

    <measure>Total Scores of Meibomian Gland Expressibility (MGE)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Meibomian gland expressiblity was assessed in three regions of the lower eyelid: temporal, central, and nasal. Each region is expressed and the overall grade of the region is evaluated using a four-grade scale: 0 = No Secretion, 1 = Inspissated, 2 = Colored/Cloudy Liquid, and 3 = Clear Liquid Oil. The total score was calculated as the sum of all grades across the three regions and ranged from 0 (no secretion) to 9, with higher scores indicating more MGE. Total scores were converted into a binary variable for the analysis purpose where Y=1 if the total score is greater than 6 and 0 otherwise. The percentage of participants with MGE total score greater than 6 was estimated. Only the interventional arm was reported since the secondary analysis was conducted among habitual contact lens users.</description>

    <measure>Conjunctival Staining</measure>
    <time_frame>1-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Conjunctival staining was graded and recorded by quadrant (Superior, Inferior, Nasal, and Temporal) using the following grading scale: Grade 0 = None, Grade 1 = Trace, Grade 2 = Mild, Grade 3 = Moderate, and Grade 4 = Severe. Average grade was calculated based on grades of the four quadrants. Only the interventional arm was reported since the secondary analysis was conducted among habitual contact lens users.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Eyes With Clinically Significant (Grade 3 or 4 of Overall Classification) Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy</measure>
    <time_frame>1-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Horizontal lid margin staining and sagittal lid margin staining are graded for each eyelid (upper and lower) separately. The horizontal and sagittal grades are then averaged for each eyelid to obtain the upper lid average grade and lower lid average grade. The final grade is the average of the upper and lower lid average grades. Participants can be classified according to their final grades for each eye. The classification is defined as follows: &quot;None&quot; for final grades of 0, &quot;Mild&quot; for final grades between 0.25 and 1.00, &quot;Moderate&quot; for final grades between 1.25 and 2.00, and &quot;Severe&quot; for final graded between 2.25 and 3.00. Only the interventional arm was reported since the secondary analysis was planned to be conducted among habitual contact lens users only.</description>

        <description>NIBUT/NIKBUT was measured as the time interval in seconds after the final blink to the first appearance of distortion in the reflected rings; or to the time that the participant has to blink due to discomfort. NIBUT is measured by a topographer (e.g. Medmont) via observation by the investigator and a stopwatch. NIKBUTis measured by the Oculus Keratograph and reported by the instrument. Different instrumentation was used depending on site availability. Combined measurements of pre-lens data collected for the interventional arm are reported. Only the interventional arm was reported since the primary analysis was conducted among habitual contact lens users. The average NIKBUT was reported for each treatment.

        <title>Total Scores of Meibomian Gland Expressibility (MGE)</title>
        <description>Meibomian gland expressiblity was assessed in three regions of the lower eyelid: temporal, central, and nasal. Each region is expressed and the overall grade of the region is evaluated using a four-grade scale: 0 = No Secretion, 1 = Inspissated, 2 = Colored/Cloudy Liquid, and 3 = Clear Liquid Oil. The total score was calculated as the sum of all grades across the three regions and ranged from 0 (no secretion) to 9, with higher scores indicating more MGE. Total scores were converted into a binary variable for the analysis purpose where Y=1 if the total score is greater than 6 and 0 otherwise. The percentage of participants with MGE total score greater than 6 was estimated. Only the interventional arm was reported since the secondary analysis was conducted among habitual contact lens users.</description>

        <description>Conjunctival staining was graded and recorded by quadrant (Superior, Inferior, Nasal, and Temporal) using the following grading scale: Grade 0 = None, Grade 1 = Trace, Grade 2 = Mild, Grade 3 = Moderate, and Grade 4 = Severe. Average grade was calculated based on grades of the four quadrants.

        <description>Horizontal lid margin staining and sagittal lid margin staining are graded for each eyelid (upper and lower) separately. The horizontal and sagittal grades are then averaged for each eyelid to obtain the upper lid average grade and lower lid average grade. The final grade is the average of the upper and lower lid average grades. Participants can be classified according to their final grades for each eye. The classification is defined as follows: &quot;None&quot; for final grades of 0, &quot;Mild&quot; for final grades between 0.25 and 1.00, &quot;Moderate&quot; for final grades between 1.25 and 2.00, and &quot;Severe&quot; for final graded between 2.25 and 3.00.
