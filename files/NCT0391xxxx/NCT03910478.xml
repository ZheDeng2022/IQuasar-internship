  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial to assess whether a subject centered, self-collection of&#xD;
      Dried blood spots (DBS) samples will improve compliance with the clinical recommendation of&#xD;
      weekly Cytomegalovirus (CMV) testing of Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients&#xD;
      who are at high risk for late CMV disease. In this study, mobile devices will be used to&#xD;
      remind HCT survivors to perform CMV monitoring using finger-stick collected DBS testing in&#xD;
      their home setting or to visit their doctor's office to perform the test. 150 allogeneic HCT&#xD;
      recipients &gt; /= 15 years of age will be randomized (2:1) to DBS monitoring or standard of&#xD;
      care (per local institution) monitoring. Duration of study participation is anticipated to be&#xD;
      within a range of 26 weeks to 43 weeks. The primary objective is to evaluate adherence to&#xD;
      recommended CMV monitoring duration and interval during the first year after HCT upon&#xD;
      enrollment using subject collected dried blood spot testing.&#xD;

      enrollment using subject collected dried blood spot testing. The secondary objectives are 1)&#xD;
      To evaluate the mean difference between the recommended monitoring that each subject&#xD;
      completes between the DBS and the control arm. 2) To compare the incidence of CMV disease&#xD;
      between the DBS monitoring and standard of care arm; 3) To evaluate the safety of DBS&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
