    <textblock>
      The aim of the present project is to assess the effects of the chronic diseases and their&#xD;
      associated treatments chronic paediatric diseases (CPD), to further understand their impact&#xD;
      on physical fitness for public health perspectives. This is an innovative approach in the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic paediatric diseases . This project should yield results that help&#xD;
      improving treatments for children and adolescents with chronic paediatric diseases throughout&#xD;
      physical activity as therapy, reduced pain, fatigue and inflammation, and improvement in&#xD;
      physical fitness and life quality. The originality and novelty of this project is to combine&#xD;
      architectural, functional and metabolic components of skeletal muscle to further understand&#xD;
      the impact of chronic paediatric diseases as a function of treatment, disease activity and&#xD;
      maturation status (prepubertal, pubertal or post pubertal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will aim at assessing muscular function (force production capacity and&#xD;
      fatigability) in specific or ecologic situations so as to get information about muscle&#xD;
      functioning on isolated muscle group (here knee extensors) or during whole body exercise.&#xD;
      Moreover, results arising from muscle architecture or quality will allow understanding the&#xD;
      decrease in strength or endurance reported in the literature. The data collected will allow&#xD;
      us to further understand the impact of the disease on structural, functional and metabolic&#xD;
      parameters. Finally, the understanding of these alterations will provide information enabling&#xD;
      to establish recommendations in physical activity (PA) to reduce or even counter the effect&#xD;
      of the chronic inflammation and prevent at long-term overweight and cardiovascular risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term objective is to contribute establishing recommendations or guidelines for&#xD;
      prescribing physical activity during medical therapy. Values obtained in pathological&#xD;
      children will be compared to those of control children matched for gender and maturation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be separated in different subgroups. Subgroups will be constituted according&#xD;
      the disease status (active vs inactive) to assess the impact of the pathology on physical&#xD;
      fitness and according to treatments to assess the effect of treatment on physical fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will perform physical tests to provide information about their physical fitness&#xD;
      (body composition, metabolic flexibility, muscle strength and fatigue, bone mineral density),&#xD;
      which will be compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Patients will also&#xD;
      complete blood tests to provide information about their inflammatory state to best understand&#xD;
      physiological disorders and allow a better classification of the disease status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Metabolic flexibility assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
           After sitting quietly for 20 min, subjects will perform a graded exercise test to&#xD;
           volitional fatigue on an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer with continuous gas&#xD;
           collection and heart rate monitoring. In all subjects, when the Respiratory Exchange&#xD;
           Ratio will be ≥1.00, indicating zero fat oxidation, the work rate will be increased by&#xD;
           the same increments at 1-min intervals until volitional fatigue. O2 consumption (VO2)&#xD;
           peak will be considered maximal when the Respiratory Exchange Ratio will be ≥1.05 and&#xD;
           the subject will achieve his age-predicted maximal heart rate [heart rate maximum: (220&#xD;
           - age)]. Indirect calorimetry, as will be used in this study, is the standard method to&#xD;
           quantify substrate oxidation rates at rest and during exercise. O2 consumption (VO2) and&#xD;
           CO2 production (VCO2) will be averaged over the final 1 min of each work rate, and the&#xD;
           results of this test will be used to calculate fat oxidation over a wide range of&#xD;
           exercise intensities for each subject with the equations:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Lipids (mg.min-1) = 1.6946 x VO2 - 1.7012 x VCO2 and CHO (mg.min-1) = 4.585 VCO2 -&#xD;
           3.2255 VO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Muscle architecture Subjects will be lied on a massage table, muscle relaxed. Ultrasound&#xD;
           will be used on vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM) and rectus femoris (RF) to&#xD;
           assess muscle architecture. The muscle belly will be measured according to Surface&#xD;
           ElectroMyoGraphy for the Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles (SENIAM) recommendations.&#xD;
           Muscle thickness (the distance between superior and inferior aponeurosis) and fascicule&#xD;
           angle (the angle formed by muscle fascicule and the inferior aponeurosis) will be&#xD;
           measured for each muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Muscle quality Subjects will sit on an adjustable seat. The right tight will be placed&#xD;
           into the antenna of the peripheral quantitative tomography, so that the femoral condyles&#xD;
           are aligned with the laser. An antero-posterior scout-view will be performed to detect&#xD;
           junction between tibial tray and the femur, which matched with the starting position of&#xD;
           the measurement. Then, a measure will be performed at 40% of the length between the&#xD;
           greater trochanter and the mid-patella of the right leg. Muscle cross sectional area&#xD;
           (CSA) and intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) will be assessed. The measurements will be&#xD;
           performed by the same investigator to avoid any inter-individual bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Muscle function&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Vertical jump height: Subjects will have to perform a series of vertical jumps.&#xD;
           Subjects will perform two squat jumps (SJ) and two counter movements jumps (CMJ) using&#xD;
           an OptoJump following standardised guidelines. For SJ, subjects will have to flex their&#xD;
           knee at 90° with the hand on the hip to avoid any counter movements induced by the upper&#xD;
           limbs. Subjects will have to maintain the position for 3-s. The guidelines for CMJ will&#xD;
           be similar, but without short break between standing and flexing positions. For both&#xD;
           exercises, subjects will have to jump as high as possible. Vertical jump height will be&#xD;
           calculated according the formula where T is time flight duration and g the acceleration&#xD;
           of 9.81 m.s-2 of gravity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Maximal voluntary strength: Subjects will sit on an isokinetic dynamometer with a hip&#xD;
           angle of 40° (0°= standing position). Upper body will be strapped on the chair back and&#xD;
           subjects will have to grip the chair to avoid any counter-movements. Their right ankle&#xD;
           will be strapped and connected to a force sensor. After a standardised warm up&#xD;
           consisting of repeating isometric contractions at increasing intensities, patients will&#xD;
           have to perform maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC). MVIC will be performed&#xD;
           at different randomized joint angles (29°, 66°, 76°, 87° and 103° [0° = full extension])&#xD;
           to determine the optimal angle producing maximal strength. Two measurements will be&#xD;
           performed at each angle to check the reproducibility. A third trial will be performed if&#xD;
           the difference between both measurements is higher than 5%. Subjects will be vigorously&#xD;
           encouraged to produce maximal voluntary strength during isometric contractions. Root&#xD;
           Mean Square (RMS) values will be calculated from the electromyographic (EMG) activity&#xD;
           recorded on VL, VM and RF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Muscle fatigue Muscle fatigue will be assessed with the same method as previously&#xD;
           described. For this test, patients will have to maintain a force level corresponding to&#xD;
           50% MVIC to avoid any knee pain. The exercise will be stopped when subjects will be&#xD;
           unable to maintain the force level more than 3-s despite vigorous encouragements. Time&#xD;
           duration to task failure will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Bone micro-architecture Bone micro-architecture will be assessed through bone mineral&#xD;
           density, trabecular and cortical density. This measurement will be performed in the same&#xD;
           time that muscle quality assessment by pQCT. Patients will be placed in the same&#xD;
           position. Two measurement will be done using pQCT at 20% and 40% of the tight.&#xD;
           Micro-architectural parameters (trabecular and cortical density) will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Body composition Body composition will be assessed by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.&#xD;
           Fat and fat-free mass, and bone density will be measured for the whole body and segments&#xD;
           (arm, leg and trunk).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Biology Blood samples will be drawn once a year for patients and once for controls.&#xD;
           Blood samples will allow to assess NFS (blood formul numeration), ionogramme, CRPus, VS,&#xD;
           total bilirubin, ASAT, ALAT, GGT, PAL, glycaemia, total cholesterol -HDL-LDL,&#xD;
           triglycerid, TSH, T4, adiponectin et leptin. Lipidomic, Cytokines and their receptors,&#xD;
           calgranulins and MicroARNs will be also assessed thereafter.&#xD;
