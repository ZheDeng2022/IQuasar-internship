      1. Abstract&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ferromagnetic Implants such as PPM's and ICD's are traditionally accepted as&#xD;
           contraindications to MRI due to safety concerns. The hypothesis is that these procedures&#xD;
           can be safely performed when appropriate safety precautions and vetting practices are&#xD;
           implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a cohort study. 1000 patients with a clinical need for MRI will be included in&#xD;
           the study at OHSU. The type of device and leads will be ascertained and a safety&#xD;
           protocol will be strictly adhered to.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           It has been estimated that 50-75% of patients with implanted devices (pacemakers and&#xD;
           ICDs) will develop an indication for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. Thus,&#xD;
           there are approximately 200,000 patients annually denied MRI scans because of the&#xD;
           presence of PPMs and ICDs in the United States. The current standard of care is not to&#xD;
           perform these scans, and instead to utilize other (inferior) imaging, and make clinical&#xD;
           decisions without the benefit of MRI imaging. This is the current standard of care of&#xD;
           OHSU, where only pacemaker patients who are not pacemaker dependent can undergo MRI&#xD;
           scans, per radiology policy. However, this leads to gaps in care for some patients who&#xD;
           would clearly benefit from an MRI scan. In some centers, it has been shown that when&#xD;
           proper precautions are taken, MRIs can be safely performed on patients with PPMs and&#xD;
           ICDs. The published experience from Johns Hopkins reports over 500 scans performed&#xD;
           without any adverse outcomes.(1) There are also several smaller studies documenting the&#xD;
           safe experience with MRI scanning in device patients (reviewed in (1), table 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main concerns which have led to restrictions on MRIs in patients with cardiac rhythm&#xD;
           devices are the following:(2)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Force and torque-ferromagnetic devices in a magnetic field are subject to static&#xD;
                and gradient magnetic field induced force and torque. However, the maximum force&#xD;
                that a modern PPM or ICD generator would be subject to is 100g, far under what&#xD;
                would be needed to dislodge a device.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Current induction-the gradient magnetic fields in the MRI scanner could induce&#xD;
                current in conductors in the field. However, the maximum observed current in vitro&#xD;
                has been less than 0.5mA, far less than what is required to capture myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Heating-Leads and other metallic devices can act as antennae, and may heat in the&#xD;
                magnetic field, however, no heating greater than 0.5deg C were observed in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Inappropriate pacing/shock/inhibition of pacing-Pacemakers and ICDs have the&#xD;
                possibility of receiving electromagnetic interference from the MRI and having this&#xD;
                lead to inappropriate pacing, inhibition of pacing, ICD shocks, reprogramming, or&#xD;
                loss of function.&#xD;
&#xD;
           While all of the concerns are real and have been reported in earlier generation devices,&#xD;
           with proper patient selection and monitoring during the scan, MRIs can be performed&#xD;
           safely on most device patients. Johns Hopkins has an experience of over 500 scans&#xD;
           without any adverse events.(1) The proposed protocol here follows exactly the Hopkins&#xD;
           protocol, and, indeed, the OHSU data will be combined with the Hopkins data for future&#xD;
           publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To review the most recent Johns Hopkins publication:(1) 555 MRI studies in 438 device&#xD;
           (PPM and ICD) patients were reported. All MRI scans were clinically indicated, and a&#xD;
           device clinician, familiar with device interrogation and programming, was physically&#xD;
           present for the entire duration of the scan. All patients were continuously monitored&#xD;
           via telemetry and pulse oximetry during the MRI. For pacemaker patients, if they are&#xD;
           pacemaker dependent they were reprogrammed to a non-sensing mode for the scan. If they&#xD;
           were not pacemaker dependent, they were left in their usual mode. For ICD patients, if&#xD;
           they were not pacemaker dependent, they were left in their usual mode. However,&#xD;
           pacemaker dependent ICD patients were not scanned, as ICDs generally do not have a&#xD;
           non-sensing pacing mode. Therapy for tachycardia was disabled in all ICDs for the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There were three clinical events during scans, all were &quot;power on resets&quot;, which means&#xD;
           that the device resets to &quot;out of the box&quot; original factory settings. One of these&#xD;
           patients had an ICD, felt tugging in his chest during the scan, and the scan was not&#xD;
           completed. The other two power on resets were in PPM patients, in whom the scan was&#xD;
           completed. Neither were pacemaker dependent, and neither noticed anything abnormal&#xD;
           during the scan. All three patients had normally functioning devices following the scan,&#xD;
           and at followup.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the overall patient population in the Hopkins study, no single patient had a&#xD;
           malfunction of a device immediately following the scan. There was a slight change in the&#xD;
           electrical parameters of the leads, on average, but this did not result in the need for&#xD;
           any intervention on any patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary objective of this study is to develop a protocol, consistent with DHHS/CMS&#xD;
           guidelines and requirements to further document safety in clinically indicated MR&#xD;
           imaging in patients with implanted cardioverter defibrillators (ICD's) and pacemakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
           MRI's will be conducted on patients who require a clinically indicated MRI only. All&#xD;
           studies will be done in the 1.5 Tesla MRI unit. ECG monitoring pads will be placed on&#xD;
           the patients for the duration of the study. An external defibrillator and ACLS drugs&#xD;
           will be on hand. Heart rate, blood pressure, O2 saturation will also be monitored&#xD;
           non-invasively throughout the study. All devices will undergo a complete interrogation&#xD;
           prior to imaging. Parameters such as atrial and ventricular pacing thresholds, R and P&#xD;
           wave amplitudes, lead impedance, and battery status will be measured and recorded. PPMs&#xD;
           will be programmed to an asynchronous mode if dependent and to an inhibited mode in&#xD;
           patients without pacemaker dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The pacemaker function of ICD's in pacemaker independent patients will be programmed to&#xD;
           ventricular inhibited (VVI) mode at 50 bpm. Pacemaker dependent patients with ICDs will&#xD;
           be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition, there is a theoretical concern that patients who have capped or abandoned&#xD;
           leads in their chest may be at risk for heating. While there is little or no objective&#xD;
           data to support this concern, given this theoretical concern, patients in this category&#xD;
           will only be admitted to the study if the referring physician deems the MRI critical and&#xD;
           after the PI has carefully considered the risk/benefit ration for each patient who falls&#xD;
           in to this category.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Similarly, there historically has also been a concern that newly implanted leads (&lt;4&#xD;
           weeks) are at risk for lead to dislodgement d/t possible torque from the MRI&#xD;
           environment. This too is only a theoretical concern and there is little or no scientific&#xD;
           evidence to support this claim. Nevertheless, patients with newly implanted&#xD;
           pacemaker/ICD leads will be considered by the PI for protocol inclusion only if the&#xD;
           referring physician deems the MRI to be critical and after considering the risk/benefit&#xD;
           to each individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the appropriate MRI protocol for each MRI patient's unique condition has been&#xD;
           completed, the device will be re-programmed to its original settings and completely&#xD;
           interrogated to detect any changes in device performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The duration of the study extends to the post procedure interrogation at 1-6 weeks post&#xD;
           MRI. IF the PPM or ICD reveals any malfunction post imaging (not seen yet), the patient&#xD;
           will be followed by the electrophysiology service and appropriate follow-up management&#xD;
           will be arranged.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Primary outcome variable. Patient safety and device malfunction during or after MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Secondary outcome variables. None&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Statistical plan including sample size justification and interim data analysis. We&#xD;
                hope to enroll 1000 patients over 4 years to further evaluate safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Early stopping rules. N/A&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Risks&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Medical risks, listing all procedures, their major and minor risks and expected&#xD;
                frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
                There are no studies showing any health hazards associated with magnetic field&#xD;
                exposure. PPM and ICD implants subjected to the strong electromagnetic field of MR&#xD;
                imaging are thought to be susceptible to movement and torque. Other traditional&#xD;
                concerns include malfunction due to demagnetization or magnetic activation leading&#xD;
                to inappropriate pacing and shocks and artificial sensing of electromagnetic&#xD;
                interference from MRI leading to inappropriate inhibition and/or activation of&#xD;
                antitachycardia therapy, device malfunction and induced arrhythmias, as detailed in&#xD;
                the background section above. Heating of the device and surrounding tissues leading&#xD;
                to fibrosis and increased capture thresholds have also been a theoretical concern.&#xD;
                However, recent work has revealed the safety of PPM's and certain ICD's in the MR&#xD;
                environment given appropriate precautions(1, 3, 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Steps taken to minimize the risks. Appropriate measures discussed in the protocol&#xD;
                section will be taken to minimize risks associated with device exposure to MRI.&#xD;
                Consistent with standard MRI policy, patients in the first trimester of pregnancy&#xD;
                and patients with history of allergic reactions to gadolinium will undergo imaging&#xD;
                without any contrast media.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Plan for reporting unanticipated problems or study deviations. Patient data will be&#xD;
                monitored on a per patient basis. Pre-vs. post MRI device testing data will be&#xD;
                compared and any significant differences immediately reported to the IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Benefits a. Description of the probable benefits for the participant and for society.&#xD;
           The patient will benefit from a standardized protocol to minimize the risk of an MR scan&#xD;
           deemed necessary for his/her care which would otherwise be denied or performed without&#xD;
           any organized framework. Society will benefit because of the increasing number of&#xD;
           implanted devices and expanding use of MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 Costs&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Detail costs of study procedure(s) or drug (s) or substance(s) to participants and&#xD;
      identify who will pay for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient and his/her insurance will be responsible for the cost of the clinically&#xD;
      indicated MRI.&#xD;
