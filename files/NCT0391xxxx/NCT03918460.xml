  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is non-randomized, multicenter international safety, performance and clinical&#xD;
      benefit outcome assessment of ANEUFIX to treat patients with isolated type II endoleak in the&#xD;
      presence of a growing AAA-sac following an EVAR procedure more than 6 months ago.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigational device is called ANEUFIX, which is a product treating the endoleak by&#xD;
      blockage of backflowing blood vessels, i.e. by filling the endoleak void and nidus of feeding&#xD;
      artery and exit of existing draining arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANEUFIX is a polymer that cures rapidly (2-4 min at 37Â°C) after injection into the AAA-sac&#xD;
      close to the nidus.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Persistent type II endoleak (more than 6 months post-EVAR or post-embolization&#xD;
             procedure); AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Volume of the 'endoleak void' can be estimated upfront; AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. An EVAR without circulatory complications (including the absence of an open AMI that&#xD;
             is connected to the endoleak as judged on existing CT-scan); AND&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. An endoleak confirmed on a CT scan that should be done within 180 days prior to&#xD;
             procedure but preferably within 90 days prior to screening demonstrating the high&#xD;

             alternative visualization technique) and based upon sac diameter measurements; AND&#xD;
