      Cirrhosis leads to portal hypertension and development of gastroesophageal varices, which are&#xD;
      the most common cause for bleeding in cirrhosis and a major cause of death. The American&#xD;
      Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) recommends screening endoscopy every 2&#xD;
      years to evaluate for gastroesophageal varices, and annual surveillance for those with small&#xD;
      varices on endoscopy. Unfortunately, endoscopy is costly, requires sedation, is poorly&#xD;
      tolerated, is subject to high inter-observer variability, and is associated with risks that&#xD;
      include bleeding, esophageal injury and aspiration. Noninvasive methods for evaluation of&#xD;
      gastroesophageal varices are needed. CT is noninvasive, rapid, less expensive than endoscopy,&#xD;
      requires no sedation, provides a quantitative measure of the size of the varices, and allows&#xD;
      for assessment of para-esophageal varices, varices in other body locations, ascites, other&#xD;
      signs of portal hypertension, patency of liver vasculature, and detection, diagnosis and&#xD;
      staging of hepatocellular carcinoma. Single-Energy CT (SECT) has relatively high accuracy in&#xD;
      prospective studies for detection of any and large varices but is associated with suboptimal&#xD;
      contrast opacification of gastroesophageal varices. Dual-Energy CT with the GE scanners with&#xD;
      GSI Xtream (DECT) improves the contrast-to-noise ratio by 60% compared to SECT and is&#xD;
      currently standard of care at UAB for evaluation of cirrhosis. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      study is to determine the accuracy of DECT for detecting any varices and high-risk varices.&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that the accuracy (AUROC) of DECT will be &gt;0.90 and &gt;0.95 for&#xD;
      detecting any and high-risk varices in a prospective pilot study (N=50) that uses endoscopy&#xD;
      as the reference standard. This will be a single-center pilot observational prospective&#xD;
      IRB-approved study. A total of 50 adult patients presenting to UAB Endoscopy for surveillance&#xD;
      endoscopy to detect and grade gastroesophageal varices will be enrolled.&#xD;

      Cirrhosis leads to portal hypertension and development of gastroesophageal varices, which are&#xD;
      the most common cause for bleeding in cirrhosis and a major cause of death. Bleeding varices&#xD;
      have a 6-week mortality of 15%-25%. About 50% of patients with cirrhosis have varices, and&#xD;
      30% have large varices (&gt;5 mm) that are high risk for bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) recommends screening&#xD;
      endoscopy every 2 years to evaluate for varices, and annual surveillance for those with small&#xD;
      varices on endoscopy. Patients at a high risk of bleeding with large varices, small varices&#xD;
      and red wale signs (an endoscopic finding), or small varices and decompensated cirrhosis&#xD;
      proceed to treatment such as prophylactic band ligation and beta blockers. Conversely,&#xD;
      patients with no varices or small varices (â‰¤5 mm) continue surveillance efforts by endoscopy&#xD;
      to monitor for development of large varices. Unfortunately, endoscopy is costly, requires&#xD;
      sedation, is poorly tolerated, is subject to high inter-observer variability, cannot detect&#xD;
      other signs or portal hypertension or para-esophageal varices that are at risk for future&#xD;
      bleeding events, and is associated with risks that include bleeding, esophageal injury and&#xD;
      aspiration. Many of these factors contribute to poor patient compliance with AASLD&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninvasive methods for detecting, grading, and risk stratification of esophageal varices are&#xD;
      needed. Imaging tests such as ultrasound elastography to measure liver stiffness have been&#xD;
      proposed as a method to predict the presence of varices but have insufficient accuracy to&#xD;
      eliminate the need for endoscopy.10 An ideal biomarker to screen for esophageal varices would&#xD;
      be part of the routine standard of care of patients with cirrhosis, noninvasive, rapid, less&#xD;
      expense than endoscopy, highly accurate, highly reproducible, and would require no sedation,&#xD;
      provide a quantitative measure of the size of the varices, provide a mechanisms to assess the&#xD;
      risk of future bleeding, allow for an assessment for other signs of portal hypertension, and&#xD;
      provide other benefits to the patient (e.g. detect ascites and HCC and assess liver&#xD;
      vasculature).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed tomography (CT) is standard of care to screen for HCC. CT is noninvasive, rapid,&#xD;
      less expensive than endoscopy, requires no sedation, provides a quantitative measure of the&#xD;
      size of the varices, and allows for assessment of para-esophageal varices, varices in other&#xD;
      body locations, ascites, other signs of portal hypertension, patency of liver vasculature,&#xD;
      and detection, diagnosis and staging of HCC. Conventional Single-Energy CT (SECT) has&#xD;
      relatively high accuracy in prospective studies for detection of any and large varices and&#xD;
      has higher inter-observer agreement than endoscopy (kappa 0.56 vs. 0.36, respectively). Major&#xD;
      deficiencies in SECT include relatively suboptimal contrast opacification of gastroesophageal&#xD;
      varices, inconsistent accuracy that is dependent upon SECT image acquisition technique, and&#xD;
      suboptimal stratification of the risk of bleeding (e.g. inability to detect red wale sign)&#xD;
      compared to endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual-Energy CT (DECT) improves the contrast-to-noise ratio by 60% compared to SECT. DECT also&#xD;
      improves visualization by taking advantage of the markedly increased attenuation of iodine at&#xD;
      photon energy levels just above the iodine K edge (33 keV). Using material decomposition&#xD;
      techniques, DECT can map the concentration of iodine on a voxel by voxel basis which,&#xD;
      combined with higher contrast to noise resolution on these same type of images, improves the&#xD;
      conspicuity of enhancing structures. DECT is routinely used to screen for HCC in cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While DECT has been shown to improve image quality and portal venography compared to SECT,&#xD;
      the accuracy of DECT for screening for varices has not been reported. The primary objective&#xD;
      is to determine the accuracy of dual energy CT for detecting any varices and high-risk&#xD;
      varices in patients with cirrhosis presenting for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.&#xD;
