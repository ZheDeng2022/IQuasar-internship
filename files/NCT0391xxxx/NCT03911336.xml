  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronotherapy is an emerging field in biomedicine that leverages on fine-tuning the timing of&#xD;
      drug delivery to obtain a therapeutic effect. Dr. Tamimi and his team have successfully&#xD;
      harnessed chronotherapy using NSAIDs to enhance bone healing in a murine fracture model.&#xD;
      Unpublished findings revealed that mice receiving carprofen for 3 days post-fracture&#xD;
      exclusively during activity hours exhibited superior bone healing outcomes in comparison to&#xD;
      specimens that received the same drug during resting hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 3-arm RCT aimed at evaluating the effect of different chronotherapeutic NSAID&#xD;
      regimens on intraoral bone healing in humans using an extraction socket healing model in the&#xD;
      context of an early implant placement protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to elucidate whether there are differences in osteogenesis and in the&#xD;
      characteristics of the newly formed bone between patients following different post-operative&#xD;
      NSAID chronotherapeutic protocols. Secondary endpoints of interest include assessment of&#xD;
      alveolar bone and soft tissue dimensional changes between pre- and post-extraction, implant&#xD;
      insertion torque, serum CRP levels, wound healing index and patient-reported discomfort at&#xD;
      different time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If proven beneficial, the proposed chronotherapeutic approach could be readily implemented in&#xD;
      clinical practice as a standalone therapy or as a valuable complement to existing&#xD;
      standard-of-care protocols, due to its simplicity, safety and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;

      Enrolled subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three groups (n=12 per group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (Test) - Tooth extraction and intake of an NSAID (i.e. Ketoprofen ER 50 mg) at 8 AM&#xD;
      and a non-NSAID (i.e. Acetaminophen / Paracetamol 500 mg) at 2 PM and 8 PM for a 3-day&#xD;
      period, starting at 2 PM on the day of the extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B (Control 1) - Tooth extraction and intake of an NSAID (i.e. Ketoprofen ER 50 mg) at 8&#xD;
      PM and a non-NSAID (i.e. Acetaminophen / Paracetamol 500 mg) at 8 AM and 2 PM for a 3-day&#xD;
      period, starting at 2 PM on the day of the extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C (Control 2) - Tooth extraction and intake of a non-NSAID (i.e. Acetaminophen /&#xD;
      Paracetamol 500 mg) at 8AM, 2 PM and 8 PM for a 3-day period, starting at 2 PM on the day of&#xD;
      the extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 1 - Screening Referred or self-referred subjects that appear to meet all the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria upon phone pre-screening will be invited to an in-person screening visit&#xD;
      at the UICOD. The study purpose, duration, potential risks and expected benefits will be&#xD;
      explained in detail to the subjects, as part of the consenting process. All screened subjects&#xD;
      will be provided with hard copies of the study timeline and the signed consent form. Upon&#xD;
      medical and dental history review, as well as site-specific clinical and radiographic&#xD;
      evaluation, eligible subjects interested in participating in the study will be scheduled for&#xD;
      Visit 2. Intraoral photographs of the site of interest will be taken. Additionally, a&#xD;
      cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan will be obtained and interpreted to evaluate the&#xD;
      study site, prior to the baseline intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 2 - Tooth Extraction (Baseline Intervention) Medical and dental history will be&#xD;
      reviewed and updated, if necessary. Subsequently, subjects will be asked to sign the surgical&#xD;
      procedure consent form. Prior to tooth extraction, an intraoral scan of the area of interest&#xD;
      will be obtained using a digital scanner (e.g. Planmeca Emerald S). Likewise, a blood sample&#xD;
      (~ 4.5 cc) will be collected for serum C-reactive protein (CRP) analysis. Following&#xD;
      administration of local infiltrative anesthesia, the study tooth will be extracted in a&#xD;
      minimally traumatic fashion, avoiding flap reflection. Following tooth extraction, the socket&#xD;
      walls will be carefully inspected for the existence of dehiscences or fenestrations. Sites&#xD;
      presenting a bony defect affecting &gt;20% of the total wall height will be excluded. Site will&#xD;
      be sealed using a collagen matrix (Mucograft Seal, Geistlich Pharma) stabilized with simple&#xD;
      interrupted sutures. The intervention will be documented using intraoral photography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the intervention, subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the study&#xD;
      groups and provided with detailed written and verbal post-operative instructions, including a&#xD;
      drug diary specific to the group that they are allocated in and a visual analog scale (VAS)&#xD;
      to record their perceived discomfort at day 0, 1, 2, 3 and 7 after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 3 - Postoperative Evaluation Any medical or dental history changes, or adverse events&#xD;
      will be recorded. Sutures will be removed. An intraoral scan and photographs of the site will&#xD;
      be obtained. Visual assessment of the healing status will be made using a wound healing index&#xD;
      (WHI). Biofilm on the adjacent teeth will be removed and home care instructions will be&#xD;
      revisited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 4 - Implant Placement At the beginning of this visit, a second segmental CBCT scan will&#xD;
      be obtained, using the same settings employed at baseline. CBCT images will be employed to&#xD;
      evaluate ridge dimensional changes compared to baseline, as well as bone availability for&#xD;
      dental implant placement. Any medical or dental history changes, or adverse events will be&#xD;
      recorded. A blood sample (~ 4.5 cc) and an intraoral scan will be obtained. Assessment of the&#xD;
      healing status will be made using the aforementioned WHI. After administering local&#xD;
      infiltrative anesthesia, patients will undergo implant insertion, according to the early&#xD;
      implant placement protocol.10 Following full-thickness flap elevation, a bone core biopsy of&#xD;
      the study site will be obtained using a trephine drill of 2.5 mm in diameter or wider. The&#xD;
      bone core will be immediately submerged in a solution of 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF)&#xD;
      for microCT (ÂµCT) and histological analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implant site preparation and placement will be conducted according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      recommendations (SLActive Bone Level - Straumann AG). Implant insertion torque will be&#xD;
      recorded. Intraoral periapical radiographs will be obtained, as necessary, in order to assess&#xD;
      implant placement location. Following final implant placement and cover screw delivery,&#xD;
      simultaneous buccal contour augmentation will be performed via guided bone regeneration (GBR)&#xD;
      using a dual bone graft. This graft composite will consist of an initial layer of locally&#xD;
      harvested autogenous bone to cover the exposed implant surface, combined with a superficial&#xD;
      layer of deproteinized bovine bone particles (DBBM; BioOss granules 0.25 - 1.0 mm, Geistlich&#xD;
      Pharma), which will be subsequently covered with a native porcine collagen membrane&#xD;
      (Bio-Gide; Geistlich Pharma). All procedures will be executed according to a two-stage&#xD;
      (submerged) approach. Therefore, tension-free primary soft tissue closure will be attained.&#xD;
      The procedure will be documented with intraoral photographs. All subjects will be provided&#xD;
      with detailed written and verbal post-operative instructions. They will be instructed to&#xD;
      avoid any disturbance in the surgical area for two weeks. Patients will be asked to use a&#xD;
      mouthwash containing 0.12% of chlorhexidine gluconate twice a day, thirty seconds at a time,&#xD;
      avoiding any eating or drinking for 30 minutes after rinsing, starting 48 hours after the&#xD;
      baseline intervention. Post-operative medications (e.g. antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
      and analgesics) will be prescribed on an individual basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 5 - Postoperative Evaluation (Final Study Visit) This visit will be scheduled at&#xD;
      approximately two weeks after implant placement. Any medical or dental history changes, or&#xD;
      adverse events will be recorded. Intraoral photographs of the site of interest, will be&#xD;
      obtained. Assessment of the healing status will be made using the aforementioned WHI. All&#xD;
      remaining sutures will be removed. Biofilm on the adjacent teeth will be removed and home&#xD;
      care instructions will be revisited. Upon completion of this final study visit, the patient&#xD;
      will be entered in a regular patient care routine, including scheduling of a future visit for&#xD;
      implant uncovering in no less than 4 months and later referral to the restorative dentist, in&#xD;
      order to complete tooth replacement therapy.&#xD;
