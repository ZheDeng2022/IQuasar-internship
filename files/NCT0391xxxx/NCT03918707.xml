  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study involving a prospective group of 15 evaluable patients who will undergo&#xD;
      rapid whole genome sequencing in addition to standard of care testing. Subjects will be drawn&#xD;
      from children admitted to the NICU at OSF Health Care Children's Hospital of Illinois who&#xD;
      meet inclusion criteria. The aims of this study are to evaluate the turn-around time and cost&#xD;
      of performing rapid whole genome sequencing (rWGS) compared to standard of care in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of genetic disorders among critically ill infants in a regional children's hospital&#xD;
      and to describe management outcomes of utilizing rWGS in acutely ill patients less than four&#xD;
      months of age.&#xD;

    <description>If normally distributed, we will use t test for univariate analysis, and linear regression models for multivariate analysis to assess the intervention effects. Otherwise, we will use Wilcoxon two-sample t test or robust linear regression models. For other categorical variables, we will use chi-square to compare the difference between the prospective and historical control groups. Stratified analysis will be performed in order to get insight into the relationships of the data.&#xD;
We will analyze data within intervention, and control group, respectively. Means and standard deviations will be reported for continuous variables, and percentage values, odds ratio, 95% confidence interval will be reported for categorical variables. The two-tailed p values are calculated for all tests, and p&lt;0.05 will be considered a statistically significant result. SAS 9.4 will be used for data management and data analysis.</description>
