  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of autologous chimeric antigen receptor-B-cell maturation antigen (CAR-BCMA T cell;&#xD;
      CT053) in patients with relapsed and or refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A of the study will be Dose Escalation followed by Part B, an expansion cohort.&#xD;
      Following consent, enrolled subjects will undergo a leukapheresis procedure to collect&#xD;
      autologous mononuclear cells for manufacture of investigational drug product (CT053).&#xD;
      Following manufacture of the drug product, subjects will receive lymphodepletion prior to&#xD;
      CT053 infusion. All subjects who complete the study, as well as those who withdraw from the&#xD;
      study after receiving CT053 for reasons other than death or meeting the early termination&#xD;
      criteria, will be asked to continue to undergo long-term follow-up in a companion study.&#xD;
