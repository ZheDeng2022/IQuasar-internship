      It was difficult to obtain clinical benefits through traditional chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy for the patients who have recurrence or metastasis tumor even though they have&#xD;
      received first-line chemotherapy or combined radiotherapy before, but failed.The aim of this&#xD;
      study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of apatinib, an anti-angiogenesis drug, in the&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is a common malignant tumor in China and its prognosis is poor. Its main&#xD;
      treatment methods include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, the 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate of esophageal cancer after operation is only about 40%. The main cause of&#xD;
      treatment failure is postoperative recurrence and metastasis.The 2-year recurrence rate of&#xD;
      esophageal cancer after radical operation was 50%, the median recurrence time was about 10&#xD;
      months and the 2-year survival rate was less than 15% for these patients.For patients with&#xD;
      local recurrence, endoscopic submucosal resection, salvage resection and radiotherapy could&#xD;
      be chosen. Palliative chemotherapy is another important method for patients with recurrence&#xD;
      or metastasis who are not suitable for surgery or radiotherapy.Cisplatin combined with&#xD;
      fluorouracil is a usually used first-line chemotherapy regimen, but the response rate is less&#xD;
      than 30% and the median survival time is only about 6~10 months.There is no standard&#xD;
      second-line treatment for patients who have failed first-line treatment. Over the past&#xD;
      decade, the second-line treatment for esophageal cancer is mostly phase I and II studies. The&#xD;
      reported objective remission rate(ORR) ranges from 2.8% to 45%, the median progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) ranges from 1.2 to 5.2 months and the median overall survival (OS) ranges from&#xD;
      3.7 to 11.4 months.Although some studies have shown that taxus-based second-line chemotherapy&#xD;
      can bring a certain degree of remission to patients, irinotecan, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin&#xD;
      can also be used as the second-line chemotherapy options for these patients, but the overall&#xD;
      efficiency is low and disease progression occurs quickly.The median survival time of&#xD;
      esophageal stent, nasal feeding nutrition support and gastrostomy is only 6 months, and the&#xD;
      1-year survival rate is generally less than 5%.The previous treatment options are few and the&#xD;
      therapeutic effect is poor for the patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who have&#xD;
      received neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with or without radiotherapy and adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy combined with or without radiotherapy after radical resection and those patients&#xD;
      with persistent or new occurred recurrence and metastasis. At present, there is no consensus&#xD;
      on the second-line treatment strategy for recurrent and metastasis esophageal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma after radical resection and there are various clinical options.Therefore, it is of&#xD;
      great clinical significance to explore the second-line treatment strategy for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, with the development of molecular targeted therapy, it has been applied to&#xD;
      the treatment of esophageal cancer, which is not only expected to ensure clinical efficacy,&#xD;
      but also to reduce the adverse effects of amount of traditional chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy.At present, research on targeted therapy for esophageal cancer is gradually&#xD;
      increasing. Targeted therapeutic drugs mainly include epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR)&#xD;
      inhibitors,vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies,&#xD;
      cyclooxygenase(COX) inhibitors and so on.Studies have confirmed that VEGF is highly expressed&#xD;
      in the development of various malignant tumors including esophageal cancer, which may be&#xD;
      closely related to tumor invasion and metastasis.As a VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor,&#xD;
      apatinib mainly treats malignant tumors by inhibiting VEGFR to exert anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      effects.Previous studies have confirmed that apatinib was safe and effective in the treatment&#xD;
      of advanced gastric cancer and adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction which was&#xD;
      approved by China food and drug administration(CFDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, it was difficult to obtain clinical benefits through traditional chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy for the patients who have recurrence or metastasis tumor even though they have&#xD;
      received first-line chemotherapy or combined radiotherapy before, but failed.The aim of this&#xD;
      study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of apatinib, an anti-angiogenesis drug, in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who had recurrence or&#xD;
      metastasis after radical resection.&#xD;
