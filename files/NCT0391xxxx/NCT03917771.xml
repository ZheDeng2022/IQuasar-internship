      This study aims to detect and treat early lower limb lymphedema secondary to lymphadenectomy&#xD;
      with the aim of increasing the quality of life of patients with this chronic condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, a group of patients (treatment group) will be referred to the Rehabilitation&#xD;
      service for a previous consultation and after surgery where lymphedema could be detected&#xD;
      early. In addition, the usual follow-up will be carried out in Gynecology Oncology&#xD;
      consultation (GO). In the second group, also called control, will be performed the usual&#xD;
      follow-up in GO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this we randomize to one of these two groups. The research project has the favorable&#xD;
      report of the Center's Clinical Research Ethics Committee&#xD;

      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Type of study: A) Randomized clinical trial B) Prospective cohort observational study&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study period: from January 2017 to December 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Scope: health area of the province of Gipuzkoa and the University Hospital of Donostia&#xD;
           as a reference center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Selection of the population:&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1. The inclusion criteria will be: A) Diagnostic gynecological cancer patients&#xD;
           submitted to bilateral laparoscopic pelvic lymphadenectomy as laparotomics (B: Sentinel&#xD;
           Node Biopsy study, SNB) within the usual surgical protocol, with expected survival&#xD;
           greater than 12 weeks and adequate liver, renal and medullary functions to accept And&#xD;
           sign informed consent 4.2. The exclusion criteria for the study will be: Blood clotting&#xD;
           or hematological disorders, previous thromboembolic disease and history of lymphatic&#xD;
           system disease (lymphedema or lymphocele), contraindication for physiotherapy or who do&#xD;
           not wish to participate and / or do not sign informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3. Sample size: A) Assuming that according to previous studies the overall incidence&#xD;
           of lymphedema after LPL is 21% (Hareyama et al), its estimated that a minimum sample of&#xD;
           44 patients will bi needed in order to be able to demonstrate at least 4-fold detection&#xD;
           (Torres et al) of Lymphedemas with early follow-up with alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.2,&#xD;
           estimating that habitual follow-up detects 13% of lymphedema ( Mohler III et al).&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4. Recruitment Process: Will be selected consecutively and offered to participate in&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 5.1 Intervention: A) After diagnosis and programming for surgery at the GO consultation,&#xD;
           circometry is performed by a trained nurse. During the admission, the nurse delivers and&#xD;
           explains recommendations sheet and is offered to participate in the clinical trial&#xD;
           giving him the Informed Consent (IC) and Information Sheet created for this purpose. In&#xD;
           case of accepting and signing the IC, it is randomized (total randomization) according&#xD;
           to system of envelopes with code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distribution of the intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment group: Face-to-face consultation in Rehabilitation for early detection of&#xD;
           lymphedema after surgery (1,6,12 months). Lower Limb measurement and care education&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: The usual follow-up will be carried out in GO consultation (0,1,6,12&#xD;
           months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pelvic lymphadenectomy will be performed by the same surgical team using a&#xD;
      transperitoneal approach. The limits of lymph node dissection will be: the psoas muscle,&#xD;
      laterally, the postero-medially internal iliac artery, the bifurcation of the common iliac&#xD;
      artery cranially, where it crosses the ureter, and caudally the origin of the epigastric&#xD;
      vessels, to level of the deep circumflex iliac vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) After diagnosis and programming for surgery at the GO consultation, circometry is&#xD;
      performed by trained and yearly nurse. During the entrance, it is delivered and explains the&#xD;
      recommendations sheet. SNB is performed by detecting sentinel ganglion from the above&#xD;
      mentioned areas according to the protocol of the service. The usual follow-up will be carried&#xD;
      out in GO consultation (0,1,6,12 months)&#xD;
