  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a gold standard treatment for a wide spectrum of&#xD;
      anxiety-related concerns. However, long waitlist times can serve as a substantial barrier to&#xD;
      those seeking treatment. Internet delivered psychotherapy, such as internet-based CBT (I-CBT)&#xD;
      may present an affordable option for disseminating empirically supported treatments. Velibra,&#xD;
      an web-based I-CBT intervention, has shown initial promise in treating anxiety disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Velibra has been used to treat anxiety-related disorders in European samples with&#xD;
      participants recruited from general practitioner's offices and diagnosed with a specific&#xD;
      subset of anxiety disorders. While these effects are encouraging, additional research is&#xD;
      needed toevaluate whether Velibra could be implemented in a community mental health clinic in&#xD;
      the U.S. Specifically, if Velibra could be successfully implemented within the context of&#xD;
      mental health clinic waitlists, it may be capable of providing evidence-based treatment to&#xD;
      larger groups of people at a faster rate than mental health clinics can structurally support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of implementing Velibra into an&#xD;
      American community clinic waitlist. We plan to offer free access to the Velibra program to&#xD;
      members of the Anxiety and Stress Clinic (ASC) waitlist at the University of Texas at Austin&#xD;
      experiencing anxiety. We will evaluate interest in the program, user data from the program,&#xD;
      and opinions of the program post-completion. We hypothesize ASC patients will find utility in&#xD;
      Velibra's ability to offer them mental health resources faster than the traditional waitlist&#xD;
      can provide.&#xD;

      Waitlist Recruitment. Participants will be recruited directly from the Anxiety and Stress&#xD;
      Clinic's waitlist. Consistent with our existing clinic screening procedures, individuals&#xD;
      added to our waitlist meeting the following criteria will be invited to participate in this&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. They have not experienced significant suicidal ideation in the past week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. They do not meet for a bipolar I diagnosis without current utilization of stabilizing&#xD;
           medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. They are not experiencing psychotic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon meeting these criteria and being added to the clinic waitlist, patients will be asked if&#xD;
      they would like to participate in our feasibility trial. Patients already on the waitlist at&#xD;
      the time of study approval will also be contacted and offered participation. If interested in&#xD;
      participating, patients will be asked to complete a digital informed consent via UT Qualtrics&#xD;
      or Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), secure, online assessment tools designed to&#xD;
      collect self-report questionnaire data for research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Survey. Following informed consent, participants will complete a baseline survey via&#xD;
      UT Qualtrics or REDCap. This survey will include measures of anxiety and other internalizing&#xD;
      symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9; Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale,&#xD;
      GAD-7; Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale, OASIS). Other questions will evaluate&#xD;
      participants' current medication/treatment status (Treatment/Medication Status questions).&#xD;
      More details about these questionnaires included below. Following completion of the baseline&#xD;
      survey, participants will receive a voucher for free access to Velibra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Velibra Program. All treatment will be provided via the Velibra website:&#xD;
      https://velibra.broca.io/en/registration/voucher. While the Velibra treatment is only six&#xD;
      weeks long, participants will have free access to the program for 24 weeks. They can access&#xD;
      this website as often as they would like. The Velibra program is self-guided, so participants&#xD;
      determine how often they access the material (the program encourages participants to complete&#xD;
      one of six sessions per week for six weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Velibra Treatment. Velibra is grounded in a cognitive-behavioral theoretical orientation and&#xD;
      consists of six treatment modules representing different skills and therapeutic techniques.&#xD;
      Each of the first five modules is followed by a &quot;training session&quot;, and contains activities&#xD;
      related to training attention biases (CBM-I). All sessions plus trainings are designed to be&#xD;
      completed in 1 - 2 hours, depending on the user's reading speed, interest, motivation, and&#xD;
      individual path through the program. Modules are organized as simulated dialogues in which&#xD;
      the program explains and illustrates concepts and techniques, engages the user in exercises,&#xD;
      and continuously asks users to respond by selecting from response options. Subsequent content&#xD;
      is then tailored to the users' responses, resulting in a simulated conversational flow. All&#xD;
      modules are accompanied by illustrations (e.g., drawings, photographs, flash animations). The&#xD;
      modules cover a variety of therapeutic content that is broadly consistent with a&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral perspective, although the program is not restricted to one CBT manual.&#xD;
      Instead, the program provides a variety of relevant therapeutic approaches and fits within&#xD;
      the broad array of contemporary CBT. The modules' theoretical rationale and content draws&#xD;
      from therapeutic strategies: (1) Cognitive Modification, (2) Mindfulness, Acceptance, and&#xD;
      Relaxation techniques (4) Exposure, (5) Interpersonal Skills, (6) Psychoeducation and Relapse&#xD;
      Prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout participants' use of the program, we will collect user data on Velibra's secure,&#xD;
      online server (amount of time spent in the program, number of completed modules, number of&#xD;
      training sessions completed between modules).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Treatment Survey. Six weeks after the original voucher send date, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to complete a second survey via UT Qualtrics or REDCap. This survey will include&#xD;
      identical symptom measures (PHQ-9; GAD-7; OASIS) and will contain a series of questions about&#xD;
      Anxiety and Stress Clinic treatment interest and Velibra dropout (Participation Questions).&#xD;
      Lastly, the survey will include questions about current medication/treatment status&#xD;
      (Treatment/Medication Status Questions) as well as questions concerning user satisfaction&#xD;
      (SUS), credibility of treatment (CSQ-8), and other questions for suggestions (Suggestions).&#xD;
