    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of a 6-week Inspiratory&#xD;
      Muscle Training and cardiovascular exercise training program in children and adolescents with&#xD;
      asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To also determine the efficacy of inspiratory muscle training and exercise in increasing&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength and endurance, and to explore relationships between fitness&#xD;
      interventions (inspiratory muscle training and exercise), exercise tolerance, airway closure&#xD;
      and dyspnea scores.&#xD;
