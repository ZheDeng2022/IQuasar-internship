  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      hMe-Seal is a low-input whole-genome cell-free 5hmC sequencing method based on selective&#xD;
      chemical labeling. It uses β-glucosyltransferase (βGT) to selectively label 5hmC with a&#xD;
      biotin via an azide-modified glucose for pull-down of 5hmC-containing DNA fragments for&#xD;
      sequencing. After selectively constructing 5hmC library, highthroughput-sequencing will be&#xD;
      performed on an Illumina Nextseq-500 instrument. By ways of Rawdata processing, differential&#xD;
      loci between Osteosarcoma group and control group will be detected to indentify specific&#xD;
      epigenetic biomarkers of Osteosarcoma. From our previous trials, we identify geno sequencing&#xD;
      related to beta-catenin pathways might have some relationship with osteosaroma primary or&#xD;
      secondary drug resistance. Thus in this trial we try to further explore the drug resistance&#xD;
      mechanism for advaced osteosarcoma second resistance to the combination therapy of Famitinib&#xD;
      and Camrelizumab.&#xD;

      cfDNA samples were prepared from peripheral blood collected from patients. Briefly, 8 ml of&#xD;
      peripheral blood was collected from each subject using EDTA anticoagulant tubes, and the&#xD;
      plasma sample was prepared within 6 h by centrifuging twice at 1 350× g for 12 min, and then&#xD;
      centrifuging at 13500× g for 12 min. The prepared plasma samples (about 2 ml/subject) were&#xD;
      immediately stored at -80 °C. The plasma cfDNA was isolated using the QIAamp Circulating&#xD;

        Results of previous study showed high objective response but short-term activity of&#xD;
        famitinib in advanced osteosarcoma. Given the recent success of immunotherapies,&#xD;
        combinations of antiangiogenics with immune checkpoint blockers have become an attractive&#xD;
        strategy. We aimed to investigate the activity of famitinib in combination with&#xD;
        camrelizumab in patients with inoperable high-grade osteosarcoma progressing after&#xD;
        chemotherapy.&#xD;
