      This study is designed to determine the RP2D of gedatolisib in combination with talazoparib&#xD;
      and to evaluate the efficacy of this combination in advanced HER2 negative breast cancer that&#xD;
      is triple negative or BRCA1/2 positive (deficient).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) are tumors that lack the hormone receptors and the&#xD;
      human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2). TNBC represents about 15% of all invasive&#xD;
      breast cancers diagnosed in the United States each year. This aggressive breast cancer&#xD;
      subtype has the lowest overall survival rate of all advanced breast cancers with median&#xD;
      survival of 12-13 months. Due to the lack of expression of the hormone receptors and&#xD;
      HER2,chemotherapy remains the current treatment for women with advanced TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of breast cancers have defects in homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair due to&#xD;
      germline BRCA mutations, and these cases are often triple negative. Poly(ADP-ribose)&#xD;
      polymerase (PARP) enzymes are involved in DNA repair and are activated by DNA strand breaks.&#xD;
      PARP function is particularly critical in tumors with BRCA1/2 mutations, making PARP&#xD;
      inhibition a rationale therapeutic strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two PARP inhibitors, Talazoparib and Olaparib, were approved by the FDA in 2018 for patients&#xD;
      who have advanced HER2 negative breast cancer and a germline BRCA 1/2 mutation. These&#xD;
      approvals were based on results from the EMBRACA and OLYMPIAD trials, respectively, which&#xD;
      both showed an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) versus physician choice&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gedatolisib is an intravenously administered PI3K and mTOR inhibitor which has been shown to&#xD;
      be safe in patients with metastatic breast cancer, either alone or in combination with oral&#xD;
      therapies. Previous research has shown that PI3K inhibitors lower nucleotide pools required&#xD;
      for DNA synthesis and S-phase progression. Additionally, inhibition of PI3K/mTOR could impede&#xD;
      PI3K interaction with the homologous recombination complex, increasing dependency on PARP&#xD;
      enzymes for DNA repair. Based on this data, the combination of a PI3K inhibitor and PARP&#xD;
      inhibitor could potentially lead to a new, non-chemotherapy treatment option for TNBC with&#xD;
      wild-type BRCA and improve the modest PFS seen with the PARP inhibitors as single agents in&#xD;
      BRCA1/2 mutant advanced breast cancer. The hypothesis for this trial is that the gedatolisib&#xD;
      will sensitize advanced TNBC or BRCA1/2 mutant breast cancers to PARP inhibition with&#xD;
      talazoparib. This study is thus designed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of&#xD;
      gedatolisib in combination with talazoparib and to evaluate the efficacy of this combination&#xD;
      in advanced HER2 negative breast cancer that is triple negative or BRCA1/2 positive&#xD;
      (mutated/deficient).&#xD;
