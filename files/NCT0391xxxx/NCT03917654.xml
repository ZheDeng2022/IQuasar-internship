      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaria affects many people in Mali and other parts of Africa. It is spread by mosquito&#xD;
      bites. Malaria can make people sick or can lead to death. Scientists want to learn if a&#xD;
      vaccine can stop it from spreading to other people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test how well an experimental malaria vaccine works to decrease malaria infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 5 and older who live in Doneguebougou, Mali, and surrounding areas&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      EKG&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to get either the experimental vaccine or an approved&#xD;
      vaccine. They will not know which they are getting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a visit about a week before their first vaccine. They will take a&#xD;
      medicine that kills malaria. They will take it at the clinic the next 2 days. Participants&#xD;
      ages 5-8 will take the drug again 2 weeks before their third vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants get the vaccine through a needle in the arm. They will have visits 1, 3, 7, and&#xD;
      14 days after. They will have blood tests or finger pricks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get another vaccine 1 and 6 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood tests once a month. At these visits they may also have urines&#xD;
      tests or mosquito feeds. For the feeds a cup full of mosquitoes will be placed on arms or&#xD;
      legs for 15-20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have visits twice a month for 4 months after their last vaccine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A vaccine to interrupt malaria transmission (VIMT), targeting disruption of both human and&#xD;
      mosquito transmission, would be a valuable tool for local elimination or eradication of this&#xD;
      disease. One strategy to design a VIMT is using components that block transmission of malaria&#xD;
      to mosquitoes, such as Pfs230. Pfs230, a surface antigen of intracellular gametocytes, as&#xD;
      well as extracellular gametes and zygotes in the mosquito stage of Plasmodium falciparum, is&#xD;
      currently the leading candidate in clinical trials for a malaria transmission-blocking&#xD;
      vaccine (TBV). Recombinant Pfs230D1M has been conjugated to a recombinant Pseudomonas&#xD;
      aeruginosa ExoProtein A (EPA) and adjuvanted with AS01. When formulated in AS01, results from&#xD;
      a recent first-in-human trial demonstrated that Pfs230-EPA induces functional&#xD;
      transmission-reducing, and in a significant proportion of vaccinees, transmission-blocking&#xD;
      serum activity that can be measured for months, the vaccine is well-tolerated and safe in&#xD;
      adults, and our recent natural history data clearly indicate that children play a&#xD;
      disproportionate role in malaria transmission. The next step in the development of&#xD;
      Pfs230D1M-EPA as a TBV is therefore to conduct an age de-escalation trial to ensure that the&#xD;
      vaccine is safe to administer to children and then to conduct a community clinical trial to&#xD;
      assess efficacy in family groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 2 study will first determine safety and tolerability of Pfs230D1M-EPA/AS01 in&#xD;
      healthy Malian children of decreasing ages: 9-18 years old, followed by 5-8 years old. A&#xD;
      total of 60 subjects will be enrolled in Doneguebougou, Mali, West Africa. Children will be&#xD;
      recruited from compounds/family that have agreed to participate in the main phase of the&#xD;
      study and will enroll in a staggered manner to receive either Pfs230D1M-EPA/AS01 vaccine or&#xD;
      comparator as assigned by their compound block randomization. Prior to receipt of vaccination&#xD;
      #1, all subjects will receive a full treatment course of artemether/lumefantrine (AL). Safety&#xD;
      and tolerability will be monitored and reported as local and systemic adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
      and serious adverse events (SAEs) and reviewed by DSMB, sponsor, medical monitors, and study&#xD;
      team prior to proceeding with enrollment of the main phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are no safety concerns, in a staggered manner, the main phase will begin enrollment&#xD;
      of approximately 137 compounds/vaccine units (about 1500 vaccinees + about 400 under 5 years&#xD;
      of age for parasite surveillance). Children enrolled during the pilot safety phase will join&#xD;
      their main phase compounds/family for vaccination #3. Prior to receipt of first vaccination,&#xD;
      all subjects will receive a full treatment course of AL. All vaccinated subjects will be&#xD;
      monitored for safety and tolerability. Immunogenicity outcomes will be antibody responses as&#xD;
      measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against recombinant Pfs230D1M.&#xD;
      Functional activity of the induced antibodies will be assessed by standard membrane feeding&#xD;
      assays in select samples. Vaccine activity will be measured in children 9-18 years of age who&#xD;
      will undergo direct skin feeds (DSF) starting 2 weeks post vaccination #3 for a total of 8&#xD;
      DSFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to scheduled last vaccination in members of the compound/family, children 1-4 years of&#xD;
      age and vaccinated children 5-8 years of age will receive a full treatment course of AL prior&#xD;
      to the expected start of the transmission season and will then be followed every 2 weeks by&#xD;
      blood smear (BS) along with all vaccinated children. Children 9-18 years of age will also be&#xD;
      assessed for vaccine efficacy, but as a separate analysis from those 1-8 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Year 2, those who received vaccination during Year 1 (5 years of age and older at&#xD;
      enrollment), if eligible and still on study, will receive a single fourth vaccination per&#xD;
      their vaccine unit (VU) blinded arm assignment. No new individuals will be enrolled. Again,&#xD;
      children 1-4 years of age and vaccinated children 5-8 years of age will receive a full&#xD;
      treatment course of AL prior to the expected start of the transmission season and will then&#xD;
      be followed every 2 weeks by BS along with all vaccinated children. Children 9-18 years of&#xD;
      age will also be assessed for vaccine efficacy against parasitemia, but as a separate&#xD;
      analysis from those 1-8 years of age. Immunogenicity outcomes will be antibody responses as&#xD;
      measured by ELISA against recombinant Pfs230D1M. Functional activity of the induced&#xD;
      antibodies will be assessed by standard membrane feeding assays in select samples. Vaccine&#xD;
      activity will be measured in children 9-18 years of age who will undergo DSF starting 2 weeks&#xD;
      post vaccination #4 for a total of 10 DSFs.&#xD;
