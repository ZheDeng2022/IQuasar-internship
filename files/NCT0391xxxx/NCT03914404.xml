      This study was a 12-week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, double dummy, parallel&#xD;
      clinical trial to compare the efficacy of γ-linolenic acid and Thioctic acid in patients with&#xD;
      diabetic neuropathy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated non-inferiority about the efficacy and safety of γ-linolenic acid&#xD;
      (Evoprim soft capsule) through patients with diabetic neuropathy were compared γ-linolenic&#xD;
      acid (Evoprim soft capsule) and Thioctic acid(LipoA HR Tab. 600mg) using double-blind, double&#xD;
      dummy clinical trials. First outcome measures are Visual Analog Scale(VAS) and Total Symptom&#xD;
      Score(TSS), secondary outcome measures are Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument(MNSI),&#xD;
      Current perception Threshold(CPT), Modified Brief Pain Inventory-diabetic&#xD;
      polyneuropathy(Modified BPI-DPN) and EuroQol-5 Dimensions(EQ 5D).&#xD;

    <measure>Changes of Visual Analog Scale(VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale(VAS) score is 0 point for no symptom, 10 points for the most severe symptom, and the patient is asked to mark the degree of subjective pain symptoms as an integer.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of Total Symptom Score(TSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Total Symptom Score(TSS) classifies diabetic neuropathy symptoms into four categories (pain, burning pain, paresthesia, numbness). The frequency (Occasional, Frequent, Continuous) and symptom intensity (Absent, Slight, Moderate, Severe) are calculated through each question and the score is obtained according to the visual analog scale. It is calculated from 0 point up to 14.64 points.</description>

    <measure>Changes of Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument(MNSIQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 15-item questionnaire (MNSIQ) is used to assess deformation, infection, skin thickening of the skin's stratum corneum, and ulcers.&#xD;
MNSIQ was designed to screen for diabetic neuropathy through questionnaires on 15 questions that are related to neuropathic symptoms (pain, temperature, and sensation). Two of 15 (number 4 and 10) are vascular symptoms and are excluded from the total score regardless of the results. If you answered 'No' to questions 7 and 13, you will get 1 point. In the end, scores ranging from 0 to 13 indicate that the higher the score, the more severe the neuropathic symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Changes of Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument(MNSIE)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A foot test (MNSIE) is used to assess deformation, infection, skin thickening of the skin's stratum corneum, and ulcers.&#xD;
MNSIE evaluates foot shape, foot ulceration, ankle reflex, sense of vibration of big toe, monofilament right and left. The score ranges from point 0 to 10, and when the score is above 2, it is diagnosed as neuropathy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of Current perception Threshold(CPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sensory nerve conduction threshold (SNCT) is a unique method for evaluating all three sensory neurons (small unmyelinated fibers, small myelinated fibers, and large myelinated fibers) that make up more than 90% of sensory nerves. It seems to be possible to objectively evaluate sensory nerve of small fiber which recovered early in diabetic neuropathy(Using neurometer).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of Modified Brief Pain Inventory-diabetic polyneuropathy(Modified BPI-DPN)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Brief Pain Inventory-diabetic polyneuropathy(Modified BPI-DPN) displays the pain area on the human figure, the number of pain sites, treatment of pain, and pain medication.&#xD;
Pain severity refers to the pain sensation- identification aspect (pain threshold). The worst pain, the least pain, the pain average, and the pain now for the last 24 hours are displayed on the 10-point scale (0 points: none, ~ 10 Point: too big to imagine). Pain interference is the emotional-synchronous aspect of pain (pain tolerance). It classifies general activity, mood, walking, working, relationship, sleep and enjoyment of life, and use the 10-point scale (0 points: none to 10 points: completely disturbed).</description>
