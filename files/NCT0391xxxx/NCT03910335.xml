  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to develop a questionnaire that should distinguish patients with&#xD;
      lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) from other patients. LSS can cause significant pain and&#xD;
      disability leading to dramatically reduced quality of life, immobility and functional&#xD;
      limitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of people with pain and disability due to LSS is expected to increase with age due&#xD;
      to the degenerative nature of the disease. With an aging population this could potentially&#xD;
      become a major health economic challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the challenges to estimate the true prevalence is the lack of a valid and reliable&#xD;
      gold standard for LSS. To our knowledge, no diagnostic screening tool designed to estimate&#xD;
      the prevalence of LSS in a clinical population of Danish patients with chronic low back pain&#xD;
      (LBP) and leg pain has been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this project is to develop a diagnostic screening tool for LSS - the LLS&#xD;
      Screen. This should consist of a set of items useable in a self-administered questionnaire, a&#xD;
      rule to compute the probability of having LSS, and a cutpoint to be used to obtain a&#xD;
      sensitivity of 95%. The rule should be applicable in patient populations suffering from low&#xD;
      back pain and with increased suspicion to suffer from LSS due to failure of non-surgical&#xD;
      treatment&#xD;

      The specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. To identify items with high content validity for diagnosing LLS B. To investigate the&#xD;
      preliminary value of items included in the LLS screen C. To investigate the performance of&#xD;
      the included items in the LLS screen D. To decide on the content of the final version of the&#xD;
      LLS Screen&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project consists of four parts. Part I addresses objective A based on a literature&#xD;
      search and qualitative semi-structured interviews. Part II addresses objective B by&#xD;
      conducting a case-control study concurrent with a cohort study and performing a series of&#xD;
      analyses to investigate the preliminary value and performance of the items. Part III&#xD;
      describes the performance of the items by combining them in various ways to obtain an optimal&#xD;
      diagnostic rule (objective C). Finally, part IV is a decision of the content of the final&#xD;
      version of the LSS Screen based on information from Part I, II and III (objective D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A case-control study with cases and controls identified within a prospective clinical&#xD;
      population based cohort study that will be boosted with cases of LSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort design First, a prospective clinical population based cohort of patients with low back&#xD;
      pain and/or leg pain will be initiated. Patients above 50 years of age will be included in&#xD;
      the study at their first visit at the Spine Centre where they fill out the screening&#xD;
      questionnaire (index test) before they are seen by a clinician. The primary diagnosis&#xD;
      (reference test) will be assessed and determined by specialists at the Spine Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case-control design Secondly, patients with LSS will be recruited from other departments to&#xD;
      artificially increase the prevalence of LSS. Patients with LSS will be recruited from the&#xD;
      surgical department at the Spine Centre of Southern Denmark, Middelfart, Denmark and&#xD;
      Department of Spine Surgery, Odense University Hospital (OUH), Odense, Denmark.&#xD;
