    <textblock>
      This study seeks to to determine the efficacy and side effect profile following radiation&#xD;
      therapy for participants with the AeroForm device placed. The AeroForm device is FDA&#xD;

      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the proportion of successful initial phase of tissue expander/implant based breast&#xD;
      reconstructions (no reconstruction failure or unexpected return to the operating room)&#xD;
      following post-mastectomy radiation therapy in participants with AeroFormplaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the rate of successful exchange of tissue expander for implant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the rate of reconstruction revisions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate CTCAE acute and chronic toxicity rates, infections and cosmetic outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate dosimetry to treatment targets as well as organs at risk (heart, lungs) with&#xD;
           AeroFormas compared to traditional reconstruction techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate time to initiation of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate clinical outcomes-local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant metastases,&#xD;
           survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate participant breast reconstruction related QOL with the AirXpander&#xD;
           AeroFormdevice&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase II trial evaluating the use of the intervention in participants with breast&#xD;
      cancer undergoing post-mastectomy radiation therapy in order to define the toxicity profile&#xD;
      and associated subsequent successful surgical reconstruction rate&#xD;

    <description>The AeroFormdevice will be placed in an immediate fashion at the time of mastectomy in a submuscular, prepectoral or dual-plane approach. The tissue expander will be minimally inflated intraoperatively to minimize dead space and while facilitating tension free closure. Participants will undergo standard postoperative management, and will be given instructions on utilization of the device, including daily expansion until desired volume is reached as determined b surgeon and participant agreement.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has received prior radiation therapy to neck, breast, or chest or other area&#xD;
             that will result in overlap.&#xD;

             duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120&#xD;
             days after the last day of trial treatment are excluded from this study because of the&#xD;
             potential toxicities of radiation therapy. Additionally, because there is an unknown,&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with AirXpanders, breastfeeding women will be excluded. These potential risks&#xD;
             may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
