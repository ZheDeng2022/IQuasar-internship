      This study will examine whether patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors harboring&#xD;
      evidence of somatic hypermutation (intermediate versus high tumor mutational burden) will&#xD;
      exhibit improvement in disease progression-free survival with dual Tremelimumab and&#xD;
      Durvalumab treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is phase II basket trial to evaluate the benefit of immunotherapy (Durvalumab and&#xD;
      Tremelimumab combination) in treatment of relapse/refractory solid tumor patients whose&#xD;
      tumors express a high tumor mutational burden (TMB high &gt;20 mutations/MB) or moderate tumor&#xD;
      mutational burden (10-20 mutations/MB) as based on next generation sequencing (NGS). The&#xD;
      primary endpoint of the study is the TTP (time-to-progression) ratio or growth modulation&#xD;
      index (GMI) which is defined for individual patients as the ratio of their TTP on the current&#xD;
      therapy to their TTP on the most recent previous therapy.&#xD;

             been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following&#xD;
             age-specific requirements apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been&#xD;

             sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male&#xD;
             partner must use at least 1 highly effective method of contraception from the time of&#xD;
             screening and must agree to continue using such precaution for 180 days after the last&#xD;
             dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days after the last dose&#xD;
             of durvalumab monotherapy. Non-sterilized male partners of female patient must use&#xD;
             male condom plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after&#xD;
             this point should be discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual&#xD;
             activity for the total duration of the drug treatment and the drug washout period is&#xD;
             an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the&#xD;
             withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Female patients should&#xD;
             also refrain from breastfeeding throughout this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must use a male condom plus spermicide from screening through 180 days after&#xD;
             receipt of the final dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days&#xD;
             after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab monotherapy. Not engaging in sexual&#xD;
             activity is an acceptable practice; however, occasional abstinence, the rhythm method,&#xD;
             and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male patients&#xD;
             should refrain from sperm donation throughout this period&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study&#xD;
             including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow&#xD;
             up&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Body weight &gt;30 kg&#xD;
&#xD;

             access an available archival tumor sample taken less than 6 months prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment if a fresh tumor biopsy is not feasible with an acceptable clinical risk&#xD;
             and no antecedent treatment has been done.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. MSS tumor as documented by either: IHC testing that does not suggest loss of MLH-1,&#xD;
             MSH-2, PMS2 or MSH6. OR PCR testing that does not suggest MSI&#xD;

             endocrine therapy, targeted therapy, biologic therapy, tumor embolization, monoclonal&#xD;
             antibodies) 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any unresolved toxicity NCI CTCAE Grade ≥2 from previous anticancer therapy with the&#xD;
             exception of alopecia, vitiligo, and the laboratory values defined in the inclusion&#xD;

             or Wegener syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc]). The following are exceptions to this&#xD;
             criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients with vitiligo or alopecia&#xD;

             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase&#xD;
             risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written&#xD;
             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of another primary malignancy except for&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease ≥5 years&#xD;
                  before the first dose of the IP ( durvalumab + tremelimumab combination ) and of&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Patients with untreated brain metastases, spinal cord compression, or leptomeningeal&#xD;
             carcinomatosis should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor&#xD;
             prognosis, because of symptoms that may arise form inflammatory reactions, and because&#xD;
             they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the&#xD;
             evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. Patients whose brain metastases&#xD;
             have been treated may participate provided they show radiographic stability (defined&#xD;
             as 2 brain images, both of which are obtained after treatment to the brain metastases.&#xD;
             These imaging scans should both be obtained at least four weeks apart and show no&#xD;
             evidence of intracranial progression). In addition, any neurologic symptoms that&#xD;
             developed either as a result of the brain metastases or their treatment must have&#xD;
             resolved or be stable either, without the use of steroids, or are stable on a steroid&#xD;
             dose of &lt;10mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent and anti-convulsants for at least 14&#xD;

             local practice), hepatitis B (known positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) result),&#xD;
             hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies). Patients&#xD;
             with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core&#xD;
             antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for&#xD;
             hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative&#xD;
             for HCV RNA&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first&#xD;

             Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP. Note:&#xD;
             Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving IP and up to&#xD;
             30 days after the last dose of IP&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female patients of&#xD;
             reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control from&#xD;
             screening to 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy or180 days after&#xD;
             the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug&#xD;
