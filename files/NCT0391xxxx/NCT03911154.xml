  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess whether slow wave sleep enhancement using SmartSleep technology&#xD;
      benefits daytime cognitive performance during periods of chronic sleep restriction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adequate healthy sleep is essential in spaceflight to ensure that astronauts maintain a high&#xD;
      level of cognitive performance capability and do so without undue stress. There is a need for&#xD;
      a technology that can improve sleep quality in space and biologically maximize the&#xD;
      performance benefits of limited sleep duration, without unduly affecting the ability of&#xD;
      astronauts to awaken abruptly and respond to an in-flight emergency. Sleep slow waves support&#xD;
      system and synaptic consolidation by promoting specific patterns of neuromodulatory and&#xD;
      electric activities, and subjective sleep quality is related to the size and number of slow&#xD;
      waves that occur nightly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use SmartSleep (Philips) technology to determine what effect the device has&#xD;
      on daytime cognitive performance after emergent awakenings from sleep in a chronic sleep&#xD;
      restriction paradigm. The SmartSleep technology uses two small sensors in the headband to&#xD;
      continuously detect the brain's slow wave sleep (delta/theta frequency) in real time, and a&#xD;
      closed-loop algorithm customizes the timing and volume of tones to optimize the sleep&#xD;
      pattern. Thus, the device uses &quot;quiet audio tones&quot; (sub-awareness) to increase slow waves,&#xD;
      which can enhance sleep quality/depth, thereby enhancing subsequent waking cognitive&#xD;
      performance without the unwanted sedating effects of medications on cognitive functions&#xD;
      during emergency awakenings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be in the laboratory for 7 days/6 nights. Night 1 will be an adaptation night&#xD;
      with 8-hours time in bed. Nights 2-5 will consist of 5 hours time in bed, followed by night 6&#xD;
      of a recovery 10 hours time in bed. During nights 2-5, subjects will receive one of four&#xD;
      stimulation modalities using the SmartSleep wearable device. Subjects will receive all four&#xD;
      modalities in a randomized order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Continuous Fixed Interval&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Block&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In-Phase Adjustable&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sham: No auditory stimulation while wearing the SmartSleep headband&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive performance testing and self-report surveys will be completed on a daily basis. A&#xD;
      total of 12 healthy astronaut-like adults will be studied. Subjects will complete the 7-day&#xD;
      study in groups of 4.&#xD;
