      liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify molecular and cellular drivers of liver disease to provide a molecular&#xD;
      classification and study the determinants or key drivers of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients admitted with steatohepatitis (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study where liver tissue, blood and stool will be collected to discover and&#xD;
      validate factors associated with diagnosis, severity, histological characteristics,&#xD;
      development of decompensations, progression of disease and survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2015, chronic liver diseases were responsible for approximately 2% of worldwide mortality&#xD;
      and in 2016 cirrhosis and chronic liver diseases accounted for 531.1 age- standardized,&#xD;
      Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY's) /100,000 habitants.(1, 2) Cirrhosis is a leading&#xD;
      cause of death worldwide within adults between 50 and 70 years old. In the past few decades&#xD;
      vast improvements have been made, death rates have decreased for almost all diseases.&#xD;
      However, in the USA, the occurrence of alcoholic cirrhosis and HCV cirrhosis has increased,&#xD;
      79 and 75% respectively, from 1990 to 2016 in regards of total number of deaths (3). This&#xD;
      trend can also be observed in other countries such as UK where standardized mortality rates&#xD;
      have increased 400% in the last 44 years. This has a big impact in the working-age population&#xD;
      (18-65 years old)(4). The main causes of liver cirrhosis are hepatitis B virus (HBV) and C&#xD;
      (HCV) as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (ALD and NAFLD,&#xD;
      respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most chronic liver diseases have a silent course until the development of complications. For&#xD;
      patients with compensated disease, the presence of significant liver fibrosis predicts&#xD;
      decompensated disease and early mortality.(5-8) Therefore, diagnosis at early stages is&#xD;
      mandatory to prevent liver-related morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to provide a framework for successful clinical trials testing&#xD;
      novel targets for therapy in liver disease. The &quot;Integrated Approaches for Identifying&#xD;
      Molecular Targets in Liver Disease&quot; (InLi) group is aimed to fill this gap. The group InLi&#xD;
      will be composed of a multidisciplinary group including hepatologists, physician-scientists,&#xD;
      basic scientists and bioinformatics experts. The main goal of InLi is to provide a framework&#xD;
      for successful clinical trials testing novel targets for therapy in alcoholic hepatitis. The&#xD;
      Human Biorepository Core will include a variety of biological samples from patients with a&#xD;
      wide arrange of liver diseases as well as healthy controls from UPMC liver center as well as&#xD;
      a comprehensive database that includes epidemiological, dietary, anthropometrical,&#xD;
      analytical, histological, and clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common protocol for tissue processing, shipping and storage will be used to ensure sample&#xD;
      integrity and quality. Storage of data generated from patients and biospecimens will be&#xD;
      facilitated through, Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system, and will follow strict&#xD;
      security measures including encryption, coding and limited access to the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of new-targeted therapies for most liver diseases, but especially,&#xD;
      steatohepatitis, one of the more urgent needs in clinical hepatology. To reach this goal, a&#xD;
      large multidisciplinary network is required. InLI coordinates a multidisciplinary group&#xD;
      composed of clinicians, physician-scientists, basic scientists and bioinformatics experts.&#xD;
      The overarching hypothesis of InLi is that the most rational way to provide a useful&#xD;
      framework for future clinical trials in liver disease consists of the (i) determination of&#xD;
      key drivers of the disease process, (ii) classification of molecular profiles and subtypes of&#xD;
      specific liver diseases within each and every pathology, and (iii)identification of&#xD;
      &quot;druggable&quot; targets based on both key drivers and molecular classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Human Biorepository Core will generate a large collection of samples from patients with&#xD;
      different Liver diseases (e.g. viral, steatohepatitis and cholestasis liver disease). For&#xD;
      each disease, we will consider a range of phenotypes focusing in early, intermediate and late&#xD;
      disease stages and for each etiology. Moreover, we will also include samples from control&#xD;
      patients. We will also build a comprehensive database that will serve as a basis for the&#xD;
      proposed translational studies and be a valuable asset for the broader scientific community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two scientific projects will combine a thorough molecular characterization of patients&#xD;
      with different liver disease with studies on key and targetable pathways that drive key&#xD;
      aspects of alcoholic hepatitis (AH) disease progression and outcome such as inflammation,&#xD;
      injury and regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project 1: (&quot;Molecular Subtypes for Targeted Therapies in Liver disease&quot;) will identify&#xD;
      molecular and cellular drivers of liver disease to provide a molecular classification using&#xD;
      RNA sequencing, kinomic, metabolomic and novel systems biology approaches, and determine&#xD;
      contributors to unfavorable outcomes and the associated progenitor cell accumulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project 2: (&quot;Determination of key drivers of the disease progression&quot;) The aim of the study&#xD;
      is to describe histological, clinical and molecular characteristics that will make a&#xD;
      particular disease evolve from early to advance form. We will use &quot;omics&quot; and novel systems,&#xD;
      a biological approach as well as classic immunohistochemistry and histology stain technics.&#xD;
      We will also use different imaging methodologies including second harmonic generation imaging&#xD;
      microscopy (SHIM) and electronic microscopy to describe and identify specific histological&#xD;
      patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project 3: Build a Human repository capable of providing a platform to develop projects 1 and&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
