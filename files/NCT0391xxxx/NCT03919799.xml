    <textblock>
      This randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 study is seeking to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of belumosudil (KD025) for the treatment of diffuse cutaneous systematic sclerosis.&#xD;
      Upon eligibility confirmation, a total of 60 adult subjects will be enrolled and randomized&#xD;
      into 3 groups (1:1:1) to either receive orally administered belumosudil (200 mg once daily&#xD;
      and 200 mg twice daily) or matched placebo for 28 weeks. Study drug dosing will be for 52&#xD;
      weeks: double-blinded for the first 28 weeks followed by an open-label extension of 24 weeks.&#xD;
      After unblinding, the subjects on belumosudil will continue on the same belumosudil dose&#xD;
      whereas the subjects in the placebo group will be re-randomized to one of the belumosudil&#xD;
      doses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes widespread microvascular&#xD;
      damage and excessive deposition of collagen in the skin and internal organs. Limited&#xD;
      cutaneous systemic sclerosis is primarily cutaneous, affecting the hands, arms, and face.&#xD;
      Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc) is a more serious manifestation of the disease&#xD;
      and is often rapidly progressive, not only involving the skin, but also involving internal&#xD;
      organs including kidney, heart, and lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who have signed an Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee-approved&#xD;
      informed consent form and met all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled. A&#xD;
      total of 60 subjects will be randomized into 3 groups (1:1:1) to receive orally administered&#xD;
      belumosudil 200 mg once daily (QD; n = 20 subjects), belumosudil 200 mg twice daily (BID; n =&#xD;
      20 subjects), or matched placebo (n = 20 subjects) for 28 weeks. The study will be&#xD;
      double-blinded for the first 28 weeks followed by an open-label extension of 24 weeks. After&#xD;
      unblinding, the subjects in Group 1 and 2 will continue on the same belumosudil dose whereas&#xD;
      the subjects in the placebo group will be re-randomized to either belumosudil 200 mg QD or&#xD;
      belumosudil 200 mg BID in 1:1 fashion.&#xD;

             Females of childbearing potential are defined as sexually mature women without prior&#xD;

                  doses of hormonal contraception for at least 3 months (e.g., oral, injectable,&#xD;
                  implant, transdermal) plus 1 barrier method; or (3) two barrier methods.&#xD;
