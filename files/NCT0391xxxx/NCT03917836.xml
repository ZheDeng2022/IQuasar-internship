      The investigators in the present study, aimed to assess the efficacy of both White-Light&#xD;
      Endoscopy with High Resolution Endoscopy-Narrow-band imaging in the diagnosis of Premalignant&#xD;
      Gastric Conditions, before and after Helicobacter pylori-eradication. A prospective study was&#xD;
      performed in our institution involving the regular use of high resolution gastroscopes with&#xD;
      and without Narrow-band imaging. From May 2018 to April 2019, all patients that received an&#xD;
      endoscopic diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori-related gastritis with/without Premalignant&#xD;
      Gastric Conditions by an expert endoscopist, were reassessed by White-Light Endoscopy and&#xD;
      High Resolution Endoscopy-Narrow-band imaging, including biopsy samples according to the&#xD;
      Sydney system, six months later after the proved Helicobacter pylori-eradication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori infection is commonly responsible for Premalignant Gastric Conditions&#xD;
      such as chronic atrophic gastritis and Intestinal Metaplasia, which are strongly associated,&#xD;
      when located in antrum and corpus, to the evolution into dysplasia and into the Lauren&#xD;
      intestinal-type of Gastric Carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have linked gastric carcinogenesis to genes, genetic variations of the host, as&#xD;
      well as to Helicobacter pylori induced inflammation of gastric mucosa. In addition, hostile&#xD;
      Helicobacter pylori strains have been considered responsible for more severe degrees of&#xD;
      inflammation and more rapid progression to intestinal-type gastric cancer, in genetically&#xD;
      predisposed subjects. Nowadays, Premalignant Gastric Conditions detection and surveillance&#xD;
      has been considered a cost-effective strategy only in intermediate or high risk regions, for&#xD;
      the prevention of high-grade dysplasia and gastric cancer. Anyway, conflicting results&#xD;
      deriving from &quot;long-term&quot; endoscopic surveillances (ranging between 2-16 years), have shown&#xD;
      that Helicobacter pylori eradication was effective in reducing the prevalence of&#xD;
      advanced-Premalignant Gastric Conditions, as well as histological progression of&#xD;
      early-Premalignant Gastric Conditions, decreasing gastric cancer incidence. The current&#xD;
      European guidelines recommend Helicobacter pylori eradication in at high-risk subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, even after Helicobacter pylori eradication, the risk for Premalignant Gastric&#xD;
      Conditions/malignant lesions progresses on long-term follow-up. An adequate upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal endoscopy should include at least four non-targeted biopsies at the lesser&#xD;
      and greater curvature, and at the antrum-corpus for Helicobacter pylori infection diagnosis&#xD;
      and for the optimal detection/staging of advanced-Premalignant Gastric Conditions, which are&#xD;
      randomly distributed throughout the stomach. Additional target biopsies of visible suspected&#xD;
      lesions are recommended, since low/high grade dysplasia may appear as endoscopically evident,&#xD;
      depressed or raised lesions. Several studies showed that Magnification Chromoendoscopy and&#xD;
      Narrow-band imaging with or without magnification could be more accurate than White-Light&#xD;
      Endoscopy alone, when performed by expert endoscopists, in diagnosing and differentiating&#xD;
      Premalignant Gastric Conditions/lesions, by guiding biopsies for staging atrophic/metaplastic&#xD;
      changes and by targeting neoplastic lesions, even if random biopsies may be useful in&#xD;
      detecting some cases undetectable by Narrow-band imaging alone, and therefore both&#xD;
      White-Light Endoscopy with Narrow-band imaging are suggested. Therefore, as a result of many&#xD;
      studies, high definition endoscopy with Chromoendoscopy is considered better than high&#xD;
      definition White-Light Endoscopy alone in diagnosing Premalignant Gastric Conditions and&#xD;
      early neoplastic lesions, whereas virtual Chromoendoscopy, with or without magnification,&#xD;
      should be used for the diagnosis of Premalignant Gastric Conditions. For patients with&#xD;
      indefinite diagnosis for dysplasia, or with dysplasia resulted from random biopsies without&#xD;
      &quot;apparent&quot; endoscopically visible lesions, the current guidelines suggest a relatively&#xD;
      immediate endoscopic reassessment with High Resolution Endoscopy-Narrow-band imaging, to&#xD;
      exclude a misdiagnosed low/high grade dysplasia on visible lesion or an early-gastric cancer,&#xD;
      differently from the previous guidelines, which advised for the same patients only endoscopic&#xD;
      follow-up within 1 year after diagnosis.&#xD;
