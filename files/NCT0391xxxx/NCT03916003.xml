      This study is designed as a multi-centre randomized, open label trial to compare the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of a high dose primaquine (PQ) treatment in G6PD normal patients with P.&#xD;
      falciparum to reduce the risk of subsequent P. vivax episodes to current standard practice of&#xD;
      providing only schizontocidal treatment.&#xD;

      Plasmodium vivax forms dormant liver stages that reactivate weeks or months following an&#xD;
      acute infection. Recurrent infections can be associated with a febrile illness, a cumulative&#xD;
      risk of severe anaemia, direct and indirect mortality, and are the most important source of&#xD;
      onward transmission of the parasite. In co-endemic areas, there is a very high risk (up to&#xD;
      50%) of patients representing with P. vivax malaria following treatment of P. falciparum.&#xD;
      Hence, in co-endemic regions there is a strong rationale for eradicating P. vivax hypnozoites&#xD;
      from the liver in patients presenting with uncomplicated P. falciparum infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recently completed multicentre IMPROV study compared the efficacy of a 7 day primaquine&#xD;
      regimen (1.0 mg/kg/day for 7 days) with a 14 day regimen (0.5 mg/kg/day for 14 days). The 7&#xD;
      day PQ regimen was non-inferior to the 14 day regimen and 5-fold more efficacious at reducing&#xD;
      P. vivax recurrence than the control.&#xD;
