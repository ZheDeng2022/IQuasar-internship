      This is a two-part (dose-escalation, dose-expansion), multicenter, open-label Phase 1 study&#xD;
      of KHK2455 in combination with avelumab in adult subjects with locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      urothelial carcinoma (including bladder, urethra, ureters, and renal pelvis). Subjects will&#xD;
      be screened for entry into this study after signing informed consent. Subjects must meet&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1 (dose-escalation phase) has a modified 3+3 design that will evaluate the safety&#xD;
           and tolerability and identify the MTD or highest protocol-defined dose, in the absence&#xD;
           of exceeding the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2 (cohort-expansion phase) will further explore the safety, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
           pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity for the combination regimen at the MTD or&#xD;
           highest dose level tested.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may be male or female and must be ≥ 18 years of age; have an ECOG PS of 0 or&#xD;
             1; and a life expectancy of &gt; 3 months in the Investigator's judgment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects are able to understand and willing to sign the ICF, according to&#xD;
             institutional standards, prior to the initiation of any study related procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have histological or cytological evidence of metastatic or advanced&#xD;
             urothelial carcinoma (including bladder, urethra, ureters, and renal pelvis that has&#xD;
             predominantly transitional cell or urothelial features); and have measurable&#xD;
             neoplastic disease according to RECIST v1.1 criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have been previously treated with a platinum-based therapy and&#xD;
             progressed; OR Been previously treated with platinum based adjuvant or neo-adjuvant&#xD;
             therapy and relapsed or progressed; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be platinum-based chemotherapy intolerant or ineligible; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have progressed during or after treatment with approved PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a tumor accessible for fresh biopsy at the baseline visit and for&#xD;
             IDO assessment. If current circumstances prohibit the biopsy procedure (e.g.,&#xD;
             temporary hospital protocol restrictions, regulatory or local authority requirements,&#xD;
             etc.) then archived tissue from previous biopsies (fresh frozen tissue &lt; 9 months and&#xD;
             formalin fixed-paraffin embedded [FFPE] block of ≤ 24 months) without intervening&#xD;
             checkpoint inhibitors can substitute for a fresh baseline biopsy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able to swallow the solid (encapsulated) dosage form of KHK2455&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have been previously treated with avelumab or any IDO1 inhibitor or&#xD;
             CTLA-4, PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors; or any investigational immunotherapy&#xD;
             including but not limited to anti-cancer vaccines or oncotropic viruses&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with prior or current liver metastases;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of organ transplant or allogeneic bone marrow transplant;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with pre-existing uveitis or other known clinically meaningful retinal&#xD;
             disorders as determined by a local ophthalmologist&#xD;
