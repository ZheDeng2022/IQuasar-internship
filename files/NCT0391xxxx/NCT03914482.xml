    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test the FLIP device, a novel device developed and manufactured&#xD;
      by Endra Life Sciences, located in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The purpose of the device is to&#xD;
      measure the fat content of liver tissue to assist in the diagnosis of fatty liver disease.&#xD;
      This feasibility study will involve 50 patients having their liver imaged by traditional&#xD;
      ultrasound and MRI methods as well as using the FLIP device. The data obtained by the FLIP&#xD;
      will be compared with the data obtained by ultrasound and MRI in order to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the device. This is a preliminary study to see if the investigational device&#xD;
      could eventually be used to image the liver alongside traditional ultrasound for discerning&#xD;
      fat concentration.&#xD;

      It has been demonstrated that thermoacoustic imaging can be used to identify water and fat&#xD;
      concentrations [Bauer, 2012]. In addition, the group led by Dr. Kruger have demonstrated that&#xD;
      conventional computed tomography shows similar features to thermoacoustic imaging in small&#xD;
      animal studies [Kruger, 2003]. These concepts have led Endra Life Sciences to develop the&#xD;
      FLIP device with the purpose of imaging fat concentration in liver tissue with indications&#xD;
      for fatty liver disease. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was first reported in 1980&#xD;
      by pathologists at the Mayo clinic in obese, or overweight, patients with no history of&#xD;
      alcohol abuse. This represented the first time that fatty livers were observed with no&#xD;
      history of alcohol abuse. Since that first report of NAFLD, increased rates of obesity and&#xD;
      general increased caloric intake has dramatically increased rates of fatty liver disease.&#xD;
      Estimates of NAFLD range from 25 - 40% of the adult population globally. NAFLD is a&#xD;
      multi-system disease. Fatty liver disease is highly correlated with obesity and alcohol&#xD;
      abuse, and is an important biomarker of insulin resistance and metabolic disease. Endra's&#xD;
      technology offers a non-invasive, cost effective point of care solution to monitoring liver&#xD;
      fat content that will be enormously helpful in surveilling patients with metabolic disease,&#xD;
      insulin resistance, and those at risk for later stage liver disease. This study will provide&#xD;
      additional information that will guide the further development of the FLIP device with the&#xD;
      end goal of commercializing the product. Fibroscan is a device that is currently on the&#xD;
      market that is also indicated for fatty liver disease. Fibroscan is a shear wave elastography&#xD;
      device that measures the stiffness of liver tissue by mechanically deforming tissue (by&#xD;
      utilizing a plunger that vibrates the surface of the skin) and measures the resulting shear&#xD;
      wave speed within the liver by ultrasound. The shear wave speed is related to the mechanical&#xD;
      stiffness of the tissue. Fibroscan aims to assess the progression of infiltration of collagen&#xD;
      into normal liver tissue that results in scarring, characteristic of fibrotic liver disease.&#xD;
      Liver fibrosis progresses from fatty liver disease, not all fatty liver disease patients&#xD;
      develop fibrotic liver disease. The Fibroscan device has an optional software module that&#xD;
      attempts to quantify the attenuation of the shear wave as it travels away from the plane of&#xD;
      deformation. Fibroscan refers to this measurement as CAP (Calculated Attenuation Parameter).&#xD;
      The attenuation of the shear wave is thought to be related to the degree of liver steatosis&#xD;
      (fat content).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the technique has demonstrated poor sensitivity, and is poorly correlated with&#xD;
      quantitative MRI measures of liver fat. Furthermore, CAP measurements in obese patients are&#xD;
      difficult to obtain and unreliable. Endra's technology aims to provide much more sensitive&#xD;
      measurements of liver fat content at the point of care. The Endra device has the potential to&#xD;
      quantify fat content as low as 5% (by volume). The system is interoperable with ultrasound&#xD;
      and leverages B-mode ultrasound imaging to guide measurement location. Compared to&#xD;
      Fibroscan's CAP, Endra's fatty liver measures are expected to be much more sensitive and&#xD;
      reproducible based on anatomical guidance by ultrasound imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A healthy volunteer study was conducted to test the overall feasibility of the device in use&#xD;
      in humans. The median liver fat percentage was in the normal range, less than six percent,&#xD;
      which helped gauge the accuracy of using the device in detecting low levels of liver fat. In&#xD;
      addition, the operator was able to optimize the use of the device on human scanning. Of the&#xD;
      25 study subject datasets analyzed, only 4 subjects had above normal liver fat by MRI fat&#xD;
      fraction (normal is &lt; 6% fat fraction). All 4 study subjects with &gt;6% liver fat fraction,&#xD;
      fell into 'mild liver fat' grade that spans 6% - 26% fat fraction, with the maximum value of&#xD;
      22%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using all 25 study subject datasets the TAEUS investigational device measurement has an R^2&#xD;
      correlation value of 0.61 with MRI measurements of fat fraction. This is particularly&#xD;
      interesting as BMI and abdominal fat thickness were found to have R^2 correlation values with&#xD;
      MRI measures of liver fat of 0.19 and 0.31, respectively.&#xD;
