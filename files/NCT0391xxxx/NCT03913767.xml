      CECIDOC is a prospective, monocentric and observational study comparing the diagnostic&#xD;
      performance of ECG-base triage to a combination of ECG and cardiovascular risk factors for&#xD;
      chest pain triage at ED.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute chest pain triage in the Emergency Department (ED) may prove challenging, since similar&#xD;
      symptoms can reveal both mild or life-threatening disorders, and the clinical presentation&#xD;
      itself is known not to be reliable for evaluating the risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first priority in patients with suspected ACS is to identify those with ST-elevation&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (STEMI), since these patients require urgent reperfusion therapy. Both&#xD;
      European and American cardiology guidelines recommend implementation of a 12-lead&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) within 10 min of arrival in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, in the absence of electrocardiographic changes consistent with ischemia, the ACS&#xD;
      rate is low (1-8% depending on the number of risk factors) , and ACS are associated with&#xD;
      lower in-hospital mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency Department (ED) triage systems for acute chest pain are either based on clinical&#xD;
      features or on a 12-lead ECG. A recent study showed the systems having a similar diagnostic&#xD;
      performance but different characteristics since clinical-based triage had a higher&#xD;
      sensitivity and ECG-based triage had a higher specificity. The lack of sensitivity of ECG&#xD;
      based triage was explained by the fact that patients with a normal or non-ischemic ECG were&#xD;
      assigned to a low-acuity triage score, defined as inadequate (false negative) for ACS&#xD;
      patients. Conversely, the lack of specificity of clinical based triage was due to a large&#xD;
      number of patients with benign pathology assigned to a high-acuity triage score to perform a&#xD;
      12-lead ECG within the 10 minutes after the first medical contact as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore hypothesized that combination of 12-lead ECG and cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factor could increase the sensitivity of ECG based triage for chest pain patients with a&#xD;
      normal or non-ischemic ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consecutive patients above 18 years of age, presenting at ED with acute non-traumatic&#xD;
      chest pain as main complaint will be systematically included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan a prospective, single-center, observational study in a teaching&#xD;
      hospital in Brussels, Belgium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triage of chest pain patients will be performed using the &quot;French Emergency Nurses&#xD;
      Classification version 2&quot; (FRENCH) triage system, which is currently used in our ED. FRENCH&#xD;
      score is a 5-levels triage system classifying patients from category 1 corresponding to the&#xD;
      &quot;immediately life-threatening condition&quot; to category 5 corresponding to the &quot;less or&#xD;
      non-urgent situations&quot;. Maximum authorized waiting period before first medical assessment&#xD;
      according to severity category are respectively: immediate response, 20 minutes, 60 minutes,&#xD;
      120 minutes and undefined. Initial triage of chest pain patients is based on vital signs,&#xD;
      than if normal patients with a normal or unmodified ECG are sorted into category 3, those&#xD;
      with an abnormal ECG without evidence of ischemia are classified into category 2, while those&#xD;
      with ECG showing signs of ischemia (ST elevation, ST depression, new onset of a left bundle&#xD;
      branch block, or T-wave inversions) are classified into category 1. Patients with lateral&#xD;
      chest pain of a probable musculoskeletal nature are sorted into category 4 without performing&#xD;
      an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FRENCH triage (ECG-based triage) will be compared to a modified FRENCH triage system&#xD;
      (ECGScore- based triage) upgrading high-risk patients with a normal ECG from category 3 to&#xD;
      category 2. The investigators defined high-risk patients as patients having a Systemic&#xD;
      Coronary Risk Estimation (SCORE) above 10 % according to the 2016 European Guidelines on&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice. To facilitate calculation of the&#xD;
      SCORE at triage, the investigators defined one major or four minor criteria required to&#xD;
      upgrade the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. History of Cardio-vascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Acute coronary syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Stroke or IAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Arterial revascularization procedure of peripheral artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. End-stage renal disease or dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minor criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Man&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Above 60 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Smoker&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Dyslipidemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above criteria will be collected by the triage nurse using a computerized form designed&#xD;
      for the study. On this basis, the computer will additionally sort the patients using the&#xD;
      modified triage scale, with blinded result avoiding bias in the initial nurse triage. This&#xD;
      modified triage will therefore not be taken into account and management of the patients will&#xD;
      not be modified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical data will also be collected by physicians using a dedicated computerized form,&#xD;
      particularly cardiovascular risks factors and complications occurring during the ED stay&#xD;
      (arrhythmia, heart failure, shock).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final diagnosis will be determined at the end of a 30-day follow-up, by either reviewing&#xD;
      patient's files or a phone call to patients or relatives. ECG interpretation and diagnosis of&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction will be based on the universal definition of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction. Pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection will be substantiated by computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT), chest infection by relevant positive biomarkers and a chest X-ray,&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux by gastroscopy or positive therapeutic test with a proton pump&#xD;
      inhibitor, and abdominal pathology by biology, imaging, or both. Musculoskeletal pain will be&#xD;
      diagnosed if all of the above-mentioned investigations are normal, and movement and palpation&#xD;
      enhanced superficial pain. Finally, patients with a normal physical examination, ECG, chest&#xD;
      X-ray, and blood tests who did not report any event during the 30-day follow-up, and who&#xD;
      therefore have no definite cause for their chest pain, will be sorted into a dedicated group&#xD;
      called 'unclear diagnosis'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local hospital ethics committee approved the study protocol (CEHF 2017/18AOU/407), and&#xD;
      patients will provide their written informed consent to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate triage system's diagnostic performance, the investigators will compare the triage&#xD;
      score of patients with ACS (final diagnosis of STEMI, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction&#xD;
      [NSTEMI] or unstable angina [UA]) to a control group made up of patients with chest pain from&#xD;
      mild severity diseases (including digestive diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD) exacerbation, musculoskeletal chest pain, and all unclear diagnoses without any&#xD;
      medical event in the follow-up period). Patients with other severe diseases, abnormal heart&#xD;
      rate, abnormal blood pressure, respiratory distress, or hypoxemia will be excluded from the&#xD;
      control group having a triage score driven by these conditions rather than by the ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since for ACS most of the arrhythmic events occur within 12 h of symptom onset and ACS&#xD;
      patients should be monitored, the investigators defined for ACS a triage Score of 1 or 2&#xD;
      (high-acuity triage score) as adequate (true positive), and a triage Score of 3, 4, or 5&#xD;
      (low-acuity triage score) as inadequate (false negative). Conversely, for the control group&#xD;
      with mild severity diseases, the investigators defined a triage Score of 1 or 2 (high-acuity&#xD;
      triage score) as inadequate (false positive), and a triage Score of 3, 4 or 5 (low-acuity&#xD;
      triage score) as adequate (true negative). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves&#xD;
      will be generated to assess each triage system's accuracy in classifying a patient in ACS&#xD;
      versus control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Capability of triage nurses to collect cardiovascular risk factors will be assessed comparing&#xD;
      data collected at triage to these collected by the physician in the medical computerized&#xD;
      file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a previous study, FRENCH score AUC under the ROC curve was 0.69. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized a corelation of 0.9 between the two tests. To show a difference of 0.06 between&#xD;
      the AUC of the tests with a power of 0.8 (alpha 0.05) we calculated a sampled size of 233&#xD;
      patients. Given the uncertainty of the correlation, we planned to enrol 500 patients.&#xD;
