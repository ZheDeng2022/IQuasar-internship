  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed in accordance with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regulatory&#xD;
      guidelines, with the aim of characterizing the bioavailability of febuxostat in the two&#xD;
      formulations in healthy adult subjects. Within the clinical portion of the study each subject&#xD;
      will receive a single oral dose of the test and the reference formulation in compliance with&#xD;
      the generated randomization code. The primary study endpoints are the pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      parameters Cmax and AUC0-T of febuxostat.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover, single&#xD;
      dose study design, in which 50 healthy adult subjects will receive one of the study&#xD;
      treatments during each study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the bioequivalence of two different formulations&#xD;
      of febuxostat after a single oral dose administration under fasting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intra-subject variation following a single dose of febuxostat appears to be up to 34% for&#xD;
      Cmax and up to 12% for AUC0-T. Statistically, given that the expected Test to Reference ratio&#xD;
      of geometric LSmeans should fall within 95 and 105%, it is estimated that the lowest number&#xD;
      of subjects to meet the 80 to 125% bioequivalence range with a statistical a priori power of&#xD;
      at least 80% is about 46. Therefore, the inclusion of 50 subjects should be sufficient to&#xD;
      account for the possibility of drop-outs, variations around the estimated intra-subject CV&#xD;
      and to conclude in favor of the hypothesis of bioequivalence with sufficient statistical&#xD;
      power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject eligibility for this study will be determined at the screening visit and eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit at least 10 hours prior to drug&#xD;
      administration for each study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject who withdraws or is withdrawn during the pretrial evaluations but before receiving&#xD;
      the investigational product (IP) will not be considered as a drop-out and will not be&#xD;
      included in the final database. Standbys should be recruited and available to replace any&#xD;
      subject who withdraws prior to the first drug administration. On-study drop-outs will not be&#xD;
      replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altasciences will generate the randomization code with a computer program according to the&#xD;
      study design, the number of subjects and the sequence of treatment administration. The random&#xD;
      allocation of each sequence of treatment administration to each subject will be done in such&#xD;
      a way that the study is balanced. Once generated, the randomization code will be final and&#xD;
      will not be modified. Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment sequences.&#xD;
      There will be two sequences in the study: AB and BA, where A = the test product, B = the&#xD;
      reference product (see detailed description of A and B items in Section &quot;Arms and&#xD;
      Interventions&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each study period, subjects will receive a single 120 mg oral dose of febuxostat (the&#xD;
      test or the reference formulation), with approximately 240 mL of water at ambient&#xD;
      temperature, following a 10-hour overnight fast. The tablet must be swallowed whole and must&#xD;
      not be chewed or broken. Study participants will be aware they will receive different&#xD;
      formulations of the same drug, without being informed which product (Test or Reference) is&#xD;
      being administered. The date and time of each dose will be recorded. For each subject, all&#xD;
      scheduled postdose activities and assessments will be performed relative to the time of study&#xD;
      drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting will continue for at least 4 hours following drug administration, after which a&#xD;
      standardized lunch will be served. A supper and a light snack will be served at appropriate&#xD;
      times thereafter, but not before 9 hours after dosing. Water will be provided as needed until&#xD;
      1 hour predose. Water will be allowed beginning 1 hour after the administration of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each study period, 21 blood samples will be collected for PK assessments. The first blood&#xD;
      sample will be collected prior to drug administration while the others will be collected up&#xD;
      to 36 hours after drug administration. Febuxostat plasma concentrations will be measured by a&#xD;
      validated bioanalytical method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are to be discharged from the clinic after the 36-hour postdose PK sample&#xD;
      collection, and following medical approval. However, they may be advised to stay at the&#xD;
      clinical site for safety reasons, if judged necessary by the physician in charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected terminal elimination half-life observed after a single oral 120 mg dose of&#xD;
      febuxostat film-coated tablets under fasting conditions is 5.1 hours. To avoid any carry-over&#xD;
      effect, a wash-out of 7 calendar days is planned between drug administrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision of which subjects will be included in the PK analysis is to be documented by the&#xD;
      pharmacokineticist (or delegate) and approved by the sponsor before the start of the sample&#xD;
      analysis by the bioanalytical facility. Subjects who are expected to provide evaluable PK&#xD;
      data for both the Test and Reference products (based on viable PK samples) will be included&#xD;
      in the pharmacokinetic analysis. Concentration data of the remaining subjects will be&#xD;
      presented separately. Subjects who do not complete the sampling schedule of one or more study&#xD;
      periods may be included in the PK and statistical analysis and bioequivalence determination&#xD;
      for only the PK parameters that are judged not to be affected by the missing sample(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of Tmax will be based on a non-parametric approach. Statistical analysis&#xD;
      of all other pharmacokinetic parameters will be based on an analysis of variance (ANOVA)&#xD;
      model. Two-sided 90% confidence interval of the ratio of geometric least-squares means&#xD;
      (LSmeans) obtained from the ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical inference of febuxostat will be based on a bioequivalence approach using the&#xD;
      following standards: the ratio of geometric LSmeans with corresponding 90% confidence&#xD;
      interval calculated from the exponential of the difference between the Test and the Reference&#xD;
      for the ln-transformed parameters Cmax and AUC0-T should all be within the 80.00 to 125.00%&#xD;
      bioequivalence range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety population will include all subjects who received at least one dose of one of the&#xD;
      IPs. Safety assessments will include clinical laboratory tests, and adverse event (AE)&#xD;
      monitoring. Additional safety measurements may be performed at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator for reasons related to subject safety. The physician in charge will be present&#xD;
      at the clinical site for at least the first 4 hours following each drug administration and&#xD;
      will remain available at all times throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study duration: up to 35 days (including screening).&#xD;
