  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib works after&#xD;
      radiation therapy in children and young adults with high grade glioma who have a genetic&#xD;
      change called BRAF V600 mutation. Radiation therapy uses high energy rays to kill tumor cells&#xD;
      and reduce the size of tumors. Dabrafenib and trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells&#xD;
      by blocking BRAF and MEK, respectively, which are enzymes that tumor cells need for their&#xD;
      growth. Giving dabrafenib with trametinib after radiation therapy may work better than&#xD;
      treatments used in the past in patients with newly-diagnosed BRAF V600-mutant high-grade&#xD;
      glioma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the event-free survival (EFS) distribution for newly-diagnosed patients with&#xD;
      BRAFV600-mutant high-grade glioma (HGG) without H3 K27M mutations excluding anaplastic&#xD;
      pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (aPXA) and anaplastic ganglioglioma (aGG) treated with&#xD;
      radiation therapy followed by a maintenance combination of dabrafenib mesylate (dabrafenib)&#xD;
      and trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide (trametinib) and to compare this EFS to contemporary&#xD;
      historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the overall survival (OS) distribution for newly-diagnosed patients with&#xD;
      BRAFV600-mutant HGG without H3 K27M mutations excluding aPXA and aGG treated with radiation&#xD;
      therapy followed by a maintenance combination of dabrafenib and trametinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the EFS and overall survival (OS) distribution for newly-diagnosed patients&#xD;
      with BRAFV600E-mutant aPXA and aGG without H3 K27M mutations treated with radiation therapy&#xD;
      followed by a maintenance combination of dabrafenib and trametinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe the EFS and overall survival (OS) distribution for newly-diagnosed patients&#xD;
      with BRAFV600E-mutant HGG including aPXA and aGG with H3 K27M mutations treated with&#xD;
      radiation therapy followed by a maintenance combination of dabrafenib and trametinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To define and evaluate the toxicities of combination therapy with dabrafenib and&#xD;
      trametinib after radiation therapy in newly-diagnosed patients with HGG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To bank tumor specimens and body fluids (blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid) for future&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo standardized local radiation therapy (RT) 5 days a week (Monday-Friday) for&#xD;
      6-7 weeks. Four weeks after completion of RT, patients receive dabrafenib mesylate orally&#xD;
      (PO) twice daily (BID) and trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at disease relapse, every 3&#xD;
      months for year 1, every 4 months for year 2, every 6 months for year 3, then annually for&#xD;
      years 4-5.&#xD;

             biopsy or incomplete resection at diagnosis followed by additional surgery, the date&#xD;
