    <description>Pruritus NRS was an assessment tool that was used to report the intensity of a participant's pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]), higher scores indicated greater severity.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 16 in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI was a validated questionnaire used to measure the impact of AD disease symptoms and treatment on health-related quality of life (QOL). DLQI consisting of a set of 10 questions which assess QOL over the past week. Responses to each questions were assessed on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0 is &quot;not at all&quot; and 3 is &quot;very much&quot;. Scores from all 10 questions added up to give total DLQI scores ranged from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much), higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status which is consists of 2 parts; the descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQVAS). The EQ-5D descriptive system includes 5 dimensions; mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension measured on 3 levels: &quot;no problem&quot; (level 1), &quot;some problems&quot; (level 2), &quot;extreme problems&quot; (level 3). The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5-digit number describing the respondent's health state. The 5 dimensional 3-level systems was converted into single index utility score between 0 to 1 that quantify health status, where 0 represents &quot;death&quot; and 1 represents &quot;perfect health&quot;.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Regular use (more than 2 visits per week) of a tanning booth/parlor within 4 weeks of&#xD;
             the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with a live (attenuated) vaccine within 12 weeks before the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active chronic or acute infection requiring treatment with systemic antibiotics,&#xD;
             antivirals, antiparasitics, antiprotozoals, or antifungals within 2 weeks before the&#xD;
             baseline visit, or superficial skin infections within 1 week before the baseline&#xD;
             visit. NOTE: participants may be rescreened after infection resolves.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected history of immunosuppression, including history of invasive&#xD;
             opportunistic infections (e.g., tuberculosis [TB], histoplasmosis, listeriosis,&#xD;
             coccidioidomycosis, pneumocystosis, aspergillosis) despite infection resolution: or&#xD;
             unusually frequent, recurrent, or prolonged infections, per investigator judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active TB, latent untreated TB or a history of incompletely treated TB or&#xD;
             non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection were excluded from the study unless that was&#xD;
             well documented by a specialist that the participants had adequately treated and could&#xD;
             then start treatment with a biologic agent, in the medical judgment of the&#xD;
             Investigator and/or infectious disease specialist. TB testing would be performed&#xD;
             according to local guidelines if required by regulatory authorities or ethics&#xD;

Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]), higher scores indicated greater severity.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline at Week 16 in Weekly Average of Peak Daily Pruritus NRS</title>
        <description>Pruritus NRS was an assessment tool that was used to report the intensity of a participant's pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]), higher scores indicated greater severity.</description>

Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]), higher scores indicated greater severity.</description>

          <title>Percentage Change From Baseline to Week 2 in Weekly Average of Peak Daily Pruritus NRS</title>
          <description>Pruritus NRS was an assessment tool that was used to report the intensity of a participant's pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]), higher scores indicated greater severity.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status which is consists of 2 parts; the descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQVAS). The EQ-5D descriptive system includes 5 dimensions; mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension measured on 3 levels: &quot;no problem&quot; (level 1), &quot;some problems&quot; (level 2), &quot;extreme problems&quot; (level 3). The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5-digit number describing the respondent's health state. The 5 dimensional 3-level systems was converted into single index utility score between 0 to 1 that quantify health status, where 0 represents &quot;death&quot; and 1 represents &quot;perfect health&quot;.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change in EASI Score From Baseline at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16</title>
        <description>EASI: Measure to assess severity &amp; extent of AD based on 4 AD disease characteristics (erythema, thickness [induration, papulation, edema], scratching [excoriation] &amp; lichenification). Each characteristic was assessed for severity by Investigator/designee on scale of &quot;0&quot; (absent) through &quot;3&quot; (severe) &amp; scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head, trunk, upper &amp; lower extremities). Total score range from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum), higher scores indicated greater severity of AD. Participants with missing EASI Score at each visit were imputed using MI (Multiple Imputation) method.</description>

          <description>EASI: Measure to assess severity &amp; extent of AD based on 4 AD disease characteristics (erythema, thickness [induration, papulation, edema], scratching [excoriation] &amp; lichenification). Each characteristic was assessed for severity by Investigator/designee on scale of &quot;0&quot; (absent) through &quot;3&quot; (severe) &amp; scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head, trunk, upper &amp; lower extremities). Total score range from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum), higher scores indicated greater severity of AD.</description>

        <description>Pruritus NRS was an assessment tool that was used to report the intensity of a participant's pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]), higher scores indicated greater severity. Participants with missing Peak Daily Pruritus NRS Score at each visit were imputed using MI method.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Responded &quot;Absence of Pruritus&quot; or &quot;Mild Pruritus&quot; in the Pruritus Categorical Scale at Week 16</title>
        <description>The pruritus categorical scale was a 4-point scale used to assess symptoms of AD. The scale is rated as follows: 0: absence of pruritus; 1: mild pruritus (occasional slight itching/scratching); 2: moderate pruritus (constant or intermittent itching/scratching that does not disturb sleep) and 3: severe pruritus (bothersome itching/scratching that disturbs sleep), higher scores indicated worse outcome.</description>
