  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During elective surgery, the decision to transfuse a patient to correct anemia or an unstable&#xD;
      hemodynamic state is often determined on a case by case basis according to personal and&#xD;
      hospital transfusion practice. There is wide variability in these practices. Literature&#xD;
      suggests that a restrictive transfusion practice is equivalent, if not better, than a liberal&#xD;
      practice in terms of morbidity and mortality. However, these data may not be generalizable to&#xD;
      specific head, neck, and spine surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the head and neck department of Montpellier University Hospital, the hemorrhagic risk has&#xD;
      not been precisely measured for certain surgical procedures. Thus hemorrhagic risk tends to&#xD;
      be overestimated and unnecessary blood tests tend to be ordered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our single center, retrospective, observational study the investigators will determine the&#xD;
      hemorrhagic risk related to each elective surgical procedure performed in our center. The&#xD;
      investigators will also analyze the transfusion triggers used, and will compare them to&#xD;
      national and international recommendations. The results of this study will inform transfusion&#xD;
      and laboratory practice for patients undergoing head, neck, or spine surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our single center, retrospective, observational study will analyze the transfusion practices&#xD;
      at the Montpellier University Hospital during the perioperative period (defined as 24 hours&#xD;
      before surgery to 48 hours after surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study The aim of the study is to identify the transfusion rate for each surgical&#xD;
      procedure (transfused patients / total number of procedures performed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also allow us:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to identify the hemorrhagic risk related to each surgical procedure performed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to define the triggers for and factors determining transfusions of PRBC and others&#xD;
           bloods products, according to the surgical procedure and to the patient's&#xD;
           caracteristicus;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assessee the quality of transfusion practices according to the national and&#xD;
           international recommendations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the accuracy of the preoperative bleeding risk estimation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to check the traceability of the transfusions in our department;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the length of hospital stay (LOS) and the 30-days outcome of transfused&#xD;
           patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting from these objectives, a model of transfusion management could be defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, requests of pre-transfusion blood test could be limited, reducing the costs associated&#xD;
      with transfusion management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of the population This is an observational monocentric retrospective study. All&#xD;
      the patients undergoing to a scheduled surgical procedure at the Montpellier University&#xD;
      Hospital, head and neck department, between 01-01-2015 and 31-12-2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scheduled surgery will be defined as performed at least 48 hours after the indication&#xD;
      given by the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only exclusion criteria will be age &lt; 18 years and emergency surgery patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data circuit definition All data will come from our computerized medical records. A complete&#xD;
      list of transfused patients for this period will be requested to the hospital transfusion&#xD;
      center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be renamed with a progressive numeric code and the database will be saved&#xD;
      in a password-protected hospital computer. The data will be read and analyzed exclusively on&#xD;
      Montpellier University Hospital's computers by people&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected for each patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Name, hospital ID&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age, sex, weight, height, BMI, ASA classification&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reason for hospitalization, type and day of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emergency surgery during the hospitalisation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Existing co-morbidities (especially liver and coagulation diseases, anemia, chronic&#xD;
           inflammatory bowel diseases and diseases influencing the level of hemoglobin and&#xD;
           coagulation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-aggregating treatments, personal anticoagulants at risk of haemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Basal Hb, Ht, INR, ACT, aPTT, platelets count, fibrinogen, albumin, liver function,&#xD;
           lactate and SvO2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hb, Ht, INR, ACT, aPTT, platelets count, fibrinogen, albumin, liver function, lactate&#xD;
           and SvO2 at the beginning of the surgery, before (period of 30 min) transfusion PRBC and&#xD;
           at the end of procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters and drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs, use of vasoactive drugs at the beginning of the surgery, before (period of&#xD;
           30 min) transfusion PRBC and at the end of procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac events or other incidents before (period of 30 min) transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimated blood loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volume of crystalloids, colloids, labile blood products administered&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimated loss of volume until the end of the surgery (blood loss, Urine, other liquids)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Input-output balance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of: tranexamic acid, PPSB, fibrinogen, Factor VIIa, cryoprecipitate, factor XIII,&#xD;
           cell saver&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Traceability of the transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood transfusions during the follow-up period and reason for transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ICU stay (duration, complications, hours of mechanical ventilation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LOS at the hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality at the hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient 30-day survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of the follow-up is defined by the hospital discharge or by the 30th postoperative&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical management of data&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is observational retrospective, no intervention of the patient will take place,&#xD;
      only descriptive statistical methods will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future development This database could be the basis for a second study, comparing data from&#xD;
      not-transfused patients undergoing to the same surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results could be also at the origin of a prospective randomized controlled study&#xD;
      concerning the transfusion practice in our center.&#xD;
