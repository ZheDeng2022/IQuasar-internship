  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The safety and efficacy of a subdermal implant retrieval device (RemovAid) is investigated in&#xD;
      a population of 25 women seeking removal of their palpable contraceptive implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the device is to evaluate the performance of the device, specifically&#xD;
      its success rate in removing palpable contraceptive implants. The device shall be able to&#xD;
      fixate at least 80% of palpable implants, and successfully remove at least 90% of these&#xD;
      implants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Similar to the REVALID and REVALID02 investigations, the REVALID03 investigation aims to&#xD;
      recruit a total of 25 women with a palpable contraceptive implant due for removal, in order&#xD;
      to obtain at least 20 successful fixations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implant retrieval device aims to standardize and simplify the implant removal procedure.&#xD;
      There is no comparator in the investigation. Descriptive data will be recorded, all recruited&#xD;
      subjects will be exposed to the investigational medical device (IMD) The primary endpoint is&#xD;
      the percentage of fixated implants that are successfully removed without the use of&#xD;
      additional tools.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Although the defined success rate needed for continuation of the investigation was met, due to&#xD;
    the overall low success rate; it was considered, particularly considering the ongoing pandemic,&#xD;
    to discontinue the investigation prematurely.&#xD;
