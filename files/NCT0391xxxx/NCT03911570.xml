  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the symptomatic effects of&#xD;
      crystalline glucosamine sulfate (GS), prescribed for the actually approved indication of knee&#xD;
      OA, in addition to conventional therapy, in comparison to the conventional therapy alone in&#xD;
      patients with primary hand osteoarthritis (HOA).This is a 6-months retrospective comparative&#xD;
      study including patients with concomitant knee and primary HOA, according to the ACR&#xD;
      criteria. To be eligible the patients had to present clinical symptoms of hand OA for at&#xD;
      least 3 months, defined as global hand pain score superior to 40 mm on a 0-100 Visual&#xD;
      Analogue Scale (VAS) and a Functional Index for Hand Osteoarthritis (FIHOA) score of at least&#xD;
      6. Furthermore, the patients have had a radiographic evidence of HOA within the previous 6&#xD;
      months with a Kellgren-Lawrence score of II-III. The participants are stratified into two&#xD;
      groups based on whether or not crystalline GS at the daily dose of 1500 mg was added to the&#xD;
      conventional therapy for HOA, including exercise, acetaminophen and non steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors. Primary outcome&#xD;
      measures are the difference between the two groups in the change of VAS pain and in the&#xD;
      FIHOA, from baseline after 6 months. Secondary outcomes were health assessment questionnaire&#xD;
      (HAQ), medical outcomes study 36-item short form (SF-36) and symptomatic drugs consumption.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Basal time; one month; three months; six months</time_frame>
    <description>The FIHOA score represents a quantitative measure of functional disability of the hands; it contains 10 items and is an investigator-administered questionnaire. Patients are asked to answer each item using a four-point Likert scale: 0 = possible without difficulty, 1 = possible with slight difficulty, 2 = possible with considerable difficulty, 3 = impossible; the range of scores is 0-30 and the highest values indicate the worst functionality. The validate Italian version of FIHOA is used for the present study.</description>

    <measure>Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Basal time; one month; three months; six months</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ is a self administered questionnaire developed to measure disability consisting of 8 sections: dressing arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities and ranging from 0 to 3 with a higher score corresponding to worse disability</description>

    <time_frame>Basal time; one month; three months; six months</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a widely used measure of health and wellbeing, including two main domains, mental and physical component summary (MCS and PCS respectively), that investigates 8 different areas of perceived health, such as physical functioning, physical role, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role and mental health. Scores range from &quot;0 to 100&quot; where &quot;0&quot; indicates the worst condition and &quot;100&quot; indicates the best possible condition</description>

        The participants were stratified into two groups based on whether or not (GS Group and&#xD;
        Control Group) crystalline GS treatment, prescribed for the actually approved indication of&#xD;
        knee OA, was added to the conventional therapy. This stratification was based on regrouping&#xD;
        patients with similar clinical characteristics at baseline.&#xD;
