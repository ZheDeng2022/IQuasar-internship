  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a limited multi-center, Phase II study to evaluate inotuzumab ozogamicin&#xD;
      (Besponsa) in pediatric patients with MRD positive CD22-positive B-lymphoblastic leukemia&#xD;
      (B-ALL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients with newly diagnosed ALL maintain low levels of MRD, despite achieving complete&#xD;
      remission with less than 5% blasts in the bone marrow. Others experience re-emergence of low&#xD;
      level MRD or increasing levels of MRD on therapy or post-transplant. New approaches are&#xD;
      needed to achieve undetectable MRD in these high-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inotuzumab ozogamicin is an antibody-drug conjugate composed of a humanized IgG subtype 4&#xD;
      monoclonal CD22-targeted antibody linked to calicheamicin, a potent anti-tumor antibiotic.&#xD;
      CD22 is expressed in more than 90% of patients with B-cell ALL, making it an attractive&#xD;
      target in this patient population. Inotuzumab ozogamicin has demonstrated exceptional&#xD;
      activity in adults with relapsed or refractory B-ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients with MRD positive CD22+ B-ALL&#xD;
           with 0.1 - 4.99% blasts in bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study the safety of inotuzumab ozogamicin when used in patients with MRD - positive&#xD;
           CD22+ B-ALL with &lt; 5 % blasts in bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the incidence, severity, and outcome of hepatotoxicity and sinusoidal&#xD;
           obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease (SOS/VOD) in patients during inotuzumab&#xD;
           ozogamicin and following subsequent treatment, including hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
           transplant (HSCT).&#xD;

      The drug will be administered intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle.&#xD;
      Patients who do not meet the definition of treatment failure after the first cycle may&#xD;
      receive up to five additional cycles of therapy. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 1 year.&#xD;
