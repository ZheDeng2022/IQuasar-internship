      The present study evaluated the effects of adding whole body vibration to squat training on&#xD;
      the isometric quadriceps muscle strength, the plasma concentration of brain-derived&#xD;
      neurotrophic factor at rest in elderly woman with osteoarthritis of the knee. The eligible&#xD;
      patients were fifteen elderly women ≥ 60 years of age who had been diagnosed with&#xD;
      osteoarthritis of the knee. The intervention consisted of uninterrupted squatting exercises&#xD;
      for 12 weeks, a 3x/week. The exercise protocol was similar in both groups differed only in&#xD;
      the presence of vibration.&#xD;

      Ethical statement: This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the&#xD;
      ethical principles for research involving humans (Resolution 196-96 of the National Health&#xD;
      Council of the Brazilian Ministry of Health) and Federal University of Jequitinhonha and&#xD;
      Mucuri Valleys Ethics Committee. All subjects gave written informed consent in accordance&#xD;
      with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the Federal University of&#xD;
      Jequitinhonha and Mucuri Valleys Ethics Committee (protocol No. 046.08).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a randomized, controlled trial in which the variables were assessed 24 h&#xD;
      before and 24 h after a 12-week training program. For the allocation of participants, a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio randomization was performed using opaque envelopes for allocation concealment. To&#xD;
      minimize the chance of bias, The investigators used the following methods: a) opaque, sealed&#xD;
      and serial-numbered envelopes; b) the envelopes were opened sequentially after the&#xD;
      participant name and details were written on the envelope; c) the envelopes were kept in a&#xD;
      locked and secure place. The allocation sequence was concealed from the researcher enrolling&#xD;
      and assessing participants. Only one researcher performing the randomization was aware of the&#xD;
      group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: The particpants were recruited through the physiotherapy clinic and through medical&#xD;
      referrals. To participate in the study, participants were required to meet the following&#xD;
      inclusion criteria: females older than 65 years of age; not using hormone replacement&#xD;
      therapy; diagnosed with OA in at least one knee in accordance with of the American College of&#xD;
      Rheumatology. The severity of the kOA was classified radiographically according to the&#xD;
      Kellgren and Lawrence scale (grades 0-4, with 0 being normal and 4 representing severe OA). A&#xD;
      Grade 2 classification (definite osteophytes and possible narrowing of joint space) was used&#xD;
      as a cutoff to determine knee OA. Further inclusion criteria included the following: no&#xD;
      recent knee injury; no walking aid requirement; and no rehabilitation procedures in the&#xD;
      previous three months. Participants were excluded if they had any orthopedic, neurological,&#xD;
      respiratory or acute cardiac diseases or if had any cognitive deficit as determined by the&#xD;
      Mini-Mental State Examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the 125 elderly people screened for eligibility, 15 elderly women fulfilled the criteria,&#xD;
      had blood sampling collected at rest (8:00 a.m.) and then participated in the IQMS test.&#xD;
      Thereafter, the participants were allocated to one of two groups: 1) the vibration group, in&#xD;
      which participants performed squat exercise training in association with WBV (VG; n=7); or 2)&#xD;
      the exercise group, in which participants performed squat exercise training without vibration&#xD;
      (EG; n=8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: The clinical and demographic data were collected from the participants using an&#xD;
      evaluation chart. Prior to the initiation of the 12-week intervention program, a blood sample&#xD;
      was collected at 8:00 a.m. from the volunteers of all groups followed by the isometric&#xD;
      quadriceps muscle strength (IQMS) evaluation. At 24 h after the intervention period, the&#xD;
      volunteers of both groups were reassessed. These procedures were performed to avoid any&#xD;
      circadian rhythm effects on hormonal status and the performance of IQMS. The tests were&#xD;
      performed by an experienced examiner who was blind to the group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention program consisted of performing squat exercise training with (VG) or without&#xD;
      (EG) whole body vibration, three times a week on alternate days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Warm-up: Prior to each training session, the participants warmed-up on a stationary cycle at&#xD;
      70% of the predicted maximum heart rate for each subject's age and were monitored using a&#xD;
      Polar heart rate monitor (Polar F4, Kempele, Finland) for 10 minutes. Immediately afterwards,&#xD;
      the participants of the VG group were placed in a position with their feet 28 cm apart (14 cm&#xD;
      to the right and 14 cm to the left of the center of the vibration stimulus) and were ready to&#xD;
      begin the squat exercises on the vibratory platform, while the participants of the EG group&#xD;
      performed the same procedure without vibration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Squat exercises: The intensity of squat exercise training was systematically augmented in the&#xD;
      vibration and exercise groups over the training period by increasing the number of&#xD;
      repetitions (6 x 20 seconds to 8 x 40 seconds) and reducing the resting time (40 to 25&#xD;
      seconds). During each exercise repetition, the examiner instructed the volunteer to perform 3&#xD;
      seconds of isometric flexion of the quadriceps at 60º and 3 seconds of isometric flexion of&#xD;
      the quadriceps at 10º. The 60º angle was measured in each volunteer using a universal&#xD;
      goniometer prior to initiating the exercise series, and a barrier was placed at the gluteal&#xD;
      region to limit the degree of flexion of the knee. The participants of both groups were&#xD;
      placed in position with their feet 28 cm apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole body vibration: For the participants in the VG group, a commercial model of a vibration&#xD;
      platform was used (FitVibe, GymnaUniphy NV, Bilzen, Belgium). In this group, acceleration was&#xD;
      also increased by varying the vibration frequency (35-40 Hz). The mechanical stimulation&#xD;
      parameters of the vibration consisted of the following: frequency of 35 to 40 Hz, an&#xD;
      amplitude of 4 mm and acceleration that ranged from 2.78 to 3.26 G. The platform provided a&#xD;
      vertical sinusoidal vibration. Prior to initiating data collection, the platform acceleration&#xD;
      values were verified using the Mega accelerometer (Acceleration Measuring Kit ZPP1-3D-147BC,&#xD;
      Southampton, United Kingdom).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure acceleration on the horizontal and vertical axes, two accelerometers (Acceleration&#xD;
      Measuring Kit ZPP1-3D-147BC, Southampton, United Kingdom) were fixed at a distance of 14 cm&#xD;
      from the center of platform vibration. The signal was amplified electronically and was&#xD;
      stored. This signal was obtained at a frequency of 1000 Hz and was sent for computer&#xD;
      analysis. Each accelerometer was calibrated using two calibration points and applying zero&#xD;
      and gravity, Earth's gravity is 1 G (9.81 m/s2). To obtain the true acceleration values of&#xD;
      the platform, the values of Earth's gravity were subtracted along the vertical axis from the&#xD;
      total signal received so that the acceleration of the platform would begin at 0 m/s2. The&#xD;
      data were transferred to a computer using the Megawin software program, and the mean and&#xD;
      maximum acceleration of each sample on each axis were analyzed using the Matlab software&#xD;
      program. Each frequency used was measured over 60 seconds. In the pilot study, interexaminer&#xD;
      reliability was found to be high, with a coefficient of variation of 1.05%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants underwent training on the vibratory platform with barefoot to avoid any&#xD;
      damping effect due to different footwear. In addition, a predetermined distance from the feet&#xD;
      (14cm to the right and 14cm to the left of the vibration center of the platform) was set to&#xD;
      ensure that each of the lower limbs received the same amount of vibration stimulus. Moreover,&#xD;
      with the aim of maintaining control of the body's center of gravity behind the base of the&#xD;
      support, the positioning of the spine, arms, and head and the type of squat (simulating the&#xD;
      motion of sitting in a chair) were standardized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isometric quadriceps muscle strength (IQMS): The IQMS was evaluated by the maximal voluntary&#xD;
      isometric contraction of knee extensors (MVIC) measured using the load cell. For this&#xD;
      evaluation, the participant was positioned in a flexion-extension chair (Home Sport, Master&#xD;
      Top model, Belo Horizonte, Brazil) and assumed a sitting posture with a straight trunk and&#xD;
      the hips flexed at 90º. The limb to be tested was positioned at 60° of knee flexion (assessed&#xD;
      individually by goniometry of the knee), and the resistance lever was positioned on the&#xD;
      distal leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The load cell was properly calibrated and positioned near the leg extension perpendicular to&#xD;
      the ground for signal acquisition during the isometric muscle strength tests (Miotec -&#xD;
      Biomedical Equipment, Porto Alegre, Brazil). The load cell was connected to the software&#xD;
      MIOTOOL 400 that transmitted the isometric muscle strength values to a computer. The MVIC&#xD;
      test was performed for 6 seconds with 1 minute between sets and with repeating three sets per&#xD;
      leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the test, the participants warmed up for 10 minutes on a stationary bicycle (Stone&#xD;
      Fitness, 2001, Huntertown, United State), which stimulated the heart rate (HR) to 70% of the&#xD;
      estimated maximum HR by age, as measured with the use of the Polar heart monitors (Polar F4,&#xD;
      Kempele, Finland). This procedure was performed to reduce the risk of injury during testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for IQMS was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.94-0.99).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of BDNF by ELISA: For plasma processing, 10-mL peripheral blood samples were&#xD;
      collected from the antecubital vein using aseptic techniques and heparin as an anticoagulant.&#xD;
      The blood was immediately centrifuged twice at 3,000 g for 10 min, and the plasma was kept&#xD;
      frozen at -70º C until assayed. Plasma BDNF levels were measured in duplicate using ELISA&#xD;
      kits for BDNF (BDNF DuoSet, R&amp;D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions; the&#xD;
      detection limit was 10 pg/mL.&#xD;
