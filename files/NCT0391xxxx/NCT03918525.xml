  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pandemic of diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate. The prevalence of diabetes has&#xD;
      risen in India by 123% over the last decade. In 1990, diabetes was not considered an&#xD;
      important contributor to mortality in India but in 2013, it is ranked as the eighth most&#xD;
      common cause of deaths in adult Indian population. There is now a growing understanding that&#xD;
      diabetes runs in families and has a significant genetic basis. In this regard, it is&#xD;
      noteworthy that from an ethnographic standpoint, Sindhi population in India has been both&#xD;
      genetically and environmentally at an increased risk of stress, hypertension and&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases. Considering the nexus of metabolic diseases that include&#xD;
      hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia and diabetes it is therefore expected that this&#xD;
      population may be at an increased risk of these metabolic conditions. However, exact&#xD;
      prevalence of contributors to type 2 diabetes in the Sindhi population is unknown. The&#xD;
      proposed study will estimate prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Sindhi families of Nagpur. Both&#xD;
      the PIs have extensive experience with family studies which includes construction of&#xD;
      pedigrees, using variance components methods, dissecting out genetic and environmental&#xD;
      components of diseases and association of critical phenotypic traits with disease. The&#xD;
      proposed study will tap this resource with a focus on the Sindhi families of Nagpur which are&#xD;
      concentrated in the Jaripatka and Khamla areas. This study will exploit the current&#xD;
      infrastructure in the Lata Medical Research Foundation to access these families and conduct a&#xD;
      first-of-its-kind study in India. It is expected that this study will pave way for more&#xD;
      extensive genetic, epigenetic and environmental studies of this population. It will also&#xD;
      foster future collaborations with national and international health agencies. In that vein,&#xD;
      the DISFIN pilot study represents the first step towards identification, quantification,&#xD;
      prevention and control of type 2 diabetes in central India.&#xD;

      At each Participant Recruitment Center:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We announced the dates of recruitment locally through pamphlet distribution, personal&#xD;
           conversations, emails and a study website to the residents of the study areas. When the&#xD;
           participants came in for the study, they were first administered the informed consent&#xD;
           form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Upon receiving such consent a Field Research Officer (FRO) appointed specifically for&#xD;
           the study collected the demographic data and conduct anthropometric measurements. All&#xD;
           the data has been directly input into a cloud-based database through tablet computers&#xD;
           made available to the FROs for the purpose of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A trained nurse then measured the blood pressure of the participant as follows: These&#xD;
           measurements were conducted using a random-zero sphygmomanometer on the left arm. To&#xD;
           account for the potential variability in the blood pressure measurements, we measured&#xD;
           the blood pressure thrice with 5-minute intervals but use the average of the last two&#xD;
           readings as the phenotypic trait value. Appearance of the first Korotkov sound and&#xD;
           disappearance of the fifth Korotkov sound was considered as the systolic and diastolic&#xD;
           blood pressures, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Thereafter the participant were under electrocardiographic evaluation. The examination&#xD;
           was conducted by a trained ECG technician using a portable ECG machine with limb leads,&#xD;
           chest leads and augmented leads. The signal recordings were digitized and stored as&#xD;
           digital signal files. Novacode software was used to quantitatively measure important&#xD;
           phenotypic traits from the ECG signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The participant then proceeded to measurement of random blood glucose using a glucometer&#xD;
           and disposable test strip. The results are shared with the participant as well as&#xD;
           entered directly into the cloud-based database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Then the participant were given a urine sample collection cup. The urine sample was used&#xD;
           to estimate urine sugar and microalbuminuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The participant were then given an appointment for fasting blood studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. On the day of the appointment, a trained laboratory technician appointed for the purpose&#xD;
           of the study drew 10 ml of venous blood from the ante-cubital vein. This blood sample&#xD;
           will be used for lipid profile studies (total and free serum cholesterol, serum&#xD;
           triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, very low-density&#xD;
           lipoproteins and apolipoproteins), fasting plasma glucose, serum cotinine (to&#xD;
           corroborate the history of smoking), serum creatinine (to quantify urinary dilution),&#xD;
           serum C peptide (to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes), plasma insulin and&#xD;
           serum HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To maximize participation for the fasting blood studies, we sent text reminders to&#xD;
           participants before the date of appointment. If the participant cannot make it on the&#xD;
           day of appointment then we again sent text and/or telephonic reminders to them for a&#xD;
           revised appointment date. We did this for a total of three times before the reminders&#xD;
           can be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. If the participants were diagnosed with any medical condition during the examination&#xD;
           then they were duly referred to expert medical help outside of the DISFIN study. If the&#xD;
           participant was newly diagnosed as a case of T2D during study the participant was&#xD;
           referred to expert diabetologist in the city for further medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Lastly, we provided a nominal time compensation for each participant who completed all&#xD;
           the study procedures.&#xD;
