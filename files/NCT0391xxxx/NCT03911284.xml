  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Learning Registry is a retrospective, exempt study. Researchers form the Duke Clinical&#xD;
      Research Institute (DCRI) will utilize de-identified data managed by Cerner for population&#xD;
      health analytics as part of a ongoing registry of patients with atherosclerotic&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerner is an electronic health record company utilized by a large number of health systems in&#xD;
      the United States. As part of their services to the health systems that they work with, they&#xD;
      have created platform for population health management called HealtheIntent. HealtheIntent&#xD;
      uses individual data from patients at a health system collected through the EMR as well as&#xD;
      other data streams in the health system (i.e. cost data), aggregates the data, and stores it&#xD;
      on an Amazon Web Services cloud, accessible to both Cerner and the health systems, to perform&#xD;
      large scale population health analytics. These data may be linked as well by Cerner to the&#xD;
      National Death Index or other data sources depending on the individual relationship with the&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this retrospective study, the Study Start Date is the date contracts were executed;&#xD;
      Primary Completion Date is the date the final dataset is available for analysis and&#xD;
      manuscript development; Study Completion Date is the date the study is completed. Enrollment&#xD;
      is the number of patient charts reviewed.&#xD;

      DCRI will utilize data on patients with ASCVD from the Cerner's health systems who have&#xD;
      agreed to participate in the Learning Registry. Cerner will de-identify the data and place it&#xD;
      into a cloud-based server hosted by Amazon Web Services that is password-protected and&#xD;
      accessible only to DCRI researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research goals for the Learning Registry are,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate treatment patterns and gaps in care for patients with atherosclerotic&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Across adults with ASCVD, treatment patterns for those groups will be evaluated,&#xD;
           including aspirin, beta blockers, ace inhibitors, P2Y12 inhibitors, statins, and other&#xD;
           antithrombotics. Factors associated with appropriate therapy use will be assessed,&#xD;
           including patient level factors (age, race, sex, insurance status), clinical factors&#xD;
           (type of ASCVD, comorbidities including kidney disease, atrial fibrillation,&#xD;
           hypertension, diabetes, duration since last event), and system level factors (type of&#xD;
           provider seen, frequency of contact with the healthcare system). Stratified analyses&#xD;
           will include, but is not limited to, adults with PAD and adults who would have been&#xD;
           eligible for the COMPASS trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Estimate the attributable risk of modifiable risk factors on recurrent cardiovascular&#xD;
           events in adults with established ASCVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who present with myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, and TIA will be&#xD;
      identified. Those who have been previously seen in the outpatient setting will be evaluated&#xD;
      for the presence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease to identify those with CVD prior to&#xD;
      their event. Risk factor control prior to the event will be assessed. The amount of disease&#xD;
      potentially preventable by risk factor control, as well as utilization of novel secondary&#xD;
      preventive therapies including rivaroxaban will be evaluated.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adults 18 and older For the overall ASCVD population, diagnose codes for&#xD;
             cardiopulmonary disease, including disease of the pulmonary circulation, cardiac&#xD;
             disease, and vascular disease will be used to identify the population to be&#xD;
             de-identified. At MU, this will include patients back to 2012, and at Seton this will&#xD;
             include patients back to 2014, which reflect dates of data availability at each health&#xD;
             system. For both institutions, data collection for patients identified will stop at&#xD;
             the end of 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the chart review population, patients with hospitalization for cerebrovascular disease&#xD;
        (e.g. stroke/TIA), coronary heart disease (i.e. myocardial infarction), and peripheral&#xD;
        vascular disease (e.g. limb ischemia) will be eligible.&#xD;
