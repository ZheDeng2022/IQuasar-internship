  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol for compassionate use combines 2 different ways of fighting disease: antibodies&#xD;
      and T cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers, and&#xD;
      both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most patients. This&#xD;
      protocol combines both T cells and antibodies to create a more effective treatment. The&#xD;
      investigational treatment is called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells&#xD;
      targeted against the CD30 antigen (ATLCAR.CD30) administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies have shown that a new gene can be put into T cells and will increase their&#xD;
      ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The new gene that is put in the T cells in this&#xD;
      study makes a piece of an antibody called anti-CD30. This antibody sticks to leukemia cells&#xD;
      because they have a substance on the outside of the cells called CD30. For this protocol, the&#xD;
      anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood part of it&#xD;
      is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called&#xD;
      a chimeric receptor. These CD30 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to&#xD;
      kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of&#xD;
      fighting the cancer are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this protocol is to treat a single patient with a second dose of&#xD;
      ATLCAR.CD30 T cells.&#xD;

      Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will receive a lymphodepleting regimen of bendamustine 70mg/m2/day over 3&#xD;
      consecutive days and fludarabine 30mg/m2/day over 2 consecutive days. Bendamustine and&#xD;
      fludarabine will be administered concomitantly. Dose reduction of bendamustine may occur per&#xD;
      treating physician discretion based on prior toxicities and the clinical status of the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of ATLCAR.CD30 T cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post lymphodepletion, if the patient meets eligibility criteria for cellular therapy, then&#xD;
      will receive ATLCAR.CD30 T cells within 2-14 days after completing the pre-conditioning&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen. We will administer ATLCAR.CD30 T cells post lymphodepletion at a dose&#xD;
      of 2 x 10^8 cells/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy under this compassionate use protocol involves 1 infusion of ATLCAR.CD30 cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be followed for up to 15 years for replication-competent retrovirus&#xD;
      evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

             have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. The two birth control methods can be&#xD;
             composed of: two barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent&#xD;
