      The study will be to demonstrate that, in patients undergoing elective thoracic surgery, lung&#xD;
      ultrasound (LUS) in OR is more sensitive, specific and accurate method than thoracic&#xD;
      auscultation, for the evaluation of OLV. The aim of the study is to demonstrate how lung&#xD;
      ultrasound can be considered an attractive alternative to the routine use of&#xD;
      fiberbronchoscope as a first line diagnostic tool to verify the correct position of left&#xD;
      double lumen tube.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most procedures in thoracic surgery require exclusion from ventilation of the lung undergoing&#xD;
      surgery. One-lung ventilation (OLV), it is obtained mainly through the placement of a&#xD;
      bi-lumen tube (DLT) in the patient's airway. A frequent complication that occurs during OLV&#xD;
      it's unrecognized bad positioning of the DLT which can lead to serious complications such as&#xD;
      hypoventilation, hypoxemia, not optimal collapse of the operated lung and damage to the&#xD;
      trachea or main bronchi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latest SIAARTI recommendations (2009) advocate in all patients use of fiberbronchoscope&#xD;
      (FOB) to control and correct the positioning of the DLT (gold standard) after the orotracheal&#xD;
      intubation and after the positioning in lateral decubitus. The usual clinical practice&#xD;
      expects to performing lung exclusion tests by auscultation of the 2 hemithorax in succession.&#xD;
      But the scientific evidence shows how this practice has a poor sensitivity and specificity in&#xD;
      assessing the correct positioning of the left DLT (LDLT). From literature, as from everyday&#xD;
      clinical experience, it is known that FBS cannot always be performed Finally, the research&#xD;
      wants to shed light how the fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FBS) is an invasive maneuver that is not&#xD;
      free from serious complications (mucosal lesions and infections).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound (US) over the last 15 years has made an important contribution to the assessment&#xD;
      and management of the airways. US quickly and effectively are able to show the excursion of&#xD;
      the diaphragm and pleura, qualitative and quantitative indicators of lung expansion. If the&#xD;
      endotracheal tube is in the correct position, a bilateral and symmetrical movement of the&#xD;
      domes of each hemi-diaphragm (B-Mode and M-mode) can be appreciated, while in the intercostal&#xD;
      window, the so-called &quot;lung-sliding&quot; will be visible. In the absence of ventilation, the&#xD;
      diaphragmatic excursion and the &quot;lung-sliding&quot; will not be detectable in the explored&#xD;
      hemi-thorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although FBS remains the gold standard for controlling the correct position of LDLT under&#xD;
      thoracic anesthesia, and is often crucial as a guide to its repositioning, from the&#xD;
      researchers point of view, the use of FOB may not be routinely necessary in all patients, but&#xD;
      its use could be reserved for selected cases in which the positioning itself is difficult or&#xD;
      in case of intraoperative displacement. Primary objective is to demonstrate how, in patients&#xD;
      undergoing elective thoracic surgery, lung ultrasound (LUS) to the operating room is a more&#xD;
      sensitive, specific and accurate method than thoracic auscultation, for the evaluation of&#xD;
      OLV. LUS is a non-invasive, safe and free from side effects technique that can be performed&#xD;
      at the patient's bed. The study aims to demonstrate how LUS can be considered an attractive&#xD;
      alternative to the routine use of FOB as a first line diagnostic tool to verify the correct&#xD;
      position of LDLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each surgical procedure 3 researchers will participate, each with a specific independent&#xD;
      role: the auscultation researcher (AR), which will have the task of performing the&#xD;
      oral-tracheal intubation and auscultation with phonendoscope pre-and post-induction of&#xD;
      general anesthesia and after positioning the patient in lateral decubitus; the ultrasound&#xD;
      researcher (UR), i.e. the anesthesiologist who will perform the pre- and post-induction of&#xD;
      the AG ultrasound evaluation and after positioning the patient in lateral decubitus; the&#xD;
      Fiberscope Researcher (FR), whom will perform the fibrobroncoscopic verification of the LDLT&#xD;
      at the end of the clinical and ultrasound assessment and after the positioning in lateral&#xD;
      position. He will reposition the endotracheal tube in case of mal positioning or&#xD;
      intra-operative displacement of the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon the arrival of the patients in the operating room, and after applying the standard&#xD;
      operative monitoring for the planned surgery, the AR will perform a preliminary thoracic&#xD;
      auscultation, in order to verify the presence of normal lung sounds in spontaneous breathing.&#xD;
      The UR will perform a preliminary thoracic ultrasound scanning, in order to verify the&#xD;
      presence of long sliding (LS) and diaphragmatic displacement (DD). Then, after the&#xD;
      positioning of adequate venous accesses and eventually a medium-thoracic peridural catheter,&#xD;
      AR will proceed to induce general anesthesia. Patients will undergo video-thoracoscopy or&#xD;
      thoracotomy operations that require mono-pulmonary ventilation (OLV) for each part or for the&#xD;
      entire duration of the operation. The choice of the appropriate LDLT size will be made on the&#xD;
      basis of Brodsky's anthropometric criteria. After sedation and curarization, direct&#xD;
      laryngoscopy will be performed with a Macintosh blade and patients will be intubated with a&#xD;
      left bi-lumen (LDLT) Carlens or Robertshaw tube by the AR, after that he will also perform&#xD;
      auscultation. After inflating the tracheal cuff and verifying the symmetricity of the&#xD;
      vesicular murmure on both pulmonary fields in two pre-established points per side (apex =&#xD;
      II-III intercostal space on the hemiclavicular; base = V intercostal space on the middle&#xD;
      axilla), the bronchial cuff will be inflated and the auscultation repeated by first clamping&#xD;
      the tracheal lumen and then the bronchial lumen. If the LDLT is correctly positioned the MV&#xD;
      will be present at the apex and base of the ventilated lung and absent in the contralateral&#xD;
      points of the excluded lung. Otherwise the LDLT will be considered wrongly positioned and the&#xD;
      AR will have 3 attempts to reposition the device. The AR will record the results of the&#xD;
      verification carried out on the CRF and will leave its role in the OR at the UR. The latter,&#xD;
      using a 6-13 MHz linear ultrasound probe, will evaluate, in B-mode and M-mode, the presence /&#xD;
      absence of the LS and the LP at the level of the II-III intercostal space on the&#xD;
      hemiclavicular, while with a convex ultrasound probe 3,5-5 MHz placed orthogonally to the&#xD;
      costal arch on the anterior axillary line, the diaphragmatic displacement will be searched&#xD;
      and measured. The bi-lumen tube will be considered correctly positioned in the presence of LS&#xD;
      and DD in the ventilated lung and in their absence in the excluded lung. Otherwise the LDLT&#xD;
      will be considered wrongly positioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UR will record the results of the verification carried out on the CRF and will leave its&#xD;
      position in the operating room at the FR. Finally, the correct positioning of the LDLT will&#xD;
      be verified with FOB from the FR and eventually repositioned. The bronchoscope will be&#xD;
      introduced into the tracheal lumen and get throw until it reaches just beyond the tracheal&#xD;
      hole. The correct vision foresees: the carena on the sagittal plane and on the right the&#xD;
      orifice of the right main bronchus, while on the left, the dome of the bronchial cap&#xD;
      occupying the orifice of the left main bronchus. The final judgment of the FR will be:&#xD;
      &quot;correct positioning&quot;, &quot;malposition&quot;, &quot;critical malposition&quot;. Each researcher will not know&#xD;
      the outcome of the verification carried out by the other 2 researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the correct positioning of the LDLT has been verified, if necessary by the surgical&#xD;
      requirements, the patient will be placed in lateral position and a new pulmonary exclusion&#xD;
      test will be performed. AR, UR and FR will perform again the lung test exclusion, reporting&#xD;
      in the CFR the results of the new evaluations. These assessments will be made by the same&#xD;
      researchers who performed the previous assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intra-operative phase the ventilation and maintenance of general anesthesia will&#xD;
      be set according to the standard clinical practice and data will be reported in the&#xD;
      appropriate section of the CFR concerning vital and ventilation parameters, the time required&#xD;
      for pulmonary exclusion tests, any displacement of the LDLT and any surgical and non-surgical&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the surgical procedure, after optimization of the analgesia and according to&#xD;
      the patient's needs, the patient will be extubated in the operating room or transfered in the&#xD;
      the post-operative intensive care unit. The collection of clinical data will continue in the&#xD;
      post-operative period until the hospital discharge of the patient enrolled in the study.&#xD;
