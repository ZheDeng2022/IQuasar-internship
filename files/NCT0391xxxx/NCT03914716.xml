  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemophilia is a genetic condition characterized by marked phenotypic heterogeneity. Bleeding&#xD;
      into a joint is the single most important risk factor for the development of hemophilic&#xD;
      arthropathy (HA). It is thought that clinical and imaging manifestations of HA are at least&#xD;
      partially attributable to genetic polymorphisms unrelated to the hemophilia genotype.&#xD;
      Identifying and characterizing biologic factors that could explain differences in&#xD;
      susceptibility to joint degeneration of patients with hemophilia would help stratify patients&#xD;
      according to the risk of degeneration of their joints and develop personalized therapeutic&#xD;
      and prophylactic strategies. This study is conducted in China.&#xD;

      This will be a 3-year prospective cohort study conducted in a single centre (Beijing&#xD;
      Children's Hospital, BCH, China) with a 2-year follow-up of patients Index joints (ankles,&#xD;
      elbows and knees) of young Chinese boys with hemophilia A will be evaluated as follows:&#xD;
      physical examination every 6 months using the Hemophilia Joint Health Score [HJHS],&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging (gray-scale and color Doppler ultrasound [US]), and by laboratory (serum)&#xD;
      at baseline, at 6, and 24 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of index joints will&#xD;
      be obtained at baseline, and 24 months. Features that will be captured either quantitatively&#xD;
      or semantically in the imaging scans will be aggregated to generate &quot;imaging phenotypes&quot;&#xD;
      which will be associated with clusters of co-expressed genes (metagenes) and clinical data.&#xD;
