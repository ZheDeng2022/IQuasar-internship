    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to detect changes in the dopamine system in the brain of&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia, especially when pretreated with antipsychotic medication. Here,&#xD;
      the investigators want to find out whether the treatment with these drugs can cause permanent&#xD;
      changes in docking points (receptors) of dopamine in the brain. It will be examined whether&#xD;
      number and response of dopamine receptors is altered, which are associated with the onset of&#xD;
      psychotic symptoms. For this purpose, a single PET/MR measurement will be performed in all&#xD;
      participants. In total 140 volunteers, consisting of 30 healthy volunteers, 20 first-episode,&#xD;
      drug-naive patients with schizophrenia and 90 pretreated patients with schizophrenia will be&#xD;
      included over a time period of three years. In addition, the influence of nicotine&#xD;
      consumption on dopamine receptors will be invesitgated by comparing data from smoking and&#xD;
      non-smoking patients. In clinical practice, an elevation of dopamine action caused by&#xD;
      alterations in receptors in the brain is of most importance. This may be the reason why the&#xD;
      treatment with antipsychotic agents does not work in some patients. In addition, a permanent&#xD;
      elevation of dopamine action is associated with permanent brain alterations by these drugs.&#xD;
      The result can contribute to work out valuable indications, whether it makes sense to&#xD;
      continue a long term therapy with antipsychotic drugs in a patient. But also the in-depth&#xD;
      understanding of the impact of nicotine on the course of therapy can help to open up&#xD;
      possibilities for improved drug treatment.&#xD;

      This project will study for the first time in humans, whether long-term treatment with&#xD;
      antipsychotic agents, representing nowadays gold standard for patients with schizophrenia,&#xD;
      may lead to an up regulation of dopamine D2-like receptors and associated, a supersensitivity&#xD;
      of these receptors. The detection of such changes and the study of influencing factors (in&#xD;
      particular smoking and type of medication) are most important for the understanding of&#xD;
      relapse risks, development of treatment resistance and the risks for motor complications of&#xD;
      antipsychotic pharmacotherapy. This monocentric, controlled study will include 140&#xD;
      participants over a time period of three years. 30 healthy volunteers, 20 first-episode,&#xD;
      drug-naive patients with schizophrenia and 90 pretreated patients with schizophrenia will&#xD;
      undergo a single PET/MR measurement.&#xD;
