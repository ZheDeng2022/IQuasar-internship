  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MyPKFiT is a web-based application recently developed by Baxalta for the use in patients&#xD;
      treated with Advate. MyPkFit has its basis in Bayesian forecasting, which allows estimation&#xD;
      of individual PK parameters by a sparse sampling schedule, where only 2-3 samples are taken&#xD;
      between 4 and 48 hours post infusion. With myPKFiT, it will, therefore, be possible to define&#xD;
      an individual PK curve for each patient based on just a few sampling points and hence, taking&#xD;
      the bleeding phenotype and the life style into account, potentially adjust the prophylactic&#xD;
      treatment accordingly to optimize cost-effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As detailed in brief summary patients will, after accurate information verbally and written&#xD;
      according to ethics approval, report bleeding events during previous 6 months. Blood samples&#xD;
      are taken, FVIII analyzed (Advate patients) and the individual PK curve determined using&#xD;
      MyPKFit. The curve will be discussed together with the patient and levels related to bleed&#xD;
      events determined. If needed dose adjustment is done based on the curve. After a further 6&#xD;
      month follow-up bleeds will again be evaluated as well as factor consumption. In this way a&#xD;
      better personalized treatment based on PK and clinical phenotype will hopefully be achieved.&#xD;
