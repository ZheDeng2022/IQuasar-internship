      In this study to planned to research the efficacy of low-flow anesthesia on patients&#xD;
      undergoing sleeve gastrectomy due to morbid obesity on respiratory functions after surgery by&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Morbid obese patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy due to morbid obesity after 01.01.2019&#xD;
      will be randomly divided into 2 groups with controls. To prevent selection bias in the study,&#xD;
      numbers will be produced at random. The produced numbers will be determined as 0: control and&#xD;
      1: experiment groups and patients will be divided into groups as such. Random numbers will be&#xD;
      generated by the MedCalc 18.2.1. program (MedCalc Statistical Software MedCalc Software bvba,&#xD;
      Ostend, Belgium; http://www.medcalc.org; 2018). Group 1 is determined as patients to be&#xD;
      administered high-flow anesthesia, while Group 2 will be administered low-flow anesthesia.&#xD;
      After anesthesia induction, Group 1 will have 4 liters/minute (50% O2 50%) flow administered,&#xD;
      while patients in Group 2 will have 1 liter/minute (50% O2, 50% air) flow administered. The&#xD;
      study included adult patients who signed the voluntary consent form aged from 18-65 years,&#xD;
      American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) III, and body mass index (BMI) &gt;40. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria for the study are no alcohol or drug addiction or diagnosis of chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD) during routine preoperative assessment by chest diseases, FEV1/FVC&#xD;
      ratio, FEV1 and FVC values within normal limits and no previous abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those with stop-bang score below 4 will be included in the study. On the day of surgery, all&#xD;
      patients had FEV1, FVC value and FEV1/FVC ratio examined by a single anesthesia technician&#xD;
      using a manual RST device without the knowledge of the anesthesia expert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure tests and calibration of the anesthesia device is performed each morning for every&#xD;
      surgery. After calibration the mechanical ventilator alarm limits for ins O2 are lower limit&#xD;
      40%, EtCO2 35-45 mmHg, min Vol (tidal volume in 1 min x frequency) according to the patient ±&#xD;
      0.5. After patient is placed on the operating table in ramp position, all patients are&#xD;
      monitored with triple route ECG, pulse oximetry and pressure cuff. The clinical protocol for&#xD;
      all patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy includes BIS (bispectral index) and TOF (train of&#xD;
      four) monitoring. Before beginning induction, first 3 mg midazolam and fentanyl 150 mvq IV&#xD;
      were administered. According to ideal weight and BIS score for 40-60, 2-5 mg propofol and 0.5&#xD;
      mg rocuronium according to true weight were administered. Patients were ventilated with 6&#xD;
      L/min 60% O2 for 2 minutes. Patients were endotracheally intubated with a Macintosh&#xD;
      laryngoscope. In addition to assessment of respiratory sounds linked to obesity with&#xD;
      auscultation, EtCO2 capnography was used to confirm the efficacy of intubation. After&#xD;
      intubation 50 mg ranitidine and 8 mg ondansetron were routinely administered. Fixing the&#xD;
      remifentanil dose to 0.1 mcg/kg/min, infusion was administered. Sevoflurane percentage was&#xD;
      changed to ensure MAC (minimum alveolar concentration of 0.6-1.1 for BIS score of 40-60 for&#xD;
      maintenance. During ventilation in PRVC mode, Group 1 had 4 liter/minute (50% O2, 50% air)&#xD;
      flow administered, while Group 2 had 3 L/min 4% for Sevoflurane the first 3 minutes as&#xD;
      wash-in. Then flow was administered at 1 L/min (50% O2, 50% air). According to ideal weight,&#xD;
      mechanical ventilator settings were 6-10 ml tidal volume, frequency 12/min (increasing, if&#xD;
      necessary, for etCO2 35-45 mmHg), PEEP 5-10 cm/H2O and inspirium/expirium ratio ½. In Group&#xD;
      1, sevoflurane percentage was set to correlate with BIS monitoring. In Group 2, after&#xD;
      intubation the sevoflurane percentage was set to a higher percentage to reach the desired MAC&#xD;
      value. Every 5 minutes during surgery, MAC, BIS, mean arterial pressure, peak heart rate,&#xD;
      sPO2, etCO2, inSO2, frequency and PEEP values were recorded. In Group 2, 5 minutes before the&#xD;
      end of surgery, flow was increased from 1 L to 4 L for wash-out. Both groups had remifentanil&#xD;
      ended 10 minutes before the end of surgery. Later 1 g paracetamol and 100 mg tramadol IV were&#xD;
      administered. Five minutes before the end of the operation patient-controlled SIMV+VE mode&#xD;
      with trigger setting of 6 was organized. At the end of surgery, patients were administered 2&#xD;
      mg/kg sugammadex according to ideal weight. When the patients trigger setting reaches muscle&#xD;
      power it was lowered to zero. When trigger is zero and there is sufficient tidal volume to&#xD;
      reach TOF (train of four) value &gt;90% and BIS score is 80-100, patients were extubated. They&#xD;
      were sent to the recovery room. In recovery the ARISCAT risk index was calculated. Later when&#xD;
      modified Aldrete scoring system is ≥9, patients were sent to the ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, mobilization and respiratory physiotherapy were provided in the 2nd hour.&#xD;
      Vital signs including mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded in the postoperative period&#xD;
      with 20 mg tenoxicam I.V. administered in the 1st hour. The PCA device was set with tramadol&#xD;
      300 mg/100 ml, bolus 10 mg, lock time 12 minutes without basal infusion. Patients with&#xD;
      numeric rating scale (NRS) scores ≥4 had a rescue dose of 4 mg morphine I.V. administered.&#xD;
      Each patient began oral intake (water) in the postoperative 24th hour, with early&#xD;
      mobilization. A second dose of tenoxicam I.V. was administered in the postoperative 8th hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 24th hour postoperative, patients had analgesia to ensure VAS score is below 4, with&#xD;
      RFT repeated by the same doctor who performed RFT preoperatively.&#xD;
