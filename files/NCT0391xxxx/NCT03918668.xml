  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most frequent tumor in Western women. In Spain about 26,000 new breast&#xD;
      cancers are diagnosed each year. This type of tumor is increasing worldwide with an increase&#xD;
      in aggressive neoplasms in young women. There are some risk factors responsible for this&#xD;
      global increase: lifestyle, diet and body weight especially in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some cell mutations, especially in the BRCA1, BRCA2 and p53 genes, are associated with a very&#xD;
      high risk of this type of cancer. Some authors have calculated the contribution of various&#xD;
      modifiable risk factors to the global burden of breast cancer, and they concluded that 21% of&#xD;
      all breast cancer deaths are attributable to alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, and&#xD;
      lack of physical activity. Nowadays, there aren't specific studies in the Community of Madrid&#xD;
      designed to know the risk factors related to breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, it is proposed to carry out an observational study that collects detailed&#xD;
      information about dietary habits, genetic factors and life quality of a group of women with&#xD;
      recent diagnosis in pre or post-surgical phase.&#xD;

      1. Storage of biological sample at the Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient's breast pathology characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study of concomitant pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Dietary study: &quot;Frequency of Food Consumption&quot; questionnaire referring to the last year&#xD;
           eating habits before having been breast cancer diagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Physical activity study in the year prior to the diagnosis of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Anthropometric study: weight, size, waist circumference and body composition (% Fat&#xD;
           mass,% Lean mass,% Body water).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Study of other risk factors of breast cancer: age, family history, reproductive history,&#xD;
           medications consumed...&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Biochemical study: biochemical variables of the last blood analysis performed on the&#xD;
           volunteer in the hospital center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Saliva collection to proceed with the genetic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Collection of stool sample to carry out the microbiota study.&#xD;
