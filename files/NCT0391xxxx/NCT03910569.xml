      The Cedars-Sinai SHI Takotsubo Registry and Proteomic Study is an observational registry that&#xD;
      will collect retrospective and prospective demographic, clinical, hemodynamic, laboratory and&#xD;
      other diagnostic parameters, therapy and outcome data from individuals who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria of Takotsubo Registry protocol. Subjects will also be invited to&#xD;
      provide a blood sample utilizing a Mitra kit sent to their homes. Researchers from the Barbra&#xD;
      Streisand Women's Heart Center will analyze Registry data to identify Takotsubo phenotypes,&#xD;
      improve diagnostic capabilities, better predict recurrence rates, and develop targeted&#xD;
      Takotsubo treatments.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Registry outreach will begin with an informational and inspirational website and will utilize&#xD;
      social media and patient-driven activism through Facebook, blogs and Twitter modalities that&#xD;
      have demonstrated efficiencies in other patient-centered research efforts. Subjects will&#xD;
      upload specific clinical materials into Cedar-Sinai's web-enabled cloud storage and which&#xD;
      will be screened by trained Smidt Heart Institute physicians. The Registry utilizes on-line,&#xD;
      e-consent and enrollment connected to a REDCap database that will allow efficient data input&#xD;
      for analysis. All potential subjects who have been diagnosed with Takotsubo or have been&#xD;
      informed by their physician that they meet diagnosis criteria, will need to provide&#xD;
      information for review that includes: hospitalization records, from the time of Takotsubo&#xD;
      event, with laboratory data (particularly -- troponin level), ECG and CTA. Registrants will&#xD;
      be asked to respond to annual update surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to accurately understand the prevalence, recurrence and prospective status of the&#xD;
      Takotsubo, to determine which individuals are at risk of reoccurrence or subsequent adverse&#xD;
      event and to determine potential treatment targets to develop therapeutic strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish a large USA-based database for patients with Takotsubo with a convenient&#xD;
           and easy to use on-line patient-advocate registry using digital media marketing, Box&#xD;
           cloud data access and storage, accurate case adjudication, and automated follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also be offered the option of participating in the Takotsubo Proteomic&#xD;
           Registry by providing remote ambulatory Mitra blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To establish a clinical trial platform for patient-centered point-of-care trials to improve&#xD;
      diagnostics, clinical care and outcomes.&#xD;
