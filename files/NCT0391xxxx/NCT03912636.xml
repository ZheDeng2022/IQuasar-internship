  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rumination syndrome is a condition in which people repeatedly and unintentionally regurgitate&#xD;
      undigested or partially digested food from the stomach, rechew it, and then either re-swallow&#xD;
      it or spit it out. The mechanism of the disease is not well understood. The investigators&#xD;
      believe that discomfort in the stomach during and immediately after meals may be an important&#xD;
      factor for this disease. The reason for such discomfort can be due to an alteration of&#xD;
      nervous regulation of the stomach. The investigators can study the nervous regulation that&#xD;
      affects the stomach and other parts of the body by analysing in detail an electrocardiogram&#xD;
      that is performed continuously for several hours. From this analysis, The investigators can&#xD;
      study a parameter called cardiac vagal tone (CVT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diaphragmatic breathing (DiaB) is a respiratory exercise, in which people mainly move their&#xD;
      abdomen to breath. DiaB is a common treatment for rumination syndrome. Patients doing DiaB&#xD;
      can reduce the number of rumination episodes. The mechanism by which DiaB improves rumination&#xD;
      is unknown. There is another type of breathing called slow deep breathing (SlowDB), in which&#xD;
      people mainly breathe with their chest. SlowDB is used as a therapy for increased pain in the&#xD;
      food pipe (oesophagus) and it might also be effective on rumination syndrome. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that both DiaB and SlowDB can improve rumination, by modifying the&#xD;
      nervous control of the stomach (that the investigators can monitor by measuring continuously&#xD;
      cardiac vagal tone (CVT)). The aims of the study are to investigate the association between&#xD;
      gastric discomfort during a meal, CVT variations (measured with the electrocardiogram during&#xD;
      the meal) and the severity of rumination episodes. The investigators will also study how DiaB&#xD;
      and SlowDB can modify this variable during the test. In a second step, The investigators will&#xD;
      assess the clinical effect of respiratory exercises (DiaB and SlowDB) on the severity and&#xD;
      frequency of regurgitations in patients diagnosed with rumination syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method This research consists of two separate studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study1 (to investigate the mechanism of rumination syndrome) 10 healthy volunteers and&#xD;
           10 rumination patients will join Study1 on 3 separate days. On each visit, the&#xD;
           investigators will place electrocardiogram sensors and a belt that can measure the&#xD;
           thorax or abdominal movement. All subjects will get instructions to perform SlowDB or&#xD;
           DiaB, answer some questionnaires, eat the test meal, perform normal&#xD;
           breathing/DiaB/SlowDB for 15 minutes, and stay quietly on the chair for 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study 2 (to assess the effect of DiaB and SlowDB on rumination syndrome) 10 patients&#xD;
           with rumination syndrome will join Study 2. On the first visit, subjects will have the&#xD;
           test meal, answer the symptom questionnaire 1 hour after the meal, and learn how to&#xD;
           perform either DiaB or SlowDB. After the first visit, subjects perform DiaB or SlowDB&#xD;
           during 15 minutes after every meal for 4 weeks. On the second visit, subjects will have&#xD;
           the test meal, answer the symptom questionnaire 1 hour after the meal, and learn how to&#xD;
           perform the other respiratory exercise. After a 2-week break, subjects will perform the&#xD;
           other respiratory exercise for the next 4 weeks. On the last visit, subjects will have&#xD;
           the test meal and answer the symptom questionnaire 1 hour after the meal.&#xD;
