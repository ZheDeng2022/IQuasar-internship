  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the effect of adjuvant therapy with the oral beta-agonist Salbutamol in&#xD;
      patients with generalized myasthenia gravis on stable standard of care having residual&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myasthenia Gravis (MG) causes various degrees of increased muscular fatigue and ocular,&#xD;
      bulbar, respiratory and extremity symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residual symptoms often remain despite treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agents. Escalation of immunosuppressive treatment may provide additional&#xD;
      benefit but is associated with potentially severe side effects, and high economic costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with beta-agonists has been investigated in animal models of MG, and in small,&#xD;
      randomized pilot studies of generalized MG. Adjuvant therapy with oral beta-agonists in MG&#xD;
      may be safe and cheap and may improve symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will examine the tolerability and efficacy of adjuvant therapy with the oral&#xD;
      beta-agonist Salbutamol in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis on stable standard of&#xD;
      care having residual symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Present study is an investigator-initiated, randomized, placebo-controlled, rater and&#xD;
      subject-blinded crossover study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study consists of Screening Period (4 weeks), Treatment Period 1 (8 weeks), Washout Period (4&#xD;
      weeks), Treatment Period 2 (8 weeks).&#xD;
