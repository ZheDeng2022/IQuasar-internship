  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will develop and refine a computer-delivered integrated Personalized Feedback&#xD;
      Intervention (PFI) that directly addresses smoking and distress tolerance. The PFI will focus&#xD;
      on feedback about smoking behavior, distress tolerance, and adaptive coping strategies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the research study is to investigate the efficacy of a brief,&#xD;
      personalized computer-delivered transdiagnostic intervention (PFI) that addresses smoking and&#xD;
      distress tolerance to reduce smoking, increase quit attempts, reduce perceived barriers to&#xD;
      cessation, increase distress tolerance, reduce anxiety/depressive symptoms, and increase&#xD;
      adaptive coping skills compared to a personalized feedback on smoking only control. To&#xD;
      address this aim, the investigators will implement a randomized controlled trial that will&#xD;
      employ a longitudinal experimental design and involve four stages: (a) phone-screener&#xD;
      (pre-screener); (b) baseline appointment consisting of a pre-intervention assessment&#xD;
      (eligibility), random assignment to a one-session computer-delivered intervention (Active PFI&#xD;
      versus Control PFI with no personalized feedback on distress tolerance), and a&#xD;
      post-intervention assessment; (c) 2-week follow-up; (d) 1-month follow-up. Assessments will&#xD;
      include a multi-method approach, including biological, behavioral, and self-report methods.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rulers for Smoking Cessation</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 2-week and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Rulers for Smoking Cessation asks participants to rate three rulers associated with motivation, confidence, and intention to quit smoking. Motivation is indexed by, &quot;How important is stopping smoking to you (0 = Not important at all; 10 = Most important goal of my life)?&quot; with a higher score indicating a better outcome. Confidence is indexed by, &quot;How confident are you that you will quit smoking within the next month (0 = Not at all; 10 = 100% confident)?&quot; with a higher score indicating a better outcome. Intention is indexed by, &quot;How ready are you to quit smoking within the next month (0 = Not at all; 10 = 100% ready)?&quot; with a higher score indicating a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Barriers to Cessation Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 2-week and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Barriers to Cessation Scale assesses 19-barriers, or specific stressors, associated with smoking cessation. Participants indicate, according to a 4-point Likert-style scale (0 = Not a barrier to 3 = Large barrier), the extent to which they identify with each of the barriers to cessation. Lower scores indicate a better outcome (range = 0 - 57).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Smoking History Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 2-week and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Smoking History Questionnaire is a self-report questionnaire used that will be used to assess smoking rate and number of quit attempts. This measure contains 30 items including open ended formats in which the individual will self-report their smoking rate per day and number of previous quit attempts. Lower reported smoking rate indicates a better outcome. Higher reported number of quit attempts indicates a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Distress Tolerance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 2-week and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Distress Tolerance Scale is a self-report measure in which respondents indicate, on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = 'strongly agree' to 5 = 'strongly disagree'), the extent to which they believe they can experience and withstand distressing emotional states. All items are averaged to create a total mean score ranging from 1 to 5 with higher total scores indicating a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire-Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 2-week and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire-Short Form will be used to assess anxiety/depressive symptoms. Participants indicate how much they have experienced each symptom on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = Not at all to 5 = Extremely). Specifically, the Anxious Arousal subscale will be used to measure anxiety and the Anhedonic Depression subscale will be used to measure depression. The Anxious Arousal subscale consists of 17-items with lower scores indicating better outcomes (range = 17 - 85). The Anhedonic Depression subscale consists of 22-items with lower scores indicating better outcomes (range = 22 - 110).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Help Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 2-week and 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Help Scale asks participants to indicate whether they would be willing to try each of 10 strategies to help deal with depression and anxiety on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 0 (definitely not) to 4 (extremely willing). Higher scores indicate a better outcome (range = 0 - 40).</description>
