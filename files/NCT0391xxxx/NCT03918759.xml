  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms (PanNEN) are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that&#xD;
      arise from the endocrine cells of the pancreatic gland. Non-functioning (NF-PanNEN)&#xD;
      represents the most common forms and do not produce syndromes due to hormonal hypersecretion.&#xD;
      Several prognostic factors have been demonstrated for NF-PanNEN. The presence of nodal&#xD;
      metastasis and lymph node ratio are widely considered predictors of disease-free survival and&#xD;
      even the number of positive nodes has been found to be associated with recurrence. In&#xD;
      addition to traditional imaging exams, diagnostic work-up should include a Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography/CT with 68Ga labeled somatostatin analogues, which have shown a high sensitivity&#xD;
      and specificity while 18F-FDG PET can be associated for evaluating the possible presence of a&#xD;
      high-grade component. Moreover, pancreatic endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is usually part of the&#xD;
      preoperative staging both for imaging details and cytological sampling. Therefore an accurate&#xD;
      identification of nodal metastases preoperatively may have important implications for the&#xD;
      extent of surgical resection and lymphadenectomy and even for a prognostic outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will evaluate prospectively the accuracy of these diagnostic&#xD;
      exams in detecting the lymph node status. Patients with sporadic NF-PanNEN who are candidates&#xD;
      for surgical resection will undergo CE-CT scan, 68Ga DOTATOC (and eventually 18F-FDG) PET/MRI&#xD;
      and EUS with FNA/B. Reference standard for defining the presence of nodal metastases is&#xD;
      represented by pathological examination on the specimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a prospective monocentric observational cohort study. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint of the study is to assess the accuracy of preoperative diagnostic procedures in&#xD;
      terms of sensitivity and specificity in detecting nodal metastases in sporadic NF-PanNEN as&#xD;
      determined by pathological examination on the specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a suspect of a sporadic NF-PanNEN will be considered for the study at the time&#xD;
      of the first visit. All consecutive patients who will meet inclusion criteria, after informed&#xD;
      consent, will be included. The preoperative work-up will be performed in our center. All the&#xD;
      examinations required for this study are necessary for the correct preoperative staging,&#xD;
      representing the standard diagnostic work-up in patients with PanNEN. Computed tomography&#xD;
      (CT) images will be obtained by multiphase technique. Non-enhanced, arterial and portal phase&#xD;
      images will be obtained in all the patients. Computed tomography (CT) images will be obtained&#xD;
      by multiphase technique. Non-enhanced, late arterial and portal phase images will be obtained&#xD;
      in all the patients as well. Every lymph nodal finding with short-axis diameter &gt;1cm or with&#xD;
      pathological contrast enhancement will be considered as pathological. Pancreatic endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound (EUS) is a relatively recent endoscopic technique which combines the&#xD;
      high-frequency ultrasound technology with the direct endoscopic vision, permitting a&#xD;
      sensitive evaluation of pancreatic lesions (from the stomach or the duodenum), an accurate&#xD;
      vascular staging and the assessment of pathologic lymph nodes related to the tumor. Nodes&#xD;
      larger than 1 cm, with well demarked and/or rounded margins and with typical&#xD;
      echoic/elastographic features will be reported as metastatic. Moreover, the additive value of&#xD;
      EUS is the possibility to sample pancreatic masses and lymph nodes with a fine needle&#xD;
      aspiration (FNA), to obtain a cytological diagnosis. A PET/MRI with 68Ga-DOTATOC is also&#xD;
      necessary for the staging of the disease. A 18F-FDG PET will be performed according to the&#xD;
      clinician's discretion, especially in the presence of large lesions and/or liver metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As soon as the preoperative assessment will be completed, a surgical resection will be&#xD;
      proposed to the patient according to the international guidelines on the management of&#xD;
      NF-PanNEN. A standard pancreatic resection will be performed according to the site and the&#xD;
      extension of the lesion. Nodes will be classified according to the Japanese classification of&#xD;
      the biliary tract cancers. The extension of lymphadenectomy will be related to the type of&#xD;
      pancreatic resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LN that will be resected apart from the pancreatic specimen, will be sent for pathological&#xD;
      examination in a separated cup labelled by the surgeon. In case of preoperative detection of&#xD;
      nodal involvement in a station not included in the standard lymphadenectomy, the nodes in&#xD;
      this station will be resected to confirm or not the radiological finding. Reference standard&#xD;
      for defining the presence of nodal metastases will be represented by the pathological&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data regarding the clinical aspect, the radiological reports and the pathological exam&#xD;
      will be fully available only to the surgeon. Radiologist, nuclear medicine physician, and&#xD;
      pathologist will be blinded to the radiological findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several retrospective studies 11-12 reported a prevalence of nodal metastases in PanNEN of&#xD;
      about 40%, in case of tumors &gt; 2 cm. No data have been found on the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of the various examinations in detecting nodal involvement. Given this prevalence&#xD;
      and assuming a good accuracy based on this institute experience, the simple size required to&#xD;
      assess the sensitivity and specificity of the methods was found to be of 150 patients,&#xD;
      considering a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive analysis will be performed of the data obtained. The aim will be to evaluate&#xD;
      the sensitivity, the specificity and the positive and negative predictive values of the&#xD;
      preoperative staging (CE-CT scan, EUS, 68Ga DOTATOC/18F-FDG PET/MRI). The comparison between&#xD;
      the exams in terms of prediction of the nodal status will be calculated with the McNemar&#xD;
      test. A logistic regression model will be used to assess the risk of nodal positivity at the&#xD;
      pathological report when the preoperative imaging demonstrates the features of nodal&#xD;
      metastases. OR and 95% confidence interval will be calculated. The statistical correlation&#xD;
      between the risk of nodal positivity at the pathological report and some preoperative&#xD;
      variables will be evaluated with the chi-square test and ROC curves analysis.&#xD;
