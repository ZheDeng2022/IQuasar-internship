  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-institution prospective case series (single arm) study will assess the clinical&#xD;
      outcomes of patients diagnosed with 1 or 2 level level discogenic low back pain following an&#xD;
      intradiscal injection of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMAC is a cellular rich fraction of bone marrow aspirate that can be readily prepared at the&#xD;
      point of care without additional processing steps to manipulate or isolate cells. In&#xD;
      addition, BMAC contains growth factors from the peripheral blood which may promote disc&#xD;
      healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of up to 20 patients aged 18- 60 with unresolved low back&#xD;
      pain attributable to intervertebral disc degeneration. Clinical exam will indicate the&#xD;
      intervertebral disc as the source of pain with features such as midline pain, pain upon&#xD;
      rising from a seated position, or positive responses to centralization maneuvers. Moderate&#xD;
      single level lumbar disc (L1-S1) degeneration (&lt;50% disc height) will be confirmed on MRI.&#xD;
      Other low back pain generators must be eliminated prior to study enrollment. Subjects must&#xD;
      meet minimum score criteria on baseline PROs (VAS&gt;=40 and ODI&gt;=30). Subjects that meet all of&#xD;
      the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will undergo bone marrow aspiration and intradiscal injection by an&#xD;
      experienced orthopedic spine surgeon. Subjects will be followed for 1 year to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of the disc injection.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             range of motion and pain to deep palpation over the symptomatic disc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MRI confirmed single level lumbar disc height loss &lt;50% (Modified Pfirrman grade &lt;=7).&#xD;
