      Purpose: To Assess the impact of high and low in vivo estradiol exposure on PrEP&#xD;
      (Pre-exposure prophylaxis) nucleotide concentrations in different cellular populations of the&#xD;
      lower GI (gastrointestinal) tract and to quantify the relationship between estradiol,&#xD;
      progesterone, and testosterone on PrEP nucleotide concentrations in rectal and peripheral&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cells. As well as the relationship between estradiol, progesterone, and&#xD;
      testosterone on PrEP concentrations in plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Healthy, cisgender female, volunteers, aged 18-49 inclusive on the date of&#xD;
      screening with an intact gastrointestinal system and regular menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): Participants will take a single daily dose of study drug for five days&#xD;
      before each sampling visit. The visits will be scheduled during the early follicular phase of&#xD;
      the menstrual cycle (approximately days 2-5 after the first day of menses, Visit 1) when&#xD;
      estradiol is predicted to be the lowest and the late follicular phase (approximately days&#xD;
      12-15 after the first day of menses, Visit 2) when estradiol is predicted to be highest.&#xD;
      Samples of blood, rectal cells, and rectal tissue will be collected at both Visits 1 and 2.&#xD;
      All participants will complete a follow-up safety visit within 14 days of completing study&#xD;
      sampling.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be enrolled, and sampling visits will be scheduled to correspond with their&#xD;
      menstrual cycles. Five days prior to the first scheduled sampling visit, participants will&#xD;
      come to the clinic to have a repeat urine pregnancy test performed to verify eligibility.&#xD;
      After verification, participants will be given a single dose of the study medication,&#xD;
      Truvada®. Study staff will witness the dose and assess for any adverse reactions post dose.&#xD;
      Participants will be sent home with a supply of 4 additional doses of Truvada® for them to&#xD;
      take at scheduled times for the next 4 days with study staff observing via video call. Study&#xD;
      staff will assess for adverse events during each dosing call. Starting 72 hours before each&#xD;
      sampling visit, participants will be required to switch to a low fiber diet and abstain from&#xD;
      inserting anything rectally. Twelve hours prior to each sampling visit, participants will be&#xD;
      required to abide by a clear liquid diet. Participants will be seen as an outpatient at the&#xD;
      Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC) at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&#xD;
      (UNC) for these sampling visits. At these visits, participants will have blood samples drawn&#xD;
      to measure peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum hormone concentrations. Participants&#xD;
      will also have rectal cells collected via cytobrush and rectal tissue collected via rectal&#xD;
      biopsy. After all samples have been collected, participants will be evaluated for adverse&#xD;
      events and be discharged. Within 14 days of completion of the second sampling visit, for a&#xD;
      follow-up visit. At this visit, blood will be obtained to check safety labs.&#xD;
