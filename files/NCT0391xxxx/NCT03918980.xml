  <brief_title>Single Dose and Multiple Dose Study to Assess Safety and Tolerability of LOU064</brief_title>
  <official_title>A 6-part First-in-human Study of LOU064 Consisting of a 4-part Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled SAD and MAD Study to Investigate the Safety and Tolerability in Healthy Volunteers, Subjects With Atopic Diathesis and Subjects With Atopic Dermatitis, an Open-label Food Effect Study and a Double-blind Formulation Effect Study in Healthy Volunteers</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6-part first-in-human study in up to approximately 184 participants. Parts 1 to 5&#xD;
      is in health volunteers and part 6 is in subjects with atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this first-in-human study is to assess the safety and tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and multiple doses of LOU064 both as once and twice daily&#xD;
      oral administration in healthy volunteers and those with atopic diathesis or atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis. This study will also explore the effect of food intake and different drug&#xD;
      substance particle sizes on the in vivo disposition of LOU064 in healthy volunteers to guide&#xD;
      dosing and formulation development for future clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is registered on CT.Gov with the initiation of part 6 in patients (FPFV in April&#xD;
      2019).&#xD;

      The study is composed of the following parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled single ascending dose (SAD) escalation study of&#xD;
      up to 10 cohorts (N = approximately 80) in healthy volunteers Part 2 is a double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled multiple ascending dose (MAD) escalation study in up to 6 cohorts in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers with asymptomatic atopic diathesis with a 12-day treatment period (daily&#xD;
      dosing) and 4-day follow-up period (N = approximately 48) Part 3 is a single cohort, single&#xD;
      dose, open-label crossover food effect study (N = approximately 12) in healthy volunteers&#xD;
      Part 4 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple dose study in up to 2 cohorts of&#xD;
      healthy volunteers with asymptomatic atopic diathesis with a 12-day treatment period (twice&#xD;
      daily dosing) and 4-day follow-up period (N = approximately 16) Part 5 is a double-blind,&#xD;
      single dose, crossover formulation effect study (N = approximately 12) in healthy volunteers&#xD;
      Part 6 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple dose study in subjects with atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis with a 4-week treatment period (twice daily dosing of LOU064) and 3-week follow-up&#xD;
      period in approximately 16 subjects&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male and female healthy subjects with an age range between 18 and 65 years&#xD;
             (inclusive), and in good general health as determined by past medical history,&#xD;
             physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests at&#xD;
             screening. Healthy subjects to participate in Part 2 or Part 4 must additionally have&#xD;
             an atopic diathesis to be eligible for these specific study portions. Atopic healthy&#xD;
             volunteers must have a positive skin prick test to a known allergen at screening&#xD;
             (atopic diathesis) but must be clinically asymptomatic and not requiring any systemic&#xD;
             medication. To participate in Part 6, subjects must additionally have chronic atopic&#xD;
             dermatitis (AD) according to American Academy of Dermatology Consensus Criteria&#xD;
             (Eichenfield et al 2014), that has been present for at least 1 year before the&#xD;
             baseline visit and defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) ≥ 12 at screening and baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  IGA (Investigator's Global Assessment) ≥ 3 on a 5-point scale at screening and&#xD;
                  baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  BSA (Body Surface Area) involvement ≥ 8% at screening and baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects have applied a stable dose of bland topical emollient at least twice&#xD;
                  daily for at least 7 consecutive days immediately before the baseline visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Able to communicate well with the Investigator, to understand and comply with the&#xD;
             requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must weigh at least 50 kg and must have a body mass index (BMI) within the&#xD;
             range of 18 -30 kg/m2 (inclusive) (parts 1-5) / 18-35 kg/m2 inclusive (part 6). BMI =&#xD;
             body weight (kg) / [Height (m)]2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. At screening, and first baseline, vital signs (body temperature, systolic and&#xD;
             diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate) will be assessed in the sitting position&#xD;
             after the subject has rested for at least three minutes and again (when required)&#xD;
             after three minutes in the standing position. Sitting vital signs should be within the&#xD;
             following ranges (inclusive):&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Systolic blood pressure 90-139 mm Hg; for subjects ≥ 55 years, systolic blood&#xD;
                  pressure up to 149 mm Hg is accepted (part 6)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diastolic blood pressure 50-89 mm Hg&#xD;
&#xD;

             subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods)&#xD;

                  efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example, hormone vaginal ring or transdermal&#xD;
                  hormone contraception. In case of use of oral contraception, women should have&#xD;
                  been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study&#xD;
                  treatment. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing&#xD;
                  potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an&#xD;
                  appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate history of vasomotor symptoms)&#xD;
                  or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total&#xD;
                  hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of&#xD;
                  oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been&#xD;
                  confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of&#xD;
                  child-bearing potential.&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption,&#xD;
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, or which may jeopardize the subject&#xD;
