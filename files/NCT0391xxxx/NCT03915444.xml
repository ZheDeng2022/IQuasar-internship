      This is a phase II open-label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel&#xD;
      cisplatin, and gemcitabine in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An individual cycle of therapy will be defined as Days 1 and 8 every 21 days. Multiple cycles&#xD;
      may be administered until the patient is withdrawn from therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall response rates as well as individual categories of response (CR, PR, SD, and PD) will&#xD;
      be determined using RECIST 1.1 (Frese 2012). Time-to-event endpoints, including PFS and OS&#xD;
      will be assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method (Kaplan 1958). Evaluation of stable disease at&#xD;
      9 weeks will also be assessed. Toxicity (adverse events) will be recorded using the NCI&#xD;
      CTCAE, version 5.0.&#xD;
