      BACKGROUND: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity-Disorder (ADHD) is associated with language&#xD;
      difficulties within expressive, receptive and pragmatic areas of language.Telling stories is&#xD;
      a particularly interesting language task as is provides the possibility of investigating how&#xD;
      children use their language in everyday interactions. Thus, investigating how children with&#xD;
      ADHD tell stories provides a more naturalistic impression of their language abilities.&#xD;
      However, the extent, causes, and clinical relevance of language and narrative difficulties in&#xD;
      ADHD remain largely unknown. Language may be the key to understanding and improving the&#xD;
      functional impairments associated with ADHD such as social and academic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM: The overall aim of the current study was to investigate the association between&#xD;
      language, narrative ability and ADHD, what contributes to this association, as well as the&#xD;
      clinical relevance of language difficulties in ADHD in relation to academic and social&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD: Children between 7-11 years old with ADHD will be recruited from Aarhus University&#xD;
      Hospital in Skejby and compared to children without ADHD recruited from schools in the&#xD;
      community. All children will be assessed at two separate meetings at the Department of&#xD;
      Psychology, Aarhus University. The total number of participants in each group will depend on&#xD;
      the intake of patients at Aarhus University Hospital, but a maximum of 100 children will be&#xD;
      sampled in each group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40% of children with the ADHD are suggested to have language difficulties. Other than&#xD;
      language difficulties being debilitating in their own right, language difficulties in&#xD;
      childhood ADHD are problematic because they likely enhance the social and academic&#xD;
      difficulties often present in children with this disorder. Children with ADHD also appear to&#xD;
      have narrative difficulties; i.e. they have problems telling a coherent, understandable&#xD;
      story. Telling stories is a particularly interesting language task as the investigation of&#xD;
      how children use their language in an unstructured task is similar to how they use their&#xD;
      language in everyday interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the extent, causes, and clinical relevance of language and narrative difficulties in&#xD;
      ADHD remain largely unknown. Studies are scarce and fraught with problems warranting&#xD;
      investigations of language abilities in children with ADHD that measure language as well as&#xD;
      executive function (EF) and that investigate the clinical relevance of these language&#xD;
      difficulties. This is necessary in order to tease apart and gain knowledge of the association&#xD;
      between language, EF and ADHD. Ultimately, such an investigation can inspire future&#xD;
      assessment and treatment of language difficulties in children with ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS AND HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The first aim is to examine narrative abilities in children with ADHD. This is done by&#xD;
           investigating whether children with and without ADHD differ with respect to their&#xD;
           narratives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second aim is to examine whether language, EF and/or ADHD symptoms can explain&#xD;
           narrative function in children with and without ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The third aim is to investigate which specific domains of language children with ADHD&#xD;
           have the most difficulty within.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The fourth aim is to investigate whether the language difficulties as well as the&#xD;
           narrative difficulties identified are associated with academic and social function in&#xD;
           ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURES Up to 100 children with ADHD, age 7-11, consecutively referred&#xD;
      from Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, will be compared to up to 100 typically developing&#xD;
      children, age 7-11, recruited from schools in the same community as the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After initial screening by telephone, informed consent has been obtained from both custodians&#xD;
      and verbal assent has been given by the child, all children (ADHD and control) will be&#xD;
      assessed at two separate meetings at the University of Aarhus by a member of the project&#xD;
      group. The parents will receive questionnaires about their child and if the families give&#xD;
      their consent, questionnaires will also be sent to the children's primary teacher. The&#xD;
      parents and teachers receive questionnaires about the child's behavior, language and social&#xD;
      and academic abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All hypotheses will be investigated with appropriate statistical analyses. The role of IQ,&#xD;
      parental educational level etc. is also examined in the analyses. If an adequate sample size&#xD;
      is obtained, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) will be applied to handle data, and if a&#xD;
      factor solution is supported, factor scores will be included in all analyses, thereby&#xD;
      reducing the number of variables in the analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REGISTRATION DETAILS The study record reported at clinical trials.gov is completely&#xD;
      consistent with the protocol approved by the Central Region Committee on Health Research&#xD;
      Ethics in Denmark. The study was registered at clinical trials.gov after enrollment had&#xD;
      begun, but no changes have been made in any procedures, recruitment etc., and as such it was&#xD;
      assessed to be feasible to include the few participants that had been enrolled before&#xD;
      registration in clinical trials.&#xD;
