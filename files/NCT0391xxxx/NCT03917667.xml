  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is a disease characterized by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle&#xD;
      mass and strength, and is related to worse clinical outcomes, physical impairment, and&#xD;
      mortality in all healthcare settings. This nutrition-related syndrome is a reversible&#xD;
      condition, and can be effectively counteracted by exercise and nutritional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of sarcopenia varies widely depending on the criteria, methods, and cut-off&#xD;
      points used for its assessment. Although the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older&#xD;
      People (EWGSOP) recommended assessing sarcopenia in geriatric patients in all care settings,&#xD;
      few studies addressing hospitalized older patients have been carried out, mainly due to the&#xD;
      characteristics of acute healthcare settings and their in-patients and because the criteria&#xD;
      used are difficult to carry out there. Therefore, this condition remains under-recognized in&#xD;
      the setting where this disease is likely to be more present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenia is expected to be a major healthcare problem in the upcoming years in Europe so,&#xD;
      in response to this claim for Public Health Action, the European Union Geriatric Medicine&#xD;
      Society founded the Special Interest Group (SIG) on sarcopenia that has taken the lead of&#xD;
      bridging the gaps between clinical and research in sarcopenia field, in line with the&#xD;
      Conference on Frailty and Sarcopenia Research Task Force, and the World Health Organization's&#xD;
      strategies to promote Optimal Aging. This goal of SIG on sarcopenia by EuGMS is being carried&#xD;
      out by promotion of collaboration among International scientific societies and institutions;&#xD;
      they have recently launched the Revised European consensus on definition and diagnosis&#xD;
      (EWGSOP2), the SARCUS project on ultrasound for sarcopenia assessment in European countries,&#xD;
      and the first International Registry of patients with sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to provide an overview of sarcopenia assessment older patients hospitalized&#xD;
      in acute-care geriatric units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a longitudinal, prospective, observational study in consecutive hospitalized patients&#xD;
      in the CHU Brugmann Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has 5 objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine prevalence of sarcopenia among hospitalized patients in CHU Brugmann.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine incidence of sarcopenia during the hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify risk factors for the development of sarcopenia at the time of admission and&#xD;
           during hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess sarcopenia as a risk factor for clinical adverse outcomes during&#xD;
           hospitalization (hospital-acquired infections, falls, delirium, longer length-of-stay,&#xD;
           disability, and mortality).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess sarcopenia as a risk factor for clinical adverse outcomes post-discharge&#xD;
           (institutionalization, hospitalizations, falls, disability, and mortality) at 3- and&#xD;
           12-month follow-up.&#xD;
