      Membrane transporters supporting tacrolimus at the lymphocyte level may play a role in the&#xD;
      variability of the relationship between tacrolimus blood concentration and intracellular&#xD;
      concentration, or may be the main explanatory factors. Nevertheless, most of the studies&#xD;
      carried out on the subject, have been by genetic approach, neglecting in fact the membrane&#xD;
      expression of these transporters, which could testify more to the real effect on the&#xD;
      transport of tacrolimus. A better understanding of the cellular transport mechanisms of&#xD;
      tacrolimus in the T lymphocyte could thus make it possible to identify sub-populations of&#xD;
      patients under-exposed at the intra-lymphocyte level, despite satisfactory systemic exposure.&#xD;

    <description>Donor graft cf-DNA characterized the cell death marker, released from necrotic or apoptotic cells in the transplant organ, and may therefore be useful as a marker for graft injury.
