  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plantar fasciitis and the chronic Achilles tendinopathy are the most common causes of heel&#xD;
      pain. The term &quot;plantar fasciitis&quot; implies an inflammatory condition by the suffix &quot;itis&quot;.&#xD;
      However, various lines of evidence indicate that this disorder is better classified as&#xD;
      &quot;fasciosis&quot; or &quot;fasciopathy&quot;, as heel pain associated with degenerative changes in the fascia&#xD;
      and atrophy of the abductor minimi muscle. High energy shock wave therapy (HESWT) has been&#xD;
      proposed as a potential method of treating patients with chronic disease without the need to&#xD;
      stop weightbearing. Often a crucial complication of HESWT is the appearance of pain with the&#xD;
      subsequent interruption of the procedure. The consequences are a reduced patient compliance,&#xD;
      need of a deep sedation and more sessions for the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequently, topic anesthesia (TA) (as EMLA) is applied during the therapy to decrease the&#xD;
      pain HESWT-induced and enable sham treatment. Multiple publications focused on the evaluation&#xD;
      of a clinically relevant eﬀect of shock wave application on plantar heel pain, either of&#xD;
      HESWT, applied in a single session with local or regional anesthesia or of low energy HESWT,&#xD;
      applied repetitively without local anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rompe JD and colleagues have demonstrated that the therapeutic success rate of HESWT with TA&#xD;
      is significantly smaller than without TA even after 3 months. Probably, the use of anesthetic&#xD;
      topically applied can reduce the efficacy of HESWT for increased impedance. To date, many&#xD;
      patients interrupted the HESWT for moderate-severe pain. Consequently, this therapy, which&#xD;
      generally is administered in three sessions, required a prolongation of procedure up to six&#xD;
      sessions.The clinical application of Posterior Tibial nerve block (already widely used in&#xD;
      operating room) during HESWT applied in Orthopedic Day Hospital could offer the possibility&#xD;
      to minimize the patient discomfort and to give the therapeutic doses just in few HESWT&#xD;
      sessions, reducing the hospital access of outpatients for the treatments and the costs&#xD;
      related to prolonged treatment caused by pain. Furthermore, this anesthetic approach could&#xD;
      make patients tolerate majorated doses of HESWT in few sessions, with high effectiveness of&#xD;
      procedure after several months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot prospective observational study is to allow outpatients with chronic&#xD;
      Achilles tendinopathy and plantar fasciitis to reduce the pain during HEWST. The study will&#xD;
      be focused on the evaluation of a posterior tibial nerve block efficacy in patients who&#xD;
      discontinued the first application of HESWT due to surge of moderate-severe pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study Primary objective The primary objective of the study is to observe a&#xD;
      40% reduction in Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) from baseline (T0) to T1 during HESWT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: evaluation of the number of patients that are able to complete a single&#xD;
      session with Posterior tibial nerve block (usually, without Posterior tibial nerve block, 40%&#xD;
      of patients can not complete the session); evaluation of the number of sessions required to&#xD;
      complete successfully the treatment (usually, without Posterior tibial nerve block, the&#xD;
      number of sessions required to complete successfully the treatment is 6); evaluation of the&#xD;
      efficacy of HESWT (American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Score - AOFAS, performed 1&#xD;
      month from the end of treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study This is an observational, pilot, prospective, cohort study. It will be&#xD;
      conducted in Orthopedic Day Hospital Ward of &quot;Fondazione-Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli&#xD;
      IRCCS&quot; of Rome. The planned duration of the study is 6th months and the proposed sample size&#xD;
      is N:21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods The enrollment starts after the patient interrupt his/her first HESWT&#xD;
      treatment (T0) because the pain is unbearable with NRS&gt;5. Before the second HESWT session&#xD;
      (T1) patients will receive the posterior tibial nerve block (PTNB) under ultrasound control.&#xD;
      This anesthetic procedure will be repeated for every subsequent HESWT session. After each&#xD;
      treatment, the patient will be monitored in Orthopedic Day hospital ward for about 2 hours or&#xD;
      until complete sensitive recovery. At the end of each session the patient will be asked to&#xD;
      express his/her pain intensity using the NRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthetic procedure With the patient lying supine and the foot externally rotated, an&#xD;
      expert anesthesiologist will perform the PTNB with echo guided, finding the posterior tibial&#xD;
      nerve between the middle and the distal third of the leg, about 6-8 cm proximally to the&#xD;
      tibial malleolus. Once the nerve will be identified, the needle (70 millimeters long, 22&#xD;
      gouge, UPC Polymedic) will insert in-plain and after careful aspiration mepivacaine 1 % (3-4&#xD;
      ml) will injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements Intensity of pain at the end of each procedure will be measured by Numerical&#xD;
      Rating Scale (NRS) between 0 and 10 points, where Zero usually represents 'no pain at all'&#xD;
      whereas ten represents 'the worst pain ever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of patient's adherence to the treatment, will be detected as the number of&#xD;
      patients that manage to complete the session The sensitive block duration will be evaluated&#xD;
      by pinprik test (defined as a test for cutaneous pain receptors. A small, clean, sharp object&#xD;
      such as a pin or needle is gently applied to the skin and the patient is asked to describe&#xD;
      the sensation. One must be certain the patient is reporting the sensation of pain rather than&#xD;
      that of pressure.) The efficacy of HESWT will be evaluated by American Orthopedic Foot and&#xD;
      Ankle Society Score (AOFAS) after 1 month from the end of treatment. Each measure of AOFAS is&#xD;
      comprised of nine questions and cover three categories: Pain (40 points), function (50&#xD;
      points) and alignment (10 points). These are all scored together for a total of 100 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled if they present all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      History of Chronic Achilles tendinopathy and/or plantar fasciitis at least 6 months long&#xD;
      Unsatisfying subjective result (Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score persistently ≥ 4 points for&#xD;
      pain during the ﬁrst few steps of walking in the morning) after at least 6 months after ≥ 3&#xD;
      of the following 5 conventional therapy programs: ≥ 4 weeks of physical therapy; ≥4 weeks&#xD;
      course of non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory medications HEWST indication Application of HESWT at&#xD;
      1500 shock waves with energy of 16 Ky First treatment discontinued for surge of pain (numeric&#xD;
      rating scale &gt; 5) Exclusion criteria Patient &lt; 18 years Peripheral circulatory disorders&#xD;
      Arthrosis of the foot or ankle, as conﬁrmed by X-ray diagnosis Skin lesions of the foot&#xD;
      Allergy to local anesthetic Neurologic abnormality (changes of deep tendon reﬂexes, motor or&#xD;
      sensory deﬁcit) Routinely consumption of analgesics or history of analgesic consumption&#xD;
      within 24 hours prior to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Plan Sample size determination As a pilot study, no data is available in the&#xD;
      literature. The proposed sample size is N:21 patients. This dimension provides a power of&#xD;
      0.99, with confidence level = 0.05 of detecting a 40% reduction in the NSR score from T0 to&#xD;
      T1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The sample will be described in its clinical and demographic features&#xD;
      using descriptive statistics techniques. Quantitative variables will be described using the&#xD;
      following measures: minimum, maximum, range, mean and standard deviation. Qualitative&#xD;
      variables will be summarized with absolute and percentage frequency tables. Normality of data&#xD;
      will be verified using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be achieved performing a Student's T test for paired sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of patients that are able to complete a single session with Posterior tibial&#xD;
      nerve block will be evaluated and compared to the same proportion in patients without&#xD;
      Posterior tibial nerve block (40% of patients can not complete the session); The mean and&#xD;
      median number of sessions required to complete successfully the treatment will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of HESWT efficacy will be performed via the AOFAS score, comparing proportions&#xD;
      using the Chi squared test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible comparisons will be performed with the Student T test for paired sample (if data are&#xD;
      normally distributed) or with the Wilcoxon test (for non normal distribution). Comparison of&#xD;
      categorical data will be performed using a Chi-square test.&#xD;
