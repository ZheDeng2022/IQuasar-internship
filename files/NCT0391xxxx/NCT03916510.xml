  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of chemoradiotherapy (CRT), in combination with surgery is the standard of care in&#xD;
      the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer. However some patients don't respond well to&#xD;
      radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More advanced radiotherapy techniques, that result in fewer toxicities, means that we are now&#xD;
      able to combine new anti-cancer agents into standard treatment. Targeting the tumour early in&#xD;
      this way has the potential to improve response rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enadenotucirev is a specific type of anti-cancer virus that only targets cancer cells. It&#xD;
      acts in the same way as any virus and can only survive by replicating inside cancer cells and&#xD;
      not normal, non-cancerous cells. This means that it can selectively target and destroy&#xD;
      tumours, without directly affecting normal cells. It also has the ability to attract cells&#xD;
      from the body's immune system to help fight the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of enadenotucirev to standard chemoradiotherapy treatment may have a combined&#xD;
      effect on the cancer cells with potentially few, additional side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims to determine the optimal dose and frequency of the virus to give by gradually&#xD;
      increasing the number of doses each successive patient receives, and then increasing the dose&#xD;
      of the virus itself. Each patient will receive a minimum of 3 doses, up to a maximum of 8,&#xD;
      spread over the course of their 5 week standard chemoradiotherapy treatment. Patients will be&#xD;
      closely monitored at all times to ensure that with each dosing group, there aren't excessive&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then undergo surgery as part of their standard of care and be followed up for&#xD;
      up to 24 months to determine the long term effects of this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims to determine the optimal dose and frequency that can then be used in future&#xD;
      studies with the possibility of exploring the addition of Enadenotucirev to other&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy treatments.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present identifying novel radiosensitising agents in colorectal cancer is an area of high&#xD;
      need for patients considering sphincter preserving surgery or needing down staging to&#xD;
      facilitate surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the combination of Enadenotucirev with chemoradiation is novel, there is a wealth of&#xD;
      evidence to support the rationale for combining this class of agent with radiation and&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enadenotucirev is a group B oncolytic virus under development for the systemic treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic or advanced epithelial tumours. Enadenotucirev is a chimeric adenovirus type 11p&#xD;
      (Adp/adenovirus type 3 (Ad3) virus, discovered through a process of bio-selection from a&#xD;
      library of chimeric viruses produced from a pool of adenoviruses from seven different&#xD;
      serotypes utilizing human HT-29 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enadenotucirev shows selective and potent toxicity in humans carcinoma cells with only very&#xD;
      limited or no toxicity to normal (non-cancerous) human cells. Other than humans, there is no&#xD;
      known permissive species for Enadenotucirev. The principle advantage of oncolytic therapy is&#xD;
      that the virus replicates only in diseased cells meaning that the concentration of drug is&#xD;
      amplified at the site of pathology so that it is higher in the tumour than in healthy tissue.&#xD;
      Virus particles spread from cell to cell within a tumour nodule until they reach&#xD;
      non-permissive normal tissues, in principle destroying all viable tumour cells they&#xD;
      encounter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the overall understanding of the mechanism of action of Enadenotucirev in humans is&#xD;
      still under investigation, it is now well established from non-clinical and clinical studies&#xD;
      that the mechanism of anti-cancer efficacy of oncolytic viruses not only involves direct&#xD;
      infection and lysis of tumour cells, but that immune responses stimulated via an increased&#xD;
      release of tumour-associated antigens and immune-inflammatory activation signals play a key&#xD;
      role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CEDAR is dual endpoint, dose escalation phase 1 trial using a time to event continual&#xD;
      reassessment method (TiTECRM). Response and Toxicity endpoints will be combined in dose&#xD;
      escalation models to identify the optimal dose schedule. Dose decisions are made using the&#xD;
      statistical model instead of just using the data from that particular dose, as in the case of&#xD;
      3+3 model, meaning it uses all available data to make a dose decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This primary objective is to determine the optimal dose and frequency of the virus by firstly&#xD;
      gradually increasing the number of doses each successive patient receives, and then&#xD;
      increasing the dose of the virus itself. All participants will receive 3 loading doses in&#xD;
      weeks 1-2, prior to initiation of standard chemoradiotherapy. Further doses of Enadenotucirev&#xD;
      will either be given after or during and after standard chemoradiotherapy and this is&#xD;
      dependent on which of the 6 different dose groups they are assigned to. The dose given will&#xD;
      vary between either 1x1012 Viral Particles (VP) or 3x1012vp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will receive a minimum of 3 doses, up to a maximum of 8, spread over the course&#xD;
      of 9 weeks. Patients will be closely monitored at all times to ensure that with each dosing&#xD;
      group, there aren't excessive side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then undergo surgery as part of their standard of care and be followed up for&#xD;
      up to 24 months to determine the long term effects of this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on progression free survival and loco-regional failure will be requested from the&#xD;
      routine clinical care team at 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
