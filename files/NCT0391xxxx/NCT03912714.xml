  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The annual incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) amounts to 6-8 new cases per&#xD;
      100.000. Patients are initially treated medically, and colitis refractory to medical&#xD;
      management is treated surgically, mostly by means of an (emergency) colectomy or a&#xD;
      proctocolectomy with ileal J-pouch anastomosis. Over the past 10 years evidence has been&#xD;
      accumulating indicating that the appendix has an immunomodulatory role in patients with UC&#xD;
      reducing the need for medication and perhaps even colectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective of this prospective observational cohort study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of appendectomy on the disease course of patients with active ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      despite standard step-up treatment including biologicals. The second objective is to&#xD;
      determine if histological inflammation in the appendix resection specimens can be reliably&#xD;
      predicted by pre-operative endoscopic biopsies of the appendix and correlated to clinical and&#xD;
      pathological response after appendectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The design of the study is a prospective observational cohort study of 80&#xD;
      consecutive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Sixty patients of 18 years and older, with established diagnosis of UC and&#xD;
      ongoing disease activity despite standard step-up treatment including biologicals.&#xD;
      Furthermore, histological characteristics in appendix biopsies of 10 patients with non-active&#xD;
      UC and 10 'healthy control' patients (e.g. patients undergoing endoscopy for polyps) will be&#xD;
      evaluated and used as a reference control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients will undergo laparoscopic appendectomy in clinical or day care&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/objectives: The primary outcome parameter is the number of patients&#xD;
      achieving remission (Total Mayo score ≤2) 12 months after appendectomy. Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      are reduction of medical therapy, the disease activity as measured with the Mayo score,&#xD;
      colectomy rate, the health related quality of life and costs (EQ-5D, EORTC-QLQ-C30-QL and&#xD;
      IBDQ), and histological appendix characteristics predictive of response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a prospective observational series including patients with active&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis despite standard step-up treatment including biologicals. Sixty&#xD;
      consecutive patients who are refractory to medical treatment will be recruited to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of the appendectomy on the disease course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be counselled at the outpatient clinics. Patients with presumed&#xD;
      therapy-refractory inflammation will undergo ileocolonoscopy, which is part of standard daily&#xD;
      practice. When informed consent is given, the presence of a PARP will be documented, and&#xD;
      additional biopsies of the appendix and coecal base will be taken, to determine histological&#xD;
      inflammation grade. Active disease is required for inclusion, and is defined as a combined&#xD;
      clinical and endoscopic Mayo-score of ≥5 with an endoscopic subscore of 2 or 3. After&#xD;
      inclusion, a laparoscopic appendectomy will be performed within 9 weeks. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed every 3 months after laparoscopic appendectomy to assess the patients' clinical&#xD;
      condition and the non-invasive Mayo score. According to standard practice evaluating therapy&#xD;
      change, a sigmoidoscopy will be performed within 6 months and a full ileocolonoscopy at 12&#xD;
      months, including biopsies of the colon and coecal base, to assess mucosal appearance and&#xD;
      complete the Mayo score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, patients will receive the similar medical treatment as given&#xD;
      pre-appendectomy. If medication can be tapered post-appendectomy, this will be done according&#xD;
      to the experience of the treating physician and current guidelines. Patients will complete&#xD;
      health related quality of life questionnaires (EQ-5D, EORTC-QLQ-C30-QL and IBDQ) via email or&#xD;
      a telemedicine application (MyIBDcoach) at inclusion and at 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-operative endoscopic biopsies of the appendix will be used to determine if&#xD;
      histological inflammation in the appendix resection specimens can be reliably predicted.&#xD;
      Histological findings in the resection specimens will be correlated to clinical and&#xD;
      pathological response after appendectomy. Furthermore, in 20 patients who are planned for&#xD;
      colonoscopy (10 patients with non-active UC and 10 non-UC patients with polyps) additional&#xD;
      appendix biopsies will be taken to use as a reference control group. Therefore, a total of 80&#xD;
      patients will be recruited for this study.&#xD;

    <description>Surgery will be performed under general anaesthesia. The laparoscopic appendectomy can be performed with the use of 3 trocars; one subumbilical, one suprapubic and one in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen. The appendix is removed using a laparoscopic endostapler enabling a safe and complete appendectomy with the cross stapling line at coecal base. Laparoscopic appendectomy will be performed by a gastrointestinal surgeon with sufficient experience in laparoscopic appendectomies (&gt;20).</description>
