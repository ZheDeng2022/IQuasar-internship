      Surgical Crown lengthening (SCL) procedure facilitates restorative and prosthetic&#xD;
      rehabilitation to provide adequate clinical crown structure to teeth which are otherwise&#xD;
      compromised due to subgingival pathologies. One of the main advantages of the surgery is gain&#xD;
      in supragingival crown length which is desirable for restoring severely lost tooth structure.&#xD;
      This procedure provides increase in retention and resistance forms of the tooth necessary for&#xD;
      restorative treatment. Indications of this procedure are subgingival caries, crown &amp; root&#xD;
      fracture, short clinical abutments, cervical root resorption and altered passive eruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gargiulo et al. has given the concept of biologic width the distance between the base of the&#xD;
      gingival sulcus and height of alveolar crest) based on classic histologic study in humans. He&#xD;
      measured the average dimensions of epithelial junction and connective tissue attachment, the&#xD;
      summed value of these dimensions gave biological width (2.04mm=0.97mm+1.07mm). Later on,&#xD;
      Vacek et al.2 examined naturally occurring dimensions in human cadaver histomorphometrically&#xD;
      and measured mean dimensions for epithelial attachment (1.14 +/- 0.49 mm) and for connective&#xD;
      tissue attachment(0.77 +/- 0.32 mm). The average dimensions reported was approximately 2mm.&#xD;
      The importance of biologic width lies in the fact that the violation of this width leads to&#xD;
      gingival inflammation, attachment loss, and alveolar bone resorption. The integrity of&#xD;
      biologic width should be maintained while performing crown lengthening for healthy hard and&#xD;
      soft tissues, required for prosthetic and restorative rehabilitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevins M et al. and Ingber JS et al. proposed &quot;3mm rule&quot; for crown lengthening. According to&#xD;
      this, 3mm of alveolar bone should be removed during crown lengthening, but this can not be&#xD;
      applicable to all cases. Deas DE et al. in a study demonstrated significant tissue rebound&#xD;
      following crown lengthening which was found to be related to placement of flap with respect&#xD;
      to alveolar crest. More the distance between POST SUTURING Flap position and alveolar crest,&#xD;
      less was the tissue rebound observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osseous surgery in crown lengthening can be performed using rotary &amp; manual instruments like&#xD;
      carbide diamond burs, surgical chisels and files which leads to generation of heat,&#xD;
      post-operative discomfort, swelling and trismus. Vercellotti et al. proposed that&#xD;
      Piezosurgery is a new osteotomy procedure that requires microvibrations at ultrasonic&#xD;
      frequency facilitated to cut hard tissue, while soft tissue remained unaffected. The sites&#xD;
      treated with piezoelectric device had gain in bone level compared to sites treated by carbide&#xD;
      bur or diamond bur. Ma LI et al and Esteves JC et al in a study performed on animals,&#xD;
      demonstrated that the use of piezoelectric device in bone cutting showed advanced bone&#xD;
      healing compared to traditional bone cutting. Sortino et al. proposed that piezosurgery&#xD;
      osteotomy showed less post-operative complications (facial swelling, trismus, discomfort)&#xD;
      although it required longer time for surgery. Verardi S.et al. evaluated and proposed that&#xD;
      piezosurgery showed more favorable response in periodontal compromised patients in terms of&#xD;
      less chewing discomfort, less cold sensitivity and low pain perception at various time points&#xD;
      compared to conventional surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Till date, no studies have compared the periodontal healing, patient based perception of&#xD;
      pain, and discomfort after osseous resection in crown lengthening using piezosurgery with&#xD;
      conventional rotary instruments. The aim of this study is to comparatively evaluate,&#xD;
      clinically and radiographically,the changes in periodontal healing, surgical time required&#xD;
      and postoperative morbidity observed in patients undergoing osseous resection in crown&#xD;
      lengthening procedure with conventional rotary instruments versus piezoelectric device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present prospective, analytical, randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted&#xD;
      in the Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology, Post Graduate Institute of Dental&#xD;
      Sciences, Rohtak Systemically healthy patients age group 18-60years will participate in this&#xD;
      study. Each patient should have at least one tooth for conducting crown lengthening procedure&#xD;
      either in maxillary or mandibular arch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enlisted from the regular outpatient department of the Department of&#xD;
      Periodontics and Oral Implantology and Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology after&#xD;
      screening on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria . All participants will be given&#xD;
      an outline of the study design and all patient-specific considerations and concerns will be&#xD;
      properly addressed. All participants will be required to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
      All patients enrolled in the study will be further randomly divided into the following two&#xD;
      groups using computer-generated balanced block randomization table with 1:1 allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group - For osseous resection in crown lengthening procedure, conventional&#xD;
           rotary instruments will be used with copious irrigation of sterile saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test group-In this group piezoelectric device will be used for osseous resection in&#xD;
           crown lengthening procedure with copious irrigation of sterile saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group Before surgical procedure all clinical measurements will be recorded using&#xD;
      customized acrylic stents and radiograph will be taken. Administration of local anesthesia&#xD;
      will be done for nerve block. Incisions will be given based on width of keratinized gingiva.&#xD;
      Before resective surgery, the position of free gingival margins (FGM) will be recorded from&#xD;
      the stent which will be placed on teeth before surgery, using periodontal probe.&#xD;
      Intrasulcular incisions/internal bevel incisions will be given and elevation of full&#xD;
      thickness mucoperiosteal flap will be done in both buccal and lingual aspect. The osseous&#xD;
      resection will be performed based on presence amount of tooth structure to be gained for&#xD;
      future restorative rehabilitation. The ostectomy (removal of bone supporting teeth) will be&#xD;
      performed under combination of rotary instruments, bone chisels, carbide &amp; diamond burs with&#xD;
      copious saline irrigation &amp; maintenance of natural bone anatomy and architecture throughout&#xD;
      the procedure. Exposed root surfaces will be planed to prevent re-attachment and rebounding&#xD;
      of free gingival margins to its initial position. After planning, the surgical sites will be&#xD;
      closed after applying pressure for 3min and providing adaption. Suturing of flap shall be&#xD;
      done based on presence of supracrestal gingival tissues(SGT) acquired postoperatively&#xD;
      ,maintaining the preoperative dimensions of the SGT. Fixation of flap then placing apically&#xD;
      to ensure maximum facial &amp; lingual bone coverage. Measurements of parameter will be recorded&#xD;
      by single investigator before and after surgery and post operative instructions will be given&#xD;
      to patients once all procedure is completed. Patients will be recalled after 1week for suture&#xD;
      removal, to evaluate patient morbidity and for demonstration of good oral hygiene. Patients&#xD;
      will be re-evaluated at 3 &amp; 6 months post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test group All surgical procedure will be performed same as described in the control group&#xD;
      except for the use of piezoelectric device for osseous resection used in this group instead&#xD;
      of using conventional rotary instruments with carbide &amp; diamond burs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be prescribed an antibiotic, an anti-inflammatory/analgesic and an&#xD;
      antiseptic mouthwash starting from the day of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OUTCOME&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative patient perceived outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gain in crown length&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in alveolar bone level SECONDARY OUTCOME&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stability of supracrestal gingival tissues&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical time required Clinical parameters- Alginate impression will be made to provide&#xD;
           study casts for full arch fabrication of customized probing stents.The stent will cover&#xD;
           most of the tooth structure but away from gingival margins. The apical edge will be&#xD;
           considered as fixed reference line for probe measurements. The following parameters will&#xD;
           be recorded clinically and radiographically at baseline, 3 &amp; 6months follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gingival index(GI), according to Löe and Silness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plaque index(PI), according to Silness and Löe&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pocket probing depth(PPD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Free gingival margin(FGM; measured before surgery and after suturing i.e distance from&#xD;
           stent to free gingival margin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relative attachment level(RAL; measured before and after surgery i.e distance from stent&#xD;
           to base of pocket)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone level via transsulcular probing(BL-TSP; from stent under local anaesthesia before&#xD;
           surgery and after 6months )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supracrestal gingival tissues will be measured by SGT=BL-TSP - FGM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Direct bone level(DBL; before and after osseous resection measured from stent to osseous&#xD;
           crest)&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Postoperative pain using visual analog scale at treated site (VAS; a scale from 0-10; 0&#xD;
           means no pain/discomfort, 10 means maximum pain/discomfort). at these time point: 1st&#xD;
           day, 4th day and 7th day postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be asked to fill the given format which include visual analog scale diagram&#xD;
      ranging from 0-10 point scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic- Intra oral periapical radiographic evaluation of alveolar bone level will be&#xD;
      done at baseline, after surgery and 6 months post-operatively. By taking CEJ (cement enamel&#xD;
      junction) as a fixed reference point to alveolar bone crest, bone level will be measured at&#xD;
      various time periods using image j software. Standardised intraoral periapical radiographs&#xD;
      will be taken by using customized bite block with paralleling angle technique using Rinn XCP&#xD;
      holder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection And Methods All the data will be collected from calibrated and standardized&#xD;
      manual periodontal probe (CP-15 UNC SE,Hu Friedy, Chicago IL). Measurements will be made at&#xD;
      six sites on treated tooth(TT;&#xD;
      mid-facial,mid-lingual/palatal,mesio-buccal,mesio-lingual/palatal,disto-buccal,disto-lingual/&#xD;
      palatal)at four sites on adjacent tooth(AT; mesio-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual &amp;&#xD;
      disto-palatal/lingual)and at eight sites on non adjacent tooth(NA;tooth which is far from&#xD;
      treated tooth;mesio-buccal,mesiobuccal furcation, distobuccal furcation, disto-buccal,&#xD;
      mesio-lingual/palatal, mesio-lingual/palatal furcation, disto-lingual/palatal furcation,&#xD;
      disto-lingual/palatal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Data recorded will be processed by standard&#xD;
      statistical analysis. The normality of distribution of data will be examined by Shapiro Wilk&#xD;
      test. Statistical analysis will be performed according to distribution of data. If it is in&#xD;
      normal distribution, intra group comparison will be done by repeated ANOVA between different&#xD;
      time points followed by paired T test between two time points and inter group comparison will&#xD;
      be done by using Independent T test between two groups. If it is in non normal distribution,&#xD;
      intra group comparison will be done by Wilcoxon signed rank test and inter group comparison&#xD;
      will be done by Mann-Whitney U test. The Chi square test will be applied to analyze categoric&#xD;
      data. Correlation and association between predictors and dependent variables will be analyzed&#xD;
      by correlation analysis and regression analysis.&#xD;
