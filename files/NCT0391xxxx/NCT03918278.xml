  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2 part study. Part 1 is a dose escalation to determine the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      and to establish a preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) dose of MK-0482 administered&#xD;
      as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in participants with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors for which there is no available therapy which may convey clinical benefit. Part&#xD;
      2 is expansion cohort to determine safety and tolerability of MK-0482 in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab with and without chemotherapy in participants with advanced tumor specific&#xD;
      cohorts.&#xD;
