      RATIONALE: Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation may improve attention deficit&#xD;
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized-controlled trial study of treating attention deficit hyperactivity&#xD;
      disorder of school-aged children with transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation to see&#xD;
      how well it works compared to sham transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether true transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation(TEAS) administered&#xD;
      twice weekly for 4 weeks (8 sessions) compared to sham TEAS causes a significant improvement&#xD;
      in symptoms of ADHD according to the investigator-rated Clinical Global&#xD;
      Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scores at week 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the changes from baseline to week 4 of Clinical Global Impressions Scale-Severity&#xD;
      of Illness (CGI-S)，Conners'Parent Rating Scales-Revised: Short Form (CPRS-R: S) score,&#xD;
      Conners'Teacher Rating Scales-Revised: Short Form (CTRS-R: S) score, go/no-go task&#xD;
      performances, and the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin within the prefrontal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a single-center study. Patients are randomized to two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Patients receive TEAS twice weekly for 4 weeks . Arm II: Patients receive sham TEAS&#xD;
      twice weekly for 4 weeks .&#xD;

    <masking_description>Children with ADHD in the 2 groups were treated in separate treatment rooms and blinded on the intervention (i.e., true or sham TEAS). The TEAS operators could not be blinded to the treatment assignments. The data collectors, outcome assessors, and statisticians were blinded to group allocations.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-Improvement scale was used to evaluate the improvement, maintenance, or worsening of subjects' symptoms compared to baseline. The CGI-Improvement Scale includes seven options for scoring: 1 very much improved; 2 much improved; 3 minimally improved; 4 no change; 5 minimally worse; 6 much worse; and 7 very much worse. Clinical response at week 4 was defined as a rating of &quot;much&quot; or &quot;very much improved&quot; (1 or 2), which is considered a clinically meaningful response.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S includes seven options for scoring: 1 normal, not at all ill; 2 borderline mentally ill; 3 mildly ill; 4 moderately ill; 5 markedly ill; 6 severely ill; and 7 among the most extremely ill patients.</description>

    <measure>the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin within the prefrontal cortex</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>fNIRS was used to monitor the brain response when the participants performed a go/no-go task before and after TEAS or sham TEAS treatment. The ETG-4000 (Hitachi Medical Corporation, Japan) multichannel fNIRS system to measure the relative concentration changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO), with two wavelengths of nearinfrared light (695 and 830 nm). HbO signal is more sensitive to changes in cerebral blood flow than deoxygenated hemoglobin and total hemoglobin signals. Specifically, we used a 3 × 11 multichannel patch that consisted of 17 emitters and 16 detectors arranged alternately at an inter-probe distance of 3 cm forming 52 channels.</description>
