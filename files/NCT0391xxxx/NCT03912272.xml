  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are two related growing epidemics that&#xD;
      are becoming pressing public health concerns. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a&#xD;
      promising cost-effective and time-efficient exercise modality for managing obesity and NAFLD.&#xD;
      However, patients with obesity and NAFLD are generally inactive and unfit, and might feel&#xD;
      intimidated by the frequency of the prescribed HIIT (conventionally three times weekly).&#xD;
      Previous HIIT studies, mostly over 2-4 month periods, showed that the participants could&#xD;
      accomplish this exercise frequency under a controlled laboratory environment, but the&#xD;
      long-term adherence and sustainability, especially in a field setting, remains uncertain. The&#xD;
      situation is more unclear if we also consider those individuals who refused to participate&#xD;
      possibly because of their overwhelming perceptions or low self-efficacy toward HIIT. Thus,&#xD;
      logically, HIIT at a lower frequency would be practical and more suitable for patients with&#xD;
      obesity and NAFLD, but the minimum exercise frequency required to improve health, especially&#xD;
      in the long-term, is unknown. This proposed study aims to examine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      long-term low-frequency HIIT for improving body adiposity and liver fat in centrally obese&#xD;
      adults. The premise of this proposal is supported by recent findings that HIIT performed once&#xD;
      a week could improve cardiorespiratory fitness, blood pressure, cardiac morphology, metabolic&#xD;
      capacity, muscle power, and lean mass. This study will provide evidence for the benefits of&#xD;
      long-term low-frequency HIIT with a follow-up period to assess its effectiveness, safety,&#xD;
      adherence, and sustainability. We expect this intervention will enhance the practical&#xD;
      suitability of HIIT in inactive obese adults and will provide evidence for low-frequency HIIT&#xD;
      as a new exercise option in the management of obesity and NAFLD.&#xD;
