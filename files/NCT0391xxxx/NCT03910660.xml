      An open-label, multicenter, Phase 1b/2 study to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose and&#xD;
      assess the efficacy and safety of BXCL701 administered orally, as monotherapy and in&#xD;
      combination with PEMBRO, in patients with mCRPC. Patients enrolled in the Phase 2a portion of&#xD;
      the study will have either Small Cell Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer(SCNC)(Cohort A) or&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma phenotype (Cohort B), while the Phase 2b randomized portion of the study will&#xD;
      enroll only the histologic subtype(s) showing preliminary evidence in Phase 2a. The study&#xD;
      will also assess other efficacy parameters, such as rPFS, PSA PFS, OS, and DOR, as well as&#xD;
      the safety of the combined treatment. The study will consist of three components.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phase 1b: Safety and tolerability of the combination of BXCL701 administered once daily&#xD;
           (QD) on Days 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle plus PEMBRO 200 mg administered intravenously&#xD;
           (IV) on Day 1 of every 21 days will be assessed and confirmed in patients with mCRPC. In&#xD;
           the first cohort enrolled in the study, the initial dose level of BXCL701 will be 0.4&#xD;
           mg; if there are no safety concerns, this will be escalated to a total daily dose of 0.6&#xD;
           mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase 2a (Simon 2 Stage): Patients will be treated with BXCL701 in combination with&#xD;
           PEMBRO. Patients will be grouped in 1 of 2 cohorts based on phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohort A: Patients with any Small Cell/Neuroendocrine features, either de novo or&#xD;
                treatment-emergent included mixed SCNC.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cohort B: Cohort B: Patients with adenocarcinoma and no evidence of small cell or&#xD;
                neuroendocrine features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2b (for the histologic subtype[s] showing preliminary efficacy in Phase 2a): Patients&#xD;
      within a given subtype will be randomized 2:1 to receive either BXCL701 combined with PEMBRO&#xD;
      or BXCL701 monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1b:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be observed for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during Cycle 1. Three patients&#xD;
      will be treated initially with BXCL701 0.4 mg plus PEMBRO:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there are no DLTs in Cycle 1, the dose of BXCL701 will be escalated to a total daily&#xD;
           dose of 0.6 mg in the next cohort of 3 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If ≥1 of the 3 original patients has a DLT in Cycle 1, after a discussion between the&#xD;
           sponsor and the investigator, either 3 patients (if 1 patient experiences a DLT) or 6 to&#xD;
           9 patients (if 2 or 3 patients experiences a DLT) will be added at the 0.4 mg BXCL701&#xD;
           dose level. For this expanded 0.4 mg cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If none of the patients experience a DLT, consideration will be given to dose&#xD;
                escalation to BXCL701 0.6 mg plus PEMBRO&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If 1/3 of the patients experience a DLT, the Phase 2 can commence&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If &gt;1/3 of the patients experience a DLT, a discussion will be held between the&#xD;
                investigators and sponsors as to how to proceed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following dose escalation to BXCL701 0.6 mg plus PEMBRO in 3 patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there are no DLTs at this dose level, the Phase 2a can commence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If ≥1/3 patients have a DLT in Cycle 1, after a discussion between the sponsor and the&#xD;
           investigator, 6 to 9 patients will be added at the 0.6 mg BXCL701 total daily dose&#xD;
           level; and consideration of an alternate dosing (e.g., split dose) schedule may be&#xD;
           given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For this additional cohort of 6 to 9 patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If &lt;/= 1/3 of the patients experience a DLT, the Phase2a can commence.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If &gt;1/3 of the patients experience a DLT, consideration will be given to the use of&#xD;
                a 0.4 mg total daily dose of BXCL701, or an intermediate dose, plus PEMBRO in the&#xD;
                Phase 2a.&#xD;

             procedures or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patient is able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements,&#xD;
             including follow-up for overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has received treatment with &gt;2 cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for&#xD;
             castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Chemotherapy in the hormone-sensitive&#xD;
             setting does not count in this assessment provided the last dose was &gt;6 months before&#xD;
             study entry. A change in chemotherapy agents due to intolerance after brief exposure&#xD;
             may not count in this assessment, pending review with Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has received external-beam radiation or another systemic anticancer therapy&#xD;
             within 14 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, prior to study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has received treatment with an investigational systemic anticancer agent&#xD;
             within 14 days prior to study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has received prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-programmed&#xD;
             death ligand 2 (PD-L2) agent or with an agent directed to another co-inhibitory T-cell&#xD;
             receptor (e.g., cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 [CTLA-4], OX-40, CD137) or&#xD;
             requires concomitant treatment with DPP4 inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has an additional active malignancy that may confound the assessment of the&#xD;
             study endpoints. If the patient has a past cancer history (active malignancy within 2&#xD;
             years prior to study entry) with substantial potential for recurrence, this must be&#xD;
             discussed with the sponsor before study entry. Patients with the following concomitant&#xD;
             neoplastic diagnoses are eligible: non-melanoma skin cancer and carcinomas in situ&#xD;
             (including transitional cell carcinoma, anal carcinoma, and melanoma in situ).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled or any&#xD;
             New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure, uncontrolled angina,&#xD;
             history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina or stroke within 6 months prior to&#xD;
             study entry, uncontrolled hypertension or clinically significant arrhythmias not&#xD;
             controlled by medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. QT interval corrected for heart rate using Bazett's formula (QTcB) &gt;480 msec at&#xD;
             Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient has uncontrolled, clinically significant pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic&#xD;
             obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension) that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator would put the patient at significant risk for pulmonary complications&#xD;
             during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient has brain or leptomeningeal metastases that are symptomatic and progressive on&#xD;
             imaging. Patients with a history of central nervous system (CNS) metastases must have&#xD;
             received appropriate treatment. Central nervous system imaging is not required prior&#xD;
             to study entry unless there is a history of CNS involvement or clinical suspicion of&#xD;
             CNS involvement. Imaging of patients with a prior history of CNS metastases should be&#xD;
             compared to prior imaging to discern disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient has an active autoimmune disease or Grade ≥3 non-infectious pneumonitis that&#xD;
             has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease&#xD;
             modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy&#xD;
             (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for&#xD;
             adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) or treatment with drugs (e.g., neomercazol,&#xD;
             carbimazole) that function to decrease the generation of thyroid hormone by a&#xD;
             hyperfunctioning thyroid gland (e.g., in Graves' disease) is not considered a form of&#xD;
             systemic treatment of an autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             at a prednisone equivalent dose of &gt;10 mg daily for at least 1 week or other form of&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             uncontrolled infection, suspected or active SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection,&#xD;
             disseminated intravascular coagulation, or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patient has known positive status for human immunodeficiency virus, active or chronic&#xD;
             Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C. Screening is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patient has any medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, places&#xD;
             the patient at an unacceptably high risk for toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Any dysphagia, odynophagia, esophageal dysmotility or stricture, known GI&#xD;
             malabsorption syndrome, or intractable diarrhea that may significantly alter the&#xD;
             absorption of orally administered study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patients with history of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension within 3 months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure&#xD;
             (BP) of ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mmHg with assumption of an upright posture.&#xD;
