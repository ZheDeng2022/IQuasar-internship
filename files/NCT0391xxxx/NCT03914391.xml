    <textblock>
      Prostate gland is a clinically important male sexual organ and its main function is for the&#xD;
      production of semen. Globally, it is the second most common cancer in men globally and is&#xD;
      also the fifth cancer cause for death in male. Despite the improvement in the understanding&#xD;
      of prostate cancer, the current usage of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) as a&#xD;
      diagnostic marker is still not ideal. Many patients with elevated PSA and then subjected to&#xD;
      prostate biopsy were found to have no prostate cancer. Therefore, there is a need to discover&#xD;
      new biological markers to improve the current situation in diagnosis and also management of&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the earlier small-scale studies, urinary spermine levels have been shown to correlate&#xD;
      well with prostate cancer diagnosis and cancer aggressiveness. Due to its nature, it could&#xD;
      provide a more convenient and non-invasive method for detecting prostate cancer. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study was to collect urine samples to study the role of potential new urine&#xD;
      diagnostic markers (including Spermine and others) for prostate cancer diagnosis.&#xD;

      Prostate cancer (PC) is highly prevalent worldwide and is the second most commonly diagnosed&#xD;
      cancer in men globally and is the 5th leading cause of cancer death in men. 1 In some Asian&#xD;
      areas, even n with widely used serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) diagnostic testing, more&#xD;
      than 50% men with newly diagnosed PC are deemed to have high risk disease. 2 However, the&#xD;
      current use of serum PSA as a diagnostic marker is unsatisfactory. Many patients has elevated&#xD;
      serum PSA is actually due to other causes and also the level of serum PSA do not correlate&#xD;
      with the staging and grading of prostate cancer. 3 Moreover, the use of serum PSA required&#xD;
      blood taking which is invasive and non-convenience for large scale screening. Therefore,&#xD;
      newer markers is needed for more simple and accurate diagnosis of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One example of such cancer biomarkers are natural polyamines. Interests on these analytes&#xD;
      have been starting in 1971 when Russell reported a considerable increase of urinary&#xD;
      polyamines such as putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm) in patients with&#xD;
      various types of solid tumors and leukaemias. 4 Afterwards, polyamine studies focusing on&#xD;
      specific cancers continued, like cervical cancer, 5 colorectal cancer 6 and breast cancer, 7&#xD;
      etc. In investigators' recent study, investigators have explored the potential roles of&#xD;
      urinary polyamines as prostate cancer biomarkers were evaluated. Patients with prostate&#xD;
      cancer (PCa), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients and healthy controls (HC) showing&#xD;
      PSA&gt;4.0ng/ml were enrolled in the study.8 Their urine samples were obtained, and the urinary&#xD;
      levels of Put, Spd, Spm were determined by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography&#xD;
      coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS). Receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristics (ROC) curve and Student's t- test were used to evaluate their diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracies. Among the three biogenic polyamines, Spm had demonstrated a good diagnostic&#xD;
      performance when comparing their levels in PCa patients with BPH patients (1.47 in PCa vs&#xD;
      5.87 in BPH; p&lt;0.0001). The results were in accordance with transrectal ultrasound prostatic&#xD;
      biopsy (TRUSPB) results, with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.83Â±0.03. Therefore,&#xD;
      urinary Spm could have a potential to serve as a novel PCa diagnostic biomarker, which in&#xD;
      turn could help to address the limited sensitivity and specificity problem of serum PSA test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, investigators would like to have a larger scale study, with inclusion of subjects&#xD;
      from different geographic locations, to further assess the correlation spermine and other&#xD;
      potential newer urine markers with diagnosis of prostate cancer and investigate their role as&#xD;
      a potential non-invasive marker for prostate cancer risk stratification and prognosis&#xD;
      prediction.&#xD;
