  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      APG-2449 is a novel, orally active, multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which inhibits&#xD;
      FAK, ALK, and ROS1 with nanomolar potencies. In preclinical studies, APG-2449 demonstrated&#xD;
      potent antiproliferative activity in various cancer cell lines as a single agent. In&#xD;
      combination treatment, APG-2449 enhanced anti-proliferative activities of several&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic and targeted agents. It is indicated that APG-2449 may have a broad&#xD;
      therapeutic potential for the treatment of human cancer as a single agent and in combination&#xD;
      with other classes of anticancer drugs. APG-2449 is intended for the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors. Upon completion of the Phase 1 dose escalation study to establish&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and/or recommended phase 2&#xD;
      dose (RP2D), several phase Ib/II studies will be implemented accordingly.&#xD;
