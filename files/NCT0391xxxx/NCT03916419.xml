      Building upon the clinical experience of the investigators with the magnetic resonance&#xD;
      (MR)-guided radiation therapy system and applying principals of hypofractionation toward the&#xD;
      current treatment paradigm of concurrent chemoradiation and consolidation immunotherapy for&#xD;
      locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), this prospective, single-arm Phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial with safety lead-in will test the feasibility and outcomes of this approach.&#xD;

    <description>The first 6 patients enrolled on study will comprise the Safety Lead-In cohort and will be closely monitored for toxicity related specifically to the experimental chemoradiation portion of the study treatment. After these 6 patients have been enrolled, accrual will temporarily be suspended for a minimum of 6 months after completion of chemoradiation to allow for the evaluation of adverse events.&#xD;
Patients will receive concurrent chemoradiation over the course of 3 weeks (15 fractions of radiation with online adaptive treatment planning at fractions 6, 9, and 12 and weekly carboplatin + paclitaxel). Four to 6 weeks after the end of chemoradiation, durvalumab immunotherapy will administered every two weeks for up to 12 months.</description>
