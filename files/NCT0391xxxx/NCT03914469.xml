  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to evaluate a tele-based behavioral change intervention&#xD;
      for older adults (aged 50 years and older) with chronic low back pain (cLBP) and comorbid&#xD;
      depression, and to ultimately assess its effect on cLBP-related disability and depressive&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will conduct a pilot randomized control trial to assess feasibility for older&#xD;
      adults with chronic low back pain and depression to receive a behavioral change tele-based&#xD;
      intervention delivered by a health coach trained in motivational interviewing. All&#xD;
      participants, regardless of intervention arm assigned, will undergo outcomes assessments&#xD;
      (baseline, mid-point, final assessments) conducted by a blinded research assistant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will assess the feasibility of a tele-delivered behavioral change intervention&#xD;
      among older adults (aged 50 and older) with chronic low back pain and depression. Fifty&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups, behavioral intervention arm&#xD;
      (n=25) versus the waitlist control arm (n=25). The active intervention will include eight&#xD;
      tele-delivered health coach sessions, three tele-based outcome assessments, and up to two&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews within 6 months of completion, post-intervention. Each tele-based&#xD;
      outcome assessment is roughly 45-60 minutes and will be conducted by a member of the research&#xD;
      team. Each intervention session will be delivered by a trained health coach over a period of&#xD;
      10-20 weeks (up to 5 months total, accounting for additional time between sessions if&#xD;
      needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first session will introduce the participant to the health coach and the program,&#xD;
      establish rapport, and measure baseline physical activity. The following six sessions address&#xD;
      behavioral determinants, followed by a final session designed to be a booster session to the&#xD;
      overall program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Omron pedometer will be provided to each participant for the assessment of physical&#xD;
      activity. The Omron pedometer will be set up by a member of the research team (e.g., stride&#xD;
      length, setting date/time) and will be mailed to the participant's home address between&#xD;
      sessions one and two. Each participant will receive a courtesy phone call when the pedometer&#xD;
      is mailed and will be asked to call the research coordinator when it arrives. The research&#xD;
      team will provide technical assistance and instructions to the participant regarding use. The&#xD;
      pedometer is intended to be worn on the waist band, daily, with the exception of times when&#xD;
      the participant may shower or bathe. The research team will verbally instruct the participant&#xD;
      on how to press the mode and memory buttons in order to provide weekly step counts for&#xD;
      tracking physical activity. The participants will be prompted by the health coach or research&#xD;
      staff to report step counts during subsequent weekly tele-based coaching sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the investigators are interested in better understanding feasibility of the&#xD;
      intervention as compared to the waitlist control, and how behaviors are sustained over time,&#xD;
      the study involves follow-up to 6 months. Investigators will use these follow-up data to&#xD;
      better understand differential attrition as well as preliminary formative implementation&#xD;
      evaluation. Using purposive sampling, investigators will conduct ~ 10 in-depth&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews. Each interview will occur ~six months post-intervention and will&#xD;
      include key stakeholders from the following groups: study participants from each arm of the&#xD;
      pilot study, the health coach, primary care and mental health providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research staff will select participants identified as higher risk for drop-out, less&#xD;
      engaged, or were particularly successful at achieving behavioral change. The purpose of the&#xD;
      final interviews is to learn about the barriers and facilitators to successful intervention&#xD;
      delivery and participant retention from the perspectives of the enrolled patients, health&#xD;
      coach, and providers. Interview topics will borrow from components of the well-established&#xD;
      framework, Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS).&#xD;
      Semi-structured interview strategy is informed by two Promoting Action on Research&#xD;
      Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) dimensions: context-how the microsystem (UTSW)&#xD;
      impacts behavioral change uptake, for example, potential facilitators to intervention&#xD;
      implementation; facilitation-identifying specific ways to augment the likelihood of&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;
