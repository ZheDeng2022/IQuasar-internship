  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the symptomatic benefits of immunomodulatory&#xD;
      treatment with IVIG for POTS (postural tachycardia syndrome) patients with evidence of&#xD;
      autoimmunity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gammunex-C, a form of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), is approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (CIDP) or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura&#xD;
      (ITP). IVIG has been in use for many decades in the treatment of these disorders and many&#xD;
      other inflammatory/autoimmune diseases. It is generally very safe and well tolerated. More&#xD;
      recently, IVIG has been proposed as an effective treatment for presumed inflammatory&#xD;
      neurological disorders which do not meet the criteria for CIDP. Specifically, case reports&#xD;
      and cases series have indicated therapeutic responses to IVIG in autonomic neuropathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous Albumin is approved for the treatment of hypovolemia (see attached package&#xD;
      insert). The use of albumin to increase plasma volume in patients with POTS has been&#xD;
      suggested. In this study, albumin will be used as an active control treatment to provide the&#xD;
      same volume and protein load as IVIG but without the immunomodulatory effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been few well designed clinical therapy trials aimed at POTS patients and even&#xD;
      fewer that are aimed at a particular pathophysiological subtype of POTS. Evidence suggests&#xD;
      that POTS is a heterogeneous disorder with differing underlying mechanisms. Several&#xD;
      uncontrolled case series have suggested a benefit of IVIG for POTS, but the volume expansion&#xD;
      associated with infusion of IVIG make it difficult to assess the immunomodulatory effects of&#xD;
      this treatment. We propose to evaluate the efficacy of IVIG using a double-blind randomized&#xD;
      cross over design that will determine efficacy while reducing effects of inter-subject&#xD;
      variability and placebo effect which are common problems in POTS therapy research. Even with&#xD;
      the statistical advantages of a crossover design, the treatment cohort will be small, and&#xD;
      this study is designed to be a pilot (phase II) study to evaluate the feasibility,&#xD;
      tolerability and potential benefits of treatment. The results of this pilot study will&#xD;
      provide the impetus and rationale for a larger multicenter clinical trial to definitively&#xD;
      evaluate immunomodulatory treatment in POTS.&#xD;
