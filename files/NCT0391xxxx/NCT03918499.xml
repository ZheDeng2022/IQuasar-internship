      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects of IRX-2, cyclophosphamide, and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      work in treating participants with gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer that has come&#xD;
      back or that has spread to other places in the body. Interleukins, such as those found in&#xD;
      IRX-2, are proteins made by white blood cells and other cells in the body and may help&#xD;
      regulate immune response. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and&#xD;
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving RX-2,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, and pembrolizumab may work better in treating participants with gastric or&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junction cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety profile of combination IRX-2 regimen and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the overall response rate of IRX-2 regimen combined with pembrolizumab using&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and immune modified RECIST&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate initial median progression-free and overall survival in these patients&#xD;
      treated with combination IRX-2 regimen and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the circulating T cell profiles in patients before and after therapy with&#xD;
      combination IRX-2 regimen and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the baseline and post-treatment tumor tissue immune gene expression profiling&#xD;
      using the Nanostring platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore identification of tumor tissue neoantigens through a multiplex proteomic&#xD;
      assay (MHC-PepSeq) paired with tumor genomic and transcriptomic sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore putative biomarkers (including circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]&#xD;
      and immune cell profiles) in peripheral blood to generate hypotheses for response to&#xD;
      treatment with combination IRX-2 regimen and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Participants&#xD;
      also receive cyclophosphamide IV on day 1 and IRX-2 subcutaneously (SC) for 10 days starting&#xD;
      on day 4 during cycles 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, and 33. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for up to 35 cycles in the absence of disease or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 30 days and then up to&#xD;
      1 year.&#xD;
