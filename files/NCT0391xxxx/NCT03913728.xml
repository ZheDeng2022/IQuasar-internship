  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective single-centre randomised controlled trial to examine the&#xD;
      feasibility of a fully powered randomised controlled trial to examine if HPLC-SRM-MS guided&#xD;
      intervention is superior to standard clinical care in improving clinical, behavioural and&#xD;
      health-economy outcomes in RA patients prescribed MTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will consist of 4 stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening (~-2 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment, consent, randomisation, data collection, examination and blood sampling -&#xD;
           baseline visit 1 (time point 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention - telephone appointment (visit 2, intervention arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcome - visit 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Process evaluation - visit 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to any trial specific procedures, the participant must have signed the informed consent&#xD;
      form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will offer a small financial compensation for successfully recruited patients&#xD;
      toward the costs of parking/refreshments/travel costs/inconvenience related to attending&#xD;
      visits&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects up to 1% of the adult population. It is a condition that is&#xD;
      treatable by medications. Methotrexate (MTX) is the first-line therapy for RA however, up to&#xD;
      60% of patients prescribed MTX still have active RA. This puts these patients at higher risk&#xD;
      of joint damage compared to those whose RA is under control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One important explanation for the poor control in those who receive treatment is that some&#xD;
      patients, for many reasons, do not take their medications as recommended (non-adherence).&#xD;
      Non-adherence is associated with increased costs to the NHS and reduced response to MTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess whether it is achievable to conduct a much larger study to explore&#xD;
      whether a review of how well patients are coping with MTX can improve RA control.&#xD;
      Understanding the reasons for poor RA control has the potential to improve the health and&#xD;
      well-being of individual patients, avoid unnecessary tests and hospital appointments and save&#xD;
      money in healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will recruit 50 patients with RA who have been prescribed MTX for more than 2&#xD;
      years. 25 patients will be asked to donate blood samples and complete questionnaires, but&#xD;
      their treatment will continue as standard. The blood tests will include patients MTX levels.&#xD;
      The results of the test provide a direct measure of medication adherence. For the other 25&#xD;
      patients, the results of the blood tests will be fed back to them with tailored targeting of&#xD;
      the main reason(s) for the deviation from the prescribed MTX. At the end of the study, the&#xD;
      investigators will assess the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial of a biochemical&#xD;
      screening of adherence guided intervention in patients with RA treated with MTX.&#xD;
