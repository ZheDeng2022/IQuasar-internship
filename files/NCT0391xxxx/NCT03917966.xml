      The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210&#xD;
      combined with preoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In China, the incidence of esophageal cancer has declined in recent years, but the mortality&#xD;
      rate has been ranked fourth. Morbidity and mortality were ranked sixth and fourth in all&#xD;
      malignancies, respectively. Therefore, esophageal cancer has always been a major malignant&#xD;
      tumor that threatens the health of our residents. Investigator designed a single-arm,&#xD;
      open-label, phase II trial of SHR-1210 combined with preoperative chemotherapy for locally&#xD;
      advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The purpose of this study is to observe and&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210 combined with preoperative chemotherapy for&#xD;
      locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
