  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the impact of traditional group fitness versus a game-based fitness&#xD;
      program, designed to maximize enjoyment, on physical fitness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fewer than 1 in 10 middle-aged US adults get the recommended amount of aerobic physical&#xD;
      activity (PA), greatly increasing their chances of heart disease and stroke. There are over&#xD;
      50 million adults with fitness center memberships, which are used only once per month and,&#xD;
      after joining new programs, people quickly stop coming. While many barriers to PA have been&#xD;
      cited (e.g., time, cost), the investigators believe that a key, modifiable, and&#xD;
      underappreciated barrier is that most adults simply do not enjoy physical activity enough to&#xD;
      do it regularly. Studies consistently observe that people who enjoy physical activity more&#xD;
      are more likely to be more active in the future. Despite this consistent observation, the&#xD;
      investigators are not aware of studies that ask &quot;Would an adult PA program designed to&#xD;
      maximize enjoyment increase PA adherence and fitness?&quot;. In 2015, our team set out to design&#xD;
      an exercise program for adults that maximized enjoyment. Taking inspiration from Pickleball,&#xD;
      a popular game of modified tennis, our team created PlayFit. PlayFit is an exercise program&#xD;
      in which adults come together three times each week to play a range of sports, all modified&#xD;
      to 1) reduce effort (e.g., smaller playing area), 2) reduce injuries (e.g., lightweight&#xD;
      low-pressure balls) and 3) reduce competitiveness (e.g., teams chosen randomly, minimize&#xD;
      physical contact, no keeping score). Pilot work in the summer of 2016 with 22 adults&#xD;
      identified five modified sports that all had Metabolic Equivalent (MET) levels between 5.5&#xD;
      and 6.5 and high satisfaction scores (average of 8.0 out of 10). More importantly, the&#xD;
      comments suggest that the investigators have created a social, enjoyable experience: &quot;that&#xD;
      was SO much fun&quot;, &quot;I've never had so much fun playing soccer&quot;. People liked &quot;the laughter&#xD;
      during the games&quot;, &quot;no pressure, not competitive&quot; and that &quot;it's not about ability, it's just&#xD;
      about having fun with people&quot;. In this study, the investigators propose testing whether&#xD;
      PlayFit leads to greater fitness gains, compared to group fitness, to help providers&#xD;
      understand in a way that helps providers and fitness center staff understand: &quot;What exercise&#xD;
      program should I recommend to promote long-term adherence and fitness?&quot;. All subjects will be&#xD;
      expected to exercise three-times weekly for 60 minutes for 12 months. The investigators will&#xD;
      randomly assign 360adults to two conditions: 1) Group Fitness activities and 2) PlayFit. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that both PlayFit and Group Fitness will increase Maximum Oxygen&#xD;
      Uptake (V02max) significantly at 6 months but, after 12 months, mediated by greater enjoyment&#xD;
      and higher adherence, participants randomized to PlayFit will have greater fitness and&#xD;
      activity gains at 12 months than Group Fitness. The results of this study have the potential&#xD;
      to help patients, providers and fitness center directors by answering the question: &quot;What&#xD;
      exercise program should be recommended to sedentary adults in order to promote long-term&#xD;
      adherence and fitness?&quot;&#xD;

    <description>Maximum Oxygen Uptake (V02Max), a measure of aerobic Fitness, will be assessed using a maximal graded treadmill test, using a Bruce protocol and heart rate and expired gas monitoring (74). V02Max is calculated based on the millilitres of oxygen consumed per kilogram of body mass per minute (e.g., mL/(kgÂ·min)).</description>
