      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation can play a role in diseases like heart disease and rheumatoid arthritis. PET&#xD;
      scans can help detect inflammation. Two new drugs may create better PET images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if the drugs [11C]ER176 and [11C]MC1 can help image inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with rheumatoid arthritis or idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers enrolled in protocol 01-M-0254 or 17-M-0181 are also needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy participants will be screened under protocol 01-M-0254 or 17-M-0181.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with arthritis or IIM will have a screening visit. This will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible CT or X-ray: A machine will take pictures of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy participants will have 1 or 2 visits. They may have urine tests. They may take the&#xD;
      drug celecoxib by mouth. They will have a PET scan. A small amount of one or both study drugs&#xD;
      will be injected through a catheter: A needle will guide a thin plastic tube into an arm&#xD;
      vein. Another catheter will draw blood. They will like on a bed that slides into a machine.&#xD;
      Their vital signs and heart activity will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with arthritis will have up to 2 visits after screening. They may take celecoxib&#xD;
      and have PET scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with IIM will have up to 3 visits after screening. At 1 or 2 visits, they will&#xD;
      take celecoxib and have PET scans. They will have 1 visit where they have an MRI: They will&#xD;
      lie on a table that slides into a machine. The machine takes pictures of the body.&#xD;

      I. Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) are both implicated in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of various inflammatory disorders, suggesting that both may serve as&#xD;
      potential biomarkers of inflammation in brain as well as periphery. Our laboratory recently&#xD;
      developed two new radioligands: [11C]ER176 to image TSPO and [11C]MC1 to image COX-2. Using&#xD;
      wholebody imaging, this study seeks to determine whether PET imaging using these new&#xD;
      radioligands can differentiate two inflammatory conditions-rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and&#xD;
      idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM)-from healthy conditions. To determine if [11C]MC1&#xD;
      uptake is specific to COX-2, we will also conduct a blocking study with a selective COX-2&#xD;
      inhibitor (celecoxib) in both [11C]MC1 and [11C]ER176 scans; celecoxib is expected to block&#xD;
      uptake of [11C]MC1 but not [11C]ER176. Using brain-dedicated imaging, this seeks to determine&#xD;
      whether RA patients and healthy volunteers have specific binding in brain - i.e., uptake that&#xD;
      can be blocked celecoxib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers (n = 17), patients with RA (n = 15), and patients with IIM (n = 15) will&#xD;
      undergo whole-body PET/CT. In addition, healthy volunteers (n = 12) and patients with RA (n&#xD;
      =12) will have brain-dedicated imaging using [11C]MC1 concurrent with arterial blood&#xD;
      sampling. Finally, 15 patients with RA will be imaged during a period of moderate to severe&#xD;
      symptoms and after clinically-indicated treatment for two to four months.Thus, the entire&#xD;
      population will be healthy volunteers (n = 29), patients with RA (n = 42), and patients with&#xD;
      IIM (n = 15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phase 1: We will begin by injecting up to 10 mCi of [11C]MC1 in one healthy male and one&#xD;
           healthy female and then conducting a whole body PET scan. Uptake will be measured in the&#xD;
           ovaries and testes, and the dose of radioactivity will be calculated. We will proceed&#xD;
           only if the dose to these organs with the higher injected activity proposed for Phase 2&#xD;
           will not exceed the limits specified by the Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase 2: Fifteen RA patients, 15 IIM patients, and 15 age-, sex-, and genotypematched&#xD;
           healthy subjects will undergo two whole-body PET/CT scans using 15 mCi of [11C]ER176 on&#xD;
           one day and two whole-body PET/CT scans using 15 mCi of [11C]MC1 on another day. The&#xD;
           first scan on each day will serve as the baseline scan for comparison; the second scan&#xD;
           on each day will be a blocking study using celecoxib. The [11C]ER176 scans are not&#xD;
           mandatory and will be requested at the discretion of the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Phase 3: Twelve RA patients and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects will undergo&#xD;
           two brain-dedicated PET/CT scans, each using 20 mCi [11C]MC1, and concurrent with&#xD;
           arterial blood sampling. The first scan will be a baseline scan, and the second will be&#xD;
           after blockade by celecoxib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Phase 4: Fifteen RA participantstients will be imaged twice with [11C]MC: while having&#xD;
           moderate to severe symptoms and after clinically-indicated therapy for about two to four&#xD;
           months. Participants will have can after injection of 15 mCi of [11C]MC1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      For whole body imaging, radioligand uptake in a selected region of interest will be&#xD;
      quantified as a Standardized Uptake Value (SUV), which normalizes for injected activity and&#xD;
      body weight. Possible differences in actual blood radioligand level will be adjusted by&#xD;
      venous blood data obtained during the PET scan. Regional uptake after blockade with celecoxib&#xD;
      will be expressed as a percentage of the baseline value. The baseline uptake and the&#xD;
      percentage blockade by celecoxib of each radioligand will be compared between patients and&#xD;
      healthy subjects as well as between inflamed and non-inflamed regions of the body in RA and&#xD;
      IIM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For brain-dedicated imaging, the density of COX-2 will be measured with pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      modeling and expressed as distribution volume (VT).&#xD;
