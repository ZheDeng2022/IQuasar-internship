    <textblock>
      This study will compare two anesthetics techniques called Dural Puncture Epidural (DPE) and&#xD;
      Standard Epidural as to which of the two can provide faster and potentially better at&#xD;
      providing pain relief for cesarean sections. It will also compare these two anesthetics&#xD;
      techniques on the percentage of women who require additional drugs to control pain during&#xD;
      their cesarean deliveries. The results of this study will help anesthesiologists know which&#xD;
      anesthetic technique can provide faster and potentially better at providing pain relief for&#xD;
      cesarean sections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the onset time of anesthesia between standard epidural&#xD;
      and Dural Puncture Epidural (DPE) for cesarean delivery. The study will hypothesize that a&#xD;
      DPE technique with a 25-gauge spinal needle will have a faster onset and improved quality of&#xD;
      surgical anesthesia when compared to a standard epidural. Participants will be blinded to&#xD;
      which group they are being assigned. An unblinded anesthesiologist will insert the epidural&#xD;
      or DPE based on randomization. After insertion of the epidural or DPE, a low dose local&#xD;
      anesthetic infusion will be infused into the epidural catheter up until the time of surgery.&#xD;
      This is the standard infusion used to provide pain relief in laboring women (bupivacaine&#xD;
      0.0625% with 2 mcg/ml fentanyl). In this way participants enrolled in the study would mimic&#xD;
      anesthetic the conditions of a &quot;labor epidural&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then move on to the next phase of the study. In this phase, the epidural&#xD;
      pump will be discontinued, and anesthesia care will be conducted in the same manner as all&#xD;
      cesarean deliveries under epidural extension anesthesia (this refers to the process of&#xD;
      providing anesthesia using a pre-existing epidural/DPE that was inserted for the purpose of&#xD;
      providing labor analgesia). Anesthesia will be induced in a standardized manner with 20 ml of&#xD;
      3% chloroprocaine. Motor and sensory block will be tested at the end of the epidural loading&#xD;
      dose. Loss of sharp sensation will be measured using a blunt plastic neurotip® (Owen Mumford,&#xD;
      USA) until a sensory bilateral block to the T6 dermatomal level has been reached. The T6&#xD;
      level measured at the xiphoid process will be marked bilaterally with a washable marker pen&#xD;
      to guarantee the precision of the primary endpoint (which will be assumed when sensory block&#xD;
      goes above T6). Sensory testing will be performed from caudad to cephalad (i.e. from blocked&#xD;
      to unblocked dermatomes) to identify the first unblocked dermatome. To identify the level&#xD;
      where the sensation of touch is first appreciated, the investigator will ask the question:&#xD;
      &quot;Tell me when you feel the sensation of something sharp touching your skin.&quot; Both the motor&#xD;
      and sensory block evaluations are part of the standard clinical care of patients receiving&#xD;
      neuraxial anesthesia. The main difference for participants enrolled in the study is that the&#xD;
      frequency of sensory assessments will be increased so that the onset of surgical anesthesia&#xD;
      can be accurately documented (approximately every minute and then more frequently as the&#xD;
      sensory block approaches the primary endpoints). A second anesthesiologist, blind to the type&#xD;
      of block will manage the clinical care of the patient from the beginning of the study (after&#xD;
      epidural catheter placement) and will administer the induction drug (prepared by that&#xD;
      anesthesiologist as per SOC). There will be no difference in this clinician's care of the&#xD;
      subject than if she were not enrolled in the study. This will assess the onset of anesthesia&#xD;
      and manage all aspects of the subject's clinical care including the documentation of the&#xD;
      local anesthetic (LA) solution administration timing and its clinical effects. The speed of&#xD;
      onset will be assessed from the end of epidural test dose. This will be defined as time zero&#xD;
      and the start of anesthesia. If required, intra-operative analgesia will be offered in the&#xD;
      form of further epidural top-up, intravenous fentanyl, ketamine, nitrous oxide or replacement&#xD;
      of neuraxial anesthesia/conversion into general anesthesia as the standard of care (SOC).&#xD;
