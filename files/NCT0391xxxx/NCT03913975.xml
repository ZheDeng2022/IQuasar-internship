  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current project is to determine the effects of augmented neuromuscular&#xD;
      training on brain neuroplasticity. Specifically we aim to evaluate the potential of augmented&#xD;
      NMT (aNMT) to alter brain neural performance as evidenced by EEG and functional brain&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The changes in EEG and MRI (pre vs. post) will be compared&#xD;
      over the same period of time. We hypothesize that the aNMT will influence adaptive brain&#xD;
      strategies in young girls.&#xD;

      The purpose of the current project is to determine the effects of augmented neuromuscular&#xD;
      training on brain neuroplasticity. Specifically we aim to evaluate the potential of standard&#xD;
      augmented NMT (aNMT) to alter brain neural performance as evidenced by EEG and functional&#xD;
      brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The changes in EEG and MRI (pre vs. post) will be&#xD;
      compared over the same period of time. We hypothesize that aNMT will influence adaptive brain&#xD;
      strategies in young girls and simultaneously will improve joint mechanics in evidence-based&#xD;
      measures collected in realistic, sport-specific virtual reality scenarios. The human brain is&#xD;
      a highly complex multilayered organ composed of many billions of neurons (1 trillion brain&#xD;
      cells and 100 billion neurons), organized into very complicated interconnecting neural&#xD;
      networks. Typically, each neuron is connected to tens of thousands of other neurons through&#xD;
      connections called synapses. Electrochemical signals that are passed between neurons through&#xD;
      these synapses allow them to communicate. The connections between neurons are not static, but&#xD;
      change over time. The more signals sent between two neurons, the stronger the connection&#xD;
      grows, and so, with each new experience, the brain slightly rewires its physical and&#xD;
      functional structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unique local physical and functional connections between neurons are called neural networks.&#xD;
      Neural networks are typically characterized by preferred signaling pathways, and it is the&#xD;
      interactions within and between these networks of neurons that enable us to perform various&#xD;
      functions including cognitive functions, such as attention, working memory, pattern&#xD;
      recognition and problem-solving. It is this simultaneous cooperative function of brain areas&#xD;
      working together as large-scale networks which is at the root of the sophistication and&#xD;
      computational power of the human brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Event Related Potentials (ERPs), which are temporal reflections of the neural mass electrical&#xD;
      activity of cells in specific regions of the brain that occur in response to stimuli, may&#xD;
      offer such a measure, as they provide both a noninvasive and portable index of brain&#xD;
      function. The ERPs provide excellent temporal information, but spatial resolution for ERPs&#xD;
      has traditionally been limited. However, by using high-density electroencephalograph (EEG)&#xD;
      recording spatial resolution for ERPs has improved significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no direct, reliable, bed-side, and non-invasive method for assessing&#xD;
      changes in brain activity associated with concussion. Event Related Potentials (ERPs), which&#xD;
      are temporal reflections of the neural mass electrical activity of cells in specific regions&#xD;
      of the brain that occur in response to stimuli, may offer such a method, as they provide both&#xD;
      a noninvasive and portable measure of brain function. The ERPs provide excellent temporal&#xD;
      information, but spatial resolution for ERPs has traditionally been limited. However, by&#xD;
      using high-density electroencephalograph (EEG) recording spatial resolution for ERPs is&#xD;
      improved significantly. The paradigm for the current study will combine neurophysiological&#xD;
      knowledge with mathematical signal processing and pattern recognition methods (BNA™) to&#xD;
      temporally and spatially map brain function, connectivity and synchronization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will provide additional evidence for the utility and contribution of the&#xD;
      BNA™ test (reflecting temporal and spatial changes in brain activity as well as brain&#xD;
      functional connectivity associated with concussion) in concussion management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BNA test is basically divided to 3 phases - first EEG data is collected from subjects&#xD;
      using an EEG system and while the subject is performing a computerized cognitive task. The&#xD;
      EEG data is then analyzed using the advanced BNA™ technology and last a report of the BNA™&#xD;
      test is generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroimaging, specifically functional magnetic resonance imaging provides improved spatial&#xD;
      data relative to EEG and provides another measure of neuroplasticity to gain the full&#xD;
      pictures of training effects on the brain. Previous literature supporting its ability to&#xD;
      detect differences in those with ACL injury strengthens the use of fMRI. We will be assessing&#xD;
      the full brain response during a knee extension task using previously established methods ACL&#xD;
      deficient and reconstructed knees. Recent investigations into gait retraining with fMRI&#xD;
      pre-post testing have created the neural correlates of gait training based on ankle&#xD;
      dorsiflexion. In the same way, this study will apply a similar paradigm utilizing knee&#xD;
      extension to understand the neuroplasticity associated with lower extremity neuromuscular&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
