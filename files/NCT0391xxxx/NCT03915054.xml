  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical use of IVM was pioneered in the nineties, but has not yet become a realistic option&#xD;
      for wide-scale practice, for several reasons. Fundamentally, despite recent progress in&#xD;
      improving the implantation and the pregnancy rates using in-vitro matured oocytes, results of&#xD;
      IVM remain lower than treatment cycles utilizing conventional ART. To improve the outcome of&#xD;
      IVM cycles, this study focuses on improving in-vitro culture conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-vitro maturation (IVM) of human oocytes obtained from minimally stimulated or unstimulated&#xD;
      ovaries offers a more &quot;patient friendly&quot; treatment option than the conventional Assisted&#xD;
      Reproductive Technology (ART) treatment with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH).&#xD;
      Typically, IVM will be offered to women with polycystic ovaries (PCO/PCOS), or to patients&#xD;
      with an excellent ovarian reserve, i.e. a high antral follicle count. IVM treatment is&#xD;
      characterized by minimal administration of FSH or hMG and NO hCG trigger. The IVM approach is&#xD;
      less disruptive to patients' daily life through the reduced need for hormonal and ultrasound&#xD;
      monitoring, avoids a range of minor and major complications, such as ovarian hyperstimulation&#xD;
      syndrome, and aims to reduce the total cost of infertility treatment for the patient and for&#xD;
      the health care budget.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human oocytes retrieved from small antral follicles are able to resume meiosis by undergoing&#xD;
      germinal vesicle breakdown and extrusion of the first polar body, if oocytes have reached&#xD;
      meiotic competence. These oocytes can be fertilized although only a proportion (less than&#xD;
      50%) of them can develop further into viable embryos. It has been hypothesized that failure&#xD;
      of embryonic development may, at least in part, be due to an immature oocyte cytoplasm. A&#xD;
      novel human in vitro maturation (IVM) culture system (named CAPACITATION-IVM is being&#xD;
      investigated, hereafter named &quot;CAPA&quot;) using 1°) natural compounds known to influence cAMP&#xD;
      levels within the cumulus-oocyte-complex and 2°) compounds that are crucial for the&#xD;
      oocyte-cumulus cross-talk. Keeping cyclic AMP high after retrieval in the GV oocyte prevents&#xD;
      the occurrence of nuclear maturation, enabling increased communication between the oocyte and&#xD;
      the cumulus cells. This allows for the improvement in the synchronization of nuclear and&#xD;
      cytoplasmic maturation processes in the oocyte, to the benefit of embryo quality.&#xD;

      There are two types of patients can be distinguished in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Polycystic ovarian morphology + normal cycle length (up to 35 days). The majority of&#xD;
           subjects in this group have non-syndromic polycystic ovaries and do not have PCOS. In&#xD;
           these patients, AMH is only moderately elevated and cyclical follicular development&#xD;
           occurs under the influence of FSH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PCOS - Polycystic ovarian morphology + oligomenorrhoea (menstrual periods occurring at&#xD;
           intervals of greater than 35 days, with only four to nine periods in a year) or&#xD;
           amenorrhea. In these patients, with often strongly elevated AMH levels and concomitant&#xD;
           hyperandrogenemia, relative FSH resistance results in arrest of follicular growth at the&#xD;
           small antral follicular state. Spontaneous selection of a dominant follicle does not&#xD;
           occur or occurs rarely. A large proportion of follicles are atretic. An important&#xD;
           proportion of these patients have a BMI higher than 25. These patients generally receive&#xD;
           the same standard gonadotropin stimulation regimen as the patients of the previous&#xD;
           group, but if the largest follicles have a diameter of less than 8 mm on the third day&#xD;
           of stimulation, patients receive one or two supplementary days of gonadotropin&#xD;
           stimulation. Moreover, these patients generally take two-three weeks of OCP before the&#xD;
           start of the IVM cycle and start stimulation approximately on day five after OCP&#xD;
           withdrawal. However, since these patients do not have endogenous FSH-driven recruitment&#xD;
           of follicles, the start of stimulation is rather flexible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of OCP (oral contraceptive pill) before the IVM cycle is obligate. OCP (for&#xD;
           example Microgynon 30 micrograms) will be administered daily, to clear the atretic&#xD;
           follicles in the ovary. OCP will be given for between 14 and 21 days (this method allows&#xD;
           for better programming the cycles and the workload in the embryology lab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the first IVM cycle (Screening visit): All subjects will undergo a pelvic ultrasound&#xD;
      scan to evaluate suitability to undergo IVM treatment. Patients will undergo a blood test for&#xD;
      serology (Hepatitis B, HIV, syphilis) and baseline hormonal profiling (LH, FSH, E2,&#xD;
      progesterone, AMH, SHBG, Testosterone). Additional analysis of TSH, thyroperoxidase&#xD;
      antibodies, prolactin. Any concomitant medication taken in the last 3 months prior to the IVM&#xD;
      attempt should be notified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First IVM treatment cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First clinic visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All subjects will contact the study nurse on cycle day (cd1) to initiate the first&#xD;
                Capacitation culture cycle. If cd1 is during the weekend, subjects will contact the&#xD;
                study nurse on Monday. The subject will attend the clinic on day 1, 2 or 3 of&#xD;
                menstrual bleeding. An ultrasound scan is performed to rule out the existence of&#xD;
                ovarian cysts and a blood sample is taken for hormonal assessment (HCG, FSH, LH,&#xD;
                E2, progesterone). On the evening of cycle day 3 of the first clinic visit,&#xD;
                flexible Gonadotrophin stimulation will be started to enhance follicular&#xD;
                development. The first dose of HP-hMG 150 IU at 2 PM. Second dose next day of&#xD;
                HP-hMG 150 IU at 2 PM. The subject will return for a pelvic ultrasound scan and a&#xD;
                blood test (FSH, LH, E2, progesterone) after the two days of HP-hMG 150 IU&#xD;
                stimulation (i.e. on the morning of day 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To patients with OCP bleeding: On day one, two, three, or four of the withdrawal&#xD;
                bleeding that occurs after discontinuing the OCP, the subject will attend the&#xD;
                clinic to undergo a pelvic ultrasound scan and a blood sample is taken for hormonal&#xD;
                assessment (FSH, LH, E2, progesterone, AMH, total serum testosterone, SHBG). On the&#xD;
                day of the first clinic visit, flexible HP-hMG stimulation will be started to&#xD;
                enhance follicular development, at a first daily dose of HP-hMG at 8 P.M. The&#xD;
                subject will return for a pelvic ultrasound scan and a blood test (FSH, LH, E2,&#xD;
                progesterone) after two days of HP hMG stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second clinic visit at day 6 (after 2 days of HP-hMG treatment):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If the ultrasound scan shows the presence of a single dominant follicle larger than&#xD;
                12 mm with the other follicles all less than 10 mm, and the oocyte retrieval (OR)&#xD;
                will be scheduled two days later, between 8:00 and 9:00 h. It is important to keep&#xD;
                the OR 42 - 46 hours after the last HP-hMG injection as a fixed timing. If the&#xD;
                ultrasound scan shows a maximal follicular diameter of less than 8 mm, a final&#xD;
                injection of HP-hMG will be administered at 2 P.M. and the oocyte retrieval (OR)&#xD;
                will be scheduled two days later, between 8:00 and 9:00 h. It is important to keep&#xD;
                the OR 42 - 46 hours after the last HP-hMG injection as a fixed timing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To patients with OCP bleeding: If the ultrasound scan shows a maximal follicular&#xD;
                diameter of approx. 9 mm, a final injection of HP-hMG will be administered at 2&#xD;
                P.M. and the oocyte retrieval (OR) will be scheduled two days later, between 8:00&#xD;
                and 9:00 h (under general anesthetics - the exact time of OR should be discussed&#xD;
                with operating nurses and anesthetist). It is important to keep the time of OR&#xD;
                constant at 42 -46 hours after the last HP-hMG injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Third visit - Oocyte retrieval: Oocyte retrieval (OR) will be scheduled between 8:00 and&#xD;
           10:00 h (under general anesthetics). On the day of OR:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  An ultrasound scan of both ovaries and of endometrial lining is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A blood sample will be obtained for hormonal profiling (LH, FSH, E2, progesterone).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) retrieved from the patient are cultured in CAPA&#xD;
           medium for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following CAPA culture, half of oocytes will be divided randomly (50/50) to the two&#xD;
           maturation triggers medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 1: Medicult IVM media + AREG+FSH+HSA+Insulin+Estradiol (AREG-TRIGGER group)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 2: Medicult IVM media + FSH+GH+hCG+HSA (CONTROL-TRIGGER group) with no AREG&#xD;
                added&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In vitro oocyte maturation:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluate and register COCs for cumulus mass (CM) and cumulus contact between oocyte&#xD;
                and cumulus cells. Each time take photographs. Discard fully denuded, degenerated&#xD;
                oocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Transfer half of the COCs (5-10 at a time) from the Capacitation culture dish to&#xD;
                the &quot;washing dish&quot; containing &quot;Maturation Medium 1 (AREG-TRIGGER medium)&quot; by using&#xD;
                an Eppendorf micropipette and wash them thoroughly (load pipette tips with 5µl,&#xD;
                max. 10µl). Then transfer COCs to the &quot;IVM dish&quot; with &quot;Maturation Medium 1&#xD;
                (AREG-TRIGGER medium)&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Transfer the second half of the COCs from the Capacitation culture dish to the&#xD;
                &quot;washing dish&quot; containing &quot;Maturation Medium 2 (CONTROL-TRIGGER medium)&quot; and wash&#xD;
                them thoroughly (load pipette tips with 5µl, max. 10µl). Then transfer COCs to the&#xD;
                &quot;IVM dish&quot; with &quot;Maturation Medium 2 (CONTROL-TRIGGER medium)&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Keep COCs in pools of ~10.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Label the dish appropriately and culture COCs 30-32 hours in an incubator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of maturation (MII, GVBD, GV) will be done at 30 hours. Oocytes which have&#xD;
           undergone GVBD but with no clear PB will be assessed at 32 hours. Insemination will be&#xD;
           performed using intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (3-4 hours after oocyte retrieval or&#xD;
           maturation check); only matured oocytes will be inseminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fertilization check will be performed under an inverted microscope at 16-18 hours after&#xD;
           insemination. Embryo evaluation will be performed at 68 ±1 hours after fertilization&#xD;
           using the Istanbul consensus. Standard Embryo Vitrification protocol used. Embryos will&#xD;
           be vitrified per stimulation protocol obtained (group 1 AREG-TRIGGER or group 2 -&#xD;
           CONTROL-TRIGGER).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frozen embryo transfer: The patient will be randomized to receive embryo randomly from&#xD;
           AREG-TRIGGER or CONTROL-TRIGGER. Where no embryo(s) from the randomized group were&#xD;
           available, embryo(s) from the other group were transferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first pregnancy test was performed 14 days after embryo transfer; a positive&#xD;
           pregnancy test was defined as serum beta hCG &gt;5 mIU/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical pregnancy was defined as at least one gestational sac on ultrasound at 7 weeks'&#xD;
           gestation with the detection of heartbeat activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ongoing pregnancy was defined as pregnancy with a detectable heart rate at ≥12 weeks'&#xD;
           gestation after the completion of the first transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Live birth was defined as the birth of at least one newborn after 24 weeks' gestation&#xD;
           exhibiting any sign of life (twins were a single count).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After a first unsuccessful IVM cycle: The clinical and embryological data and results&#xD;
           related to the first IVM cycle (cumulative fresh and frozen embryo cycles) will be&#xD;
           discussed, to establish a more patient-tailored approach for an eventual second IVM&#xD;
           cycle. The patient-tailored approach in the second IVM cycle might consist of&#xD;
           modification of the management of the follicular phase.&#xD;
