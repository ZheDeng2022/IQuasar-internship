      People with serious mental illness are three times more likely to smoke cigarettes than&#xD;
      people without mental illness. People with mental illness are less likely to be successful in&#xD;
      quitting smoking than those without mental illness. Therefore, the healthcare community needs&#xD;
      to find ways to get people with mental illness treatment to help them stop smoking. This&#xD;
      study explores whether a treatment, called acceptance and commitment therapy, which is an&#xD;
      affective therapy for serious mental illness, can help patients with serious mental illness&#xD;
      stop smoking. In particular, the investigators test whether patients will be interested in&#xD;
      receiving acceptance and commitment therapy for smoking cessation in a psychiatric partial&#xD;
      hospital (also known as a day treatment program), whether they are able to complete the&#xD;
      treatment, and whether it will help them stop smoking compared to usual care. To test these&#xD;
      research questions, 40 patients in the Rhode Island Hospital's psychiatric partial hospital&#xD;
      will be recruited. Half of the patients will receive acceptance and commitment therapy to&#xD;
      help them stop smoking (2 in person sessions, 5 telephone sessions) and half will receive&#xD;
      usual care (2 in person sessions, electronic referral to the Rhode Island tobacco quit line).&#xD;
      All participants will be offered the nicotine patch. All participants will complete a&#xD;
      baseline survey and a follow-up visit at the end of treatment to measure whether they stopped&#xD;
      smoking and whether they liked the treatment. The study will also measure how many&#xD;
      participants completed the treatment sessions. If successful, this treatment model could be a&#xD;
      way to get more patients with mental illness into treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: There is a significant disparity in tobacco use in that smokers with mental&#xD;
      illness smoke at twice the rate of the general population, use more tobacco per day and are&#xD;
      disproportionately affected by smoking-related disease. Few models exist for treating tobacco&#xD;
      use in individuals with mental illness. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a&#xD;
      treatment strategy that helps individuals accept discomfort while making value-guided change.&#xD;
      It has been used successfully to treat psychiatric symptoms in people with serious mental&#xD;
      illness (SMI) and is well-suited to treat smoking in people with SMI. Psychiatric partial&#xD;
      hospitalization programs provide an opportunity to intervene on tobacco use in people with&#xD;
      SMI. OBJECTIVE: This study tests the feasibility of offering an ACT-based smoking cessation&#xD;
      treatment initiated in a psychiatric partial hospital program and continuing post-discharge.&#xD;
      AIMS: The study has 3 aims: (1) To assess the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of an&#xD;
      ACT-based, partial hospital initiated, counseling intervention for smoking cessation. (2) To&#xD;
      collect preliminary evidence of the efficacy (i.e., effect size estimates) of ACT-based&#xD;
      counseling initiated in the partial hospital compared to usual care. (3) To explore of the&#xD;
      effect of treatment condition (ACT vs. Usual Care) on ACT treatment targets. DESIGN: This&#xD;
      study is a randomized design (n=40), where patients in an ACT-based psychiatric partial&#xD;
      hospital will be offered up to 8 weeks of the nicotine patch and randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      ACT care (n=20; two in-person ACT-based counseling sessions + 5 ACT-based telephone&#xD;
      counseling sessions) or to Enhanced Usual Care (n=20; two in person medication management&#xD;
      counseling sessions + referral to the state quit line). Outcomes assessed at end of treatment&#xD;
      include: feasibility (percent of eligible patients who enroll, percent of patients completing&#xD;
      treatment), acceptability (patient satisfaction ratings), safety (hospital readmissions,&#xD;
      symptom exacerbation), efficacy (CO confirmed 7 day point prevalence abstinence at end of&#xD;
      treatment) and ACT treatment targets (tolerance of discomfort, mindfulness and acceptance).&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE: This study tests a treatment model for smokers with SMI, a group with&#xD;
      particularly refractory smoking behavior. If successful, this model could be implemented&#xD;
      broadly in psychiatric day treatment programs.&#xD;

        <description>The avoidance inflexibility scale is a 13-item self-report assessment in which respondents to consider how they respond to difficult thoughts that encourage smoking (e.g., &quot;I need a cigarette&quot;, &quot;I wish I could have a cigarette now!&quot;), different feelings that encourage smoking (e.g., stress, fatigue, boredom, enjoyment, satisfaction, etc.), and bodily sensations that encourage smoking (e.g., &quot;physical cravings or withdrawal symptoms&quot;).The Avoidance Inflexibility Scale measures smoking-related experiential avoidance, minimum score= 13, maximum score=65, higher score indicate more avoidance (worse outcome), the study outcome is the change between avoidance measured at baseline, and at study completion, 7 weeks post-enrollment. Minimum score=-52, maximum score=52 lower scores = better outcome.</description>
