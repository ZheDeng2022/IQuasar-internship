      This study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled, multicenter clinical study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Xinnaoning capsule in the treatment of chronic stable&#xD;
      angina pectoris (Qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease angina pectoris is a kind of heart disease caused by myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia and anoxia caused by coronary atherosclerosis. It belongs to the category of &quot;chest&#xD;
      obstruction&quot; and &quot;heartache&quot; in traditional Chinese medicine. One of its common pathogenesis&#xD;
      is stagnation of Qi and blood stasis, blockage of blood vessels, so it should be treated by&#xD;
      activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis, dredging channels and collaterals, as&#xD;
      well as tranquilizing Qi and tranquilizing spirit, in order to achieve the goal of blood&#xD;
      stasis to remove new life and nourish the blood vessels of viscera and viscera. Xinnaoning&#xD;
      Capsule (Chinese medicine approved character: Z20025697) is produced by Guizhou Jingcheng&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. It has the functions of activating blood circulation, promoting Qi&#xD;
      circulation, dredging collaterals and relieving pain.Xinnaoning Capsule has not had any&#xD;
      adverse reactions for many years after it was put on the market. In this study, a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, efficacy test design was used to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of Xinnaoning Capsule in the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris&#xD;
      (Qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome) .&#xD;

    <description>The main symptoms of Qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome are chest pain, chest tightness, secondary symptoms such as palpitation, shortness of breath, chest swelling, fatigue, dark lips, dizziness, veins at the base of tongue, irritability, etc. The severity and presence of these symptoms are used as criteria for scoring.

    <description>Reference to Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Angina Severity Classification Standard。Ⅰ：General physical activity does not cause angina pectoris, such as walking and going upstairs, but tension, rapid or sustained exertion can cause the onset of angina pectoris.Ⅱ：Daily physical activity is slightly restricted. Walking fast or upstairs, climbing high, walking after meals or upstairs, walking in cold or wind, and emotional excitement can cause angina or only occur within a few hours after waking up. It is limited to walk more than 200 meters or climb stairs above one floor at normal speed.Ⅲ：Daily physical activity is obviously limited, and angina pectoris can occur when walking 100-200 m at normal speed or climbing a staircase.Ⅳ：Angina symptoms can occur when you are slightly active or at rest.</description>

    <description>The Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) measured a total of L9 problems,including physical activity limitation, stable state of angina, frequency of angina attack, satisfaction with treatment, and knowledge of disease. A kind of Assessment of Seattle Scale: The Seattle Angina Scale was divided into 5 items and 19 items: Physical Activity Restriction (PL, Question 1), Angina Stable State (AS, Question 2), Angina Attack (AF, Question 3-4), Treatment Satisfaction (TS, Question 5-8), Disease Cognition (DS, Question 9-11), 19 items of 5 items and the total score of SAQ. The formula is transformed into standard integral, standard integral = (actual score - the lowest score in this respect) / (the highest score in this respect - the lowest score in this respect) * 100, the higher the score, the better the quality of life and the state of body function of patients.</description>
