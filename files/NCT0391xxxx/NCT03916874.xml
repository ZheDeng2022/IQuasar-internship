  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gut is home to a diverse and dynamic microbial community, termed the microbiota. The&#xD;
      microbiota is essential for health and wellbeing and is involved in acquisition of nutrients&#xD;
      and energy from the diet, optimisation of the immune system, and resistance against invading&#xD;
      pathogens. Critically, in both new mothers and their babies, any disturbance of the&#xD;
      microbiota (caused, for example, by antibiotics, delivery mode [vaginal/Caesarean section],&#xD;
      or dietary change), has the potential to increase the risk that the baby might subsequently&#xD;
      develop allergic-type disorders, infections, and chronic intestinal diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early life is a key period of development, but the investigators need a clearer understanding&#xD;
      of how maternal factors and transmission of beneficial microbes from mother to baby influence&#xD;
      the development of a healthy infant microbiota. This is only possible through longitudinal&#xD;
      studies, where the profiles of microbiota from cohorts of mothers and their babies are&#xD;
      correlated with routine and more specific clinical data (i.e. antibiotics and diet)&#xD;
      throughout pregnancy and into early life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve the aims of the study, the Quadram Institute Bioscience (QIB) will work&#xD;
      in collaboration with the Norfolk &amp; Norwich University Hospital (NNUH) to recruit 250&#xD;
      pregnant female participants. Study duration will be approximately 31 months and during this&#xD;
      time, the investigators will ask the participants to collect urine and stool samples and low&#xD;
      vaginal and skin swabs. Blood samples and breast milk are optional. From her newborn,&#xD;
      investigators will ask the participant to collect a meconium and stool samples and skin&#xD;
      swabs. The participant will complete three different types of questionnaires for herself and&#xD;
      her newborn over 31 months. This study is fully funded by the Biotechnology and Biological&#xD;
      Sciences Research Council (BBSRC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gut is home to a diverse and dynamic microbial ecosystem, termed the microbiota. These&#xD;
      microbes provide their host with various beneficial effects including acquisition of&#xD;
      additional nutrients and energy from dietary components, optimal development of the immune&#xD;
      system, and resistance against invading pathogenic microbes, and are thus critical for&#xD;
      health. As the neonatal gut is essentially sterile at the outset, these beneficial microbes&#xD;
      and their associated functions are acquired after initial colonisation by pioneer bacteria,&#xD;
      successive diversification, and changes in microbial population densities until a climax or&#xD;
      'stable' microbiota has established during infancy and early childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of human physiological functions are programmed either in utero, i.e. during&#xD;
      pregnancy, or during the early-life window. Thus, the investigators need to determine&#xD;
      early-life microbiome profiles over this critical period, particularly what factors influence&#xD;
      these microbial signatures, and how changes in the signature are correlated with healthy&#xD;
      development during this time-period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is proposed that the initial colonisation and establishment of the gut microbiome during&#xD;
      early life is closely linked with the promotion of healthy development. Critically,&#xD;
      disturbances within this pioneering microbial community (both in mother and baby) have the&#xD;
      potential to increase the risk of developing diseases such as autoimmune conditions,&#xD;
      allergic-type disorders, infections and chronic intestinal diseases; disturbance may be&#xD;
      caused by antibiotics, dietary changes (i.e. breast versus formula milk) and even the way the&#xD;
      baby is delivered (i.e. Caesarean section versus vaginal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed transmission of microbial species from the maternal microbiome to the baby is a&#xD;
      key feature of birth, with subsequent waves of colonisation occurring as the baby gets older.&#xD;
      There is also an increasing awareness of the importance of maternal health during pregnancy&#xD;
      (as affected by obesity and antibiotic use) for the baby's development and health, both&#xD;
      before and after birth. Importantly, these life stage events appear to be governed by&#xD;
      particular interactions (immune and dietary) that 'select' beneficial microbes such as&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium species; species in this genus are prevalent in the gut and vagina of mothers&#xD;
      in the later stages of pregnancy and can represent up to 80% of the total microbiome in&#xD;
      healthy infants. These pioneering microbe species seem to be important for the development of&#xD;
      a healthy microbial community and the subsequent formation of a more 'adult-like' microbiome&#xD;
      by the time the child has reached 2-3 years of age; this is thought to be in response to an&#xD;
      expanding nutritional environment, i.e. from a milk-based diet to a more complex diet at&#xD;
      weaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although several studies have tried to probe these key questions, there are currently many&#xD;
      unknowns with respect to this key developmental window including (i) how does the microbiome&#xD;
      change in response to different phases of pregnancy across different body sites (and how does&#xD;
      this correlate with routinely collected clinical information), (ii) are microbes from mothers&#xD;
      directly passed to infants during birth (and how does birth mode affect this i.e. vaginal vs.&#xD;
      C-section), (iii) how do factors like diet and antibiotics influence the maternal microbiome,&#xD;
      and what is the impact on developing infant microbial communities, (iv) how do different&#xD;
      feeding regiments (e.g. breast vs. formula milk) influence specific microbial populations in&#xD;
      the infant (e.g. Bifidobacterium), (v) how do these microbes influence immune and metabolic&#xD;
      health, and how does this correlate with clinical information captured both in mother and&#xD;
      baby over time, and (iv) if the investigators carry out in-depth mechanistic studies using in&#xD;
      vitro and in vivo models, can the investigators determine how specific microbes and&#xD;
      communities contribute to healthy development and prevent disease incidence?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically, if the investigators are to determine the importance of the early life&#xD;
      microbiome, the investigators must set-up and carry out comprehensive longitudinal pregnancy&#xD;
      and infant studies, i.e. PEARL, to address these key points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, gathering these data is critical for implementation of new therapies and&#xD;
      health-associated practices that would be expected to have beneficial effects, both in the&#xD;
      short-term and across the life course, which could be explored in subsequent studies after&#xD;
      PEARL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PEARL Study will build on the Chief Investigator's (Hall) ongoing BAMBI Study - Baby&#xD;
      Associated Microbiota of the Intestine (University of East Anglia Faculty of Medical Health&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee Reference 2012/2013 - 42 HT), which is collecting faecal samples&#xD;
      from preterm infants residing in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) and following these&#xD;
      babies after they are discharged home for up to 3 years of age. This study has been analysing&#xD;
      microbiome signatures in these preterm infants and correlating these to external factors such&#xD;
      as antibiotic usage and diet and also immune markers.&#xD;
