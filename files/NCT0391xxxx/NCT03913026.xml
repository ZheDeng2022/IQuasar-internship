  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a life-saving procedure in patients&#xD;
      with blood cancers. Cord blood (CB) represents an alternative source of stem cells, which is&#xD;
      associated with a lower risk of relapse, especially in the presence of minimal residual&#xD;
      disease in the setting of acute leukemia and myelodysplasia. Furthermore, CB has the added&#xD;
      advantage of being associated with a low risk of chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD).&#xD;
      Unfortunately, CB transplants are hampered by a higher risk of transplant related mortality&#xD;
      (TRM) when compared to bone marrow/peripheral blood transplants because of the limited cell&#xD;
      dose of CB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the previous UM171 trial (NCT02668315), the CB expansion protocol using the ECT-001-CB&#xD;
      technology (UM171 molecule) has proven to be technically feasible and safe. UM171 expanded CB&#xD;
      was associated with a median neutrophil recovery at day (D)+18 post transplant. Amongst 22&#xD;
      patients who received a single UM171 CB transplant with a median follow-up of 18 months, risk&#xD;
      of TRM (5%) and grade 3-4 acute GVHD (10%) were low. There was no moderate-severe chronic&#xD;
      GVHD. Thus, overall and progression free survival at 12 months were impressive at 90% and&#xD;
      74%, respectively. The UM171 expansion protocol allowed access to smaller, better HLA matched&#xD;
      CBs as &gt;80% of patients received a 6-7/8 HLA matched CB. Interestingly there were 5 patients&#xD;
      who had already failed an allogeneic transplant and 5 patients with refractory/relapsed acute&#xD;
      leukemia/aggressive lymphoma. Despite this high risk population, progression was 20% at 12&#xD;
      months. Hence, in this new trial, investigators are targeting patients with high and very&#xD;
      high-risk acute leukemia/myelodysplasia to test the antileukemia effect of this new graft, a&#xD;
      UM171 expanded CB.&#xD;

      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-center open label phase II clinical trial. Patients with high and very&#xD;
      high-risk acute leukemia/myelodysplasia will receive a single 5-7/8 HLA matched ECT-001&#xD;
      (UM171) expanded cord blood after an ablative conditioning regimen. This group of patients&#xD;
      would be expected to have poor progression free survival (PFS) after a conventional&#xD;
      allogeneic transplant (bone marrow-peripheral blood).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators key primary and secondary objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To confirm low Transplant Related Mortality (TRM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate relapse free survival (RFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To analyze kinetics of hematologic engraftment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the safety of the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate incidence of infectious complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To analyze duration of hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To evaluate the incidence of pre-engraftment/engraftment syndrome (PES/ES)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To analyze the effect of cryopreservation of the expanded CD34+ fraction on safety and&#xD;
           efficacy endpoints&#xD;
