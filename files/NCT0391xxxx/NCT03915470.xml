  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at the difference between XF-73 and placebo in reducing the carriage of a&#xD;
      bacteria S. aureus in the nose before, during and after heart surgery. Only people who&#xD;
      normally have S.aureus in their nose will be enrolled onto the study. This will be confirmed&#xD;
      by analysis of a nasal swab (a cotton bud placed in the nose) before entering the study. It&#xD;
      is expected 125 people will participate in this study. Participation will be confirmed by&#xD;
      analysis of a nasal swab (a cotton bud placed in the nose) before entering the study. XF-73&#xD;
      or placebo will be given 5 times, with an equal chance of participants receiving either XF-73&#xD;
      or placebo. During the hospital stay more nasal swabs will be taken to determine the amount&#xD;
      of S.aureus present in the participant's nose. Other tests such as blood samples, blood&#xD;
      pressure and an examination of the nose and sense of smell will be performed as part of the&#xD;
      safety assessment. After the hospital stay participants will be followed up for 30 days or if&#xD;
      a device has been inserted into the body as part of the surgery for 90 days to look at the&#xD;
      rates of post-operative infection between the placebo and XF-73 groups. The study will run&#xD;
      for about 18 months. During this period, an independent data monitoring committee will review&#xD;
      the study to make sure that the balance of benefits and risks of participating in the study&#xD;
      does not change.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of multiple&#xD;
      applications of a single concentration of XF-73 nasal gel to assess the microbiological&#xD;
      effect of XF-73 on commensal S. aureus nasal carriage in patients scheduled for surgical&#xD;
      procedures deemed to be at high risk of post-operative S. aureus infection. The study is&#xD;
      divided in 4 periods: screening (days -14 to -1) randomization (days -10 to -1), treatment&#xD;
      (days -1 and 0) and follow-up (post-last study dose to day 30 or day 90 if an implant is&#xD;
      inserted during surgery). Day 0 is the calendar day in which surgery takes place. Only&#xD;
      patients who test positive to S. aureus by a centrally-performed rapid diagnostic test will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study. Approximately 125 patients will be randomly allocated in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to 0.2% w/w XF-73 nasal gel treatment OR placebo to match XF-73 nasal gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug, 0.2% w/w XF-73, or matched placebo will be administered 4 times into each&#xD;
      nostril over 24 hours prior to surgery and then a single application immediately upon closure&#xD;
      of surgical wound. Additionally, patients may undergo chlorhexidine skin decolonisation ahead&#xD;
      of surgery and receive perioperative prophylactic systemic antibiotics in accordance with&#xD;
      local practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed by S. aureus colonisation from screening to 7 days after surgery as&#xD;
      well as by incidence of post-operative staphylococcal infections and use of&#xD;
      anti-staphylococcal antibiotics post-surgery. Safety will be assessed by reported adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs) from screening up to Day 7 as well as vital signs, physical examination (ENT),&#xD;
      clinical laboratory assessments (haematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis) and Smell&#xD;
      Identification Tests at different time points throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum study duration will be 45 or 105 days for each individual (from screening to&#xD;
      post-study follow-up visit) depending on whether a foreign implant was inserted during&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will be set up which will review the safety&#xD;
      information from the study, the incidence of post-operative staphylococcal infections and to&#xD;
      ensure that the balance of benefits and risks of participating in the study does not change.&#xD;
