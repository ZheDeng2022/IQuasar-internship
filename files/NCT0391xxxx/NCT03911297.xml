  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 10% of all women and usually presents with irregular&#xD;
      menstrual periods and difficulties conceiving. However, PCOS is also a lifelong metabolic&#xD;
      disorder and affected women have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure,&#xD;
      and heart disease. Increased blood levels of male hormones, also termed androgens, are found&#xD;
      in most PCOS patients. Androgen excess appears to impair the ability of the body to respond&#xD;
      to the sugar-regulating hormone insulin (=insulin resistance). The investigator has found&#xD;
      that fat tissue of PCOS patients overproduces androgens and that this can result in a&#xD;
      build-up of toxic fat, which increases insulin resistance and could cause liver damage. In a&#xD;
      large cohort of women registered in a GP database, the study team have found that androgen&#xD;
      excess increases the risk of fatty liver disease. The aim is to identify those women with&#xD;
      PCOS who are at the highest risk of developing metabolic disease, which would allow for early&#xD;
      detection and potentially prevention of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, fatty liver and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. The investigator will assess clinical presentation, androgen&#xD;
      production and metabolic function in women with PCOS to use similarities and differences in&#xD;
      these parameters for the identification of subsets (=clusters) of women who are at the&#xD;
      highest risk of metabolic disease. The investigator will do this by using a standardised set&#xD;
      of questions to scope PCOS-related signs and symptoms and the patient's medical history and&#xD;
      measure body composition and blood pressure. This standardised recording of a patient's&#xD;
      clinical presentation (=clinical phenotype) is called Phenome analysis. The investigator will&#xD;
      collect blood and urine samples for the systematic measurement of steroid hormones including&#xD;
      a very detailed androgen profile (=steroid metabolome analysis) and of thousands of&#xD;
      substances produced by human metabolism (=global metabolome analysis). Phenome and metabolome&#xD;
      data will then undergo integrated computational analysis for the detection of clusters&#xD;
      predictive of metabolic risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator propose an innovative approach to solving the clinical problem at hand, the&#xD;
      lack of identified measurable parameters one can use to predict the risk of future metabolic&#xD;
      disease in women diagnosed with PCOS.The chosen approach is the standardised collection of&#xD;
      phenome and metabolome data and their unbiased integration by machine learning analysis.&#xD;
      Utilising the detailed results of the clinical phenome and metabolome analysis in the&#xD;
      DAISy-PCOS Phenome Study cohort, The study will aim to identify distinct subsets (=clusters)&#xD;
      of PCOS patients that share similar characteristics. This approach has previously been used&#xD;
      by the team to successfully identify distinct steroid markers that can serve as a &quot;malignant&#xD;
      steroid fingerprint&quot; in urine to distinguish benign from malignant tumours in patients with&#xD;
      incidentally discovered adrenal masses. Similarly, The investigator have used unbiased&#xD;
      analysis of steroid metabolome data to reveal that patients with aldosterone excess also&#xD;
      overproduce glucocorticoids and that the latter explains the majority of metabolic disease&#xD;
      risk observed in affected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the integrated analysis of the DAISy-PCOS phenome and metabolome data, The investigator&#xD;
      will apply a variety of methods in the context of connectivity or centroid-based clustering&#xD;
      and density estimation. Supervised relevance learning will give insight into markers, e.g.&#xD;
      steroids, that are most decisive for the determination of cluster memberships. In addition,&#xD;
      The investigator will use state-of-the-art visualisation and machine learning techniques&#xD;
      based on adaptive similarity measures.the investigator will use integrative approaches,&#xD;
      addressing the heterogeneous data from different sources as a whole, whilst considering&#xD;
      data-driven adaptation of generative models for the underlying biological processes. The&#xD;
      investigator will employ these approaches to characterise central phenotype clusters&#xD;
      affecting large numbers of patients as the basis of personalised management including outcome&#xD;
      prediction.&#xD;
