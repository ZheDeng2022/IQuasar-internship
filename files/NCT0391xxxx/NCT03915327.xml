      This prospective, randomized, controlled study aims to evaluate the impact of short-term&#xD;
      intravenous iron dextran on postoperative recovery and the requirement for allogeneic red&#xD;
      blood cells (RBC) transfusion in preoperative Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) patients receiving&#xD;
      orthopedic surgery, thus facilitating developing a simple and effective iron supplement&#xD;
      approach for patients' recovery.&#xD;

      Anemia is a decrease in the concentration of hemoglobin (Hb) or RBC count in the blood ting,&#xD;
      causing body not being able to adequately supply oxygen to tissues and cells. Preoperative&#xD;
      anemia is common in patients receiving elective surgery, with a prevalence ranging from 5% to&#xD;
      75%. For instance, the prevalence of anemia before total hip or total knee arthroplasty is&#xD;
      around 35%. Preoperative anemia is one of the main predictors of perioperative allogeneic RBC&#xD;
      transfusion, and is closely associated with postoperative infection, increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and decreased quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the world enters an aging society, the proportion of elderly patients receiving surgery,&#xD;
      especially orthopedic surgery, is increasing. There are 3 main causes of anemia in the&#xD;
      elderly: nutritional anemia (~34%), which is caused by lack of hematopoietic materials.&#xD;
      Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common type of nutritional anemia, while&#xD;
      megaloblastic anemia caused by lack of folic acid and vitamin B12 is relatively rare. Anemia&#xD;
      of chronic disease (~32%), which is characterized by disorders of iron metabolism that occurs&#xD;
      in certain chronic diseases, such as persistent infections, inflammation and tumors. Anemia&#xD;
      of unknown cause (-34%), which may involve multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms and&#xD;
      comorbidities. IDA, the most common cause of perioperative anemia in patients receiving&#xD;
      orthopedic surgery, is a condition caused by hematopoietic materials deficiency and has a&#xD;
      good clinical response to iron supplementation with a rapid rise of Hb level. Iron&#xD;
      supplementation in patients with preoperative IDA, or insufficient iron intake and excessive&#xD;
      loss is able to improve the patients' surgical tolerance and reduce the transfusion rate; For&#xD;
      anemic patients with acute blood loss during surgery, iron supplementation is able to&#xD;
      accelerate anemia correction, thus enhancing postoperative recovery and shortening length of&#xD;
      hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron therapy can be administrated by the oral or intravenous route. Absorption of oral iron&#xD;
      therapy is relatively low, and it usually takes over 1 to 2 months to correct the iron&#xD;
      deficiency status. Therefore, intravenous iron therapy is recommended for patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with IDA after admission to hospital to receive surgery. Intravenous iron therapy was&#xD;
      originally the standard iron supplementation in chronic renal failure patients with IDA.&#xD;
      Subsequently, it was expanded to the anemia of patients with conventional inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease for its desirable efficacy. Several studies of elderly IDA patients receiving&#xD;
      orthopedic surgery and gynecologic surgery suggest that intravenous iron therapy can rapidly&#xD;
      increase hemoglobin levels before surgery, leading to a decrease in blood transfusion rates.&#xD;
      The calculation of the total dose of intravenous iron is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      = Weight (kg) ×[Target Hb level（g/L）- actual Hb level（g/L）] ×0.24 + 500mg Treatment duration&#xD;
      is over 2 weeks in most clinical studies of intravenous iron therapy. In China, few patients&#xD;
      are treated with intravenous iron therapy in community hospitals for 2 to 4 weeks before&#xD;
      surgery. Therefore, many IDA patients did not receive proper preoperative intravenous iron&#xD;
      therapy. Iron dextran, an intravenous iron preparation that can be administered in a single&#xD;
      treatment up to 1000 mg in a relatively short (15 minutes) time without need for test dose,&#xD;
      is of low risk of adverse reactions. Therefore, sufficient amount of iron can be&#xD;
      administrated during preoperative. Currently, there is no evidence to elucidate whether&#xD;
      short-term sufficient intravenous iron supplementation can reduce perioperative blood&#xD;
      transfusion requirements among IDA patients. Thus, we hypothesized that short-term&#xD;
      intravenous administration of sufficient iron dextran can reduce the need for perioperative&#xD;
      allogeneic RBC transfusion without increasing the incidence of adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, randomized, controlled study aims to evaluate the impact of short-term (1&#xD;
      week) intravenous iron dextran in preoperative IDA patients receiving orthopedic surgery on&#xD;
      postoperative allogeneic RBC transfusion rate and amount, hemoglobin level and iron storage,&#xD;
      postoperative complications, average length/expense of hospital stay, etc., to determine the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of short-term sufficient intravenous iron therapy, and to develop a&#xD;
      simple and effective preoperative iron supplementation program.&#xD;
