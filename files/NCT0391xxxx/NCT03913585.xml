  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large proportion of the Danish population leads an unhealthy lifestyle. The associated&#xD;
      surge in lifestyle-related disease (LRD) represents a significant health and economic burden&#xD;
      for the individual as well as society. However, the reactive nature of the Danish national&#xD;
      health-care system, complicates a comprehensive and concerted preventive response to this&#xD;
      issue. The TOF project aims to remedy this situation by 1) Using digital support systems to&#xD;
      systematically identify citizens at risk of LRD and 2) Target the preventive services at&#xD;
      citizens with the highest need. Specifically, the ultimate goal of TOF is to integrate the&#xD;
      clinical and municipal preventive primary health-care system into a targeted preventive&#xD;
      service that facilitates lifestyle change in the at-risk population, and thus reduces LRD at&#xD;
      a population level. To this end, we have developed a complex intervention in close&#xD;
      collaboration with central stakeholders (health professionals, citizens). The initial&#xD;
      feasibility of the intervention has been tested in a pilot study comprising two&#xD;
      municipalities, 47 GPs, and 8814 citizens. The intervention has subsequently been adjusted in&#xD;
      collaboration with the end users, focusing both on recruitment activities and implementation&#xD;
      activities in general practice. The upcoming step involves testing of the adjusted&#xD;
      intervention (Pilot2), before large-scale implementation and efficacy evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility, acceptability, and short-term effect of the adjusted intervention will be&#xD;
      tested in two municipalities using quantitative as well as qualitative research methods. The&#xD;
      evaluation will focus on the reach of the intervention, the implementation and acceptability&#xD;
      of the intervention in general practice and municipality, the use and assessment of the&#xD;
      digital support system and the possible short-term effects on patient lifestyle and risk of&#xD;
      disease. We expect 15 general practitioners and 4800 patients to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention comprises four main components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants will be screened for LRD-risk factors by survey&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Survey information is linked with participants' medical history in order to stratify&#xD;
           participants into designated risk groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Depending on risk level, participants will be offered targeted interventions at the GP&#xD;
           or municipality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Throughout the intervention, a digital support system providing personalized feedback&#xD;
           and advice (health profile) to participants will be accessible to both participants and&#xD;
           health professionals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two (Haderslev and Middelfart) of the seven municipalities participating in the large-scale&#xD;
      TOF study volunteered to participate in Pilot2. In February-March 2018, GPs from these two&#xD;
      municipalities will receive an invitation to participate. The target group of Pilot2&#xD;
      comprises 4.800 adults born between 1959 and 1988 and who are registered with a participating&#xD;
      GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to study commencement, all enrolled GPs, practice nurses (PN), and health professionals&#xD;
      from the municipalities are invited to a joint kick-off meeting. The meeting will focus on&#xD;
      the intervention activities and tasks assigned to the GP clinics and the municipality. In&#xD;
      addition, all GP practices will be offered an introductory visit from the project secretariat&#xD;
      to help organize and plan project activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In October 2018 half of the target population will receive a mailed pre-notification&#xD;
      (postcard), and 2 weeks later the full target population will receive an invitation, sent on&#xD;
      behalf of the GP and the municipality to the individual's e-Boks. Two different invitations&#xD;
      are tested; a) A broad invitation and b) an invitation targeting citizens with low&#xD;
      educational attainment. Random selection is used to allocate citizens to the four invitation&#xD;
      groups: (+/- postcard x Invitation a/b). To enroll in the study, citizens are asked to sign a&#xD;
      consent form via a link to a secure, digital support system, accessible only with a&#xD;
      two-phased NemID password. The consent form will outline study participation and disclosure&#xD;
      of data from the GPs electronic patient record (EPR). Short videos on the digital support&#xD;
      system will also be made available to participants. These videos come in different versions,&#xD;
      designed for male and female participants, specifically. The main purpose of including the&#xD;
      videos is to describe the purpose of the study and the intervention. To adjust for social&#xD;
      inequality in health, proactive recruitment activities will be conducted by the participating&#xD;
      municipalities in socially deprived areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon consent, information on relevant diagnoses (International Classification of Primary Care&#xD;
      (ICPC-2) codes) and prescribed medicine (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification (ATC)&#xD;
      codes incl. text fields with indication for treatment) are collected from the GPs' EPR&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five months after consent (April 2019), participants will receive another digital invitation&#xD;
      in their e-Boks, this time to fill in a questionnaire and access their personal health&#xD;
      profile. Participants can opt out at any time during the intervention period by clicking an&#xD;
      &quot;opt-out&quot; button on the digital support system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The intervention comprises a two-pronged approach: (1) A joint intervention that&#xD;
      applies to the entire sample, regardless of whether the participants are healthy, at risk, or&#xD;
      already in treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD), cardio vascular disease (CVD), hypercholesterolemia or hypertension; (2) A targeted&#xD;
      intervention that is offered only to participants who presumably would benefit from either&#xD;
      further examinations at the GP (high risk), or community health services, such as smoking&#xD;
      cessation, dietary advice, or physical activity (health-risk behavior).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The joint intervention consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stratification to one of four risk groups. Stratification to a specific risk group is&#xD;
           determined by use of validated risk algorithms and EPR information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A digital support system with user interfaces for all users, including the patient, the&#xD;
           GP, and the municipal health professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A personal health profile for all participating patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The targeted intervention consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A focused clinical examination and if necessary a subsequent health dialogue with a GP&#xD;
           (targeting patients at high risk), and / or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A short telephone-based health dialogue with a municipal health professional. For&#xD;
           patients with limited capability to care for their own health, this initial talk may be&#xD;
           followed up with a subsequent face-to-face health dialogue (targeting patients with&#xD;
           health-risk behavior).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all present intents and purposes, the term health dialogue refers to a consultation that&#xD;
      includes the elements of the 5As model and the techniques used in motivational interviewing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The joint intervention All participants will have access to the digital support system, and&#xD;
      are invited to fill in a questionnaire, comprising 15 items on height, weight, self-perceived&#xD;
      health status, family history of LRD, COPD-related symptoms, smoking status, leisure activity&#xD;
      level, alcohol consumption, diet, and osteoarthritis risk factors. Questions about family&#xD;
      history of diabetes and leisure activity level were taken from the Danish Diabetes Risk&#xD;
      model. Similarly, questions on COPD-related symptoms and smoking status were derived from the&#xD;
      COPD-PS screener and the Heartscore BMI score. Items tapping dietary habits were from the&#xD;
      Swedish National Guidelines on Disease Prevention. The questionnaire takes approximately five&#xD;
      minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the questionnaire and information from the individual EPR, participants are&#xD;
      stratified into four distinct risk groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 - Participants with a pre-existing diagnosis and/or in current treatment for an&#xD;
           LRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 - Participants at high risk of developing LRD, and thus eligible for the offer&#xD;
           of a targeted intervention at the GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 - Participants engaging in health-risk behavior, and thus eligible for the offer&#xD;
           of a targeted intervention at the municipality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4 - Participants with a healthy lifestyle and no need for further intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal health profile Based on results of the stratification process, each patient receives&#xD;
      a personal health profile on the digital support system. The purpose of the health profile is&#xD;
      to encourage the patients to change their health-risk behavior and follow the tailored advice&#xD;
      provided by the system. Patients who are at increased risk of developing an LRD (Group 2) are&#xD;
      advised to consult their GP for further examination and advice. Similarly, patients engaging&#xD;
      in health-risk behavior (Group 3) are offered lifestyle counseling, or lifestyle courses in&#xD;
      the municipality. By definition, Group 4 patients lead a relatively healthy life with no need&#xD;
      for health-risk behavior change. Group 1 patients are advised to continue their treatment and&#xD;
      use the information provided to change health-risk behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The personal health profile includes individualized information on current health-risk&#xD;
      behavior and risk of disease. The information is tailored based on the questionnaire, the&#xD;
      information from the EPR, and the risk scores on COPD, T2DM, and CVD. It also includes&#xD;
      general health information and information about preventive health services concerning&#xD;
      smoking, diet, exercise, and alcohol consumption. This information is provided by the&#xD;
      municipality, the Region of Southern Denmark, or the national health services, and targets&#xD;
      the individual (e.g. via links to apps and webpages) based on his/her specific health-risk&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The targeted intervention The intervention at the GP The intervention at the general practice&#xD;
      level consists of a focused clinical examination and a subsequent health dialogue and is&#xD;
      offered to patients who are at increased risk of developing an LRD (Group 2). Group 2&#xD;
      patients accept the offer of the intervention by scheduling an appointment at the GP (either&#xD;
      by phone or the GP's webpage). Group 2 patients also have the opportunity to register for a&#xD;
      telephone call from their GP on the digital support system. Whether the patient participates&#xD;
      in the intervention or not is thus determined by their motivation and capabilities as well as&#xD;
      the extent to which the content of the personal health profile motivates the patient to take&#xD;
      action. The intervention is applied within the framework of the 5As model. The focused&#xD;
      clinical examination includes measurements of blood glucose (HbA1c) and cholesterol levels,&#xD;
      as well as height, weight, blood pressure, and lung function measurements, and an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG), depending on the patient's health profile. Results from the&#xD;
      examinations are registered in the digital support system where both the patient and the GP&#xD;
      can access them at any time. Based on results from the health examination the GP may decide&#xD;
      to offer the patient a health dialogue in general practice or the intervention in the in the&#xD;
      municipality (described below). Patients offered a health dialogue in general practice are&#xD;
      given the opportunity to prepare for the subsequent health dialogue by answering a&#xD;
      questionnaire inspired by three systematic reviews on the determinants of behavior change.&#xD;
      These include questions about motivation, resources, former experiences with behavior change,&#xD;
      social network, mental health (WHO-5 for stress; Major Depression Inventory (MDI) for&#xD;
      depression, and an open field section to qualitatively report on perceived facilitators and&#xD;
      barriers to behavior change (a so-called balance-sheet). The questionnaire results are shared&#xD;
      with the GP on the digital support system. Based on the health dialogue, the GP and the&#xD;
      patient develop a prevention plan that includes a goal, a time frame, and identification of&#xD;
      the appropriate means to fulfill the plan (e.g. reference to a smoking cessation course, or&#xD;
      follow-up at the GP). The prevention plan is uploaded to the digital support system by the&#xD;
      GP, and henceforth is accessible to both the GP and the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention at the municipal level The intervention at the municipal level is offered to&#xD;
      patients exhibiting health-risk behavior (Group 3), and Group 2 patients referred to the&#xD;
      municipality by the GP. The intervention consists of a short telephone consultation with a&#xD;
      health professional - for example a nurse, a dietician, or a physiotherapist. A subsequent&#xD;
      face-to-face health dialogue is offered to patients who may benefit from more extensive&#xD;
      support. Patients request the telephone consultation on the digital support system by filling&#xD;
      in a short form and sending it by e-mail to the municipality. A municipal health professional&#xD;
      will then call the patient within the following week. Similar to the GP intervention, the&#xD;
      intervention at the municipal level is thus also determined by patient motivation and&#xD;
      capabilities as well as the extent to which the content of the personal health profile&#xD;
      motivates the patient to take action. Immediately after the intervention, a participation&#xD;
      form is sent to the municipality. Patients can prepare for the upcoming call from a municipal&#xD;
      health professional in the same way as Group 2 patients prepare for the health dialogue -&#xD;
      that is, by answering a short questionnaire. Ultimately, a prevention plan, including&#xD;
      concrete details on its execution, is developed based on the telephone consultation and the&#xD;
      face-to-face health dialogue. The prevention plan is registered by the municipal health&#xD;
      professional and presented on the digital support system to both the municipality and the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire intervention will be offered to the participants during a four-month period from&#xD;
      April to July 2019.&#xD;

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Lifestyle intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>Upon inclusion and consent all patients receive a questionnaire to estimate risk of disease and risk behavior. Information about lifestyle is systematically registered and collated with existing Electronic Patient Record (EPR) data and the patients risk of developing a lifestyle-related disease is estimated based on validated algorithms for risk of type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and COPD (Stratification). All patients receive digital feedback including a personal health profile and targeted advice. Patients at high risk of lifestyle-related disease(s) are offered targeted prevention activities at the GP including a health examination and if needed a health dialog. Patients with health risk behavior are offered behavior counselling in the municipality and community health services, if necessary. Patients diagnosed with a lifestyle related disease and patients with a healthy lifestyle are not offered any further services.</description>
