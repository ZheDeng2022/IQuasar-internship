  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All clinical practice includes decision making, and sometimes you are ethically challenging&#xD;
      because of the consequences it will bring to the patient, the health professional or society&#xD;
      in general. Ethics seeks the best solution to a better treatment and seeks to increase the&#xD;
      quality of life of the patient with correct decision making. Ethical / bioethical&#xD;
      considerations are of a generic nature, and do not apply to specific situations. Therefore,&#xD;
      it is suggested that there should be guidelines or recommendations in the field of palliative&#xD;
      care in Mexico that may be an adjunct to decision making. The relevance of knowledge,&#xD;
      application and management of ethical / bioethical recommendations is unknown as part of&#xD;
      decision-making by professionals dedicated to palliative care in our country, taking into&#xD;
      consideration the principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-malfeasance and Justice. It is&#xD;
      necessary to consider the participation of patients, caregivers and health personnel in this&#xD;
      decision making process of decisions. This study intends to identify the current situation of&#xD;
      this issue in Mexico.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the characteristics of decision-making with bioethical involvement in palliative&#xD;
      care in a representative sample of care professionals in some regions of the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative method:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the current situation in decision-making with bioethical involvement in&#xD;
           palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify if the personnel dedicated to palliative care know guidelines or&#xD;
           recommendations related to decision-making in palliative care and the current legal&#xD;
           framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Know the strategies that palliative care personnel follow in situations in which the&#xD;
           decision to make is difficult or problematic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative method:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Know the particular situations that signify a conflict or situation with bioethical&#xD;
           implications for health professionals in palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyze the variables that influence decision-making around the application of bioethics&#xD;
           in palliative care.&#xD;
