  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to pragmatically investigate whether participation of people&#xD;
      with diabetes and prediabetes in an Exercise and Lifestyle Education Program (i.e., exercise&#xD;
      and education classes) results in better functional capacity, disease-related knowledge and&#xD;
      behavior, and cardiometabolic health parameters when compared to Exercise Program (i.e.,&#xD;
      exercise class only). In addition, the effects of these interventions will be evaluated on&#xD;
      other outcomes: program adherence, satisfaction with the program, quality of life, diet&#xD;
      quality, depression, and morbidity associated with diabetes in the 6 months follow-up.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design is a multicenter, double-blind (outcomes assessors and data analysts), randomized&#xD;
      and controlled trial with 2 parallel arms: Exercise Program (Ex) and Exercise and Lifestyle&#xD;
      Education Program (ExLE). The sample size was calculated considering the ISWT distance as the&#xD;
      primary outcome and based on a previous study that tested the effects of a comprehensive&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation program on the same primary outcome in coronary patients. The&#xD;
      calculation was made using R Software version 3.4.3 and considering the following parameters:&#xD;
      moderate effect size (d = 0.20), the statistical power of 80%, an alpha level of 5%,&#xD;
      one-sided test, two arms, and three measurements. A total of 200 participants (100 per&#xD;
      program) was required. Assuming a 20% attrition rate based on previous studies using&#xD;
      educational intervention in Cardiac Rehabilitation patients, it will take 120 participants in&#xD;
      each program to sign the consent form to have 200 participants complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults with diabetes and prediabetes will be recruited from the public and private health&#xD;
      services in two Brazilian cities (Belo Horizonte and Juiz de Fora). Volunteers will&#xD;
      participate in the interventions for 12 weeks and be invited for follow-up and reassessment&#xD;
      after 6 months of program completion. In this sense, three assessments will be performed:&#xD;
      pre-intervention (baseline), after 12 weeks of intervention, and 6 months post-program&#xD;
      completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial assessment will comprise an interview to obtain their clinical characteristics&#xD;
      and sociodemographic data, medical history, vital signs measurement, electrocardiographic&#xD;
      monitoring, and measurement of primary, secondary and tertiary outcomes (other pre-specified&#xD;
      outcome measures) through questionnaires and specific tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients approached, the date and the reasons for inclusion/exclusion will be&#xD;
      registered. With informed written consent from the patient, potentially eligible participants&#xD;
      will be scheduled to come on-site to complete initial assessments. Eligible participants will&#xD;
      be randomized to one of the 2 groups. The generation of the randomized allocation sequence&#xD;
      will be performed by the project coordinator using the software available on the website&#xD;
      www.randomization.com. To ensure allocation concealment, the local research coordinators have&#xD;
      the allocation sequence in a password-protected file. They will only provide randomization&#xD;
      information to the research team member once it is confirmed the participant is eligible. Due&#xD;
      to the nature of the intervention, participants and the research team members cannot be blind&#xD;
      to the treatment allocated. However, an independent research member blinded to the group&#xD;
      allocation will perform database management and analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group Ex and ExLE participants will be submitted to a supervised and individually&#xD;
      prescribed exercise program consisting of aerobic (walking) and muscle-strengthening exercise&#xD;
      sessions. This exercise program is 12 weeks in duration with 16 exercise sessions of&#xD;
      approximately 1 hour offered at the following frequencies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 1: 4 weeks - supervised exercise sessions 2x/week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 2: 8 weeks - supervised exercise sessions 1x/week&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each session will be constituted by moderate-intensity walking and muscle strength exercises&#xD;
      encompassing the main muscle groups, using bodyweight or elastic bands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, they will receive counseling for unsupervised exercise sessions in their&#xD;
      community to aim to accumulate a minimum of 150 min/week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in ExLE also attend education classes using the educational curriculum of&#xD;
      Diabetes College offered through different tools, including the website, patient workbook,&#xD;
      and learning management. A health educator team will deliver education classes after each&#xD;
      exercise session, and participants receive a comprehensive education workbook to accompany&#xD;
      the sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The workbook was developed by Diabetes College group researchers in Canada, and the English&#xD;
      version has been translated and culturally adapted to Brazilian Portuguese. This tool, titled&#xD;
      &quot;A Guide to Help You Live and Thrive with Diabetes&quot; or &quot;Guia para Uma Vida Plena com&#xD;
      Diabetes,&quot; contains 20 chapters developed by a multi-disciplinary committee of health&#xD;
      professionals based on diabetes patients' needs. Chapters are organized into 5 sections:&#xD;
      treat diabetes, get active, eat healthy, feel well, and take control. In total, there will be&#xD;
      offered 18 educational sessions since there will be an initial extra class for program&#xD;
      introduction and an extra final class for program graduation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes College is an educational program that helps people live and thrive with diabetes.&#xD;
      The program development was based on patients' educational needs (assessed by the information&#xD;
      needs assessment and focus groups) in the University Health Network in Toronto/Canada. This&#xD;
      program can help diabetes patients improve their health and functional capacity, make&#xD;
      lifestyle changes, control their blood sugar, and prevent diabetes (if they have&#xD;
      prediabetes). These objectives can be achieved by teaching patients what diabetes is and how&#xD;
      it impacts their health, how diabetes medicines work and help control blood sugar, and how to&#xD;
      make lifestyle changes to take control of their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be invited to the follow-up after completion of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 6-month follow-up, participants will be instructed to record their&#xD;
      Diabetes-related morbidity information on the standardized sheet developed by the research&#xD;
      team. Research team members will make monthly phone calls to participants to remind them to&#xD;
      perform this registration properly. Besides that, to minimize drop-outs to follow-up, the&#xD;
      research team members will send email and phone reminders for patients about to come on-site&#xD;
      to the 6-month follow-up assessment post-intervention.&#xD;

This is an 18-item self-administered tool which item contents are related to situations that may compromise the adherence to regular physical exercising, e. g. when feeling tired or during the holidays. The respondent should indicate from 0 (no confident) to 100 (very confident) how much confidence he or she has about maintaining the physical exercise routine face of the situation described in that item. The total score is the average from the eighteen items scores, and higher total scores indicate great exercise self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>This outcome will be assessed from the total score of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Mediterranean diet scale (MDS). The MDS has 13 items which quantitatively assess adherence to standard Mediterranean food elements [21]. The answer options are dichotomous: yes and no. Some questions have pictures and examples to help participants to answer the questions. One point is scored for each yes answered. Total scores range from 0 to 13. Scores below 5 indicate poor adherence to the MedDiet, and scores greater than 10 indicate high adherence.</description>
