        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with the investigational product (IP) or medicinal product. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) was defined as any event emerging or manifesting at or after the initiation of treatment with an IP or medicinal product or any existing event that worsened in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the IP or medicinal product.</description>
