  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With an increased incidence of pediatric type 1 diabetes (T1D) and a decrease in age at&#xD;
      diagnosis, children are exposed to complications such as renal impairment at a very young&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current biomarker used to diagnose renal impairment is microalbuminuria, but it's a late&#xD;
      marker. Early screening is a major issue to reduce T1D consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early glomerular hyperfiltration (GHF) could participate in the development and progression&#xD;
      of nephropathy. Hyperfiltration has also been associated with a systemic endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction and with changes in arterial stiffness, suggesting, at least to a certain extent,&#xD;
      a state of generalized vascular dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is responsible for very early neurovascular dysfunctions, detectable with techniques&#xD;
      to evaluate cutaneous neurovascular interaction. Those should help bringing to light very&#xD;
      early microcirculation impairment, particularly precocious endothelial dysfunction (ED).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study about correlation between GHF and ED is currently available. The hypothesis assessed&#xD;
      is those of a strong correlation between ED and GHF in children and adolescent with a story&#xD;
      of T1D for at least 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study should allow assessing ED's and GHF's proportions in our population, in&#xD;
      order to conduct a larger study to prove, in a prospective way, the prognostic value of ED in&#xD;
      the apparition of nephropathy, taking into count other factors such as diabetes duration or&#xD;
      stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This measure could be included in the global evaluation of microangiopathy risk in children&#xD;
      and then take action to prevent negative outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aspect of this study is the assessment of other functions and metabolisms possibly&#xD;
      impaired in T1D: osseous microarchitecture, vitamin D status and precocious evaluation of&#xD;
      macro angiopathy through intima media thickness measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term diabetes in children is associated with shorter and leaner bones, despite a correct&#xD;
      mineralization, a reduced bone density and a fracture risk increased six fold. Bone status in&#xD;
      the population will be evaluated through the study of bones microarchitecture via HR-pQCT&#xD;
      (High Resolution peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography) on both tibia and radius,&#xD;
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and bone turn over biochemical markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results on bone microarchitecture in a preexisting cohort of healthy children and adolescents&#xD;
      will be used to compare results.&#xD;
