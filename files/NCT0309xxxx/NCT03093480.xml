    <description>A bleeding episode started from the first sign of a bleed and ended no more than 72 hours after the last treatment for the bleed, within which any symptoms of bleeding at the same location or injections less than or equal to 72 hours apart were considered the same bleeding episode.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; in the view of the Investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition.</description>

    <description>Participants were to receive rFVIIIFc at a dose of 200 international units (IU)/kilogram (kg) as once daily injections or divided on several injections per day at the discretion of the Investigator, starting at baseline visit up to maximum of 48 Weeks in ITI Period. Participants who met the criteria for immune tolerance induction (ITI) success entered the tapering period and received rFVIIIFc at a dose adjusted according to Investigator judgment based on the FVIII activity levels and with the aim of tapering the rFVIIIFc dose to reach a prophylactic dosing regimen within 16 weeks (4 months). Follow-Up was for 32 weeks under an adjusted prophylactic regimen according to Investigator judgment.</description>
