    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a&#xD;
      single dose of a recombinant live-attenuated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in&#xD;
      RSV-seronegative infants and children 6 to 24 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a companion study to IMPAACT 2013.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of serious acute lower&#xD;
      respiratory illness (LRI) in infants and children under 5 years of age worldwide. This study&#xD;
      will evaluate whether D46/NS2/N/ΔM2-2-HindIII vaccine is attenuated and immunogenic in&#xD;
      children 6 to 24 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the RSV&#xD;
      D46/NS2/N/ΔM2-2-HindIII vaccine or placebo at study entry (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in the study between April 1 and October 31 (outside of RSV&#xD;
      season) and will remain on study until they complete the post-RSV season visit between April&#xD;
      1 and April 30 in the calendar year following enrollment. Participants' total study duration&#xD;
      will be between 6 and 13 months, depending on when they enroll in the study. Participants&#xD;
      will be evaluated in study visits that may include physical examinations, blood collection,&#xD;
      and nasal washes. Additionally, participants' parents or guardians will be contacted by study&#xD;
      staff at various times during the study to monitor participants' health.&#xD;
