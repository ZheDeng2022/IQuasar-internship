  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II pilot study aims at evaluating the benefits and the risks of methylphenidate&#xD;
      (Concerta®) for the treatment of cocaine/crack dependence in terms of cocaine/crack use&#xD;
      reduction and adverse events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive pharmacotherapy based on methylphenidate (18 mg per tablet) with a&#xD;
      3-week titration phase to a maximum dose of 108 mg per day, with a weekly follow-up during 3&#xD;
      months. Socio-demographic and behavioral data will be collected through phone interviews&#xD;
      every month. During medical visits, self-administered and clinical questionnaires will&#xD;
      collect clinical and behavioral data. Urine drug toxicologies and blood sampling will be&#xD;
      performed to gather biological, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study should identify an effective response-dose of methylphenidate for people with a&#xD;
      cocaine use disorder. The methylphenidate should be effective to reduce cocaine use in&#xD;
      cocaine-dependent individuals with a good tolerability. The results of pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic analyses will give us the effective dose of methylphenidate and some&#xD;
      information on toxicity to adapt the surveillance in a future clinical trial.&#xD;
