      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herpes virus can cause sores on the body. It can cause flu-like symptoms like fever and&#xD;
      muscle aches, and even a type of cancer. Many people with HIV also have infections with&#xD;
      herpes virus. When these people start taking HIV medicines, their herpes virus symptoms can&#xD;
      suddenly start or become worse. Researchers want to find out more about how often this&#xD;
      happens and why.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effects of HIV treatment in women who may have herpes virus infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women age 18 years and older who have been diagnosed with HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood and urine&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have about 8 study visits. Each will take about 1-2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return to the clinic 1-2 weeks after the screening visit to receive their&#xD;
      antiretroviral (ART) medicine. They will get instructions for taking it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 6 more study visits over 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During study visits, participants will have blood and urine tests, vaginal fluid collected,&#xD;
      and an oral swab. They may have an external genital exam. They will get their next supply of&#xD;
      ART medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants may have a chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have leukapheresis. Blood will be removed through a needle in an arm. It&#xD;
      will be run through a machine that separates out the white blood cells. The rest of the blood&#xD;
      will be returned through a needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total time participants will be in the study is about 1 year.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) can lead to a short-term increase of herpes&#xD;
      virus-related illnesses including genital herpes flares, higher likelihood of varicella&#xD;
      zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) uveitis or other end-organ disease, and herpes&#xD;
      simplex virus (HSV) associated encephalitis. Herpesvirus reactivation upon ART initiation may&#xD;
      be related to immune restoration disease of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome&#xD;
      (IRIS), but the etiology is unclear. We hypothesize that ART initiation can induce&#xD;
      herpesvirus reactivation causing increased cellular, systemic, and localized immune&#xD;
      activation and that alterations of interferon (IFN) pathways during initial HIV viral&#xD;
      suppression are involved in this reactivation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate these mechanisms, we propose to document the incidence of clinical herpetic&#xD;
      disease and viral shedding in vaginal and oral secretions from HIV-positive women initiating&#xD;
      ART and to assess the associations between viral shedding or clinical disease and cellular,&#xD;
      mucosal, and systemic immune activation. We will determine the role of IFN pathway in&#xD;
      herpesvirus reactivation following initiation of ART. We will also evaluate the potential&#xD;
      impact of herpesvirus reactivation on HIV cellular reservoirs by comparing residual HIV&#xD;
      plasma viral replication and cell-associated virus prior to and 52 weeks after ART&#xD;
      initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to enroll up to 200 HIV-infected women initiating ART at the NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
      (n=30 to 40) and between the Villa Maria Hospital, Rakai Health Sciences Program (RHSP) site&#xD;
      in Kalisizo, Uganda and Kalisizo Hospital ARV clinic (n=160 to 170). Women will be recruited&#xD;
      regardless of CD4+ T-cell count, presence of opportunistic infections and co-infection&#xD;
      status. Pregnant women will be excluded. During 8 study visits to occur over a 12-month&#xD;
      period, participants will receive standard-of-care treatment for HIV and opportunistic&#xD;
      infections. Blood, vaginal fluid and oral swabs collected at study visits will be tested for&#xD;
      viral levels of HIV and various herpesviruses. Vaginal samples will also be used to study&#xD;
      differences in vaginal microbiota between women with and without herpetic disease prior and&#xD;
      after ART. Plasma samples will be tested for antibody levels (IgG) specific for different&#xD;
      herpesviruses to examine changes in anti-herpetic humoral responses. ART adherence will be&#xD;
      monitored in plasma using high-resolution mass spectrometry.&#xD;

        Approximately 200 women initiating ART as part of standard HIV care will be recruited at&#xD;
        four sites, the NIH Clinical Center (approximately 30-40), the RHSP/ICER , the Villa Maria&#xD;
        Hospital and the Kalisizo sites in Uganda (approximately 160-170). Women will be recruited&#xD;
        regardless of CD4+ T-cell count, presence of opportunistic infections and co-infection&#xD;
        status. Participants taking antibiotics for co-infections and prophylaxis will be able to&#xD;
        participate in the study and antibiotic use will be captured in study data. Participants&#xD;
        may co-enroll in other non-interventional studies. Pregnant women will be excluded.&#xD;
