  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of gemcitabine&#xD;
      that can be given by inhalation (breathing it as a mist) to patients with solid tumors that&#xD;
      have spread to the lungs from other parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and side effects of this drug will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Gemcitabine is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of pancreatic and lung cancer, and other solid tumors. Its administration by&#xD;
      inhalation is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to&#xD;
      work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 44 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of gemcitabine based on when you join this study. Up to 6 dose levels of gemcitabine&#xD;
      will be tested. Up to 3 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of&#xD;
      participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose&#xD;
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects are seen. This will continue until&#xD;
      the highest tolerable dose of gemcitabine is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 28 days. You will take gemcitabine by mist 2 times each week for 4 weeks&#xD;
      (28 days). Treatment will be administered at MD Anderson. A machine called a nebulizer will&#xD;
      be used to make the gemcitabine mist. The study staff will provide you with protective&#xD;
      materials and instructions on how to take the treatment. You will breathe the drug mist&#xD;
      through the mouthpiece of the nebulizer. The study staff will tell you which days you will&#xD;
      receive the study drug. If the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you may continue to&#xD;
      receive the study drug for up to 12 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drug for up to 12 cycles. You will no longer be able to&#xD;
      take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you&#xD;
      are unable to follow study directions. If you have developed a tumor outside of the lungs&#xD;
      either before or while you are on study, and the doctor thinks it is in your best interest,&#xD;
      you may have a local control procedure (such as radiation or surgery) that may help to&#xD;
      control the disease while continuing to receive the study drug. You would sign a separate&#xD;
      consent form explaining these procedures and their risks. If you and your doctor decide on a&#xD;
      systemic cancer treatment by mouth or vein, you will no longer be able to receive treatment&#xD;
      on this study. A systemic cancer treatment is designed to spread and treat cancer cells&#xD;
      throughout the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after your last follow-up phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 3 days before Day 1 of every cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have PFTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have your blood oxygen level measured by pulse oximeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you can become pregnant, urine will be collected for a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 8 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a CT scan at the end of Cycles 2, 4, and 6, and then every 3 cycles after that.&#xD;
      The study doctor will tell you when you will have these scans. If you have a chest X-ray,&#xD;
      MRI, and PET scan as part of standard of care while you are on study, the study doctor may&#xD;
      use the results to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid having to come to the study clinic too often, you may have blood draws done by your&#xD;
      personal doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may be called by the study staff and asked about how you are doing and about any side&#xD;
      effects about 1 day after your first 2 doses of the study drug, at the end of Cycle 1, and 1&#xD;
      time every 3 months after that until you leave the study or the study ends. These calls&#xD;
      should last about 15-20 minutes each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each day that you take study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will write down the date and the day of the study cycle in a dosing diary given to&#xD;
           you by the study staff. You should bring the diary to all clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given a pulse oximeter to measure your heart rate and blood oxygen level.&#xD;
           Â°You should record your results in the dosing diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will use a small hand-held device to test your lung function before the dose and&#xD;
           answer questions about side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also be given an electronic device (such as a laptop or tablet) so that you can&#xD;
      upload the information from the lung function tests and send it to the study doctor. You will&#xD;
      only be able to access study specific material on this device. The study staff will show you&#xD;
      how to use all of the provided machines. If the device is lost, stolen, or damaged, you will&#xD;
      need to immediately report it to the study staff and you will be responsible for its&#xD;
      replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should bring the nebulizer with you to all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to return the nebulizer, pulse oximeter, lung function device, and&#xD;
      electronic device when your participation on this study is over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Dosing Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days of your last dose of the study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have PFTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have your blood oxygen level measured by pulse oximeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT scan.&#xD;

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) Recommended for Phase 2 Dose of Aerosol Gemcitabine (GCB)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MTD is defined as highest dose level with six patients with at most 1 dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurring during cycle 1. Dose levels will continue to be increased until 1 participant experiences DLT. If only 1 of 3 participants experiences DLT, 3 additional patients will be entered.&#xD;
Dose escalation conducted via accelerated titration method for first 2 dose levels followed by 3+3 method for remaining dose levels. Cohorts of 1 participant per dose level for first 2 dose levels. If at any time during cycle 1 there is an instance of pulmonary grade 2 toxicity or pulmonary function tests (PFT) decline&gt;10% related to study drug, current dose level expanded to 3 participants &amp; switched to 3+3 design. If neither of these nor any other DLT occur in dose levels 1-2, switch will be to the 3 + 3 design beginning with dose level 3. Three participants will be treated at dose level 3, if still no DLT, 3 more treated at dose level 4.</description>
