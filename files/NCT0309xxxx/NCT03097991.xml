  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This R01 tests through RCT methodology efficacy of a new intervention designed specifically&#xD;
      to aid development of positive coparenting alliances between at-risk (unmarried, uncoupled,&#xD;
      low income) African American mothers and fathers having a first baby together.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy-five randomly-assigned control group families will receive county services as-usual&#xD;
      (TAU) for pregnant parents and assistance of the partnering health and human service agencies&#xD;
      with referrals to desired services, while 75 experimental group families will receive the&#xD;
      same services and aid, plus a 6-session prenatal intervention with a post-natal booster&#xD;
      session. The intervention addresses the importance of safe, healthy families for early infant&#xD;
      development, the impact a cooperative and sustained coparenting alliance can have in&#xD;
      promoting positive infant development, challenges unmarried parents face cultivating a&#xD;
      coparenting alliance together when their commitment to one another as romantic or married&#xD;
      partners is in doubt, and ways to surmount these obstacles, maintain rapport, and sustain a&#xD;
      strong alliance. Participating families, both at intake (prior to the intervention) and then&#xD;
      again at 3 and 12 months post-partum, will report beliefs about fatherhood; extent of&#xD;
      depressive symptomatology; and quality of the mother-father partnership, including intimate&#xD;
      partner violence (IPV). State-of-the-field coparenting observations will be conducted at each&#xD;
      follow-up, along with new measures of perceived coparenting communication and respect, father&#xD;
      engagement, parent stress, and (at 12 months) infant socioemotional adjustment. Analyses will&#xD;
      examine impact of the intervention on promoting more supportive, coordinated post-partum&#xD;
      coparenting alliances and more positive adult and infant outcomes. Exploratory analyses will&#xD;
      examine questions relevant to father associations with child adjustment and whether the&#xD;
      dyadic coparent intervention has an impact on IPV.&#xD;

    <description>Six 90-minute sessions completed within 10 weeks address importance of coparenting for child development; overcoming challenges to coparenting collaboratively; anger and conflict management and communication skills. Parents develop a coparenting plan to support one another's involvement as parents to the baby. A 90-minute booster session one month after the baby's birth reinforces lessons learned in the 6-session intervention.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        An applicant is considered eligible if the pregnancy is the mother's first with the baby's&#xD;
        father; the mother and father are unmarried; and reported income places at or below the&#xD;
        county and state poverty line. The target population is African American, but mixed race&#xD;
        parents may also enroll so long as at least one parent is African American. Minor parents&#xD;
        will be recruited only if legally emancipated or with consent of their parent or guardian&#xD;
        (with an exception allowed if minor parent is estranged from parent or LAR). If a potential&#xD;
        participant reports a prior history of IPV, s/he may still be eligible for participation&#xD;
        pending a more detailed assessment completed by trained project staff using the Danger&#xD;
        Assessment Scale (Campbell, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Families are excluded if either partner 1) has recently (within the past year) been&#xD;
        arrested and convicted for violence (assault) perpetrated against someone other than a&#xD;
        current or former partner who is the co-parent of one of their children; 2) demonstrates&#xD;
        evidence of psychotic symptoms or suicidal ideation on the Brief Symptom Inventory; or 3)&#xD;
        is deemed high risk or in need of more intensive intervention. Risk determination is made&#xD;
        by weighing the parent's report on the Danger Assessment Scale (DAS). As a rule of thumb,&#xD;
        DAS scores of 9 or higher result in automatic exclusion from the study. However, even with&#xD;
        a score below 9, a parent may disclose one or more of the following issues during&#xD;
        administration of the DAS - any of which would result in exclusion from the study: 1)&#xD;
        parent reports requiring medical care because of significant injuries due to partner's&#xD;
        violence, 2) parent says she fears for her life, 3) parent reports that the partner has&#xD;
        threatened with a weapon and owns a gun or has a gun in the household; 4) parent reports&#xD;
        that the partner has threatened to kill her; 5) parent reports that violence has escalated&#xD;
        recently; 6) parent reports the partner's use of illicit drugs such as cocaine,&#xD;
        methamphetamines, hallucinogens, or opiates.&#xD;
