  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent myocardial infarctions (reinfarctions) can be due to recurrence at the original&#xD;
      treatment site, the presence of untreated lesions elsewhere, or in progressive lesions. There&#xD;
      are scarce published data describing the localization (affected vessel/s) and severity&#xD;
      (NSTE-ACS/STE-ACS) of reinfarction(s) compared to the index MI (e.g proportion of recurrent&#xD;
      infarctions in the previously diseased vessel) in large unselected patient populations. If&#xD;
      reinfarctions are generally more severe than index MI/recurrent MI(s), this might have&#xD;
      implications for choice of treatment and treatment length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, data from unselected patient populations on the overall incidence pattern/rate of&#xD;
      patients experiencing multiple reinfarctions is sparse. Patients who experience multiple&#xD;
      ischemic events may be a subset of patients who are poor responders to therapy. There is also&#xD;
      a possibility that patients with multiple events are less likely to have received&#xD;
      evidence-based therapy such as coronary stenting, novel and more effective antithrombotics&#xD;
      and modern lipid lowering treatment for the initial event. Poor adherence to secondary&#xD;
      prevention measures (e.g. low compliance to medication and adherence to cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs) may also increase the risk of recurrent events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore identification of the baseline characteristics, including treatment decision&#xD;
      strategies in the setting of a myocardial infarction, among such subjects may allow&#xD;
      modifications of the clinical management strategy prior to the occurrence of subsequent&#xD;
      ischemic events. Such modifications could include providing a more intensive or additional&#xD;
      therapy in certain patient groups or find strategies to improve patient adherence and drug&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient with reinfarctions requires more hospitalizations, treatments, laboratory tests,&#xD;
      and out-patient visits, resulting in overall increased costs. From the patient perspective,&#xD;
      recurrent events result in higher mortality and worsened quality of life.&#xD;

      This study will combine the SWEDEHEART registries RIKS-HIA (Registry of Information and&#xD;
      Knowledge about Swedish Heart Intensive care Admissions), SCAAR (Swedish Coronary Angiography&#xD;
      and Angioplasty Registry) and SEPHIA (the registry for secondary prevention following&#xD;
      coronary intensive care); and the Swedish National Population Registry (to obtain data&#xD;
      regarding vital status and date of death), Swedish Cause of Death Register (to separate fatal&#xD;
      from non-fatal MI), the Swedish Patient Registry (to obtain data on prior medical history)&#xD;
      and the Swedish Drug Registry (to obtain prescribed medical treatment and filled&#xD;
      prescriptions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RIKS-HIA database covers all acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients treated at heart&#xD;
      intensive care units in Sweden and SCAAR entails all PCI procedures performed across all&#xD;
      centers in Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will include patients with first time ever of NSTE-ACS and&#xD;
      STE-ACS and receiving care at cardiac intensive care units and entered in the SWEDEHEART&#xD;
      registry between 1 July 2006 and 31 December 2014. Baseline and in-hospital characteristics&#xD;
      will be obtained, including peri-procedural anti-thrombotic treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the incidence rate and fatality of reinfarctions in a contemporary unselected MI&#xD;
      cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize patients with one and multiple reinfarctions during the observation period&#xD;
      vs. those without.&#xD;
