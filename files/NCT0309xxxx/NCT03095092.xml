  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of a&#xD;
      single 400 mg dose of BIA 6-512 (trans-resveratrol) in healthy volunteers&#xD;
    </textblock>

    <textblock>
      Single-centre, open-label, randomised, two-way crossover study in 24 healthy male and female&#xD;
      subjects. The study consisted of 2 single-dose periods separated by a washout of 7 days or&#xD;
      more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects were admitted to the UFH on the day (Day 0) prior to receiving the dose of&#xD;
      study medication (Day 1). On the morning of the next day (Day 1), a BIA 6-512 400 mg dose was&#xD;
      administered following either a standard breakfast (Test) or at least 8 hours of fasting&#xD;
      (Reference). Subjects remained confined in the UFH from admission (Day 0) until at least 24 h&#xD;
      post dose (Day 2); then, they were discharged and returned for the second treatment period or&#xD;
      a follow-up visit.&#xD;

    <description>4 capsules of BIA 6-512 100 mg / oral administration with 240 mL of potable water .Subjects were administered a 400 mg BIA 6-512 single-dose on two different occasions. In one treatment period subjects were dosed with a single oral dose of 400 mg after a fasting of at least 8 hours, and in the other treatment period subjects were dosed with a single oral dose of 400 mg after a standard meal. Subjects were requested to fast overnight for at least 8 hours before product administration.</description>
