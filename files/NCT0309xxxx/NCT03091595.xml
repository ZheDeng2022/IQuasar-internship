  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing 15 mg E4 and 3 mg DRSP administered for 24&#xD;
      days followed by 4 placebo tablets, is being evaluated for further development. This study&#xD;
      will investigate the effect of this COC on ovarian function inhibition, levels of serum&#xD;
      luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2) and progesterone&#xD;
      during 3 treatment cycles in comparison with the reference COC 20 mcg EE/3 mg DRSP.&#xD;
