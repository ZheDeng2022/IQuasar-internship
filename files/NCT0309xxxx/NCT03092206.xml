    <textblock>
      Investigation of possible changes in insulin sensitivity in healthy volunteers taking the&#xD;
      following HIV treatment combinations: F/TAF (group 1) as compared to E/C/F/TAF (group 2) as&#xD;
      compared to R/F/TAF (group 3). The measurement of insulin sensitivity will be performed in 30&#xD;
      HIV-negative healthy non-obese (BMI 18-25) male volunteers before and after 14±2 days of&#xD;
      treatment. The volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups. Changes in&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity will be measured by golden standard hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp&#xD;
      (HEGC) technique, using glucose and insulin infusion as diagnostic agents&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly immediately following the characterization of HIV, the metabolic disturbances in&#xD;
      HIV-positive patients, particularly changes in insulin sensitivity, were reported. The&#xD;
      chronic inflammation due to metabolic changes caused by HIV-Infection on one hand and the&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) itself on the other hand were considered major contributors to&#xD;
      pathological changes in insulin sensitivity in HIV-positive patients. There were two possible&#xD;
      mechanisms discussed in the literature: Direct effects on insulin-associated cellular glucose&#xD;
      uptake and indirect effects of changes in lipid metabolism, i.e. the lipotoxicity.&#xD;
      Particularly, thymidine analogues, such as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI)&#xD;
      were strongly linked to lipotoxicity and depletion of mitochondric DNA, causing insulin&#xD;
      resistance (IR) in HIV-positive patients and healthy volunteers, ultimately resulting in&#xD;
      overt diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, protease inhibitors (PI) showed lipotoxicity, further&#xD;
      increasing insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of insulin resistance and, ultimately, diabetes mellitus in patients receiving&#xD;
      ART increases over time, significantly contributing to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      in HIV-positive patients. Due to significant increases both in life expectation and duration&#xD;
      of ART in HIV-patients, the early recognition of unfavorable metabolic changes (i. e. insulin&#xD;
      resistance) gains in importance. Particularly, the considerations of long-term toxicity and&#xD;
      safety of ART are receiving more and more attention. Unfortunately, the appropriate&#xD;
      strategies for screening, surveillance and therapeutic consequences are not well established&#xD;
      in HIV-positive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the very well established HIV nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor Tenofovir&#xD;
      disaproxil fumarate (TDF) was associated with a favorable influence on lipids and with no&#xD;
      known negative effects on insulin sensitivity, the new drug Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) has&#xD;
      not been analyzed in concern of changes in insulin sensitivity yet. As TAF has been recently&#xD;
      submitted for approval by FDA and EMEA for treatment of HIV-positive patients, widespread use&#xD;
      and potential replacement of TDF can be expected soon. Fixed dose combinations with&#xD;
      Emtricitabine (F/TAF) or cobicistat-boosted elvitegravir (E/C/F/TAF) or rilpivirine (R/F/TAF)&#xD;
      have been developed and will take part in ART settings. Unfortunately, only limited data&#xD;
      exists on metabolic effects of TAF or TAF-containing fixed dose combination drugs,&#xD;
      particularly concerning changes in lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity in HIV-positive&#xD;
      patients or healthy volunteers. For providing more safety data concerning changes in insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and associated effects on lipids more data should be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to investigate the possible changes in insulin sensitivity, measured as described&#xD;
      below by &quot;hyperinsulinemic eugylcemic clamp&quot; in healthy volunteers taking TAF/FTC (group 1)&#xD;
      as compared to E/C/F/TAF (group 2) as compared to R/F/TAF (group 3). To our best of&#xD;
      knowledge, there are currently no data available investigating changes in insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      of TAF-containing ART-regiments.&#xD;
