  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to improve the care of the obstetric population after cesarean section and&#xD;
      improve total patient satisfaction by improving post-surgical pain control with the use of&#xD;
      dexamethasone in combination with bilateral TAP blocks. The investigators will utilize a&#xD;
      dose-escalation of dexamethasone in the TAP block to observe its effects at specific small&#xD;
      doses. It is the hope of the investigator that the studied technique would become utilized&#xD;
      routinely for the obstetric population following cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to show that the addition of dexamethasone in bilateral TAP blocks&#xD;
      will prolong the duration of the block in a dose-dependent fashion. The investigators hope to&#xD;
      improve post-operative pain following cesarean section, increase duration of TAP block with&#xD;
      use of dexamethasone, decrease overall pain scores in the first 24-48 hours, and decrease&#xD;
      opioid requirements after cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be estimation of duration of TAP block, being assessed within 48&#xD;
      hours after surgery. Secondary endpoints will include pain scores both in PACU and on the&#xD;
      floor, average pain scores, time until first opioid administration, total opioid consumption&#xD;
      in first 48 hours, use of PONV medications, and overall patient satisfaction.&#xD;

      Preoperatively: informed consent will be obtained by a member of this study. The patients&#xD;
      will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria on day of procedure, and then the&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to one of three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperatively: The anesthesia team involved with care of patient in the operating room&#xD;
      will provide routine anesthesia care during the cesarean section including neuraxial&#xD;
      anesthesia with intrathecal bupivacaine and morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the procedure, the patients will receive bilateral TAP block procedure&#xD;
      while still in OR. All blocks will include 20mL of 0.5% ropivacaine, and the patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned a specific dose of dexamethasone at 0mg (given normal saline as control),&#xD;
      2mg, or 4mg. The resident or attending physician supervising the block will be investigators&#xD;
      of the study, and they along with the residents performing the blocks will be blinded to the&#xD;
      amount of dexamethasone in the injectate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively: The patients will then be monitored in the PACU for approximately 30-60&#xD;
      minutes and then subsequently monitored on an inpatient floor. Pain scores, time until first&#xD;
      opioid dose, total opioid requirement will be assessed and recorded. In PACU, these will be&#xD;
      recorded every 15-30 minutes. On the inpatient floor, these will be recorded every 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain scores, average pain scores in first 48 hours, total opioid consumption, time until&#xD;
      first opioid use, and PONV medication requirement will also be recorded. These will be&#xD;
      recorded by review of the electronic medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satisfaction scores and estimation of TAP block duration will be assessed and recorded by&#xD;
      anesthesia personnel approximately 48 hours post-operatively; these will be subjective&#xD;
      evaluations recorded between 24-38 hours postoperatively. The patients will be asked to&#xD;
      estimate how long they felt the block lasted. For satisfaction scores, patients will rate&#xD;
      their satisfaction subjectively on a scale of 1-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: all demographic and clinical variables with continuous measures will be&#xD;
      expressed as means and standard deviations; categorical factors will be expressed as&#xD;
      proportions. For non-normal data, the medians and inter quartile ranges will be displayed.&#xD;
      The distribution of the continuous factors will be examined using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov&#xD;
      test. For data that are normally distributed, one-way ANOVA will be used to compare groups of&#xD;
      data. For data that are not normally distributed, the Kruskal-Wallis test will be used for&#xD;
      comparisons. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests will be used to analyze categorical data.&#xD;
      For all comparisons, a value of p &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS for Windows, version 9.2. One-way ANOVA (or&#xD;
      the Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate) will be used to compare duration of TAP block for&#xD;
      the three groups. Linear regression will also be used to test the relationship between&#xD;
      duration of block and dexamethasone dose, while controlling for relevant clinical and&#xD;
      demographic variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-way ANOVA (or the Kruskal-Wallis test) will be used to compare the groups on&#xD;
      post-operative pain scores, opioid requirements, and patient satisfaction scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Power and Sample Size Estimates: Approximately 69 subjects (23 per group) are&#xD;
      expected to be enrolled in this study. Given this sample size and assuming that the average&#xD;
      duration of TAP block is 18 hours for the control group, 22 hours for the 2 mg of&#xD;
      dexamethasone group, and 24 hours for the 4 mg of dexamethasone group, this study will have&#xD;
      approximately 80.9% power to detect a difference in block duration, assuming a common&#xD;
      standard deviation of 6 hours. If the variability in block time is smaller than 6 hours, this&#xD;
      study will have greater power.&#xD;
