      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized&#xD;
      by progressive muscle weakness and eventual death. Studies demonstrate that the immune system&#xD;
      plays a key role in ALS progression; however, the role of the immune system is unclear, as&#xD;
      various aspects can play both a beneficial and detrimental role in the disease course.&#xD;
      Attempts to universally suppress the immune system in ALS patients have at best had&#xD;
      negligible effects on progression or at worst accelerated the disease. Thus, there is a&#xD;
      critical need to identify immune cell populations to serve as biomarkers and therapeutic&#xD;
      targets.&#xD;

      Project Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized&#xD;
      by progressive muscle weakness and eventual death. Studies demonstrate that the immune system&#xD;
      plays a key role in ALS progression; however, the role of the immune system is unclear, as&#xD;
      various aspects can play both a beneficial and detrimental role in the disease course.&#xD;
      Attempts to universally suppress the immune system in ALS patients have at best had&#xD;
      negligible effects on progression or at worst accelerated the disease. Alternatively,&#xD;
      augmenting or depleting specific immune cell populations in ALS mouse models alters the&#xD;
      disease course and slows progression. Thus, there is a critical need to identify immune cell&#xD;
      populations to serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of ALS in both human patients and mouse models. While&#xD;
      clinical symptoms result from motor neuron degeneration, it is becoming increasingly clear&#xD;
      that the immune system plays a key role in pathology. A variety of insults give rise to&#xD;
      identical immune responses which go on to produce the characteristic clinical and&#xD;
      histopathological manifestations of motor neuron disease. This makes the immune system an&#xD;
      attractive target for therapeutics, as the wide variety of potential ALS sources all funnel&#xD;
      through a common immunological pathway over the course of disease. The investigators recent&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that ALS patients have increased levels of several subpopulations&#xD;
      of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in their peripheral blood. A subset of patients has ILC&#xD;
      levels 5-10 times greater than those found in healthy control patients. The differences seen&#xD;
      in the ILC levels in peripheral blood are much greater differences seen in other immune cell&#xD;
      populations during ALS. Thus, these cell populations are attractive candidates for use as&#xD;
      biomarkers or therapeutic targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study can be broken into three broad phases which will applicable to each&#xD;
      patient: recruitment, sample collection, and analysis. Following diagnosis of disease, ALS&#xD;
      patients who live within 1 hour of the University of Michigan will be called by our clinical&#xD;
      coordinator and enrolled in the study (recruitment). Following enrollment in the study, each&#xD;
      of the patients will be visited once every 28 Â± 5 days for a year after the initial visit by&#xD;
      a Michigan Institute for Clinical &amp; Health Research (MICHR) clinical research unit; this unit&#xD;
      will take 20 ml of blood per patient. Samples will then be returned to the University of&#xD;
      Michigan. ILCs will be isolated from peripheral blood using fluorescence-activated cell&#xD;
      sorting (FACS) and the mRNA of each ILC population will be collected and cytokine production&#xD;
      analyzed using multiplex (analysis). On the day of collection, a clinician or clinical&#xD;
      coordinator from the University of Michigan Comprehensive ALS Clinic (UMCAC) will contact the&#xD;
      patient to complete an ALSFRS-R questionnaire to assess the physical deterioration of the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also incorporate control subjects. The control subjects will have blood taken&#xD;
      once a month for 12 total visits over 36 months, but will not complete the ALSFRS-R&#xD;
      questionnaire as they will not have been diagnosed with ALS and therefore the questionnaire&#xD;
      does not fit; 20ml of blood will be taken per visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects need to live within approximately 60 miles of the University of Michigan.&#xD;
