  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy affects between 0.5 and 0.7% of the European population. Despite the availability of&#xD;
      numerous drug treatments, one third of patients still have seizures, which are associated&#xD;
      with significant cognitive and social complications and excess mortality. In these patients,&#xD;
      surgical treatment to remove the epileptogenic zone (EZ), the region of the brain responsible&#xD;
      for seizures, is the only approach that can allow control of the disease. However, before&#xD;
      investigating this surgery, investigations have to answer two questions: (i) what is the&#xD;
      location and extension of the EZ and (ii) what functional risks, both motor and cognitive,&#xD;
      would represent the resection of this Cortical region? As it is a functional surgery, it is&#xD;
      in fact inconceivable that the surgery will result in an over-handicap. For these reasons,&#xD;
      all candidates for surgery benefit from a complete assessment including imaging examinations,&#xD;
      a neuropsychological assessment and a long-term video-EEG recording to record seizures.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, in some patients, this assessment does not give us a formal answer. In these&#xD;
      subjects, it is then necessary to carry out a second step, consisting of an invasive&#xD;
      exploration by implantation of intracerebral electrodes during a stereoencephalography&#xD;
      (SEEG). Due to its temporal and spatial resolution, the SEEG allows, besides the precise&#xD;
      determination of the EZ, to carry out a functional mapping of the cortical regions likely to&#xD;
      be included in cortectomy. Conventionally, this mapping is carried out on the basis of the&#xD;
      cortical electrical stimulations applied to the implanted electrodes. If this approach is&#xD;
      very robust for exploring primary functions such as motor skills or language, it cannot be&#xD;
      used to evaluate more complex cognitive tasks such as face recognition or attention Effective&#xD;
      cognitive treatment on a daily basis. This has led to the development in recent years, in&#xD;
      Lyon and Grenoble, of a complementary approach to cerebral stimulation: dynamic spectral&#xD;
      imaging (ISD). Numerous experimental paradigms have demonstrated that the realization of a&#xD;
      cognitive task associates with the generation within the cortical regions involved in its&#xD;
      treatment of a particular cortical activity. This activity is characterized by oscillations&#xD;
      of the cortical rhythm in high frequencies (&gt; 30 Hz), called gamma activities. The ISD thus&#xD;
      consists in mapping this gamma activity during various cognitive tasks, thus making it&#xD;
      possible to study more widely the complexity of the cognitive functions. Correlations between&#xD;
      gamma activity and cognitive tasks have so far been exclusively performed in the&#xD;
      non-epileptic cortex explored at the periphery of the EA during SEEG. Nevertheless, the&#xD;
      cortical oscillatory pattern study associated with a specific cognitive task within the EZ&#xD;
      could better anticipate complex cognitive deficits that could be generated by the resection&#xD;
      of a cortical region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this project is to establish the predictive character of the gamma&#xD;
      cortical oscillatory pattern associated with a specific cognitive task on the risk of&#xD;
      occurrence of a cognitive disorder after surgery of epilepsy.&#xD;
