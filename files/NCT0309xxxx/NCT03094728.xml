  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to assess HLA compatibility, HLA antibodies and cross matching in liver&#xD;
      transplantation recipients and their relation to acute rejection, CMV infection, and&#xD;
      recurrence of HCV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a cohort study conducted in patients who had undergone LDLT between January 2015 and&#xD;
      January 2016 at in Ain Shams Center for Organ Transplantation (ASCOT) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      HLA Typing and Mismatch:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative blood samples from all recipients and donors were collected. The serological&#xD;
      tissue typing for HLA was performed by a SSP-PCR (sequence-specific- primer). HLA-A, HLA- B,&#xD;
      and HLA-DR loci were examined and used to calculate mismatch scores. The locus-specific type&#xD;
      of HLA mismatch, as well as the degree of HLA mismatch, was then assessed. For each locus&#xD;
      individually, the mismatch number was scored as 0, 1, or 2, on the basis of the number of&#xD;
      donor alleles not shared with the respective recipient. Each patient was assigned an overall&#xD;
      total score depending on the total number of mismatches at the 3 loci, ranging from 0 (no&#xD;
      mismatches at any loci) to 6 (mismatches at all loci)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross matching (total and autocross):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crossmatch involves placing recipient serum (potentially containing donor-specific anti-HLA&#xD;
      antibodies) onto donor lymphocytes (containing HLA antigens).A cytotoxic reaction (deemed&#xD;
      'positive') suggests the presence of preformed DSAbs (donor specific antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autoantibodies are generally IgM rather than IgG antibodies. To establish if autoantibodies&#xD;
      are responsible for the result an auto-crossmatch should be performed. In this assay,&#xD;
      recipient serum is crossmatched against recipient (rather than donor) lymphocytes. Second,&#xD;
      the original crossmatch should be repeated with the addition of the agent Dithiothreitol&#xD;
      (DTT). DTT reduces the disulfide bonds in IgM thereby preventing IgM antibodies from&#xD;
      generating a positive result. IgM antibodies are generally regarded as having no pathological&#xD;
      significance in transplantation.&#xD;
