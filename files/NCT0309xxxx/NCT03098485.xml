    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of antimicrobial (antibiotic) exposures&#xD;
      on the microbiome in healthy adults, specifically during and after usual courses of the&#xD;
      antimicrobials used to treat community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Pneumonia is a lung&#xD;
      infection, and community-acquired pneumonia is pneumonia that develops outside of a&#xD;
      healthcare facility (i.e., in the community). A microbiome is a the community of&#xD;
      microorganisms living in a particular location, such as the gut or the mouth. Disruptions to&#xD;
      a person's microbiome may reduce his/her &quot;colonization resistance&quot; (resistance to&#xD;
      colonization with pathogenic microorganisms) and make him/her more susceptible to multidrug&#xD;
      resistant organism (MDRO) colonization and infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study changes in the microbiome, the investigators will recruit 20 healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers and obtain fecal, salivary, skin, and urine specimens at multiple time points&#xD;
      before, during, and after administration of antimicrobials. Participants will be randomized&#xD;
      to one of 4 antimicrobial regimens, all of which are FDA-approved for treatment of&#xD;
      community-acquired pneumonia. Stool specimens will be analyzed via stool culture and genetic&#xD;
      sequencing, and all remaining specimens will be frozen and used to create a biospecimen&#xD;
      repository for future analysis. The rationale for using healthy volunteers (instead of&#xD;
      patients already prescribed antibiotics by their physicians) is because the human microbiome&#xD;
      is very complex and can be affected by a variety of medical conditions and other medications.&#xD;
      In addition, the presence or absence of patient-specific factors means people with infections&#xD;
      may not be prescribed the specific courses of antibiotics the investigators are trying to&#xD;
      study. Studying the effect of antibiotics on healthy volunteers will provide baseline data&#xD;
      that are more applicable to the population at large.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year, antimicrobial resistance causes over two million infections and 23,000 deaths in&#xD;
      the US alone, representing a critical global public health issue. Some of the most feared&#xD;
      multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs) include Clostridium difficile, carbapenem-resistant&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae&#xD;
      (ESBL), MDRO Acinetobacter, and MDRO Pseudomonas aeruginosa; there are few antimicrobials&#xD;
      effective against these MDROs, and available antimicrobials often have rate-limiting&#xD;
      toxicities. The major risk factor for MDRO colonization and subsequent MDRO infections is&#xD;
      exposure to antimicrobials. The use of antimicrobials has been associated with an altered and&#xD;
      often less diverse composition of the fecal microbiome, and expansion of the resistome. A&#xD;
      &quot;healthy&quot; microbiome provides &quot;colonization resistance&quot; against potentially pathogenic&#xD;
      bacteria; antimicrobials disrupt this protective community, providing selective pressure that&#xD;
      favors MDRO colonization, persistence, and transmission to others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods to proactively prevent MDRO colonization, rather than reliance on reactive approaches&#xD;
      to this problem, are urgently needed. Antimicrobial stewardship is a key component of MDRO&#xD;
      prevention efforts; however, there is no method to determine which antimicrobials cause the&#xD;
      greatest degree of microbiome disruption. A better understanding of exactly how&#xD;
      antimicrobials alter the microbiome is necessary to optimally guide future MDRO prevention&#xD;
      efforts and antimicrobial stewardship. The development of microbiome disruption indices&#xD;
      (MDIs) would help characterize the risk associated with specific antimicrobials, and can be&#xD;
      used during antimicrobial development, patient monitoring while on antimicrobials, and to&#xD;
      facilitate infection prevention efforts to contain MDRO spread. Additionally, MDIs can be&#xD;
      used as an alert when microbiome disruptions reach a critical level and MDRO colonization is&#xD;
      imminent. At that point, interventions to restore the microbiome could be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the leading causes of death in the United&#xD;
      States, with an estimated &gt;900,000 cases each year in adults age 65 and older. Large amounts&#xD;
      of antimicrobials are used in treating patients with CAP because the disease is relatively&#xD;
      common. A better understanding of the effect of CAP antimicrobial treatment on the microbiome&#xD;
      could result in improved treatment options for patients with CAP and protect CAP patients&#xD;
      from colonization or infection with MDROs.&#xD;
