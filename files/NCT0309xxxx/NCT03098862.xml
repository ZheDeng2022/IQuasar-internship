      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genes are instructions that tell the body how to work and grow. They can affect how the body&#xD;
      responds to infection. Researchers want to learn more about genes that affect how the body&#xD;
      responds to the Ebola virus. Some people with Ebola get very sick and die. Others do not. The&#xD;
      research may lead to better treatments for Ebola virus and other germs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To look for genes that may be related to a person s chance of getting very sick after coming&#xD;
      in contact with the Ebola virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People at least 3 years of age who either:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Had Ebola&#xD;
&#xD;
      Had close contact with someone who had Ebola&#xD;
&#xD;
      Were in an Ebola vaccine study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a small amount of blood taken from an arm vein by a needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will collect participants data from other vaccine studies they may have been in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be asked questions about their health and social history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will have their blood tested for the infection syphilis and HIV, the virus&#xD;
      that causes AIDS. Participants will be told the results and will get help finding care, if&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will have their blood sample tested to see if they have had Ebola in the&#xD;
      past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be stored for future research. They will be marked with a code but not&#xD;
      with participants names.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 2013-2015 Ebola Virus outbreak in Western Africa was unprecedented in size and geographic&#xD;
      scope. There were over 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths. During and following the outbreak, it&#xD;
      became evident that spectrum of disease being observed in the communities and the Ebola&#xD;
      treatment units was much broader than previously thought. In this study, we aim to identify&#xD;
      host genetic factors that underlie the observed variation in disease susceptibility,&#xD;
      severity, clinical sequelae, viral persistence, and serological response. We will enroll EVD&#xD;
      survivors, close contacts of survivors, EVD healthcare workers, and individuals who have&#xD;
      received investigational Ebola vaccines (population controls), and collect a blood sample,&#xD;
      HIV/syphilis infection status, demographics, and medical history from participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most subjects will complete study participation after a single study visit; subjects having&#xD;
      Ebola serology and/or HIV/syphilis testing done as part of this study will return for one or&#xD;
      two follow-up visits to receive their HIV/syphilis test results and post-test counseling and&#xD;
      Ebola serology results. We will genotype participants and compare results between cohorts to&#xD;
      address the study aims. This may provide insight into pathogenesis and host immunity and&#xD;
      potentially suggest new methods of intervention.&#xD;
