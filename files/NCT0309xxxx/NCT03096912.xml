  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ribociclib are effective and safe in the&#xD;
      treatment of progressive well/dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WDL/DDL).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The expected duration of this study is 36 months (24 months accrual period and 12 month&#xD;
      follow up period). Enrollment into the screening or treatment phase of the study will be&#xD;
      stopped when the actual subject numbers have been achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single arm single institution, open label, prospective, phase II trial will evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of oral 600mg/daily in 28 day cycles of ribociclib in advanced&#xD;
      well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDL) and de-differentiated liposarcoma (DDL) patients.&#xD;
      Number of patients in the study will reflect the reconciliation between statistical&#xD;
      requirements and incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will continue until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
      noncompliance or withdrawal of consent by the patient or investigator decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All screening requirements must be completed within 28 days of the visit (except for CDK4/6&#xD;
      amplification and pRb, p16 and cyclin D staining status which may be completed in advance).&#xD;
      Patients will be examined on cycle 1 day-1 and every 2 weeks, including complete blood count&#xD;
      (CBC) and chemistry, for the first 8 weeks of treatment, and thereafter every month until&#xD;
      disease progression. CT/MRI imaging (contrast) will be performed every 8 weeks for response&#xD;
      evaluation. Clinical benefit as well as individual categories of response (complete response&#xD;
      (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) will be&#xD;
      determined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST). Response duration&#xD;
      endpoints, including PFS, PFS at 12 weeks and OS will be assessed using the Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      method. Toxicity (AEs) will be recorded using the NCI- Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
      Effects v 4.03 (NCI-CTCAE). Screening procedures will include medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, blood test, baseline CT/MRI imaging and formalin-fixed tissue submission for&#xD;
      FoundationOne mutational analysis.&#xD;
