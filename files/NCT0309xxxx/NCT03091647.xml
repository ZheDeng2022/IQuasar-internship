    <textblock>
      This study develops and pilot tests the efficacy of a home-based, self-administered&#xD;
      acupressure intervention in improving cancer-related fatigue (proximal outcome), and physical&#xD;
      functioning and other quality of life outcomes (distal outcomes) of Chinese immigrant breast&#xD;
      cancer survivors (versus usual care control group).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will enroll 124 foreign-born, Chinese-speaking women from Southern California and Maryland&#xD;
      areas with moderate to severe levels of fatigue, diagnosed with stage 0-IV breast cancer,&#xD;
      aged 21-74, and 1-5 years post-primary treatment. Using an adaptive treatment strategy&#xD;
      design, participants will be randomized to either the acupressure intervention or control&#xD;
      groups. The acupressure group will learn how to press three chief energy acupoints on each&#xD;
      side of the body through de novo 11-minute Chinese-language video and practice acupressure&#xD;
      every day (one minute per acupoint; a total of 6 minutes per day) for an 8-week intervention&#xD;
      period. Participants will be telephone interviewed twice: at baseline and 8-weeks&#xD;
      post-intervention follow-up.&#xD;
