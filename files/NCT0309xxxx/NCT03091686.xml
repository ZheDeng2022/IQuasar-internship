  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Societal changes have resulted in reduced demands to be active and increased daily time spent&#xD;
      sitting. Excessive sitting has been shown to be a health hazard. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to examine whether sedentary behaviour and diabetes information grounded in the Health Action&#xD;
      Process Approach is a meaningful source of motivation to reduce daily sitting time among&#xD;
      adult office workers. The intervention will target risk perceptions related to sitting by&#xD;
      presenting research on prolonged sitting and diabetes risk, the effectiveness of breaking up&#xD;
      prolonged sitting, and provide strategies to break up sitting. It is expected that&#xD;
      participants who receive this information will report greater motivation and intentions to&#xD;
      reduce both work and leisure sitting time.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Using a Health Action Process Approach framework, the purpose of this study is to examine&#xD;
      whether sedentary behaviour and diabetes information is a meaningful source of motivation to&#xD;
      reduce daily sitting time among preintending adult office workers. Specifically, to examine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of an intervention guided by HAPA to influence participants'&#xD;
      pre-intentional motivational constructs (i.e., sedentary-derived risk perceptions [RP],&#xD;
      outcome expectancies [OE], self-efficacy [SE]) and intentions (GI) for reducing both&#xD;
      occupational and leisure-time sedentary behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedentary office-workers who had given little thought to how much they sit were targeted to&#xD;
      discriminate preintenders from intenders. Research has demonstrated the benefits of matching&#xD;
      self-help manuals and other motivational materials to a person's stage of readiness or change&#xD;
      (e.g., Graham, Prapavessis, &amp; Cameron, 2006; Pope, Pelletier, &amp; Guertin, 2017)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial with outcome variables being assessed immediately&#xD;
      post-intervention. If successful, participants in the Experimental Group (sedentary&#xD;
      intervention group) will report higher outcome expectancies (OE) regarding reducing sitting&#xD;
      time, higher risk perceptions (RP) regarding SB and diabetes risk, higher self-efficacy (SE)&#xD;
      to reduce both occupational and leisure-time SB, and greater intentions (GI) to reduce both&#xD;
      occupational and leisure-time SB at post-intervention, compared to participants in either the&#xD;
      Attention-control Group or Control Group. In addition, it is hypothesized that participants&#xD;
      in the Attention-control Group, those who received information about the benefits of physical&#xD;
      activity, will also show slightly greater scores on pre-intentional motivational factors&#xD;
      (i.e., OE, RP, and SE) and behavioural intentions (GI) those those in the Control Group based&#xD;
      on the reminder that moderate-vigorous physical activity is important (which implies that&#xD;
      sitting should be minimized). Participants in the Control Group are not expected to report&#xD;
      any changes in sitting-related motivational factors post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with outcome variables being assessed&#xD;
      immediately post-intervention. Participants will be full-time adult, office workers primarily&#xD;
      recruited from large businesses and office spaces. Potential participants (estimated&#xD;
      enrollment: 252) will be recruited by Andrew Rollo, Co-Investigator, and Harry Prapavessis,&#xD;
      Principal Investigator, for this study. Relevant contacts (i.e., Head of Human Resources,&#xD;
      President, Chief Executive Officer, Office Manager) at potential businesses of interest will&#xD;
      be contacted via email. The email will include the letter of information (LOI) and&#xD;
      recruitment poster. If the individual accepts the invitation to participate and informs the&#xD;
      researchers that he/she is willing to facilitate and aid with the recruitment process, a&#xD;
      face-to-face meeting will be arranged. During this meeting, full and complete study details&#xD;
      (i.e., purpose, design, methods and procedure) will be made clear to the ONE individual&#xD;
      (i.e., Head of Human Resources, President, CEO, Office Manager). The individual will then be&#xD;
      asked to email all full-time employees in the respective office/business and offer them the&#xD;
      opportunity to participate. In this recruitment email, brief study details, a recruitment&#xD;
      poster and a link to an online survey (i.e., including the Letter of Information, Informed&#xD;
      Consent, and online questionnaire) using the SurveyMonkey website will be provided to all&#xD;
      employees. Adult office-workers who choose to take part in this study will be asked to&#xD;
      complete an online questionnaire using SurveyMonkey. Participants will be assured that&#xD;
      participation in this study is voluntary, that they are free to discontinue and withdraw from&#xD;
      the study at any time, and that they may choose to skip any questions that they do not wish&#xD;
      to answer without any effect on their employment status/work conditions. In other words,&#xD;
      refusing to participate, refusing to answer any questions or withdrawing from the study will&#xD;
      not impact their employment beyond potentially not receiving benefits associated with study&#xD;
      participation. After viewing the Letter of Information and indicating that they consent to&#xD;
      participate in the study (by clicking &quot;I agree&quot; on the survey), participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a brief demographics questionnaire. All participants will then be randomized to one&#xD;
      of three groups: Control (outcome questionnaire without any slides), Attention-Control (same&#xD;
      outcome questionnaire but with slides focusing on benefits of moderate-vigorous physical&#xD;
      activity), or Experimental (same outcome questionnaire but with slides focusing on sedentary&#xD;
      behaviour and diabetes risk). Depending on group assignment, participation should take&#xD;
      between 30 minutes and 45 minutes total. In the attention-control and experimental condition,&#xD;
      participants will receive information in the form of a slide show that will be viewed online.&#xD;
      The intervention aims to address all components of the Health Action Process Approach. For&#xD;
      the experimental group, the intervention material will target risk perceptions (RP) related&#xD;
      to sitting by presenting evidence supported by research on sedentary behaviour and diabetes&#xD;
      risk; outcome expectancies (OE) by presenting research on the effectiveness of breaking up&#xD;
      sedentary time for improving blood sugar and insulin levels; and self-efficacy (SE) by&#xD;
      providing strategies on how to reduce and break up sitting time. The attention-control slide&#xD;
      show will take the same approach but the slides will be geared towards meeting&#xD;
      moderate-vigorous physical activity guidelines. Participants randomly assigned to the control&#xD;
      group will receive no information or intervention of any kind and will only be asked to&#xD;
      complete the outcome questionnaire. Regardless of group assignment, all participants will&#xD;
      complete the same measures post-intervention (i.e., questionnaire measuring sedentary-related&#xD;
      pre-intentional motivational constructs [RP, OE, SE] and intentions [GI]). However,&#xD;
      participants in the attention-control and experimental group will FIRST receive information&#xD;
      in the form of a slide show that will be delivered online. The first question assesses&#xD;
      outcome expectancies (OE) with respect to reducing daily sitting time; the second question&#xD;
      assesses risk perceptions (RP) related to sitting time and diabetes risk; questions 3-12&#xD;
      assess self-efficacy (SE) related to reducing sedentary behaviour; and questions 13-22 assess&#xD;
      intentions (GI) related to reducing sedentary behaviour. The post-intervention outcome&#xD;
      questionnaire will be administered online via SurveyMonkey immediately following intervention&#xD;
      delivery (with the exception of control group who will solely complete the questionnaire).&#xD;
      All responses are completely confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only participants who responded 'somewhat' or below in response to the baseline screening&#xD;
      question, which asked whether they had given any thought to how much time they spent sitting,&#xD;
      were used in the main analyses (n = 96) to test the major hypotheses generated for the&#xD;
      present study.&#xD;
