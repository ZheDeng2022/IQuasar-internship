  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 90 male and female patients with documented solid tumor malignancies of&#xD;
      epithelial origin that are locally advanced or metastatic, and either refractory to standard&#xD;
      therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available, will be entered into this Phase 1a/2a,&#xD;
      multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, cohort study of AVID100. Phase 2a will include&#xD;
      evaluation of patient with EGFR-overexpressing squamous histology non-small cell lung cancer,&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and triple negative breast cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On Day 1 of study, patients will receive study drug administered by 2-hour IV infusion.&#xD;
      AVID100 will be administered once every 3 weeks (Q3W) with administration on Day 1 of the&#xD;
      first week, followed by a 3-week recovery period. In Phase 2a AVID100 will be administered at&#xD;
      a dose of 220 mg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence of progressive disease at any point in the study will necessitate withdrawal of the&#xD;
      patient from further participation so that alternative management of their malignancy may be&#xD;
      considered. All patients will be followed to further evaluate safety as well as evidence of&#xD;
      the anti-tumor effects of AVID100 in these selected patient populations. If anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity is observed additional patients may be added to the planned Phase 2a patient&#xD;
      populations to further characterize these effects.&#xD;
