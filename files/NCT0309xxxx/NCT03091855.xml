      PLUG Dementia Trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened at Intermountain Medical Center and at Intermountain affiliated&#xD;
      anticoagulation clinics in the Salt Lake City region. Patients with atrial fibrillation that&#xD;
      undergo a standard of care, clinically approved, left atrial appendage closure will be&#xD;
      considered for study. All patients will be followed for 24 months, and will be assessed at&#xD;
      the 3-, 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-months post-left atrial appendage closure as well as other visits&#xD;
      deemed necessary for clinical care. All subjects will undergo protocol-specified laboratory&#xD;
      tests and will complete 6 standard, validated questionnaires at each follow-up visit, except&#xD;
      at the 3-month visit when only one questionnaire will be administered. A subset of patients&#xD;
      (n=20), will receive a cranial MRI at baseline and 24-month visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI PLUG Dementia Sub-Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above, 20 of the 60 subjects who are selected for participation in this&#xD;
      sub-study will receive a cranial MRI at baseline and at the 2-year (24 months) follow-up&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
