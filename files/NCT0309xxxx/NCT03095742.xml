      Microdialysis assessment of cerebral energy state during cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation in humans&#xD;
&#xD;
      In comatose patients resuscitated from out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), neurological&#xD;
      injuries remain the leading cause of death. The in-hospital mortality is reported at 30-50%,&#xD;
      and the total mortality, although improved substantially over the last decade, remain to be&#xD;
      significant, in most countries at up to 90%. The brain of a patient resuscitated after&#xD;
      cardiac arrest (CA) may have suffered ischemia and when spontaneous circulation is&#xD;
      re-established, the subsequent reperfusion may cause further damage. Brain ischemia and the&#xD;
      reperfusion injury lead to tissue degeneration and loss of neurological function, the extent&#xD;
      dependent on duration and density of the insult. Temperature control and Targeted Temperature&#xD;
      Management (TTM) targeting 33-36°C may mitigate this damage and is recommended in current&#xD;
      international guidelines. However, managing post cardiac arrest patients are much more&#xD;
      complicated than TTM alone, and blood pressure measurements and mechanical ventilation as&#xD;
      part of post resuscitation care is emphasized. An adequate blood pressure must be maintained&#xD;
      in the post-cardiac arrest patient. Episodes of hypotension can cause secondary injury, in&#xD;
      addition to any initial insult incurred during the arrest by the brain and other organs. Mean&#xD;
      arterial blood pressure (MAP) should be above 65 mmHg to reverse the acute shock state, and&#xD;
      may preferably 80 to 100 mmHg to optimize cerebral perfusion. When determining blood pressure&#xD;
      goals, clinicians must balance the metabolic needs of an ischemic brain with the potential&#xD;
      for overstressing a decompensated heart. Cerebral autoregulation is often impaired after&#xD;
      cardiac arrest, and brain perfusion declines when the MAP falls below 80 to 100 mmHg. Thus,&#xD;
      maintaining an adequate MAP helps to avoid further brain injury. However, blood pressure&#xD;
      goals have not been investigated in prospective clinical trials, and remain to be based on&#xD;
      observational data and extrapolation from experimental data. While experimental studies&#xD;
      suggest that high mean blood pressure targets are needed for maintaining cerebral blood flow,&#xD;
      registries on consecutive clinical cases undergoing post resuscitation care suggest that&#xD;
      lower blood pressure targets are used in clinical practice. But data RCT´s addressing&#xD;
      specific targets in post resuscitation care have not been performed. The current trial&#xD;
      addresses these strategies for neuroprotection in using design of two different target blood&#xD;
      pressure levels. Intervention: 1:1 randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Normal MAP&quot; (approximately 65 mmHg) vs. &quot;high MAP&quot; (approximately 75 mmHg) Markers measuring&#xD;
      global cerebral ischemia caused by cardiac arrest and consecutive resuscitation, and&#xD;
      reflecting the metabolic changes after successful resuscitation are urgently needed to enable&#xD;
      a more personalized resuscitation and post resuscitation care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is technically simple and feasible to place a microdialysis catheter in the jugular bulb&#xD;
      and monitor biochemical variables related to cerebral energy metabolism bedside. The LP ratio&#xD;
      obtained from microdialysis of cerebral venous blood may be a sensitive indicator of&#xD;
      impending cerebral damage and might play a critical role in detecting the early responses of&#xD;
      post resuscitation care. Aim of this study is to investigate the global cerebral metabolic&#xD;
      changes during CA and post-resuscitation care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The study aim to (I) investigate whether the LP ratio obtained by microdialysis (MD) of&#xD;
      the cerebral venous outflow reflects a derangement of global cerebral energy state during the&#xD;
      peri-cardiac arrest period and (II) investigate the correlation between LP ratio and&#xD;
      neurological outcome among patients with cardiac arrest and (III) investigate the correlation&#xD;
      between LP ratio and the randomized blood pressure targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Single center randomized trial with allocation of 60 comatose out-of-hospital cardiac&#xD;
      arrest patients undergoing TTM, to normal or high blood pressure target during ICU stay.&#xD;
      Secondary a descriptive prospective cohorte study, measuring LP ratio obtained by&#xD;
      microdialysis (MD) of the cerebral venous outflow, during the peri-cardiac arrest period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Analysis will compare the two target blood pressure groups with respect to&#xD;
      LP ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) when discharged from hospital, time&#xD;
      to death, daily cumulated vasopressor requirement during ICU stay and need for combination of&#xD;
      vasopressors and inotropic agents or mechanical circulatory support. All end-points are&#xD;
      correlated to the randomized blood pressure groups. A stratified analysis by the following&#xD;
      pre-defined design variables will also be performed: sex, age above median, median time to&#xD;
      ROSC, known hypertension, known COPD, shockable primary rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Interventions are considered emergency procedures and study blood pressure&#xD;
      measurement using the study blood pressure modules should be commenced as soon as possible&#xD;
      after sustained ROSC, screening and randomisation. Study target blood pressure will be&#xD;
      blinded. Patients will be mechanically ventilated, sedated (propofol/fentanyl) and when&#xD;
      necessary paralysed with neuromuscular blocking agents to reduce shivering and subsequent&#xD;
      heat-generation and energy consumption. The core body temperature will be set as quickly as&#xD;
      possible at the predefined target temperature, according to intervention allocation, with 4°C&#xD;
      intravenous solutions, and commercially available cooling devices at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician. The target core temperature is then maintained for 24 h. After the&#xD;
      maintenance period core temperature is gradually raised to normothermia of 37°C with a&#xD;
      rewarming rate of no more than 0.5°C/hour. Body temperature is then maintained at&#xD;
      normothermia 37 ±0.5°C for as long the as patient is comatose until 72 hours from sustained&#xD;
      ROSC in treatment groups, using pharmacological treatment and temperature management systems&#xD;
      when applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is targeting low-normal paO2 of 9.5 kPa during TTM and when mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      is needed. The target PaO2 is reached by adjusting FiO2 and PEEP on the ventilator as long as&#xD;
      the patient in on controlled ventilation. Patients ventilation is adjusted, targeting&#xD;
      normocapnia of paCO2 of 4,5 - 6,0 in all patients. Serial arterial blood gas analyses will be&#xD;
      performed open label using the commercially available equipment adjusted to 37 °C&#xD;
      (alpha-stat).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MD catheter (CMA 67, MDialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden) is placed in a retrograde direction&#xD;
      into the jugular bulb. A second identical MD catheter is inserted into one brachial artery.&#xD;
      Both catheters are inserted through a peripheral intravenous 17 GA cannula using ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance. The positioning of the catheter in the jugular bulb above the inlet of the common&#xD;
      facial vein is verified on lateral neck radiograph according to accepted principles. MD&#xD;
      catheters are perfused by MD pumps (CMA 106, MDialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden) at 0.3 μL/min.&#xD;
      The perfusates are collected in microvials and analyzed every one hour for 72 hours by&#xD;
      enzymatic photometric techniques and displayed bedside (Iscus, Mdialysis AB, Stockholm,&#xD;
      Sweden). The analyses include the variables routinely monitored during intracerebral&#xD;
      microdialysis: glucose, pyruvate, lactate, glutamate and glycerol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurological status, according to the CPC-scale, and survival are evaluated every day in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit and/or at day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and at hospital (including local&#xD;
      hospital) discharge, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Danish Regional Committee on Health and Research Ethics approved the study. Trial&#xD;
      registration: S-20150173 HLP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives The prognosis of patients who are admitted in a comatose state following&#xD;
      successful resuscitation after cardiac arrest remains uncertain. Although the introduction of&#xD;
      therapeutic hypothermia (TH), targeted temperature management (TTM) and improvements in&#xD;
      post-resuscitation care have significantly increased the number of patients who are&#xD;
      discharged home with minimal brain damage, short-term assessment of neurological outcome&#xD;
      remains a challenge. The need for early and accurate prognostic predictors is crucial,&#xD;
      especially since sedation and TH/TTM may alter the neurological examination and delay the&#xD;
      recovery of motor response for several days. The development of additional tools, including&#xD;
      electrophysiological examinations (electroencephalography and somatosensory evoked&#xD;
      potentials), neuroimaging and chemical biomarkers, may help to evaluate the extent of brain&#xD;
      injury in these patients. Accurate prognostication of comatose patients treated with TH/TTM&#xD;
      can be obtained only 72 to 96 hours after CA and requires a multimodal approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Markers measuring cerebral ischemia caused by cardiac arrest and consecutive resuscitation,&#xD;
      and reflecting the metabolic changes after successful resuscitation are urgently needed to&#xD;
      enable a more personalized resuscitation and post resuscitation care. The LP ratio obtained&#xD;
      from microdialysis of cerebral venous blood may play a critical role in detecting the early&#xD;
      responses of post resuscitation care, and may predict in hospital and long term prognosis in&#xD;
      patients affected by brain injury after CA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the peri-cardiac arrest period the LP ratio obtained by microdialysis of the cerebral&#xD;
      venous outflow may reflects a derangement of global cerebral energy state. The LP ratio&#xD;
      obtained from microdialysis of cerebral venous blood in humans may be a sensitive indicator&#xD;
      of impending cerebral damage among patients with cardiac arrest. Further, the study&#xD;
      investigates the correlation between LP ratio and the randomized blood pressure targets. In&#xD;
      the future this might optimize and individualize the management of post cardiac arrest&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appendix:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-defined methodological substudy conducted prior to the MICA-RCT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-center prospective feasibility study explores the possibilities to use&#xD;
      microdialysis (MD) for continuous monitoring of cerebral energy metabolism by analyzing the&#xD;
      draining cerebral venous blood. Eighteen comatose patients (same inclusion criteria as&#xD;
      MICA-study but without the MAP intervention) )will be continuously monitored with jugular&#xD;
      bulb and radial artery (reference) MD following resuscitation. This feasibility study was&#xD;
      designed to investigate whether bedside JBM reflects secondary brain injury after OHCA, and&#xD;
      may be implemented as a clinical tool with implications for early prognosis and&#xD;
      individualized treatment improving patient outcome. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis&#xD;
      whether the lactate/pyruvate (LP) ratio monitored in the cerebral venous outflow reflected&#xD;
      brain energy metabolism after cardiac arrest and hence was different from the LP ratio&#xD;
      monitored in arterial blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective was to compare time-averaged means of microdialysis parameters&#xD;
      (intervals of 12 hours) of the jugular venous and the arterial blood during&#xD;
      post-resuscitation care. Secondary objectives of clinical interest were to compare (i)&#xD;
      neuro-metabolic patterns between patients with unfavorable and favorable neurological outcome&#xD;
      (ii) total duration of cerebral desaturation and clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and discomforts: Few. The retrograde MD catheter is inserted under ultrasound guidance&#xD;
      and is associated with a small (&lt;2%) risk of localized bleed which can be managed by manual&#xD;
      compression. Accidental arterial puncture occurs and is managed by manual compression.&#xD;
      Strokes and air emboli are extremely rare and symptoms are usually transient. The blood drawn&#xD;
      for blood gas analyses is not associated with increased risk, the volume needed is&#xD;
      approximately 50 ml total and thus not associated with increased risks.&#xD;
