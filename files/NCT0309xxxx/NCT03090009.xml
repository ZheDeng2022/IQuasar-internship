    <textblock>
      Dental implants are often used to replace missing teeth. In fact, in the US over 700,000&#xD;
      implants are places every year and over 2 million implants are places world wide.&#xD;
      Peri-implant mucositis in an inflammatory condition affecting dental implants and is&#xD;
      recognized as a risk factor for peri-implantitis (a condition affecting the bone around&#xD;
      implants and eventually leading to implant loss). The prevalence of Peri-implant Mucositis&#xD;
      has been reported in the literature to range from 50-90% whereas the prevalence of&#xD;
      Peri-implantitis has been reported as high as 20%. it is commonly believed that a dysbiotic&#xD;
      microbiome is the primary cause for these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inflammatory burden around diseased implants creates a high-protein environment which is&#xD;
      necessary for the survival of pathogenic bacteria. It is logical, therefore, that reducing&#xD;
      inflammation by Non Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) may create a shift in the&#xD;
      dysbiotic microbiome to a symbiotic microbiome. The aim of the current study is to test the&#xD;
      effects of oral NSAIDs on the peri-implant microbiome.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Inflammation around dental implants has been defined as Peri-implant mucositis and&#xD;
      Peri-implantitis . Peri-implant mucositis is a localized inflammation limited to the mucosal&#xD;
      tissue surrounding the implant whereas peri-implantitis has advanced to the bone surrounding&#xD;
      the implant as well. The prevalence of Peri-implant Mucositis has been reported in the&#xD;
      literature to range from 50-90% whereas the prevalence of Peri-implantitis has been reported&#xD;
      as high as 20%. Due to the fact that there are many similarities in the clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of infection in the gingiva and peri-implant mucosal tissue, studies attempted&#xD;
      to compare the microbial characteristics around teeth to that found around implants. Emerging&#xD;
      data suggests that the microbiome around infected teeth has some similarities and&#xD;
      dissimilarities to peri-implant infection. Such differences may stem from different&#xD;
      inflammatory characteristics as well as the presence of a non-vital foreign material (the&#xD;
      dental implant) in the area. Some of the known pathogenic strains identified in the&#xD;
      peri-implant sulcus are anaerobic a-saccharolytic bacteria, which feed off the adjacent&#xD;
      tissue inflammatory exudate. Logically, attenuation of the inflammation would deprive the&#xD;
      nearby bacteria of nourishment needed to sustain their growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) to control chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      disease has been used extensively in medicine. Its action of blocking cyclooxygenase&#xD;
      inflammatory pathway and in-effect blocking the production of Prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) has led&#xD;
      to its use with general pain control as well as its long term use in the treatment of tissue&#xD;
      inflammation and pain caused by rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, tendinitis and&#xD;
      bursitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Offenbacher et al. as early as in 1981 discovered that patients with periodontitis had&#xD;
      significantly higher levels of PGE2 in the sulcular fluid between gingiva and the tooth (GCF)&#xD;
      . In a follow up study over a period of 18-36 months, Offenbacher observed that patients who&#xD;
      had exhibited periodontal attachment loss had significantly higher levels of PGE2. This led&#xD;
      Williams et al. to study the effects of Flurbiprofen, a phenylalkanoic derivative family of&#xD;
      of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, on naturally occurring periodontal disease in an&#xD;
      animal model over a period of 12 months. The study demonstrated decreases in alveolar bone&#xD;
      loss in flurprofen treated animals at 3, 6 , 9 and 12 months. William et al then followed&#xD;
      with a clinical trial where 44 patients who self administered peroral flurbiprofen twice&#xD;
      daily for a period of 24 months. The study reported severely depressed bone loss rates over&#xD;
      the period of the trial and as early as 6 months after administration of flurbiprofen that&#xD;
      continued over the length of the trial. Other studied the drugs effect on other more&#xD;
      aggressive forms of the disease with similar results . These results have been duplicated&#xD;
      around implants as well. Jeffcoat et al demonstrated that oral intake flurbiprofen helped&#xD;
      reduce bone loss around implants in the first year of service. Reddy similarly demonstrated&#xD;
      with use of digital subtraction radiography, flurbiprofen taken orally was able to help&#xD;
      increase bone density and apposition around implants after just 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The positive effect of systemic antibiotics and as well topical anti microbials on the&#xD;
      pathogenic bacteria in the gingiva sulcus and peri-implant crevice has been well documented&#xD;
      and is indisputable. The removal of these bacteria has helped promote tissue health. Similar&#xD;
      results have been documented around implants as well. However more recently the reverse&#xD;
      approach to disease control has gained popularity. Instead of trying just to reduce the&#xD;
      bacterial challenge through antimicrobial/antibiotic therapy, modulating the host response to&#xD;
      decrease the inflammatory destruction of the tissue, could be a more efficient and effective&#xD;
      way of controlling the disease In decreasing the inflammatory environment, the pathogenic&#xD;
      bacteria feeding off the inflammatory exudate would be greatly decreased, effecting a major&#xD;
      change in the microbiome. To date nobody has characterized this change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to test the effects of oral NSAIDS on the peri-implant&#xD;
      microbiome. Also, clinical parameters will be tested for correlation with the microbial&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is random controlled double blind clinical trial. Patients visiting the&#xD;
      graduate periodontal clinic at the Hadassah Medical Center will be examined for eligibility&#xD;
      for the study. Implants with peri-implant mucositis (clinical signs of inflammation without&#xD;
      radiographically bone loss) will be included. Patients (n=50) will undergo clinical&#xD;
      examination (which will include probing depths, presence or absence of suppuration and&#xD;
      bleeding on probing) and sampling of the subgingival bacterial deposits using a perio-strip.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to the experimental flurbiprofen group (100 mg bid) or&#xD;
      placebo group (n=25 for each group). Drug consumption will be set for the duration of 2&#xD;
      weeks. At the end of drug intake period (day 14) and two weeks afterwards (day 28) all&#xD;
      subjects will be re-examined, which will include a new clinical exam and sampling of the&#xD;
      subgingival bacterial deposits. The microbiological samples will be analyzed using 16s&#xD;
      Ribosomal Pyro-sequencing. The microbiome profile of the Flurbiprofen group before and after&#xD;
      treatment and two weeks post-treatment will be compared. as well as the microbiome from the&#xD;
      placebo group compared with the Flurbiprofen group. Statistical differences will be evaluated&#xD;
      using ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. Correlation between the clinical parameters and&#xD;
      microbiological parameters will be tested using Pearson correlation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study asks the question whether the use of a well-known NSAID that had proven beneficial&#xD;
      effects in maintaining the mucosal tissue integrity around implants and help control and&#xD;
      prevent peri-implant inflammation. Studies have shown that implants placed 5 years previously&#xD;
      will most likely have some form of peri-implant mucositis . Just as gingivitis can lead to&#xD;
      periodontal disease, Peri-implant mucositis can lead to peri-implantitis a more destructive&#xD;
      inflammatory disease that puts implant survival in jeopardy. Therefore, a drug that can limit&#xD;
      the amount of destructive bacteria around the implant can be a very effective non-invasive&#xD;
      method of treatment. Additionally with the use of a more comprehensive taxonomical&#xD;
      identification of the peri-implant micro-genome, there will be a better understanding of the&#xD;
      bacterial role in the destructive process associated with peri-implant inflammation&#xD;
