      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the efficacy of the standard dose of Thymoglobuline® induction therapy for&#xD;
      preventing acute rejection (AR) after transplantation among recipients of Donated after&#xD;
      Cardiac Death (DCD) kidney transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate delayed graft function (DGF), graft and patient survival after kidney&#xD;
           transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate adverse events of Thymoglobuline® throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore possible risk factors of AR and DGF in patients with DCD kidney transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate AR and DGF under different risk stratifications and explore an description&#xD;
           optimal induction therapy regimen for recipients of DCD kidney transplant.&#xD;
