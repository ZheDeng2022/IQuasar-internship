  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chikungunya fever is an acute viral disease, transmitted by the mosquito (Aedes aegypti),&#xD;
      that triggers pain and disabling rheumatic manifestations. There is no cure for this disease,&#xD;
      and the usual treatment is directed at relieving symptoms through the use of analgesics and&#xD;
      antipyretics. Due to the risk of adverse effects triggered by prolonged use of analgesic and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs, the use of complementary therapies, such as Auriculotherapy, might&#xD;
      be a safe and effective non-pharmacological treatment for the management of Chikungunya&#xD;
      symptomatic cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects diagnosed with Chikungunya and undergoing routine treatment will receive&#xD;
      auricotherapy treatment once a week, for five weeks. Subjects will be assessed at baseline&#xD;
      and after 4 and 8 weeks after intervention. This study might help understand the use of&#xD;
      Auriculotherapy as a complementary treatment in the treatment of physical and functional&#xD;
      symptoms of individuals infected by Chikungunya .&#xD;

      Objectives of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of Auriculotherapy in the management of pain and&#xD;
           functional capacity of symptomatic individuals after Chikungunya fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effects of Auriculotherapy on the intensity of pain, limitation of&#xD;
           mobility, and perception of disability and physical capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate the effect of Auriculotherapy on pain medication use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place and study population: Subjects diagnosed with Chikungunya Fever will be recruited for&#xD;
      convenience in the basic care of the city of Fortaleza-CE, Brazil, in order to be evaluated&#xD;
      and treated by the researcher's team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures and intervention: Subjects will be evaluated at the initial time of the research,&#xD;
      and after 4 and 8 weeks of intervention. The description of the procedures will follow the&#xD;
      guidelines of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and the Standards for&#xD;
      Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA). Asepsis of the ear&#xD;
      with alcohol 70%is necessary to apply 4 to 5 auricular acupuncture points. In the&#xD;
      intervention group, specific points will be used to the management of pain and physical&#xD;
      function. In the placebo group, non-specific points will be used. Patients will be instructed&#xD;
      to exert finger pressure at each point for 3 minutes. At least 3x / day, or whenever they&#xD;
      feel pain. These implants will be kept for 5 days and will be taken off by the participant 2&#xD;
      days before the next appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects: The research will begin after approval by the Ethics and Research Committee&#xD;
      (CEP) of the Federal University of Ceará. All participants will sign the Informed Consent and&#xD;
      are free to withdraw from the study.&#xD;
