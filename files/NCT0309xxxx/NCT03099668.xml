    <textblock>
      A randomised study of multidisciplinary care (MDT) versus routine care in patients with&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients with RA are randomised either to a single visit to a &quot;one&#xD;
      Stop Arthritis Clinic' (OSAC) or to see their usual rheumatologists. Data are collected at&#xD;
      the baseline visit, and again at subsequent clinic visits (approximately 3 and 6 months).&#xD;
      Outcomes such as quality of life, disease activity, physical function, disease specific&#xD;
      knowledge, coping and self efficacy are evaluated. Assessment of comorbidities and&#xD;
      preventative care (cancer screening, vaccinations, cardiovascular risk assessment and&#xD;
      optimisation) are also assessed between the 2 arms.&#xD;

      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Holistic review by a multidisciplinary team leads to improved outcomes such as improved&#xD;
           disease activity, physical function and quality of life (QOL) in patients with&#xD;
           rheumatoid arthritis (RA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. These improved outcomes are likely mediated via improvements in medication adherence,&#xD;
           coping, disease specific knowledge and improved self-efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A &quot;One Stop Arthritis Clinic&quot; (OSAC) where patients are seen by a multidisciplinary team&#xD;
           co-located in time and space, is an effective solution to delivering multidisciplinary&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims Primary: To determine whether a multidisciplinary review, as compared to&#xD;
      routine review by the treating rheumatologist, leads to improved QOL as measured by the&#xD;
      European Quality of Life-5 Dimension 3 Level (EQ-5D) index at 6 months in patients with RA&#xD;
      with deemed stable disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the effect of the multidisciplinary review, as compared to routine&#xD;
           rheumatologist review on RA disease activity (measured using the disease activity score&#xD;
           in 28 joints, DAS28), pain (measured using a 100mm visual analogue scale (VAS), and&#xD;
           physical function (measured using the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire, mHAQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the effect of the multidisciplinary review, as compared to routine&#xD;
           rheumatologist review on several secondary measures including self-efficacy (as measured&#xD;
           using the Rheumatoid Arthritis Self Efficacy, RASE), Disease Specific Knowledge (DSK)&#xD;
           using a Patient Knowledge Questionnaire (PKC), coping, medication adherence (using the&#xD;
           Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS) questionnaire, pill counts and adherence&#xD;
           proportion percentage) and Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the effect of the multidisciplinary review, as compared to routine&#xD;
           rheumatologist review on patient experience&#xD;
&#xD;
           Background and Significance Burden of disease: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic&#xD;
           disease affecting approximately 0.5 -0.7% of the population; and most common in&#xD;
           working-age adults. Inadequately treated RA is a leading cause of disability, work loss&#xD;
           and productivity loss due to irreversible joint damage in this relatively young group of&#xD;
           the population, in the prime of their productive work-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
           &quot;Treat to Target&quot; (T2T) approach: It has been clearly shown, that a T2T approach, in&#xD;
           which therapy is escalated at regular intervals according to a pre-determined protocol&#xD;
           and driven by consistent measurement of disease activity, is superior to routine care in&#xD;
           achieving remission, and T2T is now standard of care. A validated, clinically sensitive&#xD;
           composite disease activity measure, the DAS28 is routinely used to measure disease&#xD;
           activity, and is a good predictor of disability. DAS28 values of &lt;2.6 are defined as&#xD;
           remission. About 50% of patients with early RA treated at the NUH rheumatology clinic&#xD;
           achieve remission at 6 months (unpublished data, from the Singapore Early Arthritis&#xD;
           Cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Multidisciplinary care: The multidisciplinary team (MDT) concept is increasingly gaining&#xD;
           popularity and traction, and has been shown to improve outcomes in complex cancer care.&#xD;
           Several rheumatology societies and quality standards recommend that patients with RA&#xD;
           should have access to a multidisciplinary team consisting, at the minimum, of a&#xD;
           specialist nurse, physiotherapist (PT), occupational therapist (OT) and podiatrist. This&#xD;
           is based on the results of several randomized controlled trials showing the benefit of&#xD;
           occupational therapy on grip strength, and physiotherapy on physical function and&#xD;
           cardiovascular fitness in RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The multidisciplinary &quot;One Stop Arthritis Clinic&quot; (OSAC) at the National University&#xD;
           Hospital (NUH), Singapore. An OSAC was set up in the specialist outpatient clinic (SOC)&#xD;
           at the National University Hospital (NUH) in January 2016 with the aim of providing&#xD;
           point of care access to MDT care. Prior to the OSAC, MDT care for RA patients was&#xD;
           sporadic, if at all. Most patients were treated solely by the physician&#xD;
           (rheumatologist), with referral to members of the MDT on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis, and with&#xD;
           appointments made on a different day, at a different location. Many patients declined&#xD;
           the appointment due to the inconvenience of a separate visit and because they often&#xD;
           perceived it as unnecessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The OSAC team currently consists of 6 members, namely a rheumatologist, specialist&#xD;
           nurse, PT, OT, podiatrist and medical social worker. Existing RA patients on follow up&#xD;
           in NUH may be referred, on the discretion of their rheumatologist, to the OSAC.&#xD;
           Consenting patients are seen at the OSAC at the next review, in lieu of their routine&#xD;
           rheumatologist review. Preliminary patient surveys have reported excellent patient&#xD;
           experience. As previously reported, and as per our experience, early success has come&#xD;
           from careful planning of the logistics and organization of the clinic, along with full&#xD;
           and equal participation of all stake-holders who share the same egalitarian values, thus&#xD;
           avoiding conflict.&#xD;
&#xD;
           However, there have been some barriers to OSAC referral, namely:&#xD;
&#xD;
           (i) Cost: As outpatient specialist consultation in Singapore is typically paid out of&#xD;
           pocket, with varying amount of government subsidization, patients pay anywhere from&#xD;
           twice to 3 times the consultation fee to attend the OSAC as compared to a routine&#xD;
           rheumatologist review. Therefore, cost to the patient plays a major role in health care&#xD;
           decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (ii) Poor uptake on the part of the patients: A survey among our patients revealed that&#xD;
           they have poor general awareness of allied health services. This is possibly because&#xD;
           Asian cultures traditionally tend to adopt a doctor-centred care delivery, especially&#xD;
           older patients who have experienced doctor-led consultations through most of their&#xD;
           lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Gaps in knowledge:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Although the individual benefits of OT and PT interventions have been clearly shown,&#xD;
           these have been mostly limited to intensive regimens involving multiple sessions with&#xD;
           close supervision.17-20 The recommended &quot;annual MDT review&quot; has never been shown in a&#xD;
           controlled trial to improve outcomes. The recommendation for annual MDT review is based&#xD;
           mainly on observational studies and expert opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. Most trials of OT and PT were performed prior to the treat to target (T2T) era. It&#xD;
           remains to be seen, whether with current effective treatments, an MDT review can further&#xD;
           confer an additive benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our study aims to fill some of these gaps by randomly assigning patients to either the&#xD;
           OSAC or to routine rheumatologist care, and comprehensively studying outcomes in both&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Single centre, randomised, single-blind, controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be recruited from the rheumatology outpatient clinic at NUH, and informed&#xD;
           consent will be taken for patients who are agreeable to participate. Consented patients&#xD;
           will be randomised via a random number sequence generated by the Stata® statistical&#xD;
           software and placed in sealed envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study visits will be at 0, 3 and 6 months, timed to coincide with routine&#xD;
           rheumatology clinic visits. The baseline visit will be approximately 3 months after the&#xD;
           randomisation visit. Patients randomised to the intervention arm will be seen in the&#xD;
           OSAC once, followed by visits to the routine rheumatology clinic at month 3 and 6.&#xD;
           Patients in the control arm will be seen at the routine rheumatology clinic on all&#xD;
           visits (0, 3 and 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection and follow-up: Patients will be followed for 6 months from the baseline&#xD;
           visit (approximately 9 months from randomisation). Data will be collected by&#xD;
           self-administered questionnaires and face to face interviews administered by a trained&#xD;
           research nurse to both the intervention and control arms and blood will be drawn for&#xD;
           potential future research from all participants at the baseline visit. Data on&#xD;
           demographics, disease severity (seropositivity, presence of erosions) and disease&#xD;
           activity using the DAS28 will be collected using a standard case report form (CRF) at&#xD;
           baseline and at 6 months. Joint counts will be performed by either ML, PC, AS or the&#xD;
           research nurse at the baseline visit. At the 3 month and 6-month visit, joint count will&#xD;
           be performed by an independent assessor (a second research nurse), who is blinded to the&#xD;
           study arm. A standardisation session will be conducted to improve inter-rater&#xD;
           reliability between the various joint count assessors prior to commencement of the&#xD;
           study. Physical function will be assessed according to the mHAQ and HR-QOL will be&#xD;
           measured using the EQ-5D instrument at baseline and at 6 months. Pain score,&#xD;
           self-efficacy, coping, adherence and disease specific knowledge will be measured at&#xD;
           baseline, 3 months and 6 months using the VAS for pain, RASE, coping, MARS and Hennel&#xD;
           patient knowledge questionnaires (PKC) respectively and foot pain will be measured using&#xD;
           the Manchester Foot Disability Index (MFI). In addition, data on comorbidities, exercise&#xD;
           frequency, smoking, alcohol, traditional medication use, vaccination status and&#xD;
           adherence to recommended cancer screening will be collected. Laboratory tests and&#xD;
           imaging will be done as part of the routine clinical care of patients with RA and&#xD;
           relevant data will be abstracted from the electronic medical record. Treatment changes&#xD;
           at each visit will be recorded. Resource utilisation in the form of number of clinic&#xD;
           visits (including separate visits to see allied healthcare professionals), laboratory&#xD;
           tests, imaging, prescriptions and procedures will be abstracted from the hospital&#xD;
           billing database. Utilisation of the specialist nurse helpline will be recorded. Work&#xD;
           status and number of days off work for both the patient and the caregiver (if any) will&#xD;
           also be collected. Data on patient experience will be abstracted from the hospital&#xD;
           electronic patient experience survey, which will be administered to all patients at the&#xD;
           baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary outcome measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
           European Quality of Life-5 Dimension 3 Level (EQ-5D) index at 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Proportion of patients in clinical remission or low RA disease activity (measured&#xD;
           using the disease activity score in 28 joints, DAS28) (remission = DAS28 ≤ 2.6, low&#xD;
           disease activity = DAS28 &gt; 2.6 &amp; ≤ 3.2) ii. Pain (measured using a 100mm visual analogue&#xD;
           (VAS) scale iii. Physical function (measured using the modified Health Assessment&#xD;
           Questionnaire, mHAQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
           iv. Self-efficacy (measured using the Rheumatoid Arthritis Self Efficacy, RASE) v.&#xD;
           Disease Specific Knowledge (DSK) using a Patient Knowledge Questionnaire (PKC) vi.&#xD;
           Coping vii. Medication adherence (using the MARS questionnaire and pill count to&#xD;
           calculate medication adherence proportion percentage) viii. Patient experience (using&#xD;
           the standard hospital electronic patient experience survey, e-PES) ix. Foot pain (using&#xD;
           the Manchester foot disability index, MFI) x. Proportion of patients who achieve&#xD;
           adherence to guidelines for vaccination xi. Proportion of patients who achieve adherence&#xD;
           to guidelines for cardiovascular risk management xii. Proportion of patients who achieve&#xD;
           adherence to guidelines for bone health optimisation xiii. Proportion of patients who&#xD;
           achieve adherence to guidelines for cancer screening xiv. Utilisation of healthcare&#xD;
           resources (clinic visits, laboratory, imaging, procedures, prescriptions, calls to the&#xD;
           nurse helpline) xv. Days off work (patient) xvi. Days off work (caregiver) xvii. Hours&#xD;
           per week in productive paid or unpaid work (patient) xviii. Hours per week in productive&#xD;
           paid or unpaid work (caregiver)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size calculation and feasibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Using baseline values from patients seen at OSAC, the mean baseline EQ-5D index&#xD;
           (descriptive) is 0.722 with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.156. Allowing for an alpha&#xD;
           error of 5%, and 95% power to demonstrate a minimal clinically important improvement of&#xD;
           0.1 in the EQ-5D index, we would need a sample size of 128 for a 1:1 randomisation (64&#xD;
           in each arm). After allowing for a 10% dropout rate, we plan to recruit 140 patients (70&#xD;
           in each arm) to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Approximately 60 patients with RA are seen weekly at NUH. The OSAC runs once a week and&#xD;
           has a capacity of 6 patients per clinic session. If we can randomize 8 patients per week&#xD;
           (of which half would be randomized to the intervention arm, to be seen at OSAC), we&#xD;
           would be able to recruit an adequate number of subjects in about 18 weeks. The&#xD;
           consultation fee for the study participants' baseline visit (OSAC or routine&#xD;
           rheumatology review) would be paid for through the grant funding; thus providing an&#xD;
           incentive for patients to participate, and also overcoming the cost barrier for referral&#xD;
           to OSAC. Follow up for all patients would be completed about 9 months after the last&#xD;
           patient is recruited; thus the study can be completed in about 14 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical analysis: All analysis will be done using Stata® statistical software. The&#xD;
           mean EQ-5D index at 6 months of patients in the intervention and control groups will be&#xD;
           compared using the Student's t-test. Logistic regression will be used to calculate the&#xD;
           odds of achieving a minimal clinically important difference in QOL (as measured by a 0.1&#xD;
           increase in the EQ-5D index) between the intervention vs. the control group while&#xD;
           controlling for confounders such as age, gender, disease duration, disease severity&#xD;
           (seropositivity, presence of erosions at baseline), disease activity (DAS28) and mHAQ at&#xD;
           baseline. We will further determine whether self-efficacy, coping, adherence and DSK can&#xD;
           improve prediction of QOL when they are added to the regression model.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Strengths and limitations This is a randomized controlled study, thus controlling for&#xD;
           bias in terms of allocation of patients to MDT care. Disease activity outcomes are&#xD;
           blinded; as joint counts will be performed by a blinded assessor. The case report form&#xD;
           is designed to be comprehensive, such that all possible outcomes of importance will be&#xD;
           collected. Though cost-effectiveness is not one of the outcomes to be studied, the data&#xD;
           collected are adequate to do a cost -effectiveness analysis if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main limitation of the study is that the patients cannot be blinded to the&#xD;
           intervention (MDT care). This is inherent to the nature of the intervention. In&#xD;
           addition, outcome assessors cannot be blinded to several of the outcomes, as they are&#xD;
           determined from patient reported questionnaires; thus may be biased in favour of MDT&#xD;
           care. Radiographic outcomes in terms of joint space narrowing and erosions are not&#xD;
           collected as part of this study, as typically changes in these need time (≥ 1 year) and&#xD;
           are relatively insensitive to subtle interventions such as ours. However, increasingly&#xD;
           outcomes important to the patient are thought to be the most preferred outcomes to&#xD;
           study, and have been shown to be predictive of radiographic damage.&#xD;
