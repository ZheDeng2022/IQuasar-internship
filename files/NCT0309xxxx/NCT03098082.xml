  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis (PEP) is the most&#xD;
      common, serious complication of ERCP. More than 500,000 ERCP procedures are performed from&#xD;
      which 25,000 cases of PEP occur in the U.S.A. annually. PEP accounts for significant&#xD;
      morbidity and health care expenditures. While symptoms of PEP arise immediately after ERCP,&#xD;
      they are non-specific. Consequently, unnecessary admissions of outpatients without PEP and&#xD;
      inadvertent discharge of outpatients with PEP from ERCP recovery are common. An accurate,&#xD;
      confirmatory test for diagnosis of PEP immediately after ERCP is lacking. Actim Pancreatitis&#xD;
      (Medix Biochemica) is a urine trypsinogen-2 dipstick test (UTDT) that uses trypsinogen-2 as a&#xD;
      biomarker for acute pancreatitis. Urine Trypisinogen-2 Dipstick test (UTDT) is a simple,&#xD;
      inexpensive test with promising preliminary data for accuracy for immediate diagnosis of PEP.&#xD;
      Prior studies of ITDT test characteristics lack rigorous scientific design. Investigators&#xD;
      will enroll 1825 ERCP outpatients at our institution in a prospective cohort study. A&#xD;
      pre-ERCP UTDT test and diagnostic UTDT 2 hours after the ERCP will be performed. Patients&#xD;
      with a positive baseline UTDT will be followed clinically as part of this study without 2&#xD;
      hour testing. Care providers and study primary investigators will be blinded to the 2 hour&#xD;
      UTDT results. Baseline, intra-procedure and recovery room clinical data will be recorded.&#xD;
      Diagnosis of PEP will be made blinded to the UTDT result. Admission status for PEP will be&#xD;
      assessed by review of records and phone/e-mail contact 5 days and 30 days after ERCP&#xD;
      procedure. Sensitivity and specificity of 2 hour post ERCP UTDT for the diagnosis of PEP will&#xD;
      be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: 1) To determine the test characteristics of UTDT for the diagnosis of PEP 2 hours after&#xD;
      completion of ERCP. 2) To identify and describe patients with baseline UTDT positivity, in&#xD;
      whom this test offers limited utility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1.1 To determine the test characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) of the&#xD;
      UTDT for the diagnosis of PEP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. UTDT is a sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of PEP for patients undergoing&#xD;
           ERCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At a cutpoint for a negative test of &lt;50ug/L, UTDT will be accurate at 2 hours post ERCP&#xD;
           in patients whose baseline test is negative.&#xD;

      Proposed Study and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will enroll 1825 ERCP outpatients at our institution in a prospective cohort&#xD;
      study. A pre-ERCP UTDT test and diagnostic UTDT 2 hours after the ERCP will be performed.&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. UTDT is a sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of PEP for patients undergoing&#xD;
           ERCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At a cutpoint for a negative test of &lt;50ug/L, UTDT will be accurate at 2 hours post ERCP&#xD;
           in patients whose baseline test is negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary AIM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 To identify and describe patients with baseline UTDT positivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) A subgroup of patients will demonstrate baseline positivity for UTDT. Based on previous&#xD;
      studies, the subgroup is likely to include patients with chronic inflammatory or obstructive&#xD;
      conditions of the pancreatic duct (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, obstructive chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis)1 This subgroup will represent a minority (&lt;6%) of outpatients presenting for&#xD;
      ERCP. 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited in the pre-procedure area prior to ERCP. Only patients who would&#xD;
      be offered ERCP as part of their previously outlined care plan will be included in this&#xD;
      study. Patients will be screened according to inclusion/exclusion criteria described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent: Eligible patients will sign an IRB-approved, written informed consent to&#xD;
      verify their willingness to participate in this study. Informed consent will be obtained on&#xD;
      the day of their scheduled ERCP. Consent for the study will be obtained by one of the&#xD;
      participating endoscopists and/or a research assistant. Patients will receive a copy of the&#xD;
      signed and dated informed consent document. Original informed consent documents will be&#xD;
      maintained on-file. A note may be made in the subject's medical record regarding&#xD;
      participation in the research study. Once consented and enrolled into the trial, patients&#xD;
      will be issued a unique identifier for the purposes of data entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Procedure data and sample collection: After obtaining informed consent, patients will be&#xD;
      asked health questions prior to ERCP to assess and quantify current and prior alcohol use,&#xD;
      current and prior tobacco use, quantification of narcotic use and quantification of&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. Narcotic and NSAID use in the 7 days prior&#xD;
      to ERCP will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain scores will be collected at baseline and post ERCP. Subjects will be shown the study&#xD;
      pain scale (appendix 1) and asked to pick a number on the scale to rate their pain at&#xD;
      baseline and 2-3 hours (+ or - 15 minutes from time of Scope out) post ERCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on the indication of ERCP, history of acute pancreatitis, recurrent&#xD;
      acute pancreatitis, or chronic pancreatitis, history of pancreatic surgery, presence of&#xD;
      peri-pancreatic fluid collection and prior sphincterotomy. Prior imaging may be reviewed for&#xD;
      the presence of pancreatic mass and/or pancreatic duct obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline tests may be obtained prior to undergoing ERCP including serum pancreatic enzymes&#xD;
      (amylase, lipase), serum liver enzymes, and coagulation profile as is the standard for our&#xD;
      endoscopy unit. Available outpatient laboratory data within 48-72 hours of ERCP will be&#xD;
      reviewed. Lack of baseline labs will not be a criterion for exclusion from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with baseline, pre-procedure positivity for UTDT (&gt; or = 50ug/L) will undergo all&#xD;
      study procedures as outlined below with the exception of 2 hour UTDT level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are unable to provide a urine sample for post ERCP testing will still be&#xD;
      included in the final analysis of baseline UTDT level. Subjects who are excluded due to the&#xD;
      inability to access the ampulla at ERCP will also still be Included in the final analysis of&#xD;
      baseline UTDT level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-procedural Data Collection: Patients will undergo ERCP as intended. All clinical&#xD;
      decisions and endoscopic interventions prior to, during and after ERCP will be performed at&#xD;
      the discretion of the treating physician. Data on duration of procedure, placement of&#xD;
      pancreatic or biliary duct stents, ERCP maneuvers deployed for cannulation (e.g. needle&#xD;
      knife), findings associated with chronic pancreatitis (e.g pancreatic duct stones),&#xD;
      pancreatic duct leak, peri-procedural NSAIDs administration, amount of intraoperative IV&#xD;
      fluids and any immediate complications including perforation, bleeding, or hemodynamic&#xD;
      instability will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate Postoperative Care, Data and Sample collection: At our institution, patients&#xD;
      typically remain in the recovery area for 2-3 hours after completion of the ERCP. This time&#xD;
      interval in part is related to two-phase recovery after general anesthesia, which is the&#xD;
      standard sedation approach for ERCP outpatients. Patients will remain for recovery after ERCP&#xD;
      for at least two hours for a post procedure observation period and collection of UTDT result.&#xD;
      During this time, a urine sample for UTDT testing will be collected at 2 -3 hours (+ or - 15&#xD;
      minutes from time of Scope out) after ERCP by the study research technician. Patients, study&#xD;
      investigators, ERCP care team, nursing staff will be blinded to the results. The statistician&#xD;
      will be blinded to the urine trypsinogen-2 test during statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to admit/monitor the patient will be left to the discretion of the endoscopist /&#xD;
      ERCP care team and will occur blinded to the UTDT results. Data regarding symptoms (e.g.&#xD;
      nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain scores), narcotic administered for pain symptoms, duration in&#xD;
      recovery, volume of IV fluids administered in recovery and decision to admit or discharge&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a risk assessment for post-ERCP pancreatitis. This will calculated and&#xD;
      tracked for the purposes of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow Up Data Collection: Patients who are hospitalized will have serum amylase and lipase&#xD;
      drawn after the ERCP procedure per standard clinical protocol timelines. Patients who are&#xD;
      discharged to home/other after ERCP will be contacted by telephone and/or email 5 days (+ 4&#xD;
      days or - 2 days) and 30 days ( + or - 10 days) after the ERCP by a study team member to&#xD;
      determine whether PEP occurred and was managed outside of our institution. Patients will be&#xD;
      asked about ERCP procedure complications such as infection, bleeding, perforation and death.&#xD;
      This contact may be made by phone, email or text message. Subjects will be asked for their&#xD;
      preferred method of contact at study enrollment. Records confirming post ERCP pancreatitis&#xD;
      will be requested if the patient is admitted and/or initially managed at an outside&#xD;
      institution for PEP. Patients without hospitalization for symptoms attributable to post ERCP&#xD;
      pancreatitis will be classified as not having developed PEP. Records pertaining to any ERCP&#xD;
      procedure complications will also be requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEP will be defined by the primary ERCP team. The ERCP team will be blinded to the UTDT&#xD;
      result when determining PEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data regarding volume of IV fluids administered at 24, 48 hours of admission and&#xD;
      severity of pancreatitis (based on Cotton criteria, Modified Marshall Score and graded&#xD;
      presence of necrosis) will be assessed recorded for all patients admitted with PEP.&#xD;
