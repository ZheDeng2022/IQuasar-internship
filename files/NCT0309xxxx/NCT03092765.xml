    <time_frame>Screening; up to Week 64</time_frame>
    <description>The Child-Pugh classification is used to assess the prognosis of chronic liver disease. The score employs five clinical measures of liver disease. Each measure is scored from 1 to 3, with 3 indicating most severe derangement. The total score ranges from 5 to 15 and is a sum of the individual domain scores. A higher score indicates a worse prognosis.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; up to Week 64</time_frame>
    <description>The PBC-40 is measures quality of life. Participants are asked to respond to 40 questions, each of which is scored on a scale of 0 to 5 (where 0=not applicable; 1=least impact; 5=greatest impact), grouped into six domains (symptoms, itch, fatigue, cognition, social, and emotional). For each domain, scoring involves summing individual question response scores. A higher score indicates a poorer quality of life.</description>

    <description>Scores for fibrosis, bile duct loss, and chronic cholestasis are combined for staging: stage 1, total score of 0; stage 2, score 1 to 3; stage 3, score 4 to 6; and stage 4, score 7 to 9. Cholangitis activity and hepatitis activity are graded as CA0-3 and HA0-3, respectively. A higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>
