      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal anesthesia is considered the first choice for cesarean sections if there are no&#xD;
      absolute or relative contraindications. It is easy and has lower risks for mother and baby&#xD;
      for most of cases. Anesthetists, especially junior staff, prefer spinal anesthesia for&#xD;
      cesarean sections avoiding managing airway or inserting an endotracheal tube which is usually&#xD;
      difficult in full term pregnant woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotension that follows spinal anesthesia usually occur due to blockade of sympathetic&#xD;
      vasomotor activity that is accentuated by compression of the aorta and inferior vena cava by&#xD;
      the gravid uterus when the patient is in the supine position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It starts very soon after intrathecal injection of the local anesthetic and may extend till&#xD;
      the end of the block putting the anesthesia team in an explanatory situation. The&#xD;
      pathophysiology of spinal hypotension is mainly due to the sympathetic blockade predominating&#xD;
      pararsympathetic power to dilating blood vessels and subsequent blood pooling in the dilated&#xD;
      blood vessels (mainly venous side).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sudden bradycardia can occur from shift in cardiac autonomic balance toward the&#xD;
      parasympathetic system from activation of left ventricular mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors&#xD;
      Bezold Jarisch reflex (BJR) or from an increase in baroreflex activity.[1] Serotonin released&#xD;
      during low-volume states has been suggested as a possible trigger for the BJR.[2] Granisetron&#xD;
      is a 5-Hydoxy Tryptamine 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist that is very effective in preventing&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes mellitus is a widespread disease that increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases&#xD;
      and intraoperative mortalities. Diabetes is associated with increased risk of perioperative&#xD;
      hypotension due to autonomic neuron system dysfunction associated with micro and macro&#xD;
      complications of long standing hyperglycemia. The effect of preganglionic sympathetic fibers&#xD;
      and cardiac sympathetic innervation blockade occurring during spinal anesthesia on cardiac&#xD;
      autonomic neurons function are expected to be different in diabetic patients from that of&#xD;
      normal patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a large cohort of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, Ziegler et al. [3], using&#xD;
      predefined heart rate variability (HRV) tests and spectral analysis of the R-R intervals,&#xD;
      found that 25.3% of patients with type 1 diabetes and 34.3% of patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      had abnormal findings. Clinical symptoms of autonomic dysfunction may not appear until long&#xD;
      after diabetes onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, subclinical cardiac neuropathic dysfunction, manifested as changes in HRV, may be&#xD;
      detected within 1 year of diagnosis in type II diabetes and within 2 years of diagnosis in&#xD;
      type I diabetes .[4]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg and&#xD;
      bradycardia defined as heart rate less than 50 beat/minute are haemodynamic adverse effects&#xD;
      of spinal anesthesia in non-obstetric patients has been reported to be 33% and 13%&#xD;
      respectively.[5,6]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the effect of the antiemetic drug Granisetron (G Setron 1 mg in 1&#xD;
      ml ampule) in reducing the incidence of hypotension occurred with spinal anesthesia in type I&#xD;
      diabetic patients arranged for cesarean sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be randomized double blind where the anesthetists', data collectors and&#xD;
      patients will be blinded to the assigned groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After hospital ethics committee approval and written informed consents, 68 type I diabetic&#xD;
      patients scheduled for cesarean sections will participate in this study at Operation Theater&#xD;
      of Suez Canal University Hospitals. All participating patients will be randomly classified&#xD;
      into two equal groups, the (G) Granisetron group and the (P) Placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the incidence of Hypotension defined as SBP &lt; 90 mmHg occurred&#xD;
      with spinal anesthesia in type I diabetic patients arranged for caesarean sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 68 type I diabetic full term pregnant women enrolled for caesarean section&#xD;
      deliveries under spinal anesthesia will be included in this study. Approval of our&#xD;
      institutional medical committee and a written consent from patients will be obtained.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria will include diabetic (Type I) ladies aged above 21 years old arranged for&#xD;
      elective caesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Exclusion criteria will include any&#xD;
      contraindications for spinal anesthesia (like bleeding diathesis or regional infection at&#xD;
      site of neuroaxial block), known allergy to Granisetron or local anaesthetic (heavy&#xD;
      bupivacaine, Marcaine Spinal 0.5% Heavy, 5mg/ml, AstraZeneca ampule), chronic hypertension,&#xD;
      pregnancy induced hypertension, or congenital or rheumatic heart diseases, antepartum&#xD;
      haemorrhage, Fetal destress or gestational age &lt; 36 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be randomly classified in to two equal groups (34 patients in each): G&#xD;
      group will receive 1 mg Granisetron (G Setron, 1 mg/ml Egyptian Pharmaceutical Company)&#xD;
      intravenously diluted in 10 ml normal saline 10 minutes before spinal anesthesia, and P group&#xD;
      will receive 10 ml normal saline N.S as placebo considering the same timing and color of&#xD;
      solution. Randomization will be performed using a computer based random number generator and&#xD;
      sealed envelopes will not be opened till an informed consent is obtained. The study will be&#xD;
      double-blind as the anesthetists, data collectors and patients will not know the assignment&#xD;
      groups. The syringes of Granisetron and placebo will be prepared by an anesthetist who will&#xD;
      not be informed about the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be infused with 500 ml lactated ringer intravenously IV. Premedication with&#xD;
      30 ml of a 0.15 molar solution of sodium citrate will be given orally 15-30 minutes before&#xD;
      surgery in addition to Ranitidine ampule (Zantac) 50 mg diluted in 10 ml N.S given&#xD;
      intravenously slowly. Base line heart rate (HR) and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP)&#xD;
      readings will be measured just before spinal anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia will be performed&#xD;
      in the sitting position using 25-gauge spinal needle (B BRAUN Co.) in L3-L4 or L4-L5 lumbar&#xD;
      interspaces, 12.5 mg (2.5 ml volume) 0.5% hyperbaric Bupivcaine (Marcaine Spinal 0.5% Heavy,&#xD;
      5mg/ml, AstraZeneca ampule) will be injected intrathecally over 1 minute. After spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia, parturient will be placed on the operating table in the supine position with 15°&#xD;
      of left lateral tilt with supplemental oxygen through a face mask at 5 L per min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory level will be evaluated by testing for cold sensation, and motor block will be&#xD;
      assessed according to Bromage scale after 5 min. HR and mean arterial blood pressure will be&#xD;
      recorded every 3 min until the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure will be measured every 3 min Ephedrine 10 mg boluses will be used until&#xD;
      hypotension (Mean blood pressure above 65 mmHg) is controlled and then the predetermined&#xD;
      protocol will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance fluid of lactated Ringer's solution will be given at a rate of 10 ml/kg/h in both&#xD;
      groups during the surgical procedure. An additional rapid bolus infusion (100 ml) of lactated&#xD;
      Ringer's will be pushed at each episode of hypotension. 10 mg ephedrine will be administered&#xD;
      if MBP is less than 65 mmHg. A second dose of 10 mg ephedrine will be repeated if hypotension&#xD;
      persisted 5 min or recurred. Phenylephrine will be considered if persistent hypotension not&#xD;
      responding to ephedrine. If bradycardia occurred defined as HR lower than 60 beat per min 0.5&#xD;
      mg atropine will be considered unless it is associated with hypotension, if that ephedrine&#xD;
      will be the choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data of all patients (Age, Height, Weight, BMI, duration of procedure, duration&#xD;
      of diabetes, Glycosylated Hemoglubin, and parity) will be recorded. Incidence of hypotension&#xD;
      will be calculated and compared in both groups. Other useful information as incidence of&#xD;
      bradycardia (HR&lt; 50 beat/minute) and atropine, ephedrine, and phenylephrine administered&#xD;
      doses will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nausea and vomiting will be recorded using Verbal Descriptive Scale (VDS) [0 = no nausea, 1 =&#xD;
      mild nausea, 2 = moderate nausea, 3 = frequent vomiting and 4 = severe vomiting] [7]&#xD;
