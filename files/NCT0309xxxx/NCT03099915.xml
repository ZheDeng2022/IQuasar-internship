      Objective: Identify modifiable factors that may affect asthma control and the use of&#xD;
      emergency room to define customized interventions for the management of asthma prior to&#xD;
      emergency room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency department attendance is always a sign of poor balance or control of asthma. In&#xD;
      spite of a decrease in the number of deaths that has been halved in 20 years and&#xD;
      hospitalization due to asthmatic disease, the use of emergency center for this disease has&#xD;
      not decreased. We now know that the passage through emergencies and hospitalization for&#xD;
      aggravation of asthma is in itself a factor of mortality. Acting on the determinants of poor&#xD;
      balance or control of asthma is essential to further reduce the mortality and morbidity of&#xD;
      asthma.&#xD;

      There is two parts in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 - Qualitative study by individual interviews until data saturation (although about ten&#xD;
      patients should be enough to capture the concepts of interest) on the factors that induce an&#xD;
      imbalance of asthma (based on the GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) report whose criteria&#xD;
      are validated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interview guide will be written to systematically address all aspects related to asthma&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In agreement with the patient the interview will be recorded, and the verbatim will be&#xD;
      transcribed and coded using a software (Nvivo version 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of a questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      A questionnaire will be developed from:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analysis of patient verbatim&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  other data: GINA criteria, psychological criteria (psychological distress is assessed by&#xD;
           the 12-item general health questionnaire (GHQ-12) which is valid psychometric tools in&#xD;
           French) and social criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2-Observational cohort qualitative study. The questionnaire thus prepared will be placed&#xD;
      in the patient file upon admission. As soon as possible it will be filled by the patient&#xD;
      after improvement of his condition and collected by the doctor or nurse who took care of the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain sufficient power to demonstrate significant associations, and assuming that 15&#xD;
      variables are taken into account in a multivariate model and based on the recommendations of&#xD;
      10 subjects per variable, 150 patients are required.&#xD;
