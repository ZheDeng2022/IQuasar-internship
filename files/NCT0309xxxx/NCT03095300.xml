      Background High-flow nasal cannula (NHF) are a promising tool for administering oxygen to&#xD;
      critically ill patients with high respiratory demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prone positioning (PP) is a simple and cost-effective strategy that since 1980s has been used&#xD;
      in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure to treat oxygenation&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large randomized study detected a relevant survival benefit by prone positioning in&#xD;
      patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) undergoing&#xD;
      invasive mechanical ventilation and managed with the ARDS network PEEP-FiO2 table strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretically, PP may benefit spontaneous breathing patients too, but data concerning its&#xD;
      application in such context are limited to small case series and a retrospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed a pilot feasibility study to assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      prone positioning in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure patients noninvasively treated with&#xD;
      NHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Patients: 15 adult hypoxemic (PaO2/FiO2&lt;200 mmHg with respiratory rate greater than&#xD;
      25 breaths per minute) non-hypercapnic patients with acute respiratory failure. PaO2/FiO2&#xD;
      will be assessed while the patients is receiving 50 L/min of 50% oxygen via a standard face&#xD;
      mask for a 15-minute monitoring period at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Eligible patients will undergo NHF for 1 hour in the supine semi-recumbent position&#xD;
      (baseline, BL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, each enrolled patient will be placed in the prone position for 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 2-hour PP period, the patient will be rotated and will undergo 1 hour of NHF in the&#xD;
      semi recumbent supine position (Supine step).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements Patient's demographics will be collected at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the monitoring period, and then on a hourly basis the following data will be&#xD;
      collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory rate, SpO2, pH, PaCO2, PaO2, SaO2, PaO2/FiO2;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart Rate, arterial blood pressure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dyspnea, as defined by the VAS dyspnoea scale;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discomfort, as defined by a visual analogic scale (VAS) adapted to rate the procedural&#xD;
           pain of ICU patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End expiratory lung impedance (EELI), tidal volume distribution, global and regional&#xD;
           lung dynamic strain (Change in lung impedence due to tidal volume/ELLI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Work of breathing, assessed by pressure-time product (PTP) of the esophageal pressure&#xD;
           and inspiratory swings in this signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Occurrence of pendelluft phenomenon&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of adverse events will be also recorded for each study step.&#xD;

      Background Nasal high flow oxygen (NHF) is a new and promising tool for oxygen therapy in&#xD;
      critically ill patients: NHF allows accurate delivery of the set FiO2, anatomical dead space&#xD;
      clearance due to a washout effect in the upper airways and provides a small, variable amount&#xD;
      of positive end end-expiratory pressure. Different studies have investigated its safety and&#xD;
      efficacy in several clinical setting and, recently, a randomized controlled trial showed that&#xD;
      NHF, as compared to NIV, may reduce the intubation rate in severely hypoxemic patients with&#xD;
      de novo acute respiratory failure (AHRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prone positioning (PP) is a simple and cost-effective strategy that since 1980s has been used&#xD;
      in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure to treat oxygenation&#xD;
      impairment. In the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) PP reduces intrapulmonary shunt&#xD;
      (Qs/Qt) and enhances lung recruitment, modifying both lung ventilation (VA) and lung&#xD;
      perfusion (Q) distribution, finally generating an improvement in VA/Q matching and reversing&#xD;
      oxygenation impairment. In addition, the reduction of transpulmonary gradient (mean pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial pressure-pulmonary artery occlusion pressure) due to a higher pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      occlusion pressure allows pulmonary vascular recruitment, possibly lowering dead space&#xD;
      fraction. Indeed, prone positioning sessions have been shown to reduce right ventricular&#xD;
      afterload, increase cardiac index in subjects with preload reserve and reverse acute cor&#xD;
      pulmonale in severe ARDS patients. Finally, a large randomized study detected a relevant&#xD;
      survival benefit by prone positioning in patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome (ARDS) undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and managed with the ARDS&#xD;
      network peep-FiO2 table strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretically, PP benefits may concern also spontaneous breathing patients, in whom it could&#xD;
      possibly contribute to the success of the noninvasive strategy. Data concerning PP&#xD;
      application in such context are limited to small case series and a retrospective study&#xD;
      involving patients undergoing NIV or oxygen therapy and suggesting good patients tolerance,&#xD;
      significant improvement in oxygenation during the procedure and no increase in nurse&#xD;
      workload. In particular, in the retrospective study by Pesenti and co. 43 procedures in 15&#xD;
      patients were analysed: three patients (20%) received mild sedation without dosing&#xD;
      adjustments over the course of the study, median [IqR] duration of prone positioning was&#xD;
      3[2-4] hours and only in two cases (5%) pronation had to be interrupted after 30 minutes due&#xD;
      to patient's discomfort, while no other respiratory or technical complications, such as&#xD;
      displacement of indwelling catheters, facial oedema, pressure sores, pressure neuropathies,&#xD;
      compression of nerves, and retinal vessels or vomiting, have been documented. Given its high&#xD;
      tolerability, simplicity to use and positive effect on patients' comfort when compared both&#xD;
      to NIV and to low flow oxygen delivered through a face mask, NHF may be the optimal strategy&#xD;
      for the respiratory management of spontaneous breathing patients during prone positioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, a recent electrical impedance tomography study on 20 healthy volunteers during&#xD;
      NHF showed a more homogeneous dorsal-to-ventral ventilation pattern in PP, as compared to the&#xD;
      supine position: notably, a dorsal-to-ventral more uniform air distribution may benefit&#xD;
      hypoxemic patients, given that PaO2 response to oxygen supplementation can be fostered by&#xD;
      more homogeneous regional lung inflation and better oxygenation has been shown to be a&#xD;
      predictor of NHF treatment success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed a pilot feasibility study to assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      prone positioning in patients wit AHRF undergoing high flow oxygen therapy via nasal cannula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: 21-bed medical-surgical ICU, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario &quot;Agostino&#xD;
      Gemelli&quot;, Rome, Italy..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: adult hypoxemic (PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 200 mmHg) non-hypercapnic patients with acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure will be assessed for the enrolment. To validate the presence of the&#xD;
      oxygenation criteria, each eligible patient, in the absence of exclusion criteria, will&#xD;
      receive 15 minutes of heated and humidified 50% oxygen at a rate of 50 l/min via a&#xD;
      non-rebreathing face mask. An ABG will be then collected and PaO2/FiO2 ratio computed: given&#xD;
      the high flows used, actual FiO2 will be approximated to the set one. Patients with a P/F&#xD;
      ratio&lt;80 mmHg and/or a RR&gt;40 bpm will be excluded for safety reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Eligible patients will undergo NHF for 1 hour in the supine semi recumbent position&#xD;
      (baseline, BL step). Oxygen therapy will be commenced at 60 l/min and flows will be decreased&#xD;
      in case of intolerance. Humidification chamber (MR860, Fisher and Paykel healthcare) will be&#xD;
      set at 37 °C or 31 °C according to patient's comfort. FiO2 will be titrated to obtain and&#xD;
      SpO2 &gt;92 % and &lt;98 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, the patient will be placed in the prone position for 2 hours (Prone step). During&#xD;
      pronation FiO2 will be increased up to 80% and then gradually decreased to the baseline value&#xD;
      within the first 10 minutes of prone positioning. Any further modifications in the NHF&#xD;
      settings will be discouraged over the entire course of the study; nonetheless, if needed to&#xD;
      achieve the SpO2 target, an increase in FiO2 will be allowed and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As suggested by Pesenti and co., in conscious and cooperative patients pronation will be&#xD;
      performed by 2 operators and the attending physician, while in patients with impaired&#xD;
      mobility up to 5 operators will be necessary. Evaluation of gastric residual volume through a&#xD;
      nasogastric tube will reduce the risk of aspiration and application of appropriate skin&#xD;
      protections will avoid pressure sores. In addition, careful application of appropriate&#xD;
      cushions will enhance patient tolerance to the manoeuvre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For safety reasons, enteral feeding, whether prescribed, will be interrupted 1 hour before&#xD;
      prone positioning and re-established after the study ending.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 2-hour PP period, the patient will be rotated and will undergo 1 hour of NHF in the&#xD;
      semi recumbent supine position (Supine step).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As already stated, FiO2 will be increased up to 80% for the procedure and then gradually&#xD;
      decreased to the baseline value within the following 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of intolerance to PP, all clinical data will be collected and the patients will be&#xD;
      promptly rotated in supine position. The reasons for prematurely unproning the patient will&#xD;
      be accurately recorded. In case of sudden worsening of the oxygenation impairment or&#xD;
      haemodynamics, 100% FiO2 will be set and the patient will be promptly positioned in the&#xD;
      supine semi-recumbent position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements Patient's demographics will be collected at study entry: initials, age, sex,&#xD;
      height, weight, BMI, cause of hospital and ICU admission, SAPS II, Apache, SOFA, date and&#xD;
      time of ICU admission, date and time of enrolment, comorbidities, NYHA category prior to&#xD;
      respiratory failure, body temperature, chest x-ray (jpeg images), chest CT scan (if&#xD;
      available).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study enrolment an electrical impedance tomography (EIT) belt will be placed around the&#xD;
      thorax between the 5th or 6th parasternal intercostal space and connected to a dedicated&#xD;
      device to record electrical impedance signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, each patient will undergo a standard ICU monitoring: ECG, Invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure, SpO2, respiratory rate, diuresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the BL period, and then on a hourly basis the following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory rate, SpO2, pH, PaCO2, PaO2, SaO2, PaO2/FiO2;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart Rate, arterial blood pressure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dyspnoea, as defined by the Borg dyspnoea scale;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discomfort, as defined by a visual analogic scale (VAS) adapted to rate the procedural&#xD;
           pain of ICU patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End expiratory lung impedance (EELI), tidal volume distribution and global and regional&#xD;
           lung dynamic strain (Change in lung impedence due to tidal volume/EELI). At the end of&#xD;
           each step, ten-minute EIT signals will be recorded and offline reviewed using a&#xD;
           dedicated software. Image acquisition rate will be 30 Hz. Lungs will be divided into&#xD;
           four regions (ventral, mid-ventral, mid-dorsal and dorsal): the percentage of impedance&#xD;
           variation related to tidal volume and the percentage EELI in the four regions as&#xD;
           compared to the absolute values will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PTP of the esophageal pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Esophageal pressure inspiratory swings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory system, lung and chest wall mechanics, according to the method proposed by&#xD;
           Mauri et al. (Am J Resp Crit Care Med 2017)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pendelluft phenomenon&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a safety tool the following adverse events will be assessed in each of the three study&#xD;
      periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of displacements of the nasal cannula&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of oxygen desaturations (SpO2 &lt;90%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Episodes of haemodynamic instability (Systolic arterial pressure&lt;80 mmHg or FC&gt;120 BPM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Displacement of venous line (peripheral or central), if documented&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Displacement of arterial line, if documented&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Displacement of urinary catheter, if documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, the nurse in charge will be asked to anonymously rate the additional&#xD;
      workload due to PP (in minutes) and to judge the feasibility and safety of the procedure&#xD;
      using two analog scales ranging from 0 (completely unfeasible/unsafe) to 10 (totally&#xD;
      feasible/safe).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Given the pilot, physiological and exploratory design of the study, a formal&#xD;
      sample power analysis was not performed. It is planned to enrol 15 patients over a period of&#xD;
      12 months.&#xD;
