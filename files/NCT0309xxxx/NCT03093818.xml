      PREPARE is an international, prospective, multi-center, open, randomized, cross-over&#xD;
      implementation study assessing the impact of pre-emptive pharmacogenomic testing, of a panel&#xD;
      of actionable pharmacogenomic variants, on adverse event incidence. Additional outcomes&#xD;
      include, healthcare expenditure, process indicators for implementation and provider adoption&#xD;
      of pharmacogenomics.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-emptive pharmacogenomic testing will be implemented in clinical sites across seven&#xD;
      European countries (United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Austria, Greece, Slovenia, Italy and&#xD;
      Spain). The 36-month study is split into two (19 and 18-month) time-blocks. The participating&#xD;
      countries are randomized to start with either implementing pharmacogenomics guided&#xD;
      prescribing or with standard of care in the first block. In the pharmacogenomics guided&#xD;
      prescribing arm, results of the pharmacogenomic test will be incorporated in the (electronic)&#xD;
      medical record and may be used by physicians and pharmacists to guide drug and dose selection&#xD;
      for 39 routinely prescribed drugs, as per the Dutch Pharmacogenomics Working Group&#xD;
      guidelines. In the standard of care arm, patients will not receive pharmacogenomic testing.&#xD;
      After this 19-month block, the countries switch to implementing the opposite strategy and&#xD;
      will recruit new patients for a period of 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are eligible for participation when they receive a first prescription for one or&#xD;
      more of 39 drugs for which a Dutch Pharmacogenomic Working Group guideline is available&#xD;
      (acenocoumarol, amitriptyline, aripiprazole, atomoxetine, atorvastatin, azathioprine&#xD;
      ,capecitabine, citalopram, clomipramine, clopidogrel, codeine, doxepin, efavirenz,&#xD;
      escitalopram, flecainide, flucloxacillin, fluorouracil, haloperidol, imipramine, irinotecan,&#xD;
      mercaptopurine, metoprolol, nortryptiline, paroxetine, phenprocoumon, phenytoin, pimozide,&#xD;
      propafenon, sertraline, simvastatin, tacrolimus, tamoxifen, tegafur, thioguanine, tramadol,&#xD;
      venlafaxine, voriconazole, warfarin or zuclopenthixol). All patients will be followed for a&#xD;
      minimum of three months and a maximum of 18 months. In total, 8,100 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited; 4,050 will receive pharmacogenomic testing, and 4,050 will receive standard of&#xD;
      care. Each implementation site will concentrate on, but is not limited to, recruiting&#xD;
      patients within a specific therapeutic area. Therapeutic areas include primary care, general&#xD;
      medicine, cardiology, oncology, psychiatry, neurology, and transplantation. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that implementing pharmacogenomics guided drug and dose selection will decrease&#xD;
      incidence of clinically relevant adverse drug reactions by 30% (from 4% to 2.8% among those&#xD;
      with actionable drug-gene interactions).&#xD;
