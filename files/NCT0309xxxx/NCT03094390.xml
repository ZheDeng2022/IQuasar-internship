    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the accuracy of the total thoracic fluid content (TFC) measured by&#xD;
      cardiometry can predict weaning failure. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve&#xD;
      (AUROC) will be determined, sensitivity, specificity, and best cutoff value will be&#xD;
      calculated for TFC in prediction of weaning failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Weaning from mechanical ventilation is a serious and challenging process in critical care&#xD;
      practice. Weaning failure is associated with poor patient outcomes. Increased mortality in&#xD;
      patients with failed weaning was due to development of complications related to&#xD;
      re-intubation. Detection and correction of the cause of failed spontaneous breathing trial&#xD;
      (SBT) helps the intensives to improve the outcome of the next trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid overload and positive cumulative fluid balance is a risk factor of weaning failure in&#xD;
      both cardiac and non-cardiac patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many tools for prediction of lung congestion as a risk factor for weaning failure have been&#xD;
      reported. The gold standard for detection of cardiac cause of weaning failure was pulmonary&#xD;
      artery catheter. More simple tools had been investigated for detection of cardiac cause of&#xD;
      weaning failure in patients with or without previous cardiac dysfunction such as&#xD;
      extravascular lung water and B-natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although measurement of extravascular lung water is a reliable tool for prediction of cardiac&#xD;
      cause of weaning failure, it has the disadvantage of the need of advanced monitor with&#xD;
      invasive arterial line. Bioreactance is a new technology used for measurement of cardiac&#xD;
      output and total thoracic fluid content (TFC). More recently, electrical velocimetry is a&#xD;
      newer technology with good performance in cardiac output monitoring. The use of electrical&#xD;
      velocimetry in measurement of TFC has the advantage of being non-invasive with no need for&#xD;
      advanced skills. The aim of this work is to validate the use of TFC (measured by electrical&#xD;
      velocimetry) in prediction of weaning outcome.&#xD;
