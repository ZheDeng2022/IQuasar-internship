      The purpose of this study is to compare the glucose, insulin and subjective hunger responses&#xD;
      elicited by oats with additional dried fruits, nuts and seeds soaked overnight in skim milk&#xD;
      and consumed cold versus Cream of Rice cereal with additional dried fruits, nuts and seeds&#xD;
      cooked just prior to its consumption.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Willing to maintain habitual diet, physical activity pattern, and body weight&#xD;
             throughout the trial and to refrain from smoking for 12hr prior to each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to maintain current dietary supplement use throughout the trial. On test days,&#xD;
             subject agrees not to take any dietary supplements until dismissal from the Richardson&#xD;
             Centre. Failure to comply will result in a rescheduled test visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal fasting serum glucose (&lt;6.3mmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to abstain from alcohol consumption for 24 h prior to all test visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to avoid vigorous physical activity for 24 h prior to all test visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of health conditions that would prevent fulfillment of study requirements as&#xD;
             judged by the Investigator on the basis of medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Understanding the study procedures and willing to provide informed consent to&#xD;
             participate in the study and authorization to release relevant protected health&#xD;
             information to the study investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to meet any one of the inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of AIDS, hepatitis, a history or presence of clinically important&#xD;

             peripheral arterial disease, stroke), pulmonary, biliary or GI disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of medications known to influence carbohydrate metabolism, including, but not&#xD;
             limited to adrenergic blockers, diuretics, thiazolidinediones, metformin and systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids within 4 weeks of the screening visit, or with any condition which&#xD;
             might, in the opinion of Dr. Jones, the director of the Richardson Centre, either: 1)&#xD;
             make participation dangerous to the subject or to others, or 2) affect the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major trauma or surgical event within 3 months of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known to be pregnant or lactating&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Extreme dietary habits, as judged by the Investigator (i.e. Atkins diet, very high&#xD;
             protein diets, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic blood&#xD;
             pressure ≥100 mm Hg as defined by the average blood pressure measured at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Change in body weight of &gt;3.5kg within 4 weeks of the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any signs or symptoms of an active infection within 5 d prior to any test&#xD;
             visit. If an infection occurs during the study period, test visits should be&#xD;
             rescheduled until all signs and symptoms have resolved and any treatment (i.e.&#xD;
             antibiotic therapy) has been completed at least 5 d prior to each test visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cancer in the prior two years, except for non-melanoma skin cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent history (within 12 months of screening) or strong potential for alcohol or&#xD;
             substance abuse. Alcohol abuse is defined as &gt; 14 drinks per week (1 drink=12 oz beer,&#xD;
             5 oz wine, or 1.5 oz distilled spirits).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to any investigational drug product within 30 d prior to screening.&#xD;
