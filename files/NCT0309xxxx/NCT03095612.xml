    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2 clinical trial of the oral XPO1 inhibitor selinexor (KPT-330) in&#xD;
      combination with docetaxel for previously treated, advanced KRAS mutant non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC). It is a single-arm, non-blinded study, which will compare safety and outcomes&#xD;
      with historical controls (docetaxel monotherapy). The multi-center study will be conducted&#xD;
      within the Academic Thoracic Oncology Medical Investigator Consortium (ATOMIC).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a phase 1/2 single-arm, non-blinded, multi-institutional study. Selinexor will be administered once weekly starting one week before chemotherapy initiation (to permit pharmacodynamic assessment of selinexor alone and in combination with chemotherapy), in combination with docetaxel. Docetaxel will be given once every 3 weeks. Treatment will be administered in 21-day cycles. Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be assessed based on the first cycle (7-day lead-in plus 21-day cycle = 28 days) toxicity using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] version 4.03. A standard 3 + 3 dose escalation paradigm will be used.</intervention_model_description>

&#xD;
               1. Written informed consent in accordance with federal, local, and institutional&#xD;
                  guidelines. The patient must provide informed consent prior to the first&#xD;
                  screening procedure. However, the Investigator should not repeat procedures that&#xD;
                  are performed as part of standard of care (SOC), if they are within the screening&#xD;
                  window and are done prior to signing the ICF.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced (stage 4, according to the&#xD;
                  American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] version 7.0 Staging manual) NSCLC&#xD;

                  unstained slides plus 1 H+E slide. If archival tumor tissue is not available in&#xD;
                  select cases, subjects may be permitted to enroll on the study with prior&#xD;
                  approval of the study PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. At least one and up to two previous lines of systemic cytotoxic therapy for&#xD;
                  advanced NSCLC, of which one must have been a platinum-based doublet therapy. Up&#xD;
                  to four total previous lines of systemic therapy (including immunotherapy and&#xD;
                  molecularly targeted therapy) for advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Radiographic or clinical disease recurrence or progression during or after the&#xD;
                  last line of systemic therapy&#xD;

                  hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL; platelets ≥ 100,000/µL. Patients may be transfused with&#xD;
                  PRBCs up to 7 days prior to when enrollment labs are drawn to achieve Hgb ≥9.0&#xD;
                  mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Adequate renal function (calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min using the&#xD;

                  and ≤ 5 × ULN in patients with liver metastases, alkaline phosphatase must be ≤&#xD;
                  2.5 × ULN (unless elevated alkaline phosphatase clearly due to skeletal-rather&#xD;

                  absence of bulky and/or central liver metastases). Patients with Gilbert's&#xD;
                  syndrome are allowed if total bilirubin ≤ 2 × ULN and direct bilirubin is ≤ ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. Female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use 2 methods of&#xD;
                  contraception (including 1 highly effective and 1 effective method of&#xD;

                  patients must use an effective barrier method of contraception if sexually active&#xD;

                  and agree to use 2 reliable methods of contraception throughout the study and for&#xD;
                  3 months after their last dose of medication. Female patients are considered NOT&#xD;
                  of childbearing potential if they have a history of surgical sterility (including&#xD;
                  hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, but not tubal ligation alone) or&#xD;

                       and their partners must use 2 reliable methods of contraception, at least&#xD;
                       one of them a barrier method (if sexually active with a female of&#xD;
                       child-bearing potential).&#xD;
&#xD;
