    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study to determine optimal thigh cuff design using a cephalad fluid&#xD;
      shift protocol in patients who have an intraventricular catheter (such as Ommaya reservoir)&#xD;
      placed for the delivery of central nervous system chemotherapy or for diagnosing potential&#xD;
      elevation of ICP and monitoring its progression as part of standard medical care.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with intraventricular catheter meeting eligibility criteria will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
Blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram and Intracranial Pressure (ICP) monitoring after standard of care procedures are completed&#xD;
Continuous ICP monitoring using a disposable pressure transducer (i.e., TruWaveTM)&#xD;
Sequential placement in an upright, seated, supine 0°, and supine 15° head down tilt (HDT) positions for approximately 15 minutes for stabilization, followed by: Non-invasive ICP, intra-ocular pressure (IOP) assessment, femoral vascular ultrasound, jugular vascular ultrasound, and assessment of adverse events</description>

    <description>The aim is to achieve positive and near normal forward arterial vascular blood flow to the lower extremities. Milder cuff pressures up to 65 mmHg will be used to limit venous return to the upper body.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female, 18-89 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have an intraventricular catheter placed for the delivery of central&#xD;
             nervous system chemotherapy or for diagnosing potential elevation of ICP and&#xD;
             monitoring its progression as part of standard medical care&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  KPS ≥ 70&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients on active anti-cancer (intra-thecal or IV) therapy, must be at least 2&#xD;
             weeks since last treatment; oral therapy is permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Less than 2 weeks since any prior surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ICP &gt; 20 mmHg that cannot be clinically stabilized&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant (Note: women of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test; women who are not of child-bearing potential are defined as: post-menopausal,&#xD;
             age &gt; 55 years with cessation of menses for 12 or more months; or less than 55 years&#xD;
             with postmenopausal status confirmed by follicle-stimulating hormone in the&#xD;
             post-menopausal range; or who have had a hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Existing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, syncope, ocular disease that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, may confound the study results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled neurological symptoms such as headache, nausea or vomiting that, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, will limit the patient's ability to participate in the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Injury, trauma, venous thromboembolism, peripheral arterial disease or any condition&#xD;
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, will prevent the subject from tolerating the&#xD;
             application of a thigh cuff; history of treated DVT is permitted&#xD;
