    <textblock>
      The proposal is a phase II clinical study designed to assess the feasibility of durvalumab&#xD;
      (MEDI4736) in HIV-1-infected individuals with solid tumors. Additionally, to obtain data that&#xD;
      lets understand the possible benefit of this treatment in cancer patients and HIV infection,&#xD;
      exploring if activity of durvalumab (MEDI4736) could be higher in cancer that has been&#xD;
      produced at least in part due to the chronic immunosupression. Simultaneously, it will allow&#xD;
      us to investigate the effect of disrupting this immunoregulatory pathway might have in&#xD;
      reversing cancer pathways and HIV-specific T-cell function during persistent chronic HIV&#xD;
      infection in humans.&#xD;

      PD-1/ PD-L1 coinhibitory pathway plays a significant role in the regulation of the immune&#xD;
      response in both chronic infectious diseases and cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical and animal data support the safety and promising activity of anti-PD-1 antibody&#xD;
      in HIV-1 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demonstrated anticancer activity and safety profile of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in cancer&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlikely drug interactions of durvalumab (MEDI4736) and antiretroviral treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposal is a phase II clinical study designed to assess the feasibility of durvalumab&#xD;
      (MEDI4736) in HIV-1-infected individuals with solid tumors. Additionally, to obtain data that&#xD;
      lets understand the possible benefit of this treatment in cancer patients and HIV infection,&#xD;
      exploring if activity of durvalumab (MEDI4736) could be higher in cancer that has been&#xD;

      reversing cancer pathways and HIV-specific T-cell function during persistent chronic HIV&#xD;
      infection in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, our hypothesis is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV patients with cancer have a similar outcome in terms of tolerability when treated with&#xD;
      durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy at the recommended dose than non HIV infected patients.&#xD;
