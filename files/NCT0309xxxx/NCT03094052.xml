  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the incidence and severity of diarrhea in patients with stage&#xD;
      II-IIIC HER2 Positive breast cancer treated with trastuzumab and neratinib. Trastuzumab is a&#xD;
      form of targeted therapy because it attaches itself to specific molecules (receptors) on the&#xD;
      surface of cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab attaches to HER2&#xD;
      receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the cancer cell may be&#xD;
      marked for destruction by the body's immune system. Neratinib may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving trastuzumab and&#xD;
      neratinib may work better in treating patients with stage II-IIIC HER2 positive breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the incidence and severity of diarrhea in patients with early stage breast&#xD;
      cancer receiving adjuvant neratinib with or without trastuzumab in the setting of&#xD;
      anti-diarrheal strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the incidence of grade 3 or higher diarrhea using the dose-escalation strategy&#xD;
      and anti-diarrhea medications as needed (prn) in patients who received prior trastuzumab&#xD;
      emtansine (T-DM1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess neratinib adherence, holds, delays, and early discontinuation throughout the&#xD;
      course of study therapy which includes patients receiving neratinib for &gt; 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess overall toxicity including constipation and cardiac toxicity with concomitant&#xD;
      neratinib and trastuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of neratinib. Patients receive one of the following&#xD;
      treatment regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NERATINIB MONOTHERAPY: Patients receive neratinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21.&#xD;
      Cycles repeats every 21 days for up to 55 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive loperamide and/or diphenoxylate&#xD;
      hydrochloride/atropine sulfate as needed per physician discretion for symptom management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NERATINIB AND TRASTUZUMAB: Patients receive neratinib PO QD on days 1-21. Patients also&#xD;
      receive trastuzumab maintenance therapy as determined by treating physician. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for up to 55 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. After completion of trastuzumab treatment, patients may continue on&#xD;
      neratinib monotherapy for the remainder of the 55 weeks. Patients may receive loperamide&#xD;
      and/or diphenoxylate hydrochloride/atropine sulfate as needed per physician discretion for&#xD;
      symptom management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of studies treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days.&#xD;
