  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is investigating a drug as a possible treatment for metastatic renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma. The intervention involved in this study is TAK-228.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved TAK-228 as a treatment for&#xD;
      any disease but it is being investigated as a treatment for advanced solid tumors, blood&#xD;
      disorders, and inflammatory diseases. TAK-228 works to inhibit or interfere with cellular&#xD;
      functions involved in cell growth and survival. TAK-228 specifically targets a type of&#xD;
      protein that can make chemicals that trigger cell growth, including cancer cell growth. This&#xD;
      protein may also cause cells to produce proteins that trigger the development of new blood&#xD;
      vessels. Cancers need new blood vessels in order to grow. In some types of cancer, this type&#xD;
      of protein (mTOR) is switched on, and it makes the cancer cells grow and produce new blood&#xD;
      vessels. mTOR blockers (inhibitors) are a newer type of cancer growth blocker that can stop&#xD;
      the growth of some types of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers hope to learn how participants with previously treated mRCC will respond to&#xD;
      treatment with TAK-228. Other goals of this study include assessing the types of side effects&#xD;
      associated TAK-228 and whether there is a relationship between certain genetic mutations&#xD;
      (changes to your DNA) and participant responses to the drug.&#xD;
