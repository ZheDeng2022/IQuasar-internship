      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine consequences at school age of the diagnosis of NEC in&#xD;
      the neonatal period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a case-control study, with case-group being children born in Denmark with a history&#xD;
      of NEC and control-group being age-, gestational age- and year of birth matched children born&#xD;
      in Denmark with no history of NEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abnormal or borderline 'total difficulties score' in the&#xD;
      strenghts-and-difficulties-questionnaire as assessed by parents.&#xD;

      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge of the long-term complications related to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in the&#xD;
      neonatal period is essential, when clinicians are counseling parents about the risk for&#xD;
      complications following NEC. When deciding upon a follow-up strategy for the infant after&#xD;
      discharge, this knowledge is also crucial. If the infant has an increased risk for&#xD;
      complications later in life, a closer follow up is important to assure proper handling of&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, a definite conclusion regarding long-term complications of NEC has not been made. A&#xD;
      systematic review including ten studies, have shown a significantly increased risk for&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental impairment in NEC children. However, the median follow-up time did not&#xD;
      exceed two years and may not reflect the true long-term complications. The ORACLE Children&#xD;
      Study investigated neurodevelopmental impairments in children with a history of NEC at 7,5&#xD;
      year follow-up and found no increased risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No review has been published regarding growth impairments and so far, available studies have&#xD;
      a less than three year follow-up period and are reporting conflicting results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal morbidities are even less investigated and reports no association with NEC&#xD;
      within three years follow-up. However, the ORACLE Children Study found increased risk of&#xD;
      bowel problems at 7,5 years follow-up in children with a history of NEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Oracle Children Study and Roze et al reported behavioural problems in up to 30% of&#xD;
      children with a history of NEC at school age, but no statistic significance was found when&#xD;
      compared to a control-group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further studies investigating the outcome of NEC-children at school age are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to conduct a retrospective parental-questionnare study, to determine&#xD;
      the long-term complications related to the diagnosis of NEC at school age (5-15 years of&#xD;
      age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a case-control study. Case-group will include all surviving children born in Denmark&#xD;
      between 1st of January 2002 and 31st of December 2011 with an international classification of&#xD;
      diseases (ICD-10) diagnosis of NEC at discharge. Matching each child with a history of NEC to&#xD;
      two children with no history of NEC by gestational age, year of birth and birthweight will&#xD;
      form the control group. Matching criteria's have been chosen to balance prematurity and age&#xD;
      at follow-up between case and control-group. Parental follow-up questionnaires regarding&#xD;
      complications will be sent to all parents of cases and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data on the children, regarding birth and neonatal history, will be obtained and&#xD;
      used in a mixed regression model to adjust for possible confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abnormal or borderline 'total difficulties score' in the&#xD;
      strenghts-and-difficulties-questionnaire as assessed by parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Severe cerebral palsy (GMFCS III-IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Head circumference as measured by parents&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Height as measured by parents&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Abdominal symptoms resulting in significant absence from school as reported by parents&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Diarrhoea within the last six months&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Constipation within the last six months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for the case group was estimated to include 200 children with NEC (after a&#xD;
      no-response drop out of 20%) and in the control group 300 children without NEC, with a 1:2&#xD;
      match ratio and the assumption that the response rate will be lower in the control group.,&#xD;
      i.e. 250 parents of children with NEC and 500 parents of control children will be contacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SDQ total score Assuming 30% prevalence of abnormal or borderline scores for 'total&#xD;
      difficulties' in the strength-and-difficulties-questionnaire in NEC-survivors, compared to an&#xD;
      assumed 20% in controls (19), this study will detect the difference with a power of 72% at a&#xD;
      5% significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe cerebral palsy (GMFCS score III-V) Assuming a 20% prevalence (9) of severe cerebral&#xD;
      palsy in NEC-survivors compared to an assumed 10% in controls (22) this study will detect the&#xD;
      difference with a power of 87% at a 5% significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Head circumference The power calculation on our cohort shows that we, at a 5% significance&#xD;
      level, can detect the difference in mean head circumference at 0.3 standard-deviations or&#xD;
      more, with a power of 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: a p-value &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant. To determine a difference&#xD;
      in SDQ-scores between case- and control group, Chi-squared test or Fischer's Exact test will&#xD;
      be used as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome: a p-value &lt; 0.01 will be considered significant. Differences in 'height',&#xD;
      'head circumference' and 'absence from school due to abdominal symptoms' will be investigated&#xD;
      by t-test or Mann-Whitney's test as appropriate. 'Severe cerebral palsy', 'diarrhoea' and&#xD;
      'constipation' will be analyzed by Chi-squared test or FischerÂ´s Exact test as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At first, an unadjusted analysis will be performed to investigate differences in primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcome. Secondly, a mixed regression model will be used to adjust for possible&#xD;
      confounders&#xD;
