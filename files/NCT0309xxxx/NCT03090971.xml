  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, controlled, prospective, proof-of-concept study, in 7 patients presenting&#xD;
      NF1 and cutaneous neurofibromas. This study will include three treatment visits to the study&#xD;
      center and three follow-up visits. Treatment will consist of two stages: neurofibroma&#xD;
      microporation using the laser device, followed by topical application of one drop of&#xD;
      diclofenac 25mg/ml on the surface of the neurofibroma; followed by re-application of one drop&#xD;
      of diclofenac, twice daily, for three days. The applications subsequent to the first&#xD;
      application will be performed by the patients. Subjects will return to the study center at&#xD;
      three day intervals (Assessments 2 &amp; 3) for new microporation and topical diclofenac&#xD;
      application, followed by at-home topical diclofenac application for three more days.&#xD;
      Assessment 4 will take place 3 days after Assessment 3. Assessment 5 will take place 7 days&#xD;
      after the end of the treatment period and Assessment 6 at 30 days after the last application&#xD;
      of study drug. The primary efficacy variable in this study is the inflammatory process with&#xD;
      the presence of tissue necrosis. The primary safety variable is the occurrence of adverse&#xD;
      events considered to be associated with the study drug, occurring during the treatment&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome with highly&#xD;
      variable clinical manifestations and that has a worldwide incidence of approximately 1/2500.&#xD;
      The most common lesion is the cutaneous neurofibroma, appearing on the skin of 90% of adults&#xD;
      with NF1. The number of cutaneous neurofibromas in an affected individual can vary from a few&#xD;
      to several thousand. These lesions may be surgically removed, but typically recur, and&#xD;
      surgical removal often leads to scarring. Intralesional administration of diclofenac was&#xD;
      previously reported with favorable results, and significant inflammatory processes were&#xD;
      observed within the treated neurofibromas, with tissue necrosis and detachment of some&#xD;
      treated neurofibromas, effects that were not observed among the control neurofibromas. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this study is to evaluate the use of topical diclofenac in the treatment&#xD;
      of cutaneous neurofibromas in patients with NF1. The secondary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the safety of the use of topical diclofenac in the treatment of cutaneous&#xD;
      neurofibromas in patients with NF1. This is an open, controlled, prospective,&#xD;
      proof-of-concept study, in 7 patients presenting NF1 and cutaneous neurofibromas. This study&#xD;
      will include three treatment visits to the study center and three follow-up visits. Treatment&#xD;
      will consist of two stages: neurofibroma microporation using the laser device, followed by&#xD;
      topical application of one drop of diclofenac 25mg/ml on the surface of the neurofibroma;&#xD;
      followed by re-application of one drop of diclofenac, twice daily, for three days. The&#xD;
      applications subsequent to the first application will be performed by the patients. Subjects&#xD;
      will return to the study center at three day intervals (Assessments 2 &amp; 3) for new&#xD;
      microporation and topical diclofenac application, followed by at-home topical diclofenac&#xD;
      application for three more days. Assessment 4 will take place 3 days after Assessment 3.&#xD;
      Assessment 5 will take place 7 days after the end of the treatment period and Assessment 6 30&#xD;
      days after the last application of study drug. The primary efficacy variable in this study is&#xD;
      the inflammatory process with the presence of tissue necrosis. The primary safety variable is&#xD;
      the occurrence of adverse events considered to be associated with the study drug, occurring&#xD;
      during the treatment period. Prior to any study-related procedure, written informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from the participant. The Clinical Research From will be filled, stored,&#xD;
      coded, and the data will be analyzed using GraphPad Prism, v. 5.0. Frequency tables will be&#xD;
      generated and central tendencies calculated (mean, median, mode).&#xD;
