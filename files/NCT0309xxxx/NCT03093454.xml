    <textblock>
      This project will evaluate the integration of lavender essential oil in surgical patients&#xD;
      during the perioperative and postoperative phase of care. The study will assess patients'&#xD;
      pain, sleep quality, and mood. The goal is to support that lavender oil will decrease pain&#xD;
      scores and narcotic use, increase sleep quality, and decrease anxiety by improving overall&#xD;
      patient satisfaction and supporting their natural sense of well being. This research project&#xD;
      will help support the use of complementary medicine in a hospital setting. The increased&#xD;
      awareness and use of complementary medicine in a hospital setting will strengthen the patient&#xD;
      centered care model that all hospitals strive to achieve.&#xD;

      Background &amp; Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Essential oils have been formally documented in use since the time of the Egyptians. The&#xD;
      Ebers Papyrus document notes Egyptians using frankincense for different physical ailments. In&#xD;
      Greece Hippocrates used essential oils to fumigate the city of Athens to fight off the&#xD;
      plague. In medieval periods lavender essential oil was used for its antidepressive,&#xD;
      anxiolytic, sedative, and analgesic properties. Medieval Persian physicians made records of&#xD;
      their treatment plans which included lavender for depression and pain for headaches. With the&#xD;
      invention of steam distillation to separate the essential oil from the plant Europe began to&#xD;
      use oils in perfumes and for medicinal benefits in the 1500's. Two physicians named&#xD;
      Hieronymus and Brunschwig wrote one of the earliest printed books on the distillation and use&#xD;
      of essential oils for medical benefits. By the 19th century a French chemist Rene- Maurice&#xD;
      Gattefosse was known for studying essential oils and their therapeutic benefits. His work and&#xD;
      documentation led the way for the support of essential oil in medical ailments. Robert&#xD;
      Tisserand in the early 1990s reviewed the French chemists work and added to his research to&#xD;
      help make essential oils more known to the public in present day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years lavender has been studied on human subjects to tests its known reputation for&#xD;
      sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic properties. In one clinical trial oral administration of&#xD;
      lavender was compared to Ativan 0.5mg for generalized anxiety disorder. The study supported&#xD;
      that the oral lavender oil called Silexan was as effective as 0.5mg of Ativan in adults with&#xD;
      generalized anxiety disorder. A second clinical trial analyzing sleep quality found that&#xD;
      ischemic heart patients in the intensive care unit received better sleep with 100% lavender&#xD;
      oil undiluted placed on a cotton ball within 20cm from the patient from the hours of 9pm-6am.&#xD;
      Two studies have used lavender oil through inhalation in the recovery room with an oxygen&#xD;
      mask after surgery for pain control. The first study was patients after breast biopsy, the&#xD;
      second was patients who just had laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. The study with the&#xD;
      breast biopsy patients showed a higher satisfaction rate with pain. The patients undergoing&#xD;
      laparoscopic banding also showed a higher rate of satisfaction with pain as well as decreased&#xD;
      opioid use in the recovery room. Furthermore one study used 100% lavender oil undiluted on&#xD;
      the skin of pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy as a topical application and asked&#xD;
      the patients to inhale. The study showed a decrease use in Tylenol usage postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design &amp; Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Randomized study with control group and test group. Using a 1:1 treatment allocation&#xD;
      ratio, the total of 60 patients (30 per arm) will be randomly assigned to control or&#xD;
      treatment arm. The Statistical Investigator will generate the randomization scheme and&#xD;
      monitor the randomization process over the course of the trial. The study will use&#xD;
      randomization with random permuted blocks. The test group will receive 50% lavender oil&#xD;
      diluted in fractionated coconut oil and the control group will have the current standard of&#xD;
      care with no essential oil intervention. Fractionated coconut oil is being used because it is&#xD;
      colorless, odorless, does not stain clothing, and has a long shelf life. It also serves as a&#xD;
      carrier oil for the essential oil to absorb into the skin instead of evaporating off the skin&#xD;
      due to essential oils volatile nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure The lavender essential oil used will be from the company doTERRA. This&#xD;
      essential oil company was chosen because this company has a medical and science governing&#xD;
      board made up of physicians, surgeons, chemists and pharmacists. The oil is also third party&#xD;
      tested by Dr. Robert Pappas a trusted chemist in the essential oil community for purity and&#xD;
      quality. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry are used to ensure purity and no unwanted&#xD;
      substances are in the essential oil. doTERRA's essential oils have also already been used in&#xD;
      a hospital setting at Vanderbilt University hospital in Tennessee. doTERRA's essential oils&#xD;
      were diffused in the Vanderbilt ER at the nursing stations. After 3 months of diffusing staff&#xD;
      felt less work related stress, less time feeling overwhelmed, and had more energy at work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent is obtained, exactly 4 drops of 50% lavender solution will be placed&#xD;
      on the wrist over the radial artery. The patient will rub her wrists and hands together and&#xD;
      then inhale and exhale slowly for one minute. This will occur thirty minutes before being&#xD;
      taken to the operating room. The dilution of 50% was chosen after reviewing Robert&#xD;
      Tisserand's book on essential oil safety, consulting a local certified aromatherapist,&#xD;
      Cynthia Loving, and consulting Dr. David Hill, executive vice president and chief medical&#xD;
      officer of doTERRA essential oils. This percent dilution is recommended on skin and is not&#xD;
      likely to cause irritation to the skin. Repeated insult patch skin testing from doTERRA has&#xD;
      supported this dilution rate to be safe to the skin. Furthermore a previous study used 100 %&#xD;
      lavender oil on children age 5-12 undergoing tonsillectomy with no adverse reactions. The&#xD;
      first dose will be given thirty minutes prior to the operating room because it takes 20&#xD;
      minutes for lavender to be absorbed thought the skin and reach peak plasma levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery the patient will receive 4 drops of 50% solution lavender oil on the temple&#xD;
      region over the temporal artery every 2 hours until completion of surgery. This will be&#xD;
      applied by the anesthesia team. If the temporal region is not accessible the shoulders or&#xD;
      feet will be alternate locations of application. When the patient arrives to the recovery&#xD;
      room she will receive lavender oil through an oxygen mask. A 50 % solution will be used by&#xD;
      placing 4 drops of the lavender solution on the mask and wiping it around the mask with a&#xD;
      cotton ball. This delivery method will be used because this was used in a study from New York&#xD;
      University Medical Center studying postoperative pain and no adverse events occurred. When&#xD;
      the patient is on the post-operative floor she will receive 50 % lavender oil on the wrist&#xD;
      every 4 hours in the same manner as preoperatively from the hours of 6am to 9pm. Nightly&#xD;
      (9pm-6am), 8 drops of 50% lavender oil will be placed on the cotton ball situated within 20cm&#xD;
      of the patient. This method and concentration was chosen after reviewing a study in ischemic&#xD;
      heart patients in the intensive care unit. The patients received lavender at bedside on a&#xD;
      cotton ball and had statistically significant better sleep quality. The control group will&#xD;
      have the current standard of care with no lavender intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation will be monitored in the&#xD;
      preoperative area before lavender is given and 30 minutes after it is given. The level of&#xD;
      pain will also be asked prior to application and at the second set of vitals. The control&#xD;
      group will get two sets of vital measurements and pain scale measurements without any&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same vitals will be recorded while the patient is under anesthesia every 30 minutes.&#xD;
      There will be a notation in the chart when lavender is given to correlate time from&#xD;
      application to time of vitals recorded. A review of the electronic medical record will be&#xD;
      done to record amount of narcotic needed interop in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the recovery room after the patient is given lavender through the oxygen mask the same&#xD;
      vital signs and pain score measurement will be taken 15, 30, and 60 minutes from lavender&#xD;
      application. In the control group on arrival to the recovery room the same data points will&#xD;
      be measured with the same time intervals with no intervention. The amount of narcotic needed&#xD;
      in the recovery room will be taken from the electronic medical record for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively on the floor vital signs as noted above will be recorded every 4 hours. At&#xD;
      each 4 hour interval after the vital signs are taken lavender will be applied to the&#xD;
      experimental group and no intervention in the control group. One more set of vitals signs&#xD;
      will be recorded 45min after application of lavender each time lavender is applied. There&#xD;
      will be a review of narcotic use from the electronic medical record from both groups. There&#xD;
      will be a notation when lavender was given to correlate lavender application and narcotic&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anxiety questionnaire will be given preop before the application of lavender and then&#xD;
      daily for every post-op day they stay. The questionnaire is called the hospital anxiety and&#xD;
      depression scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sleep questionnaire will be given in preop before application of lavender and then daily&#xD;
      for every post-op day they stay. The sleep questionnaire is called the Richard Campbell Sleep&#xD;
      Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily starting on postop day 1 the patient will also record their level of satisfaction of&#xD;
      pain control from a scale of 1-10 with 1 being not satisfied and 10 being satisfied. Patients&#xD;
      typically stay in hospital 1-3 days post-op. A survey will be filled out daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis &amp; Statistical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design/Endpoints: The primary outcome will be a difference in pain scores between the 2&#xD;
      groups and/or decrease in narcotic use and/or increased patient satisfaction of pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are better sleep and decreased anxiety. The secondary outcome will be a&#xD;
      difference in scores from the two surveys, the Richards Campbell sleep questionnaire and the&#xD;
      Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytic Plan and Method: Differences in the change scores of pain in the two groups as well&#xD;
      any other demographic and clinical continuous variables will be examined using t-test or&#xD;
      Wilcoxon test, depending on whether the variables are normally or non-normally distributed&#xD;
      respectively. The differences between the categorical variables will be examined using&#xD;
      chi-squared or Fisher's exact test. Analysis will be conducted under the intention to treat&#xD;
      (ITT). Missing data will be imputed under multiple imputation methods. Differences in the&#xD;
      outcomes while controlling for potential covariates (age, etc) will be examined using linear&#xD;
      regression. Significance of the tests will be assessed at alpha = 0.05. Analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC.).&#xD;

This 14-component scoring system is used to tabulate a total sum score (0-42) or separate anxiety and depression scores (0-21). A higher score represents a more severe degree of anxiety and/or depression. The severity of a patient's anxiety or depression may then be grouped into three categories based on the score (Normal, 0-7; Borderline abnormal, 8-10; Abnormal 11-21).</description>
