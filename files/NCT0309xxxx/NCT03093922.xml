    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare any good and bad effects the study drug atezolizumab&#xD;
      has on the cancer when combined with the standard chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine and&#xD;
      cisplatin (or GC) in two different dosing schedules: chemotherapy (GC) before atezolizumab&#xD;
      vs. GC after atezolizumab.&#xD;
