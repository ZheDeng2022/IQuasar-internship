      The embryologist will oad the embryos into the catheter at the right position, then the&#xD;
      catheter will be slowly pushed through the cervical canal, 1-2 cm beneath the fundus 5.5 cm&#xD;
      away from the cervical external os.The embryos will be delivered by pushing the plunger of&#xD;
      the syringe from the mid-cavitary positioned catheter and keeping the plunger pushed down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Group: The catheter will be pulled back slowly and without rotation with the plunger&#xD;
      still pushed forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: The catheter will be pulled back slowly with a 360°rotation with the plunger&#xD;
      kept pushed forward.&#xD;

      Patients to be included will be those meeting the study criteria who present at Istanbul&#xD;
      Zeynep Kamil Training and Research Hospital, In vitro fertilization unit between February 1,&#xD;
      2017 and August, 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The voluntary participants of the study will undergo controlled ovarian stimulation that is&#xD;
      routinely performed in our clinic, followed by ovum pick up (OPU) and embryo transfer&#xD;
      procedure. Volunteers will be asked to hold the urine 2 hours before the procedure to ensure&#xD;
      fullness of the bladder. Identification details will be checked to verify that the names on&#xD;
      the embryo containers are correct. The embryos will be examined by the embryologist. The&#xD;
      participants will be informed before the procedure about the fertilization rates, number and&#xD;
      quality of the developed embryos, the number of embryos to be transferred and the number of&#xD;
      embryos planned to be frozen. Patients will undergo the procedure in the lithotomy&#xD;
      position.The fullness of the bladder will be verified by inserting a speculum cervix and the&#xD;
      vagina will be cleaned with a sterile serum physiological saline solution (SF) sponge, and&#xD;
      cervical mucus aspired from the external os gently with a special soft aspirator catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the cervix is cleaned with culture liquid, a trial transfer will be performed with a&#xD;
      sterile catheter. At this stage, only the soft internal catheter will pass through the&#xD;
      internal os and the outer sheath will be stopped when it reaches the internal os. The outer&#xD;
      sheath of the catheter will be advanced 2 cm into the cervical canal under ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance and will be stopped before passing the internal os. Once it is ensured that the soft&#xD;
      catheter is inside the endometrial cavity, the embryologist will be informed of the&#xD;
      appropriate catheter position. Embryologist will oad the embryos into the catheter at the&#xD;
      right position, then the catheter will be slowly pushed through the cervical canal, 1-2 cm&#xD;
      beneath the fundus 5.5 cm away from the cervical external os. The embryos will be delivered&#xD;
      by pushing the plunger of the syringe from the mid-cavitary positioned catheter and keeping&#xD;
      the plunger pushed down. Afterwards, the volunteers will be randomly divided into two groups.&#xD;
      Randomization will be ensured by a computer-based programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1st Group Volunteers: The catheter will be pulled back slowly and without rotation with&#xD;
           the plunger still pushed forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2nd GroupVolunteers:The catheter will be pulled back slowly with a 360° rotation with&#xD;
           the plunger kept pushed forward. The speculum will remain in the cervix until the&#xD;
           embryologist checks the catheter for the presence of any embryos, blood or mucus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters to be Reviewed: Age, weight, height of the participants, primary/secondary&#xD;
      infertility, infertility duration, presence of additional diseases, gravida, parity, abortion&#xD;
      history, endometrial thickness on the day of HCG, infertility reasons, baseline and total&#xD;
      gonadotropin dose, stimulation period, number of collected oocytes, number of M2 oocytes,&#xD;
      quality of transferred embryos, BhCG positivity&#xD;
