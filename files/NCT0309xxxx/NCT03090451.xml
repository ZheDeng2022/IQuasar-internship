  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with type 1 diabetes often find exercise very difficult to manage, because of the high&#xD;
      risk for low blood glucose levels. This can occur very quickly once exercise starts and&#xD;
      presents many risks for subjects, such as severe symptoms, confusion, passing out, seizures,&#xD;
      and even coma or death in very severe cases. Preventing low blood glucose levels during and&#xD;
      after exercise is important because physical exercise is a key component of managing&#xD;
      diabetes. It is often hard to correctly adjust insulin infusion rates or doses before&#xD;
      exercise as the relationship between exercise and changes in glucose levels in those who have&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes is still not fully understood. Therefore, the investigators propose this&#xD;
      study to further our understanding in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to help separate the effects of insulin from those of muscle work&#xD;
      (non-insulin effects) on the changes in blood glucose levels during aerobic exercise. The&#xD;
      main hypothesis is that the non-insulin effects occur quickly during exercise and account for&#xD;
      the rapid change in blood glucose levels once aerobic exercise begins. These effects can be&#xD;
      separated from the slower changes in insulin sensitivity that occur because of exercise, and&#xD;
      which account for reduced insulin demand even after exercise has stopped. The investigators&#xD;
      will investigate the effects of both moderate and intense aerobic exercise at different&#xD;
      levels of insulin in the body to help separate the insulin and non-insulin effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to recruit 26 subjects to take part in this study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly divided into two groups, with 13 in each group. Group 1 will undergo moderate&#xD;
      aerobic exercise, while group 2 will undergo intense aerobic exercise. Each subject will&#xD;
      repeat the exercise study three times on three separate days at least 2 weeks apart, while&#xD;
      having insulin infused at a low, a medium, and a high rate. Subjects will have an IV line&#xD;
      placed in each arm, one for drawing blood relatively frequently during the study, and another&#xD;
      for infusion of insulin, glucose, and a special glucose tracer (non-radioactive). Each study&#xD;
      lasts about 9 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information from this study will be used to help develop a mathematical model of how glucose&#xD;
      changes during exercise in type 1 diabetes. Such a model of type 1 diabetes and exercise will&#xD;
      be very useful for adjusting insulin doses in patients who use multiple daily injections of&#xD;
      insulin, and can help to guide an automated insulin delivery system, such as the artificial&#xD;
      pancreas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus afflicts close to 10% of our population and 5% of those with diabetes have&#xD;
      type 1, which is defined by an absolute deficiency of insulin. The need for managing diabetes&#xD;
      is critical, given the economic burden of this disease, with over $175 billion dollars in&#xD;
      direct health care costs, and almost another $70 billion in indirect costs for disability and&#xD;
      work loss. The personal impact is equally as important for people with this disease, as&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of blindness, the need for kidney dialysis, and&#xD;
      non-traumatic amputations in the United States. Type 2 diabetes is associated with reduced&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity and the metabolic syndrome, and dietary modification and exercise are&#xD;
      important components in the management of underlying insulin resistance. However, these&#xD;
      lifestyle strategies are also important in type 1 diabetes for many reasons: 1) type 1&#xD;
      diabetes subjects now live into adulthood, when insulin resistance and obesity become factors&#xD;
      for glycemic control, 2) latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood (LADA) represents a &quot;mixed&quot;&#xD;
      form of autoimmune diabetes where some type 2 diabetes characteristics such as insulin&#xD;
      resistance can exist, and 3) dietary modification and exercise remain effective means for&#xD;
      management of acute hyperglycemia and, in the longer term, HbA1c, potentially reducing the&#xD;
      risk of microvascular complications. Therefore, the need for exercise is still evident in&#xD;
      subjects with type 1 diabetes to maintain good glycemic control and to prevent complications&#xD;
      from developing. However, exercise is challenging for people with T1D to manage. Exercise&#xD;
      causes increased insulin sensitivity along with rapid uptake of glucose by muscle and other&#xD;
      tissues within the body, leading to a sharp decline in glucose levels and hypoglycemia as&#xD;
      shown by other groups as well as ours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Without adjustments in insulin for exercise, hypoglycemia is common in persons with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes. In a study of 48 individuals with T1D, with no adjustments to insulin, who exercise&#xD;
      for 60 min at a moderate intensity, glucose levels dropped on average by 40%, with 52% of&#xD;
      subjects falling to 70 mg/dL or below. Despite this clear need for insulin adjustments for&#xD;
      exercise, there are no uniform recommendations on how to dose insulin around the time of&#xD;
      exercise. In 2006, the DirecNet Study Group published a study on the impact of suspending&#xD;
      basal insulin at the start of exercise in 40 children with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump&#xD;
      therapy. This intervention significantly reduced hypoglycemia (from 43% to 16%), but much&#xD;
      more commonly resulted in hyperglycemia (increased from 4% to 23%). Schiavon and Cobelli et&#xD;
      al addressed this issue of how to best adjust insulin for exercise using in silico&#xD;
      simulations. Adjusting insulin doses in the in silico environment decreased hypoglycemia from&#xD;
      88% to 16% of patients when a universal adjustment was applied, and to 4% when an individual&#xD;
      adjustment was applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study described within this protocol is designed to disambiguate the impact of exercise&#xD;
      on insulin and non-insulin mediated effects on glycemic control. To achieve this, the&#xD;
      investigators will perform a series of stable glucose tracer studies in which subjects will&#xD;
      be fasting for about 8 hours and will undergo aerobic exercise at a moderate and intense&#xD;
      level for 45 minutes while insulin rates are clamped at a low (subject's basal rate), medium&#xD;
      (basal x 1.5), and high (basal x 3) insulin infusion rate. Subject's basal rates will be&#xD;
      obtained from injected basal insulin amounts, such as NPH/glargine/detemir, or basal rates in&#xD;
      those who use insulin pumps and will be adjusted for the HbA1c, as described in the OHSU AP&#xD;
      system. Di-deuterated glucose (6,6-2H2-glucose) which is not radioactive and which can be&#xD;
      metabolized via usual pathways in the human body will be the stable tracer. Each subject per&#xD;
      arm will undergo 3 10-hour studies while blood glucose, insulin, and glucagon levels are&#xD;
      captured throughout the study, and catecholamine and fatty acid levels are captured during&#xD;
      and just after the exercise period, as outlined below. Glucose tracer levels will be measured&#xD;
      at OHSU through the Bioanalytical Shared Resource/PK core lab, and calculation of rate of&#xD;
      appearance (Ra) and rate of disappearance (Rd) of glucose will be performed by our colleagues&#xD;
      at McGill University using a non-steady state model of glucose dynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained from this study will inform an updated model of glucose regulation in type&#xD;
      1 diabetes, providing exercise as an input to the model, which will be utilized in a model&#xD;
      predictive control (MPC) system for managing type 1 diabetes. Such a system can be used to&#xD;
      deliver insulin and/or glucagon to manage glycemic changes during and outside of exercise.&#xD;
