  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The critically ill polytrauma patient is one of the most complex cases with regard to the&#xD;
      optimization of the intensive care, anesthesia, as well as postoperative management. One of&#xD;
      the most important steps in the complex management of such patients is the modulation of&#xD;
      anesthesia and the volemic resuscitation, especially in the first hours post-trauma, and in&#xD;
      the operating room admission. We start with the assumptions that the optimization of&#xD;
      anesthesia should depend on each patient, being conducted in an individual manner. We also&#xD;
      believe that by individualizing the anesthesia by monitoring the entropy and SPI it is&#xD;
      possible to obtain an appropriate management regarding resuscitation and volume replacement.&#xD;
      Furthermore it assumes that an adequate anesthesia, and resuscitation singled volume&#xD;
      replacement can reduce morbidity and mortality rates as well as the period of stay in the ICU&#xD;
      and recovery time.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project aims to aid to the Romanian healthcare system, by assuring new modernized&#xD;
      monitoring equipment, specific for the department of anaesthesia and intensive care, for both&#xD;
      clinical and paraclinical data, as well as for the existing information for modulation and&#xD;
      optimizing of the general anaesthesia used in critically ill polytrauma cases based on modern&#xD;
      techniques, such as entropy, and surgical pleth index (SPI). In this way, it aims to create a&#xD;
      new prospect of developing a model, which will help the physicians in the decision-making&#xD;
      process, hoping to improve the stats in the high morbidity and mortality rates in this&#xD;
      specific field of medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reducing the mortality and increasing the quality of the provided medical services is&#xD;
      possible by assuring a modern monitoring system, because critically ill patients should be&#xD;
      observed through complex techniques. Furthermore, interpretation and timely synthesis of the&#xD;
      biological signals and their correlation with other clinical and laboratory data are useful&#xD;
      in modulating general anesthesia in the critically conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General objectives comprise of developing a new research field regarding the international&#xD;
      standards of research and combating the economic and social needs of Romania and Europe, by&#xD;
      creating a complete protocol, which is innovative and helpful in improving the mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity index for polytrauma patients admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU), by means&#xD;
      of better monitoring procedures and modulating the anaesthesia and therapeutic management,&#xD;
      therefore increasing the efficiency of the public health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of the study are to represent the integration of modern anesthesia&#xD;
      methods used for monitoring and optimizing the management of anesthesia and therapy options,&#xD;
      depending on each patient as an individual; calculating the severity scores and risk factors,&#xD;
      both in the first 24 hours as well as continuously, providing support instruments designed to&#xD;
      add to the medical decision making process, and make it possible in a very short time,&#xD;
      developing an ergonomic mode, dynamic and standardized viewing of local and distant&#xD;
      perioperative anesthetic protocols, modulated by non-invasive modern techniques for&#xD;
      anaesthesia monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients enrolled in the study will have a monitoring sheet from the start, which&#xD;
      will contain details regarding the following: a) Demographic data: age, sex, BMI (registered&#xD;
      at the time of admission); b) Clinical data: ASA score, ISS score, APACHE II score, trauma&#xD;
      mechanism, type of surgical intervention (registered at the time of admission); c) Laboratory&#xD;
      data: EAB parameters, complete blood count, fibrinogen, ESR, PCR, total bilirubin (T0 -&#xD;
      before orotracheal intubation, T1 - at extubating, T2 - at 24 hours post-operatively, T0 -&#xD;
      before orotracheal intubation, T2 - at 24 hours post-operatively; d) Clinical parameters:&#xD;
      heart rate, mean blood pressure, SpO2 plethysmography, EtCO2 capnography, entropy, SPI,&#xD;
      axillary skin temperature probe, diuresis (T0 - before orotracheal intubation, at an interval&#xD;
      of 15 minutes perioperative, T1 - at extubating); e) Perioperative events: hypotension,&#xD;
      bradycardia, bronchospams, SpO2 drop (desaturation) lower than 90% via pulse oximetry (Every&#xD;
      event should be noted in the monitoring sheet of the study); f) Events related to intubation:&#xD;
      laryngospasms, failed intubation, tissue injury resulting from difficult intubating&#xD;
      conditions, postoperative airway complications due to difficult intubation (Every event&#xD;
      should be noted in the monitoring sheet of the study). The database officer should register&#xD;
      all the patient data relevant for the study in electronic format including all details noted&#xD;
      in the monitoring sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For statistically analysis of the study, in concordance to these objectives, a series of&#xD;
      statistical tests were utilized which can satisfy all the statistical objectives of the&#xD;
      study. For analysis if the normal distributions of continuous data, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov&#xD;
      test will be utilized. Similarly, data with a normal distribution were compared using the&#xD;
      Student t test and presented as mean with SD. Last but not the least, data with an&#xD;
      inhomogeneous distribution will be compared using the Mann-Whitney U test and presented as&#xD;
      median. Nominal data will be compared using the chi-square test. For highlighting the&#xD;
      statistical differences, a P value less than 0.05 was considered as significant. The&#xD;
      statistical analysis of data will be performed computerized with the programs Microsoft&#xD;
      Office Excel for Mac 2011 v.14.4.7. (Microsoft Corporation, Bucharest, Romania) and Prism 6&#xD;
      for Mac OS X v.6.0. (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). This analysis consisted, in the&#xD;
      calculation of frequencies and the percentages for qualitative variables, as well as the&#xD;
      calculation of the arithmetic means and the standard deviations for quantitative variables.&#xD;
      The statistical estimation of the results was performed using the criteria decision of the&#xD;
      statistical test. Similarly, the lot will be further statistically analyzed for determining&#xD;
      the heterogeneity/homogeneity in between the groups. Similarly, for increasing in the&#xD;
      transparency between the different groups, patients will be divided into more groups, as&#xD;
      presented in this study.&#xD;
