    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the radiographic, histological and clinical comparisons of the&#xD;
      completely autologous T-PRF or allograft effectiveness at the maxillary sinus elevation&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants randomly divided into 2 groups and the test group had a Schneiderian membrane&#xD;
      elevation with using balloon lifting technique and after that sinus was filled with T-PRF&#xD;
      produced from the patients' blood and 4 months waiting period has been entered. At the end of&#xD;
      the 4th month, the bone samples were received from the implant slots and sent to histological&#xD;
      evaluation. After 3 months, implant stability was measured and recorded. In the control&#xD;
      group, the same procedures were followed and sinus was filled with only allograft. Waiting&#xD;
      period was changed to 6 months for this group.&#xD;

    <description>Blood samples were collected from the each participant's arm in the test group by 20 ml syringe and then was transferred into 10ml grade IV titanium tube without anticoagulant. After centrifugation of blood samples (2800 rpm, 12 minutes) at room temperature, the T-PRF clot was removed from the tubes with sterile tweezers. 6 blood tubes were collected for a sinus floor elevation/lifting operation and 6 T-PRFs were prepared for each participant.</description>
