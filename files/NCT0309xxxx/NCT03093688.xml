  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invariant Natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a unique subset of lymphocytes that express&#xD;
      homogeneous TCR recognizing KRN7000 which was up-regulated by many kinds of cancer cells.&#xD;
      PD-1+CD8+T cells of patients with advanced tumor are most likely tumor-specified. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that immunotherapy strategy of infusion of iNKT cells and PD-1+CD8+T cells may&#xD;
      decrease the tumor burden and improve overall survival. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the safety and efficacy of treatment of patients with advanced solid tumor by infusing&#xD;
      of iNKT cells and PD-1+CD8+T cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of patients with advance solid tumor is great unsolved challenge to the physicians.&#xD;
      Efficacy of conventional treatment, such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy is&#xD;
      limited. AS novel therapy, immunotherapy shows great prospects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human iNKT cells can directly lysis tumor cells by a perforin-dependent mechanism,and&#xD;
      intracellular granzyme B expression may also potentiate cell killing. Tumor cells expressing&#xD;
      CD1d may be especially susceptible to direct NKT cell lysis. iNKT cells play important role&#xD;
      in immune regulation by secreting various cytokines. PD-1+CD8+T cells are most likely&#xD;
      tumor-specific in patient with advanced tumor. Expansion method of iNKT cells and PD-1+CD8+T&#xD;
      cells in vitro is developed as published in our patent. Infusions of iNKT cells and CD8+T&#xD;
      cell have been proved safe in mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical trial, the safety and efficacy of the immunotherapy of infusion of iNKT&#xD;
      cells and CD8+T cells are assessed.&#xD;
