  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive, Phase II/III study in 2 parts (i.e. Part 1 (dose ranging) and Part 2&#xD;
      (Hypothesis testing)). NaBen® is granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by US FDA as&#xD;
      treatment for refractory schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 Objectives: There are two primary objectives for Part 1 of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate, in terms of dose-response, the effectiveness of NaBen® (1000 and 2000&#xD;
           mg/day) compared to Placebo (0 mg/day), when combined with clozapine, in improving the&#xD;
           residual symptoms associated with refractory schizophrenia in adults, and; to determine&#xD;
           the optimal dose to be used in Part 2 of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sample size re-assessment to evaluate the final sample size needed to proceed with Part&#xD;
           2 of the study The secondary objective of the Part 1 of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
           safety and tolerability of NaBen® (1000 and 2000 mg/day) compared to Placebo (0 mg/day),&#xD;
           in combination with clozapine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 Objectives: The primary objective of the Part 2 of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of NaBen® (at the optimal dose determined in the Part 1 of this study) compared&#xD;
      to Placebo (0 mg/day), when combined with clozapine, in improving the residual symptoms&#xD;
      associated with refractory schizophrenia in adults. The secondary objective of the Part 2 of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of NaBen® (at the optimal dose&#xD;
      determined in the Part 1 of this study) compared to Placebo (0 mg/day), in combination with&#xD;
      clozapine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II/III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-part, dose-finding,&#xD;
      Multi-center study, in which subjects with refractory schizophrenia will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1 (i.e. dose finding portion) of the study One hundred seventy one (171) subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio (NaBen® 2000 mg/day: NaBen® 1000 mg/day: Placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects, after signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF), will be assessed during the&#xD;
      screening phase. This screening phase is designed to exclude subjects who have had more than&#xD;
      20 percent reduction in the PANSS total score using PANSS score evaluations at Visit 1 and&#xD;
      Visit 2. Only those subjects who successfully complete the screening phase and still meet the&#xD;
      study eligibility criteria will proceed with Randomization and the double-blind treatment.&#xD;
      All randomized subjects will receive eight (8) weeks of randomized treatment (NaBen® 2000&#xD;
      mg/day, NaBen® 1000 mg/day or Placebo). Study treatments will be given twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Interim Analysis (IA) will be conducted when 171 subjects in Part 1 of the study have been&#xD;
      randomized and completed 8 weeks of treatment or early terminated, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
      Randomization of subjects in the study will continue until the IA of the Part 1 data is&#xD;
      completed. The data from the Part 1 analysis will be reviewed by an independent Data Safety&#xD;
      and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) who would assess the data for both safety and efficacy&#xD;
      trends. The DSMC responsibilities will be further elaborated in the DSMC charter. The DSMC&#xD;
      will approve continuation of the study and recommend the optimal dose and sample size&#xD;
      adjustment for the Part 2 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming no sample size adjustment was made as a result of the IA, for Part 2 of the study a&#xD;
      total of 116 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, of which 58 subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to the NaBen® optimal dose group and 58 subjects to the Placebo group. The&#xD;
      procedures and assessments for subjects in Part 1 and Part 2 of this study will be identical&#xD;
      with the exception of the randomization schema.&#xD;

             member, social worker, caseworker, or nurse) as determined by the Investigator and per&#xD;
             the local regulations. The identified caregiver should be considered reliable by the&#xD;
             Investigator and per the local regulations in providing support to the subject to help&#xD;
             ensure compliance with study treatment, study visits and protocol procedures who&#xD;
             preferably is also able to provide input helpful for completing study rating scales&#xD;
&#xD;
