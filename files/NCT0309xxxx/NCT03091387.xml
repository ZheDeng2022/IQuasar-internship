      Intubation and ventilation are lifesaving interventions in the neonatal intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU), especially among preterm, low birth weight babies. However, timely extubation is also&#xD;
      necessary. The decision to extubate usually depends on clinical judgement, appropriate blood&#xD;
      gas prior to extubation and low ventilator parameters. Approximately 40 % of babies'&#xD;
      extubated on the above criteria require re-intubation, suggesting that current methods to&#xD;
      predict extubation failure are insufficient. . Spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) has been&#xD;
      predominantly used in infants and children to access the readiness for extubation. Few&#xD;
      studies in premature neonates have also shown good sensitivity and specificity in predicting&#xD;
      extubation success. However its significance in our population is yet to be determined. We&#xD;
      aim to use this for both our preterm and term babies and if results are significant we plan&#xD;

      Intubation and ventilation are lifesaving interventions in the neonatal intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU), especially among preterm, low birth weight babies. However, timely extubation is also&#xD;
      necessary, in order to prevent adverse effects of prolonged intubation, such as iatrogenic&#xD;
      pneumothorax, superadded bacterial infections and colonization, subglottic injury and&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia1,2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For extubation to be successful, baby should maintain hemodynamic stability and O2 saturation&#xD;
      for at least 48 hours post-extubation. So far there are no standard guidelines, especially in&#xD;
      low resource countries such as ours, to predict successful extubation. The decision to&#xD;
      extubate usually depends on clinical judgement, appropriate blood gas prior to extubation and&#xD;
      low ventilator parameters3. Intensivists may vary in their experience and training, resulting&#xD;
      in a large variation in the timing and outcome of extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research from high income settings indicates that approximately 40 % of babies extubated on&#xD;
      the above criteria require re-intubation, suggesting that current methods to predict&#xD;
      extubation failure are insufficient.3 Readiness for extubation can be objectively measured by&#xD;
      observing pulmonary functions, respiratory muscle strength, respiratory drive, ventilator&#xD;
      flow volumes and gas exchange.5,6 Re-intubation causes prolonged hospital stay, adversely&#xD;
      effects the family, and results in undesirable effects on the neonate4 . Therefore accurate&#xD;
      prediction of extubation failure in neonates is a high priority. Spontaneous breathing trial&#xD;
      (SBT) has been predominantly used in infant and children to access the readiness for&#xD;
      extubation . Few studies in premature neonates have also shown good sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity in predicting extubation sucess7.However its significance in our population is&#xD;
      yet to be determined. We aim to use this for both our preterm and term babies and if results&#xD;
      are significant we plan to include this as our routine pre extubation criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the usefulness of SBT, in predicting extubation failure among neonates admitted&#xD;
      to a NICU in a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the usefulness of ratio of spontaneous expired minute ventilation(VE) during&#xD;
           ET CPAP to VE during mechanical ventilation (V˙E ratio , )in predicting extubation&#xD;
           failure among neonates admitted to a NICU in a tertiary care hospital in Karachi,&#xD;
           Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the usefulness of VE during ETCPAP, in predicting extubation failure among&#xD;
           neonates admitted to a NICU in a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Prospective validation study Study Setting: NICU, AKU Duration of study: 12&#xD;
      months Study Population: Neonates admitted to a tertiary care NICU in a low resource setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operational definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Expired Tidal volume(Vte) : volume of gas (ml) which moves out of the lung with each&#xD;
           breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Spontaneous Expired Minute ventilation(VE) : amount of gas spontaneously exhaled from&#xD;
           lungs in one minute. This is a product of Vte and respiratory rate. It is displayed in&#xD;
           real time on SLE 5000 ventilator. Normal values for full term babies is 200-400&#xD;
           ml/kg/min whereas 200-300 ml /kg/min for preterm babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. VE Ratio: Et cpapVE/Vent VE Sampling technique: Consecutive sampling Sample size:&#xD;
           Assuming SBT to have 95% sensitivity and 73% specificity for predicting extubation&#xD;
           sucess7 , and presuming that 30% of neonates will fail extubation, we will require 45&#xD;
           neonates in each group to obtain 95% CIs of ±3%. The sample size will be inflated by 20%&#xD;
           to accommodate for differences in re-intubation practice. Therefore 55 neonates in each&#xD;
           group will be enrolled in the study. This sample size is sufficient to also detect a&#xD;
           difference of 1 SD in mean VE in the group failing extubation, assuming an overall mean&#xD;
           VE of 300ml/kg/min (power 80%and twotail αof 0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification and recruitment of neonates:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An NICU fellow not involved in the clinical management of the baby will maintain a log of all&#xD;
      neonates who are planned to be extubated. Eligibility assessment will be done by the fellow&#xD;
      who will then approach the neonate's family for consent. Care will be taken to ensure that&#xD;
      consent is voluntary. Refusal of consent will not lead to any change in the management. A&#xD;
      baseline questionnaire will be filled, including demographic information such as post -natal&#xD;
      age, gender, gestational age, current weight etc. Information related to the clinical&#xD;
      indication of extubation, other medications given will be recorded. Eligible candidates will&#xD;
      be divided into two groups of &lt;1.5kg weight and &gt;1.5kg weight. Separate log will be&#xD;
      maintained for both groups. Total of 55 enrolments will be made in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be according to SOP. Questionnaires are attached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Index Maneuver:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrolment, Nicu SBT study fellow will observe and record clinical data and patient&#xD;
      demographics on a predefined proforma. Vitals, including heart rate, respiratory rate,&#xD;
      ventilator parameters and respiratory volumes will be recorded by same observer for 3 minutes&#xD;
      at 30 second intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 minutes the baby will be shifted to ET CPAP mode on the same ventilator and the same&#xD;
      parameters will be rerecorded at 30 sec interval for 3 minutes as done previously. A&#xD;
      regularly serviced and authorized stop watch will be used to monitor the time and all&#xD;
      parameters will be recorded from the Mindray (IPM12) monitors and SLE 5000 ventilator. The&#xD;
      clinical teams caring for the patients will not be present during the maneuver and all the&#xD;
      babies will be extubated as per the primary teams plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for stopping the index maneuver:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bradycardia (Heart rate &lt;100bpm) for &gt;15 seconds and/or oxygen Saturation of &lt;85% even after&#xD;
      15 % increase in Fi02 from the baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up and outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes of extubation will be recorded separately after 48 hours. The reasons for&#xD;
      re-intubation will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBT maneuver will be performed by a fellow not involved in the clinical team. The clinical&#xD;
      team will be blinded to the results of the SBT. The success and failure of SBT will be&#xD;
      determined by the principal investigator, who will be blinded to the outcome of the&#xD;
      extubation, after the completion of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBT Results: SBT will be labeled as failed if the criteria for stopping the index maneuver&#xD;
      were applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analysis for both groups will be performed for continuous variables like age,&#xD;
      weight , gestational age , chronological age using means with SD and medians with&#xD;
      interquartile ranges as appropriate. For categorical variables e.g. gender, frequencies and&#xD;
      proportions will be reported. Multiple logistic regression will be done to identify factors&#xD;
      predicting SBT failure in each group. P value of &lt; 0.05 will be taken as significant..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LR will be calculated using area under curve (AUC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analysis for secondary outcomes will be performed in different gestational age and&#xD;
      weight categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous outcomes will be compared using student's t test when normally distributed and by&#xD;
      Mann-whitney U test when skewed. Categorical data will be assessed using the chi square test&#xD;
      and fisher two tailed exact test where indicated. The ability of the outcome (SBT, VE, VE&#xD;
      ratio) variables to accurately discriminate between successful and failed extubation will be&#xD;
      assessed using receiver operating curves(ROC) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent The informed consent will be confirmed with a signature or thumbprint by the&#xD;
      parent or the authorized guardian of the child. In the absence of a signature, a witness&#xD;
      (other than the member of the research team obtaining consent) will be asked to sign.&#xD;
      Finally, the member of the research team obtaining consent will sign this form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and Risks There is a potential risk of transient hemodynamic instability when&#xD;
      performing the SBT. That is why, safety net is in place to record heart rate and O2&#xD;
      saturation every 30 seconds. A trained nurse and neonatal fellow trained in NRP will be&#xD;
      available at the bedside during the procedure. The fellow performing the procedure is year&#xD;
      two with NRP certification. He will further be trained to immediately revert to the&#xD;
      ventilation mode if HR &lt; 100 beats per minute for &gt; 15 seconds and increase in Oxygen&#xD;
      requirement O2. This has been practiced in another study in an NICU by PG Davis et al in 2006&#xD;
      and shown to have no adverse effects7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vulnerable Populations Study population is neonates because the study involves optimizing&#xD;
      NICU care of neonates. Consent will be taken in Urdu to ensure that the potential participant&#xD;
      understands the research. Extra protection will be in place to ensure voluntary&#xD;
      participation. It will be explained that participation is voluntary and can be terminated by&#xD;
      the participant at any time without reason and without any penalty. If the potential&#xD;
      participant has any questions, they will be answered in their native language to ensure that&#xD;
      they understand the research and their potential role in it. The study personnel will not&#xD;
      influence the clinical team's decisions in caring for the neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality To ensure privacy, all the interviews will take place in a separate room.&#xD;
      Hard copies of the study-related forms will be stored in a locked cabinet in a storage room&#xD;
      under supervision of the principal investigators. Only approved study personnel will have&#xD;
      access to this information. After completion of the study, identifier information will be&#xD;
      stripped and only study IDs will be used during analysis. All identifier information will be&#xD;
      delinked and identifier information will be stored under lock and key.&#xD;
