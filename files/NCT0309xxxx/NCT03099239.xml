  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1 study is to determine the safety of one, two, and three&#xD;
      intravenous infusions of human umbilical cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells&#xD;
      (hCT-MSC), administered every two months, in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I, prospective, open-label trial designed to assess the safety of one,&#xD;
      two, and three intravenous doses of hCT-MSC in young children with ASD. Children ages two to&#xD;
      11 years with ASD will be eligible to participate. All participants will receive intravenous&#xD;
      infusion(s) of CTCs. The first cohort of three patients will receive a single dose. If there&#xD;
      are no safety concerns, the second cohort of three patients will receive two doses, given two&#xD;
      months apart. The third cohort will consist of six patients, each of whom will receive three&#xD;
      hCT-MSC infusions with a two-month interval between doses. All participants will have an&#xD;
      initial clinical evaluation to verify the diagnosis of ASD and confirm protocol eligibility.&#xD;
      The main endpoint is safety, for which acute infusion reactions and incidence of infections&#xD;
      will be assessed. ASD-specific outcome measures, described below, will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline and six months from baseline and results will be described.&#xD;
