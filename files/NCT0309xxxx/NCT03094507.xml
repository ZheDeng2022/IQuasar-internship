  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the levels of three HIV medications: dolutegravir,&#xD;
      darunavir and cobicistat in the blood after drug intake has been stopped, in order to&#xD;
      understand how long these drugs persist in the blood. The study will specifically look at&#xD;
      blood levels of these three drugs after taking them every day for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two groups. Participants in Group 1 will take dolutegravir everyday for 14&#xD;
      days, then nothing for 7 days, then dolutegravir and darunavir/cobicistat together for 14&#xD;
      days, nothing for 7 days, and then darunavir/cobicistat alone for 14 days. If participants go&#xD;
      into Group 2 they will begin with darunavir/cobicistat everyday for 14 days, then nothing for&#xD;
      7 days, then dolutegravir and darunavir/cobicistat together for 14 days, nothing for 7 days,&#xD;
      and then dolutegravir alone for 14 days. Drug levels for both groups will be measured on days&#xD;
      14, 35 and 56. If the participants decide to take part, the duration of the study will be up&#xD;
      to 57 days plus a screening visit which will take place up to 28 days prior to the start of&#xD;
      the study, and a follow up visit, which takes place 15 to 22 days after the last dose of&#xD;
      study medication. Eligible participants will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to group 1 or group 2.&#xD;
      Participants and the study doctor will know which study medications the participant is taking&#xD;
      at all times during the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, cross-over, open label study, which means that the participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the different arms of the study which receive different medications. The&#xD;
      participants and the study doctor will know which study medications the participant is taking&#xD;
      at all times during the study.This study will be conducted in a single site, in London.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the participant's involvement in the study will be up to 57 days plus a&#xD;
      screening visit up to 28 days prior to the start of the study, and a follow up visit 27 to 33&#xD;
      days after the last blood measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be asked to visit the clinic on up to 14 occasions, of which three&#xD;
      visits involve staying in the unit for approximately 12 hours (day 14,35 and 56).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken from the participants throughout the study to measure the levels&#xD;
      of dolutegravir, darunavir and cobicistat in blood. Blood and urine will also be collected&#xD;
      throughout the study for safety analysis; this is to ensure the participants are healthy to&#xD;
      take part or to continue taking part in the study. The total amount of blood collected from&#xD;
      each participant during the study will be approximately 500ml (just below a pint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with written information about the study in the form of a&#xD;
      participant information sheet and will be allowed adequate time for questions and to consider&#xD;
      the study before agreeing to participate. It will be the responsibility of the investigator&#xD;
      or the co-investigator to obtain written informed consent prior to undertaking any procedure&#xD;
      detailed in the protocol. As part of the consent procedure, participants will also be asked&#xD;
      consent to their personal details being entered into TOPS (the over-volunteering protection&#xD;
      system).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator or designee will provide adequate explanation of the aims, methods,&#xD;
      objectives and potential hazards of the study. They will also be explaining to the&#xD;
      participants that they are free to refuse or withdraw from the study for any reason without&#xD;
      detriment to their future care or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed description of each study visit follows below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening visit If the participant agrees to take part, they will firstly be asked to&#xD;
           sign the informed consent form and they will be given a copy to keep.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the visit the following assessments will be carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Demographic details&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Full medical, drug and social history&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Physical examination including weight, height, and vital signs (temperature, blood&#xD;
           pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
           • ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Chemistry panel&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Haematology with a differential and clotting screen&#xD;
&#xD;
           • HIV antibody testing&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Hepatitis B and C screening&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Urinalysis (macro analysis)&#xD;

           • Drug screen (urine)&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Pregnancy test (urine) for WOCBP (women of child-bearing potential)&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Registration of TOPS database&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Concomitant medications&#xD;
&#xD;
           GP verification of medical history: A medical history questionnaire will be sent to all&#xD;
           participants' GPs for verification of medical history. This information will be reviewed&#xD;
           by the Investigator as part of the medical history evaluation. If the completed&#xD;
           questionnaire is not received from the GP, then the available information regarding the&#xD;
           participant will be reviewed by the Investigator. The Investigator will assess this&#xD;
           information and decide whether they are sufficiently confident that the inclusion and&#xD;
           exclusion criteria are met and whether the participant may be enrolled into the study.&#xD;
           This decision must be documented in writing BEFORE the participant is dosed. Copies of&#xD;
           sent GP letters and returned confirmation of medical history will be filed in each&#xD;
           participant's source documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline Visit, Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will attend the Unit in the morning and will be asked to fast for 8 hours&#xD;
           overnight prior to attending. The following evaluations will be performed in the morning&#xD;

           A Tivicay® (dolutegravir) tablet will be administered with a standard breakfast, made up&#xD;
           according to instructions along with 240 ml of water. This will set the nominal time of&#xD;
           dosing. Subjects will be instructed to administer Tivicay® at home in the morning on all&#xD;
           other days (14 days in total) (with the exception of days 7, and 14, when the drug will&#xD;
           be administered in the PK Unit). Participants will be instructed to administer study&#xD;
           drugs in the morning within 15 min of standard breakfast.Participants will be given a&#xD;
           diet sheet giving examples of a standardised breakfast for them to have at home with the&#xD;
           study drug. They will be also reminded to take their study drug to the unit on day 14 as&#xD;
           they will take their last dose in the unit on that day.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group2:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A Rezolsta® (darunavir plus cobicistat) tablet will be administered with a standard&#xD;
           breakfast, made up according to instructions along with 240 ml of water. This will set&#xD;
           the nominal time of dosing. Subjects will be instructed to administer Rezolsta® at home&#xD;
           in the morning on all other days (14 days in total) (with the exception of days 7, and&#xD;
           14, when the drug will be administered in the PK Unit). Subjects will be instructed to&#xD;
           administer study drugs in the morning within 15 min of standard breakfast.Participants&#xD;
           will be given a diet sheet giving examples of a standardised breakfast for them to have&#xD;
           at home with the study drug. They will be also reminded to take their study drug to the&#xD;
           unit on day 14 as they will take their last dose in the unit on that day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Wash out periods (Days 15 to 21 and Days 36 to 42):Group 1 and 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      From days 15 to 21 and days 36 to 42, participants will be asked to stop taking their study&#xD;
      medication for a total of 7 days each time. These are the washout periods. 7) Intensive&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic Visits (Days 14, 35 and 56) Participants will be admitted to the unit in the&#xD;
      morning on days 14, 35 and 56 and will remain in the Unit for approximately 12 hours. They&#xD;
      will be asked to fast for 8 hours overnight prior to attending.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following evaluations will be performed in the morning of Days 14, 35 and 56, before&#xD;
      study medication dosing: Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and&#xD;
      respiratory rate) • Physical Examination (symptom directed)&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Blood samples will be collected for:Platelets function (to investigate how clotting&#xD;
           works in people taking anti-HIV medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial blood samples will be taken on 6 occasions over the day (pre-dose (within 10 minutes&#xD;
      before dosing), then 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hrs later) to measure the levels of study drugs in&#xD;
      their blood. A cannula will be placed in a vein in the participant's forearm to allow&#xD;
      repeated blood samples to be taken without having to repeatedly use a needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact time of intake of study medication will be recorded on the CRF. Participants should&#xD;
      remain in a semi- recumbent position until four hours post dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be able to leave the unit after the 12 hour sample to return the following&#xD;
      morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Tail Pharmacokinetic Visits (Day 15, 36 and 57)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be required to attend the unit for plasma drug concentration sampling. This&#xD;
      will occur at 24 hours post dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend on days 5, 36 and 57.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Follow up visit (day 84 to 90)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return to the unit on one occasion between days 80 to 90 inclusive and&#xD;
      undergo the following evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Haematology with a differential and clotting screen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemistry panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of AEs&#xD;
&#xD;
           10) Early termination visit In case of early termination, participants will attend the&#xD;
           unit for an early termination visit within one week (or otherwise as the investigator&#xD;
           believes appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this visit the following evaluations will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Haematology with a differential and clotting screen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemistry panel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant medications and adverse event check The reason for the early termination of&#xD;
           the participant will be clearly documented on the participant's CRF. The participant&#xD;
           will not then be required to attend for a follow up visit unless deemed necessary in the&#xD;
           opinion of the investigator (e.g. due to adverse event follow up).&#xD;
