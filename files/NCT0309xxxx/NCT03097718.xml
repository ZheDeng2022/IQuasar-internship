      This project aims to elucidate neural correlates of proprioceptive deficits in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent non-specific low back pain, by studying whether brain activation patterns during&#xD;
      the processing of proprioceptive signals from the ankle muscles and lower back muscles are&#xD;
      altered compared to healthy control subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a highly prevalent health condition, with a reported lifetime prevalence of&#xD;
      up to 84% worldwide. Currently, it induces more disability than any other health condition,&#xD;
      such as depression, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other musculoskeletal&#xD;
      disorders. Approximately 85% of all low back pain complaints are non-specific, meaning that&#xD;
      the pain cannot be attributed to a recognizable specific pathology such as an infection or&#xD;
      vertebral fracture. While many patients with low back pain recover within a month, a large&#xD;
      number of patients report a recurrence within one year. Current treatment interventions often&#xD;
      remain unsuccessful, which highlights the current lack of knowledge on the underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms of non-specific low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postural control deficits have been identified as a key factor in the development and&#xD;
      recurrence of non-specific low back pain. To achieve optimal postural control, the central&#xD;
      nervous system needs to process, integrate and weigh proprioceptive signals from different&#xD;
      body regions (e.g. ankle muscles and lower back muscles) with vestibular and visual inputs.&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that patients with non-specific low back pain have a decreased&#xD;
      ability to optimally weigh proprioceptive signals during standing, which leads to reduced&#xD;
      postural robustness compared to pain-free individuals. More specifically, patients with low&#xD;
      back pain dominantly rely more on proprioceptive signals from the ankle muscles and are not&#xD;
      able to up-weigh proprioceptive signals from the lower back muscles when needed. This might&#xD;
      be due to an impaired central processing of proprioceptive signals. However, up to now no&#xD;
      studies have investigated central proprioceptive processing in patients with recurrent&#xD;
      non-specific low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this project aims to elucidate whether patients with recurrent non-specific low&#xD;
      back pain showed altered brain activation patterns during the processing of proprioceptive&#xD;
      signals from the ankle muscles and lower back muscles compared to healthy controls, by&#xD;
      applying local muscle vibration during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&#xD;

    <description>Brain activation during the processing of proprioceptive signals originating in the ankle muscles (soleus muscle) and lumbar paraspinal muscles (multifidus muscles) is studied by applying muscle vibration to these muscles during fMRI. The test subjects participate in one scanning session, during which three fMRI runs with ankle muscle vibration and three fMRI runs with lumbar paraspinal muscles vibration are made in alternating order. Each fMRI run consists of three conditions: 'muscle vibration at 60 Hz' that stimulates muscle proprioceptors and vibrotactile skin receptors, 'muscle vibration at 20 Hz' that stimulates vibrotactile skin receptors (serves as a control condition) and 'rest'. During each fMRI run, the two 'vibration' conditions are presented three times during 18s-long blocks. Each' vibration' block is followed by a 18s-long 'rest' block.</description>
