  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coagulation dysfunction is frequent in septic patients and it is associated with an increase&#xD;
      risk of mortality. During sepsis platelets number usually decreases and their function is&#xD;
      reduced and this mechanism is sustained by an inflammatory induced coagulopathy. Some recent&#xD;
      studies evaluated the possibility to use viscoelastic whole blood tests of the haemostasis,&#xD;
      such as thromboelastography (TEG), which analyze all blood components and their interactions&#xD;
      during clot formation and dissolution and might be useful for assessing bleeding risk in&#xD;
      septic patients. Maximun amplitude (MA) is one of the variables obtained from TEG analysis&#xD;
      and it expresses the strength of the clot and the efficacy of platelet function. A low level&#xD;
      of MA describes a lower strength of the clot determined by a lower number or a reduced&#xD;
      function of platelet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether a lower level of MA and a pattern of&#xD;
      hypocoagulability might be associated with an increased risk of bleeding and need of&#xD;
      transfusion in patients with sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to conduct a prospective multicenter observational study, enrolling 100 consecutive&#xD;
      adults patients with sepsis. We will exclude patients under 18 years old of age, chronic use&#xD;
      of oral anticoagulant and anti platelet treatment, hematologic malignancy, congenital&#xD;
      bleeding disorders, oral contraceptives, lack of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point To evaluate whether a lower level of MA might be associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points: to evaluate whether a different level of MA correlates with the&#xD;
      biomarker of the severity of sepsis such as presepsin, with the biomarker of the severity of&#xD;
      infection and whether a pattern of hypocoagulability might be associated with a risk of&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled patients will undergo a blood sample at admission (T0), after 72 hours (T1) and&#xD;
      after 7 days (T2) and all the following parameters will be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet count, APTT, PT, INR, fibrinogen, procalcitonin and presepsin .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, all viscoelastic parameters (reaction time (R), clot formation speed (K), angle&#xD;
      (alpha) and maximum amplitude (MA)) will be performed at bedside, at T0, T1, T2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements: Intensive Care Unit Length of Stay and mortality at 28 days and at 90&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coagulation dysfunction is frequent in patients with severe sepsis and it is associated with&#xD;
      an increase risk of mortality. During sepsis platelets number usually decreases and their&#xD;
      function is reduced and this mechanism is sustained by an inflammatory induced coagulopathy.&#xD;
      Several studies have showed a correlation between altered function of platelets and sepsis&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional coagulation tests such as activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT),&#xD;
      prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) were developed mainly to&#xD;
      monitor anticoagulation treatment and may not fully reflect the complex in vivo coagulation&#xD;
      disturbances that usually characterizes sepsis. More recently some studies evaluated the&#xD;
      possibility to use viscoelastic whole blood tests of the haemostasis, such as&#xD;
      thromboelastography (TEG) and thromboelastometry (ROTEM), which analyze all blood components&#xD;
      and their interactions during clot formation and dissolution and might be useful for&#xD;
      assessing bleeding risk in septic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more recent study identified a possible hypocoagulability pattern among septic patients at&#xD;
      risk of bleeding using TEG variable and the authors found a strong correlation with increased&#xD;
      risk of death. Maximun amplitude (MA) is one of the variables obtained from TEG analysis and&#xD;
      it expresses the strength of the clot and the efficacy of platelet function. A low level of&#xD;
      MA describes a lower strength of the clot determined by a lower number or a reduced function&#xD;
      of platelet. In one recent study it has been described that a lower MA describing a&#xD;
      hypocoagulability pattern might be associated with an increased risk of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether a lower level of MA and a pattern of&#xD;
      hypocoagulability might be associated with an increased risk of bleeding and need of&#xD;
      transfusion in patients with sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A prospective multicenter observational study will be conducted in five intensive&#xD;
      care units of five Italian university hospitals. We asked for Ethic Committee approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: : all adult patients with diagnosis of sepsis admitted for more than 48&#xD;
      hours will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: patients younger than 18 years old of age; chronic use of oral&#xD;
      anticoagulant and anti platelet treatment; hematologic malignancy; congenital bleeding&#xD;
      disorders; oral contraceptives; lack of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point To evaluate whether a lower level of MA might be associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate whether a different level of MA correlates with the biomarker of the&#xD;
           severity of sepsis such as presepsin (PSEP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate whether a different level of MA correlates with the biomarker of the&#xD;
           severity of infection such as procalcitonin (PCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate whether a pattern of hypocoagulability might be associated with a risk of&#xD;
           mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Prospective, multicenter, observational&#xD;
&#xD;
      All demographic and clinical data will be collected for each patient, as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, gender, weight, simplify acute physiology score (SAPS) II, sequential organ failure&#xD;
      assessment (SOFA) score (at admission and every 72 hours), clinical pulmonary infection score&#xD;
      (CPIS), if the source of infection comes from lung, type of infection and microbiological&#xD;
      isolation, haemodynamic parameters (heart rate, mean arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary&#xD;
      wedge pressure, cardiac output, mixed venous oxygen saturation) and renal function&#xD;
      (creatinine, urine output and fluid balance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled patients will undergo a blood sample at admission (T0), after 72 hours (T1) and&#xD;
      after 7 days (T2) and all the following parameters will be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet count, APTT, PT, INR, fibrinogen, procalcitonin and presepsin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, all viscoelastic parameters will be performed at bedside, using a TEG 5000&#xD;
      Hemostasis Analyzer System (Haemoscope Corporation, Chicago, Illinois, USA), at T0, T1, T2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. reaction time (R), normal range (3-8 sec)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. clot formation speed (K), normal range (1-3 sec)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. angle (alpha), which reflects the clot growth kinetics, normal range (55-75Â°)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. maximun amplitude (MA), normal range (51-69 mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. fibrinogen maximun amplitude (FFMA), normal range (14-24 mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleeding definition We defined bleeding event as any intracranial bleeding identified at CT&#xD;
      scan or any other bleeding at gastrointestinal tract (hematemesis or melena or frank blood in&#xD;
      the stools), at tracheal aspirates or in the urine or bleeding during surgery and from wounds&#xD;
      or any bleeding event requiring concomitant transfusion of three units of red blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intensive Care Unit Length of Stay (ICU-LOS);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mortality at 28 days and at 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis A power analysis was calculated considering primary endpoint:&#xD;
      correlation between level of MA and risk of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We defined bleeding as intracranial, gastrointestinal, tracheal or surgical bleeding or any&#xD;
      bleeding event requiring concomitant transfusion of three units of red blood cells. From&#xD;
      previous study we observed an incidence of 26%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power 86.4% B (size of the regression coefficient) 0.1 Standard deviation of MA 6 P (event&#xD;
      rate) 26% Alpha 0.05&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected number of patients enrolled in 24 months is about 100 and with a Cox&#xD;
      proportional hazard model we can estimate the Hazard Ratios (HR) and 95% CI with the&#xD;
      parameters of the following table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Cox regression of the log hazard ratio on MA as a covariate with a standard deviation of 6,&#xD;
      based on a sample of 100 observations achieves 86.4% power at a 0.05 significance level to&#xD;
      detect a regression coefficient equal to 0.1 (log of hazard ratio). The sample size was&#xD;
      adjusted for a bleeding rate of 26%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characteristics of the patients and clinical measures will be describe using the most&#xD;
      appropriate statistics, as mean (SD), median (IQR) or percentages according to variable type&#xD;
      and distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cumulative incidence of bleeding during period of observation (7 days) will be estimated&#xD;
      with the Gooley method, to take into account the competitive risk of death, and compared with&#xD;
      the Gray test. The Fine and Grey model will be used to estimate adjusted HR and their 95% CI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of associations between MA and severity of disease or infection will be assessed&#xD;
      using Spearman's correlation test.&#xD;
