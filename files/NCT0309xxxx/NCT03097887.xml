  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed trial is designed to answer the following questions: First, is biliary reflux&#xD;
      to the distal esophagus present before OLGB and does it increase after the procedure? Second,&#xD;
      does performing an OLGB with or without anti-reflux sutures make a difference in (biliary)&#xD;
      reflux exposures of the distal esophagus? To answer these questions the investigators plan to&#xD;
      perform a randomized, controlled trial involving two groups. Group A will undergo an OLGB&#xD;
      without anti-reflux sutures and consists of 50 patients. Group B will receive an OLGB with&#xD;
      anti-reflux sutures and also consists of 50 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastroscopic evaluation for inflammation and reflux will be performed before and one year&#xD;
      after the operation utilizing multilevel intraluminal impedance pH-monitoring (MII-pH) and&#xD;
      intragastric Bilitec 2000™. Furthermore, the study will be blinded to the patient. Long-term&#xD;
      weight loss, the resolution of comorbidities and the incidence of surgical complications will&#xD;
      serve as secondary endpoints. Follow-ups will be performed at 3, 6, and 12 months&#xD;
      postoperatively to assess all primary and secondary goals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity, and especially its comorbidities, has unarguably become the number one threat to&#xD;
      human health in the modern world. Western lifestyle leads to an increased prevalence and thus&#xD;
      to a higher mortality (i.e. due to cardiovascular diseases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The positive effects of gastric bypass surgery on excess weight loss and comorbidity&#xD;
      resolution are well-known. In contrast to the standard laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass&#xD;
      (RYGB), a newer method, the laparoscopic Omega Loop Gastric Bypass (OLGB), has emerged over&#xD;
      the past years. It is believed to be the simpler method involving only one anastomosis&#xD;
      (instead of two) and therefore potentially reducing morbidity and mortality whilst&#xD;
      maintaining comparable excess weight loss. However, since this new type of gastric bypass is&#xD;
      similar to the former Billroth II resection (BII), the carcinoma risk is a concern. The OLGB&#xD;
      is different from the BII resection in many ways. For instance, it involves creating an&#xD;
      approximately 10 cm long narrow gastric pouch which could prevent the suspected underlying&#xD;
      pathogenetic mechanism: biliary reflux to the gastric tube and subsequently to the esophagus.&#xD;
      Biliary reflux is suspected to stimulate squamous esophageal cells and Barrett's epithelial&#xD;
      cells to produce inflammatory mediators and therefore cause oxidative stress, DNA damage and&#xD;
      apoptosis which might lead to adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Worldwide, there are currently two different ways to perform an OLGB: with or without&#xD;
      anti-reflux sutures, which involve sewing the biliopancreatic limb to the staple line of the&#xD;
      pouch using V-Loc (non-absorbable) moving upwards as far as easily possible without creating&#xD;
      any tension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed trial is designed to answer the following questions: First, is biliary reflux&#xD;
      to the distal esophagus present before OLGB and does it increase after the procedure? Second,&#xD;
      does performing an OLGB with or without anti-reflux sutures make a difference in (biliary)&#xD;
      reflux exposures of the distal esophagus?&#xD;

Biliary exposure will therefore be assessed before and 12 months after the operation utilizing multilevel intraluminal impedance pH-monitoring (MII-pH) and intragastric Bilitec 2000™.</description>
