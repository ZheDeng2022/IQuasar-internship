  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) has traditionally been treated in subspecialty health centers given&#xD;
      the complexity of older pegylated interferon containing regimens, formerly the standard of&#xD;
      care. This model has persisted into the modern era of direct anti-viral agents (DAAs) despite&#xD;
      their relative simplicity, creating a bottleneck of human resources necessary to fight the&#xD;
      largest infectious epidemic in North America. In addition, stigma and fear over cost has lead&#xD;
      payers to restrict treatment in People Who Inject Drugs (PWIDs), even though a majority of&#xD;
      new infections occur in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of treatment of HCV with elbasvir-grasoprevir in PWIDs&#xD;
      in a real world, community health clinic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two prospective cohorts of PWIDs of 25 patients each, both in primary care-based&#xD;
      community health clinics in Portland, Oregon. Cohort one is actively engaged with ambulatory&#xD;
      medication assisted therapy with buprenorphine or extended released injectable naltrexone.&#xD;
      Cohort two maintains active injection drug use with needle exchange and risk reduction&#xD;
      education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These groups are compared to a 50 patient retrospective cohort of people with substance use&#xD;
      disorders at tertiary care hepatology-based treatment program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients have genotype 1 or 4 HCV and are treated with elbasvir-grasoprevir for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize there is no difference in sustained viremic response at 12 or&#xD;
      48 weeks post-completion of treatment (SVR 12, 48) when treating patients in a community&#xD;
      health clinic setting as compared to the standard-of-care subspecialty setting.&#xD;

      Ratio Index (APRI) &gt; 0.7 or APRI &gt;0.7 but fibrosure/fibroscan of F2 or less; patients with&#xD;
      genotype 1a and Nonstructural 5a (NS5a) resistance associated variants (RAVs); have clinical&#xD;
      or radiologic evidence of cirrhosis; have aminotransferase levels &gt;10x upper limit of normal;&#xD;
      have a hemoglobin of less than 11g/dL, and are co-infected with hepatitis B or HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize there is no difference in sustained viremic response at 12 or&#xD;
      48 weeks post-completion treatment (SVR 12, 48) when treating patients with a DAA in a&#xD;
