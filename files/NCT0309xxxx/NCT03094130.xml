      The main objective of this study is to compare the interpretation of health news items&#xD;
      reporting results of phase I/II (non-randomized) trials with or without spin (i.e.,&#xD;
      distortion of research results). The news items which reported studies evaluating the&#xD;
      treatment effect on human health, have high number of spin in the headline and text and&#xD;
      received high online public attention will be selected. Spin will be deleted and will rewrite&#xD;
      the news items without spin. This sample of news items reporting results of phase I/II&#xD;
      (non-randomized) trials with and without spin will be interpreted by French-speaking&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Health news is an important way to communicate updated medical research to the public. News&#xD;
      items reporting the results of medical research attract a large audience. However, the&#xD;
      quality of reporting in health news is questionable. The merits of a wide range of treatments&#xD;
      and tests are overplayed and harms are underplayed. Several studies have shown the presence&#xD;
      of spin (i.e., distorted presentation of study results) in health news. Distorted facts can&#xD;
      be misleading and can affect the behaviour of physicians, healthcare providers and patients.&#xD;
      However, little research has assessed whether spin can affect readers' interpretation of&#xD;
      health news items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: &quot;Spin&quot; is defined as a misrepresentation of study results whatever the motive&#xD;
      (intentionally or unintentionally) to highlight that the beneficial effect of the&#xD;
      intervention in terms of efficacy and safety is greater than that shown by the results. To&#xD;
      compare the interpretation of health news items reporting phase I/II (non-randomized) trials&#xD;
      with or without spin. News items evaluating the effect of a pharmacological treatment that&#xD;
      received high online public attention will be focused.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The hypothesis of this study is that the spin can influence the reader's&#xD;
      interpretation of health news items reporting results of phase I/II (non-randomized) trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Interventions: Health news items reporting results of phase I/II (non-randomized)&#xD;
           studies with and without spin will be compared. A sample of health news items reporting&#xD;
           the results of phase I/II (non-randomized) studies evaluating the effect of&#xD;
           pharmacologic treatment and containing highest number of spin in the headline and text&#xD;
           will be selected. Spin will be deleted in the selected news items and will be rewritten&#xD;
           the news without spin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants: The participants will include French-speaking population from an e-cohort&#xD;
           Nutrinet santé.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sample size: For this RCT, the sample size will be 300 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The primary outcome will be perception of beneficial effect of the treatment X. We will&#xD;
           ask participants, what do you think is the probability that treatment X would be&#xD;
           beneficial to patients? (scale, 0 [very unlikely] to 10 [very likely]). Perception of&#xD;
           safety and beneficial effects of treatment in clinical studies is considered as a&#xD;
           surrogate marker of health outcome as it may have an impact on the future development of&#xD;
           the drug, and the potential use of the drug for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Expected results: This study will evaluate the impact of spin on the interpretation of&#xD;
           news items reporting results of phase I/II (non-randomized) studies by French-speaking&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. This study is approved by ethics review regulations by INSERM (CEEI-IRB):IRB00003888&#xD;
