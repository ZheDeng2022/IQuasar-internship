&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 55 and older with any of the following:&#xD;

&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye exam: The pupil will be dilated with eye drops. Eye pressure and movements will be&#xD;
      checked. Pictures will be taken of the inside of the eye.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly&#xD;
      in the United States. At present, the current classification systems do not take into&#xD;
      consideration advances in imaging technology, visual function biomarkers, as well as&#xD;
      genotyping and phenotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical sites in the United States and around the world will conduct a longitudinal study&#xD;
      that will bring together resources and commitment for the development of a classification&#xD;
      scheme for AMD using imaging and visual function biomarkers, with the plan to correlate&#xD;
      genetic information obtained in the future. These data could eventually help develop an&#xD;
      understanding of the mechanisms involved in the development and progression of AMD. The&#xD;
      project will recruit participants with early AMD or reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) and&#xD;
      controls. All data and images from this longitudinal study will be available to researchers&#xD;
      worldwide to help in the development of visual function biomarker identification and&#xD;
      classification development. The initiative should provide an unparalleled state-of-the-art&#xD;
      standardized phenotype and genotype including AMD status with information on imaging, visual&#xD;
      function and biomarkers, with a particular focus to developing surrogate outcome variables&#xD;
      for proof of principle phase 2 clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cohort study will recruit up to 500 total participants with early AMD or RPD, including&#xD;
      age-matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a multi-center, international, prospective, observational cohort&#xD;
      study of participants with early AMD or RPD. Study participants will undergo clinical&#xD;
      assessments, multi-modal imaging and receive the standard of care as determined by the&#xD;
      participant s ophthalmologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further research is necessary to characterize RPD and to understand the progression of AMD&#xD;
      from early to late stage disease. The primary objectives of the longitudinal observational&#xD;
      study are to enroll participants with early AMD (medium size drusen) to assess rate of change&#xD;
      in drusen volume and progression rates to large drusen, and associate these morphologic&#xD;
      changes with psychophysical changes, including visual acuity and dark adaptation. Separately,&#xD;
      participants with RPD (verified by Reading Center review) will be enrolled and followed to&#xD;
      better understand the natural history of RPD as well as to document structural and functional&#xD;
      changes over time and associate them with the psychophysical changes listed above and changes&#xD;
      in quality of life. In addition, control participants with no drusen or little drusen (normal&#xD;
      aging changes) will be enrolled as comparison groups for the early AMD and reticular drusen&#xD;
      groups. Data from this study will be analyzed to identify potential risk factors for disease&#xD;
      progression and possible outcome variables for future studies. The collection of multi-model&#xD;
      imaging at baseline and longitudinally will allow for an assessment of the disease&#xD;
      classification and morphologic changes that might serve as biomarkers for disease progression&#xD;
      for eyes with early AMD or RPD. Psychophysical testing will help assess functional changes&#xD;
      and associations. Information will be disseminated to help the ophthalmic community better&#xD;
      understand the natural course of early AMD and RPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To meet these objectives, the study will encourage up to approximately 20 sites participating&#xD;
      in the AMD Ryan Initiative Study (ARIS) to recruit and characterize patients with early AMD&#xD;
      or RPD for the longitudinal study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The longitudinal phase of ARIS will collect information on consenting participants with early&#xD;
      AMD or RPD seen at participating sites. Routine data collection will focus on the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enhancing the understanding of the natural history of early AMD and RPD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluating the functional characteristics of early AMD and RPD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compiling information on the potential ocular associations and natural progression of&#xD;
           RPD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluating risk factors for disease progression in participants with early AMD and RPD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluating multi-model imaging to understand the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis&#xD;
           of early AMD and RPD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determining the 5-year progression rate to large drusen or late AMD in eyes with early&#xD;
           AMD or RPD (in those participants who have NO large drusen at baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determining the rate of change in drusen volume in eyes with early AMD and possibly the&#xD;
           rate of change in the volume of sub-retinal deposits in eyes with RPD, stratified by the&#xD;
           presence or absence of large drusen&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the rates of progression in RPD in eyes with and without early or intermediate&#xD;
           AMD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Developing possible surrogate outcome variables associated with progression to late AMD&#xD;
           or visual acuity loss including change in drusen volume&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improving classification criteria for RPD&#xD;
