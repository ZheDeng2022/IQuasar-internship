    <textblock>
      The study evaluated and compared the safety, tolerance and acceptability of a lifestyle&#xD;
      modification program with or without nutritional supplementation in generally healthy&#xD;
      overweight subjects with cardiometabolic risk factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the safety, tolerance and acceptability of a low-glycemic load diet combined&#xD;
      with exercise and lifestyle modification education (DIET) or a similar program with a meal&#xD;
      replacement formula and targeted nutraceuticals (PROG) in generally healthy, overweight&#xD;
      subjects, forty to fifty subjects with two or more cardiometabolic risk factors, aged 18 to&#xD;
      69 will be randomized into different arms, 13-week intervention trial. To evaluate safety and&#xD;
      tolerability, questionnaires were collected weekly. Additionally, baseline, week 9 and 13&#xD;
      fasting blood samples will be drawn for blood counts, metabolic profiles, plasma lipids, and&#xD;
      additional cardiovascular risk factors. Vitals signs, weight and body composition were&#xD;
      monitored weekly.&#xD;
