  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of religious duties for all healthy adult Muslims is fasting during Ramadan, the ninth&#xD;
      month of Islamic lunar calendar. In this month, Ramadan observance fasted (no food and drink)&#xD;
      from dawn to dusk. Studies demonstrated daytime fasting may pose a positive significant&#xD;
      effect on metabolic health. Thus, this present study aimed to determine the effect of Ramadan&#xD;
      fasting on body composition, metabolic profile, serum leptin and adiponectin levels in&#xD;
      healthy men.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Outcome measurements were taken at before (baseline) and at the end of Ramadan (after Ramadan&#xD;
      fasting) on body composition, metabolic profile (fasting plasma glucose, insulin, total&#xD;
      cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c, triglycerides, and HOMA-IR), serum leptin and adiponectin, ratio&#xD;
      of leptin to adiponectin in 27 healthy men (19-31 years) Muslim in Bangkok, Thailand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Twenty-nine subjects fulfilled inclusion criteria including: age 19-40 years, Muslim&#xD;
      men fasted completely, and no known of any metabolic-related diseases. Subjects with diseases&#xD;
      and/or intake of any medication and dietary supplement, smoking, and alcohol drinking were&#xD;
      excluded. After Ramadan fasting, 27 subjects completed the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Review Committee for Research Involving Human&#xD;
      Research Participants, Health Science Group, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand (COA&#xD;
      no. 136/2558).Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to enrolling to&#xD;
      the study. Subject's anonymity was preserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Research visit was conducted at Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Chulalongkorn&#xD;
      University, Bangkok, Thailand at before (earlier days of Ramadan) and after (third week of&#xD;
      Ramadan) to collect the outcome measurements including anthropometry, body composition,&#xD;
      metabolic profile, serum leptin and adiponectin levels, and ratio of leptin to adiponectin.&#xD;
      The dietary intake of 2 weekday and one weekend day and physical activity were recorded each&#xD;
      week during Ramadan in food record booklet. Energy intake and macronutrients composition&#xD;
      including carbohydrate, protein and fat will be analysed by registered dietitian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry and body composition measurements Weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), and percent&#xD;
      body fat were measured at baseline (week-0) and the end of Ramadan fasting period (week-4).&#xD;
      Body weight, and percent body fat mass were assessed using a constant current source with a&#xD;
      high frequency current (50kHz, 500μA)-bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA) (MC-980MA body&#xD;
      composition analyzer, TANITA corporation, Tokyo, JAPAN). The subject was requested to dress&#xD;
      in light attire and bare feet. The 8 polar electrodes were positioned so that electric&#xD;
      current was supplied from the electrodes on the tips of the toes of both feet and the&#xD;
      fingertips of both hands, and voltage is measured on the heel of both feet and the near side&#xD;
      of both hands. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as weight/height2 (in kilograms per&#xD;
      square meter). Waist and hip circumferences were measured by using a standard rounded tape at&#xD;
      a point right above the iliac crest on the mid-axillary line at minimal respiration (for&#xD;
      waist) and in a horizontal plane at the level of the maximal extension of the buttocks (for&#xD;
      hip) to the nearest 1.0 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic profile measurements Fasting blood samples were taken from vein puncture at before&#xD;
      and after a period of Ramadan fasting. Separated serum samples were stored at - 80o C until&#xD;
      analyses were performed. After withdrawal, blood samples were collected to determine the&#xD;
      metabolic profile including plasma glucose, total cholesterol, high density&#xD;
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c), and triglycerides (TG) by enzymatic method while serum&#xD;
      insulin levels were analyzed by Chemiluminescence. Low density lipoprotein-cholesterol&#xD;
      (LDL-c) was estimated by using the Friedewald equation (LDL-c = [total cholesterol] - [HDL-c]&#xD;
      - [TG]/5).22 Additionally, HOMA-IR was measured as fasting serum insulin (µIU/mL) x fasting&#xD;
      plasma glucose (mmol/L)/22.5.23&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum leptin and adiponectin measurements Serum leptin and adiponectin levels were assayed at&#xD;
      the laboratory at Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Chulalongkorn University. Serum leptin&#xD;
      was measured using a commercially &quot;Human Leptin Standard ABTS ELISA Development kit&quot;&#xD;
      (Peprotech, Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ, USA, Cat. no: 900-K90) at a wavelength of 405nm with&#xD;
      correction set at 650nm, while serum adiponectin was measured using &quot;Adiponectin (human)&#xD;
      ELISA kit&quot; (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA, Cat. no: ALX-850-377) at a wavelength&#xD;
      of 450nm with correction set at 630nm. Both serum leptin and adiponectin were measured by the&#xD;
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and were carried out according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Data were expressed as frequency or percentage for descriptive; mean ±&#xD;
      standard error mean (SEM), mean percentage change (% change) ± SEM for the&#xD;
      continuous-normally distributed data; and median (range) for continuous-non normally&#xD;
      distributed data. Paired student t-test, two related sample (Wilcoxon) test were employed for&#xD;
      comparison of normally distributed and non-normally distributed data, respectively.&#xD;
      Differences were considered as statistically significant for two-tailed of probability value&#xD;
      or P less than 0.05. All analyses were performed using SPSS, version 16.0 (IBM, Chicago, IL,&#xD;
      USA).&#xD;
