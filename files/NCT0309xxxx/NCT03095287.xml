  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, multinational, prospective, single-arm, nonrandomized, open-label&#xD;
      study of approximately 25 male subjects with congenital hemophilia A who will receive their&#xD;
      first (primary) immune tolerance induction (ITI) treatment with Alphanate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 2 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An ITI Treatment Phase in which all eligible subjects will receive ITI treatment with&#xD;
           Alphanate for a period of up to 33 months. Upon confirmation of complete immune&#xD;
           tolerization, subjects will then enter a 12-month Prophylactic Phase. If, after 33&#xD;
           months of ITI, a subject has achieved partial immune tolerance, the subject will enter a&#xD;
           12-month Prophylactic Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 12-month Prophylactic Phase for all subjects who meet the criteria for complete or&#xD;
           partial success to continue on a prophylactic dosing regimen of Alphanate.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Male subjects &lt;12 years of age presenting with an inhibitor titer &gt;0.6 to &lt;10 Bethesda Units&#xD;
      (BU) will be screened before the planned start of ITI treatment. Subjects continuing to meet&#xD;
      the entrance criteria will enter the ITI Treatment Phase and receive daily doses of Alphanate&#xD;
      100 IU/kg/day for up to 33 months, with a one-time option to increase to a dosing regimen of&#xD;
      200 IU/kg/day at any time after 90 days of ITI treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will continue to receive their daily Alphanate dose for up to 33 months until the&#xD;
      titer is negative (&lt;0.6 BU) on 2 consecutive assessments and treatment success is confirmed&#xD;
      by FVIII:C pharmacokinetic assessments, at which time they will enter the 12 month&#xD;
      Prophylactic Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, subjects who have achieved partial immune tolerance at the completion of 33&#xD;
      months of ITI treatment will enter the 12-month Prophylactic Phase. Subjects who do not&#xD;
      achieve partial immune tolerance at the completion of 33 months of ITI treatment will be&#xD;
      discontinued as treatment failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Prophylactic Phase begins with an 8 week taper period for subjects tolerized with 100&#xD;
      IU/kg/day or with a 12-week taper period for subjects tolerized with 200 IU/kg/day to bring&#xD;
      the dose down in a step-wise manner to a prophylactic dose of Alphanate 50 IU/kg every other&#xD;
      day or 3 times per week, at the investigator's discretion. During the Prophylactic Phase,&#xD;
      subjects will be monitored monthly for the first 4 months and then every 2 months for the&#xD;
      remaining 8 months to assess sustainability of immune tolerance.&#xD;
