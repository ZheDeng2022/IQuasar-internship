  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study the researchers want to learn more about the effects (both good and&#xD;
      bad) the study drug selumetinib has on participants with neurofibromatosis type II (NF2)&#xD;
      related tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers are asking patients with NF2 related tumors to be in the study, because their&#xD;
      hearing has decreased and/or their NF2 related tumor has started to grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if selumetinib will stop NF2 related tumors from growing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure the changes in hearing after receiving selumetinib for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if selumetinib improves how participants feel (physically and emotionally) and&#xD;
           how participants can perform daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine tumor tissue, if available, in a laboratory to see if NF2 related tumors have&#xD;
           targets of selumetinib.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 trial to assess the hearing response rate and radiographic response of VS&#xD;
      in children and young adults with NF2 who are treated with selumetinib. Dosing will be based&#xD;
      on age: For patients with NF2 who are 3 to &lt; 18 years of age, dosing will be based on BSA.&#xD;
      Dosing is based on BSA calculated at the beginning of each course. For patients with NF2 who&#xD;
      are ≥ 18 to 45 years of age, dosing will be the standard adult dose of 75 mg BID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selumetinib is taken orally twice a day continuously. One course is equivalent to 28 days.&#xD;
      Therapy may continue for up to two years (26 courses) in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two treatment strata. Stratum 1 is for those patients who have a target&#xD;
      vestibular schwannoma which is causing hearing loss. Stratum 2 will be reserved for patients&#xD;
      who exhibit growth of a tumor(s) besides vestibular schwannoma and are therefore not eligible&#xD;
      for stratum 1.&#xD;

             for age, height and gender at the time of registration.&#xD;

             groups are eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent.&#xD;
        Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study due to risks of&#xD;
             fetal and teratogenic adverse events as seen in animal/human studies. The effects of&#xD;
             selumetinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation, and for four weeks after dosing with selumetinib ceases. The&#xD;
             selumetinib manufacturer recommends that adequate contraception for male patients&#xD;
             should be used for 16 weeks post-last dose due to sperm life cycle. Women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to study&#xD;
             registration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or&#xD;
             her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Female subjects are considered &quot;of child-bearing potential&quot; if they are anatomically&#xD;
        and physiologically capable of becoming pregnant. For girls of normal reproductive&#xD;
        potential, the possibility of becoming pregnant requires ovulatory menstrual cycles and&#xD;
        heterosexual intercourse. Although the timing of ovulation relative to menarche is&#xD;
        variable, there is consistent evidence that some girls may have ovulatory cycles prior to&#xD;
        menarche, and that, in healthy populations, regular ovulation may begin within a few months&#xD;
        of menarche. Therefore, menarche is the most feasible clinical indicator of the biological&#xD;
        potential for pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any clinically significant unrelated systemic illness (serious&#xD;
             infections or significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction) that&#xD;
             is likely to interfere with the study procedures or results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are currently receiving another investigational drug within 4 weeks prior&#xD;
             to the first dose of study treatment, or within a period during which the&#xD;
             investigational drug or systemic anticancer treatment has not been cleared from the&#xD;
             body (e.g. a period of 5 'half-lives'), whichever is the most appropriate and as&#xD;
             judged by the investigator are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have taken another BRAF inhibitor such as Vemurafenib or Dabrafenib prior&#xD;
             to study registration are not eligible. Prior treatment with selumetinib or another&#xD;
             MEK inhibitor is not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with QTc interval of &gt; 450 msec&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require enzyme inducing anti-convulsants to control seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticoagulation: Patients receiving coumadin are eligible but must have their PT and&#xD;
             INR monitored prior to each 4 week course.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the&#xD;
             safety monitoring requirements of the study are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following cardiac conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Uncontrolled hypertension in adults (BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg despite medical therapy) b.&#xD;
             Acute coronary syndrome within 6 months prior to starting treatment c. Uncontrolled&#xD;

             severe valvular heart disease (Appendix I) e. Prior or current cardiomyopathy&#xD;

             Known arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
             f. Previous moderate or severe impairment of left ventricular systolic function (LVEF&#xD;
             &lt;45% on echocardiography or equivalent on MuGA) if known even if full recovery has&#xD;
             occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
             g. Severe valvular heart disease h. Baseline Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)&#xD;

                  IOP)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No major surgery within 4 weeks of starting selumetinib. Portacath insertion, G Tube&#xD;
             placement, and insertion of ventriculoperitoneal shunt are not considered major&#xD;
             surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to selumetinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of a medical or psychiatric illness, that in the investigator's judgment&#xD;
             renders the patient incapable of further therapy on this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with progressive disease associated with significant or disabling clinical&#xD;
             symptoms requiring immediate intervention with surgery or radiation therapy are not&#xD;
