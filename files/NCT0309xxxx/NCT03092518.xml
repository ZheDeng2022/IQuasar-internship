      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastric cancer is a common and serious cancer. Standard treatment is chemotherapy drugs.&#xD;
      Researchers want to see if a new treatment helps. It is surgical removal of the cancer and&#xD;
      heated chemotherapy delivered to the abdominal cavity called HIPEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if surgical removal of tumors plus heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy can improve&#xD;
      survival in people with gastric cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with gastric cancer who can have most tumors surgically removed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue sample from previous surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoscopy with biopsy: A tube with a camera goes through the mouth and into the stomach.&#xD;
           It and takes a sample of stomach tissue. Participants might may get medicine to make&#xD;
           them drowsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laparoscopy: Small cuts are made in the abdomen. A thin tube with a light and camera is&#xD;
           inserted into the abdomen. Participants sleep through the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in the hospital. They will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery to remove as many tumors as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIPEC for 60 minutes: Two thin tubes are put into the abdomen. Two chemotherapy drugs&#xD;
           are given through one tube. They are drained out through another at a temperature a few&#xD;
           degrees above normal body temperature. Another drug is given in a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recovery for 7-21 days: Participants will have tubes in their stomach and bladder and IVs for&#xD;
      a few days. They will get pain medicine, IV fluids, antibiotics, and blood transfusions as&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have visits every few months for 3 years, then one a year. Visits include&#xD;
      physical exam, blood tests, and scans. They also include dietary assessment and questions.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An estimated 24,590 cases of gastric adenocarcinoma are diagnosed annually in the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peritoneal surface is a site of metastasis found often at time of diagnosis and is a&#xD;
      common (40%) site of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopy with peritoneal lavage and cytopathologic analysis is a staging modality that can&#xD;
      identify a subset of patients with microscopic peritoneal metastasis prior to consideration&#xD;
      for definitive surgical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been employed in advanced gastric cancers and as an adjuvant&#xD;
      with an associated improvement in survival in systematic reviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the overall survival in patients with cytology-positive gastric cancer treated with&#xD;
      HIPEC and gastrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytopathologic evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medically fit for systemic chemotherapy, HIPEC and gastrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single arm, Phase II study of HIPEC and gastrectomy.&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disseminated extra-peritoneal or solid organ metastases&#xD;

             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;

             been studied in pregnant women and has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with HIPEC and gastrectomy, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients may be considered for this study only after consultation with a&#xD;
             NIAID physician.&#xD;
