  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a flexible lifestyle program designed to help Latino men&#xD;
      make healthy lifestyle changes to lower their risk of developing diabetes and heart disease.&#xD;
      The program is called HOMBRE (Hombres con Opciones para Mejorar el Bienestar y bajar el&#xD;
      Riesgo de Enfermedades crónicas; English translation: Men with choices to improve well being&#xD;
      and decrease chronic disease risk).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a comparative effectiveness trial where obese Latino men will receive, by&#xD;
      random assignment, the HOMBRE intervention or a minimal intensity intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to test whether a flexible lifestyle program with choices for program&#xD;
      engagement will lead to better health outcomes, compared to a minimal intensity self-directed&#xD;
      lifestyle program. If proven successful, this study has the potential to significantly impact&#xD;
      health outcomes that matter to Latino men through the innovative design of lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions to prevent chronic disease.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary intake was measured using the gold-standard approach of multiple pass 24-hour recalls in Spanish or English using Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR). Diet quality was assessed by the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score. DASH scores were calculated based on combining nine nutrient targets (i.e. total fat, saturated fat, protein, cholesterol, fiber, magnesium, calcium, sodium and potassium). A higher score reflects higher diet quality. The minimum score is 8 and the maximum is 40. DASH score at 18 months - DASH score at baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Obesity-related Problem Scale, average scores of 8 questions with a range from 0 (no at all) to 3 (extremely). The average score is then multiplied by 100 and divided by 3 to convert to a scale of 0-100, with a higher score indicating more obesity-related problems. Obesity-related quality of life measured at 18 months - obesity-related quality of life measured at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change in Psychosocial Well-being: Depressive Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ-9 is a self-report questionnaire with 9 items. Respondents answered questions regarding how often a symptom has bothered them over the last two weeks. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale (0 = not at all, 1 = several days, 2 = more than half the days, 3 = nearly every day). PHQ-9 total score is the sum of the nine items, ranging from 0 to 27. Scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent cutpoints for mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe depression, respectively. PHQ-9 score at 18 months - PHQ-9 score at baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep disturbance T-score, a population scale with a range from 25 (extreme disturbance or impairment) to 80 (not at all) converted from the raw total score of 8-item questionnaire. A score of 50 represents the average of the calibration sample, which was generally more enriched for chronic illness.

HOMBRE: HOMBRE is a Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB)-based intervention tailored for men and available in 3 delivery modalities (coach-facilitated individual approach, coach-led online virtual groups, and coach-led in-person groups). A lifestyle coach will support men in making an informed choice of modality and will provide ongoing individualized feedback. All delivery modalities provide the same evidence-based curriculum and include self-monitoring and individualized feedback from the lifestyle coach.</description>

        <population>At 18 months, 186 in HOMBRE and 180 in Minimal Intensity had either study-measured, EHR-abstracted, or self-reported weight, therefore were counted in retention in the Participant Flow module. We used same model as first secondary outcome to examine changes in EHR weight at 18 months. We abstracted weight from the EHR from 3 months prior to randomization to 24 months post randomization. 209 in HOMBRE and 209 in Minimal Intensity had EHR-abstracted weight during this 27-month period.</population>

        <description>Dietary intake was measured using the gold-standard approach of multiple pass 24-hour recalls in Spanish or English using Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR). Diet quality was assessed by the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score. DASH scores were calculated based on combining nine nutrient targets (i.e. total fat, saturated fat, protein, cholesterol, fiber, magnesium, calcium, sodium and potassium). A higher score reflects higher diet quality. The minimum score is 8 and the maximum is 40. DASH score at 18 months - DASH score at baseline.</description>

        <title>Change in Psychosocial Well-being: Depressive Symptoms</title>
        <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ-9 is a self-report questionnaire with 9 items. Respondents answered questions regarding how often a symptom has bothered them over the last two weeks. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale (0 = not at all, 1 = several days, 2 = more than half the days, 3 = nearly every day). PHQ-9 total score is the sum of the nine items, ranging from 0 to 27. Scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent cutpoints for mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe depression, respectively. PHQ-9 score at 18 months - PHQ-9 score at baseline.</description>
