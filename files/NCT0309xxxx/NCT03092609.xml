  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are one of the most common psychological disorders. Underlying anxiety is&#xD;
      an increased attentional bias to threat, which has been identified as a causal contributor in&#xD;
      the development of anxiety. Given this causal relationship, attention bias modification was&#xD;
      introduced as a treatment option where anxiety is reduced by training individuals to direct&#xD;
      their attention away from threat and thereby decreasing anxiety. Over a decade of research&#xD;
      using this approach, called attention bias modification (ABM), suggests that overall the&#xD;
      approach is effective in reducing anxiety. Although ABM appears to be a very promising&#xD;
      treatment option for anxiety, there are several factors limiting the effectiveness of ABM.&#xD;
      These include the recognition of individual-level needs and a known underlying mechanism of&#xD;
      action by which ABM is effective. Neuroimaging evidence suggests that attentional bias to&#xD;
      visual threat is associated with a network of brain regions including the amygdala, anterior&#xD;
      cingulate cortex, and visual cortex. In human participants, experience-dependent&#xD;
      neuroplasticity is visible in voxel-based morphometry based measures of gray matter volume&#xD;
      following training. Recently, voxel-based morphometry measures of gray matter volume have&#xD;
      been linked to dendritic spine density-a known cellular mechanism for learning-related&#xD;
      neuroplasticity. Thus, voxel-based morphometry measures are ideally suited to measure&#xD;
      learning-related neuroplasticity following attention bias modification. In this proposal&#xD;
      participants' level of attentional bias, anxiety, and gray matter volume will be measured&#xD;
      before and after completing six weeks of attention bias modification training (N = 50) or&#xD;
      attention control training (N= 50). The proposal aims to (1) establish that pre-treatment&#xD;
      bias predicts variability in gray matter volume in the extended amygdala and anterior&#xD;
      cingulate cortex, (2) assess the extent to which reduced extended amygdala and anterior&#xD;
      cingulate cortex gray matter volume following ABM underlies reductions in attentional bias&#xD;
      and anxiety, and (3) Establish pre-treatment bias as a predictor of successful ABM as&#xD;
      measured by reduced bias, reduced anxiety, and reduced gray matter volume in the extended&#xD;
      amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex. Consistent with the objectives of the AREA grant and&#xD;
      NIMH's focus on identifying and validating new targets for treatment development that&#xD;
      underlie disease mechanisms, the current proposal plans to involve students at a rural&#xD;
      primarily undergraduate university in a research project aimed at establishing&#xD;
      neuroplasticity in the extended amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex as a target mechanism&#xD;
      for ABM training outcome, which could be used to objectively track training-related outcomes&#xD;
      in anxiety treatment.&#xD;
