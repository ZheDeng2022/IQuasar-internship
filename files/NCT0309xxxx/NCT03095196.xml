      Background: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a multi factorial disease, affecting clinical&#xD;
      outcomes in failing heart (HF) patients treated by Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy with a&#xD;
      defibrillator (CRT-d).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: One hundred and ninety five T2DM patients will receive a CRT-d treatment. Randomly&#xD;
      the study population will receive a CRT-d via multipolar left ventricle (LV) lead pacing (n&#xD;
      99 as Multipolar group), v/s a CRT-d via bipolar LV pacing (n 96, as Bipolar group). These&#xD;
      patients will be followed by clinical, and instrumental assessment, and telemetric device&#xD;
      control at follow up. Study design will be to evaluate, in failing heart T2DM patients,&#xD;
      cardiac deaths, all cause deaths, arrhythmic events, CRT-d responders rate, hospitalizations&#xD;
      for HF worsening, phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS), and LV catheter dislodgment events (and&#xD;
      re-intervention for LV catheter re-positioning), comparing multipolar CRT-d v/s bipolar CRT-d&#xD;
      group of patients at follow up.&#xD;

      Introduction: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a worldwide increasing disease, impacting on&#xD;
      heart functions, and cardiac diseases, and outcomes. T2DM may lead to heart failure (HF)&#xD;
      disease, and conditioning HF disease progression, and the response to treatments. In HF&#xD;
      patients, cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-d) is a&#xD;
      well-established treatment to improve symptoms, quality of life, NYHA class, and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. T2DM may condition the CRT-d response. The advancement of CRT-d technology worked&#xD;
      to reduce implant complications, phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) events, and left ventricle&#xD;
      (LV) catheter dislodgments, and to ameliorate the CRT-d responders rate, and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. The multipolar LV lead pacing represented one of the waited technological&#xD;
      advancement in CRT-d technology, resulted in a stable and continuous CRT-d pacing. The stable&#xD;
      and continuous CRT-d pacing may condition the prognosis, and CRT-d responders rate in failing&#xD;
      heart patients. At our knowledge, there are not data investigating these effects in a&#xD;
      population of T2DM failing heart subjects. In this study T2DM failing heart patients randomly&#xD;
      received a CRT-d via multipolar LV lead and/or a CRT-d via bipolar LV lead. In these patients&#xD;
      we evaluated, as primary study endpoints, PNS events, LV lead dislodgments, interventions for&#xD;
      LV re-positioning, cardiac deaths, all cause deaths, stroke events, and hospitalizations for&#xD;
      HF worsening. As secondary endpoints we evaluated arrhythmic events, strokes, and CRT-d&#xD;
      responders rate. Our study hypothesis was that, in T2DM failing heart patients multipolar LV&#xD;
      pacing may lead to a reduction of PNS episodes, LV leads dislodgments, and interventions to&#xD;
      re-positioning LV leads, leading to a significant amelioration of the HF clinical status, and&#xD;
      of the CRT-d responders rate. These effects induced by multipolar CRT-d pacing may reduce&#xD;
      arrhythmic events, hospitalizations for HF worsening, and of cardiac deaths, and all cause&#xD;
      deaths in T2DM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: From September 2012 to September 2015 we conducted a multicenter, prospective,&#xD;
      randomized study at University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Italy, Catholic University of&#xD;
      Sacred Heart, Campobasso, Italy, and John Paul II Research and Care Foundation, Campobasso,&#xD;
      Italy. We screened 213 consecutive T2DM patients with stable chronic HF, NYHA functional&#xD;
      class II or III, left bundle branch block, severe left ventricle ejection fraction reduction&#xD;
      (LVEF &lt; 35%), stable sinus rhythm, candidates to receive a CRT-d treatment according to the&#xD;
      international guidelines. Exclusion criteria were: age &lt;18 or &gt;75 years, ejection fraction&#xD;
      &gt;35%, previous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), CRT-d and/or pacemaker implant,&#xD;
      absence of informed patient consent, and any condition that would make survival for 1 year&#xD;
      unlikely. 198 eligible patients were included in the study, and received a CRT-d treatment,&#xD;
      and a traditional CRT-d ambulatory monitoring. The CRT-d has randomly undergone via&#xD;
      multipolar left lead pacing (n 101) v/s bipolar left lead pacing (n 98). Study population was&#xD;
      divided in Multipolar CRT-d group (multipolar LV pacing), v/s Bipolar CRT-d group (bipolar LV&#xD;
      pacing), according to the LV lead stimulation catheter used, and implanted at enrolment. 99&#xD;
      patients in Multipolar CRT group v/s 96 patients in the Bipolar CRT group completed the&#xD;
      follow up. All patients were informed about the study nature, and gave their written&#xD;
      informed, and signed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol: 199 patients received a CRT-d, then divided in multipolar CRT-d patients (n&#xD;
      101), and bipolar CRT-d patients (n 98). Before interventions, baseline laboratory studies,&#xD;
      including HbA1c, lipid panel, and fibrinogen, were determined. Follow-up was concluded at 12&#xD;
      months after CRT-d implant. Responders patients to a CRT-d treatment were defined by evidence&#xD;
      of LV reverse remodeling, 6 minutes-walk improvement and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure&#xD;
      scale improvement. Enrolled patients were followed by clinical, instrumental assessment, and&#xD;
      device telemetric control at follow up. During these visits we reported lead functionality&#xD;
      parameters, and arrhythmic events in CRT-d recipients, PNS episodes, and CRT-d effect on&#xD;
      clinical outcomes. This study was conducted from September 2012 to December 2015. The study&#xD;
      was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The Ethics Committees of all&#xD;
      participating institutions approved the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention phase: CRT-d implant procedure, and LV pacing leads positioning Experienced&#xD;
      electrophysiologists performed CRT implant procedures, that were standardized. Right atrial&#xD;
      catheters were all placed in right atrial appendage, right ventricular catheters in right&#xD;
      ventricle apex, as indicated by antero-posterior, right anterior, and left anterior oblique&#xD;
      views projections at radioscopic imaging. LV epicardial catheters were placed by percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary sinus catheterization. In this case we have chosen, by previous described&#xD;
      radioscopic projections and angiography, a lateral and/or posterior-lateral target vessel,&#xD;
      according to international guidelines recommendations. We randomly chose a multipolar and/or&#xD;
      a bipolar left ventricle pacing lead, as described before in the text. Implantation duration&#xD;
      was defined as the time between skin incision until suture. Measurements were repeated within&#xD;
      24hours of implantation using the implanted pulse generator and pacemaker programmer, and&#xD;
      then 10th days, 6th month, 12th month after discharge at follow up. The sensing and pacing LV&#xD;
      configurations were defined by 10 bipolar configurations for multipolar LV pacing modality,&#xD;
      and at least 4 different left ventricle pacing configurations (LV tip to either LV ring or&#xD;
      right ventricular (RV) coil, and LV ring to either LV tip or RV coil) for the bipolar left&#xD;
      ventricle pacing group. LV pacing leads were connected to an appropriate bipolar CRT-D&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lead functionality parameters Right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle leads&#xD;
      functionality parameters were measured, as P, and R-wave amplitude values (sensing&#xD;
      thresholds), lead impedances values (impedance thresholds), and lead pacing outputs values&#xD;
      (pacing thresholds). The sensing thresholds values were obtained from the intra-cardiac&#xD;
      electrograms records, measured using a sensing configuration. The pacing thresholds, and&#xD;
      impedance thresholds values, were measured using pacing catheter configurations. To measure&#xD;
      intra thoracic impedance (Ohm), and pacing thresholds (Volt for milliseconds), we focused on&#xD;
      the right ventricle (RV) coil electrode to device case pathway configuration, and on the left&#xD;
      ventricle (LV) tip to LV ring configuration. These parameters were evaluated during&#xD;
      ambulatory follow up visits, and device interrogations at follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arrhythmic events in CRT-d recipients Arrhythmic events were defined as atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      (AF), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and ventricular fibrillation (VF) episodes, and&#xD;
      implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) shocks. AF was defined as paroxysmal, and/or not&#xD;
      paroxysmal according to authors suggestions. VT was defined as arrhythmia originating from&#xD;
      ventricular chambers, sustained and/or not sustained by arrhythmic event duration. VF was&#xD;
      defined as a fibrillating arrhythmia originating from ventricular chambers, and associated to&#xD;
      hemodynamic instability, and cardiac arrest. By CRT-d devices interrogations at follow up we&#xD;
      reported ICDs shocks for each CRT-d patient, at 10th days, 6th month, and at 12th month after&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phrenic nerve stimulation events PNS and left ventricle pacing leads threshold were measured&#xD;
      by a standard protocol at CRT-d implant, and during all follow up durations by CRT-d devices&#xD;
      interrogations. In case of PNS diagnosis during follow up, by patients symptoms assessment,&#xD;
      devices interrogations, and physician ambulatory diagnosis, we reached the best left&#xD;
      ventricle lead pacing configuration to solve PNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LV leads dislodgments LV catheter dislodgments resulted by the movement of the catheter into&#xD;
      and out of the coronary sinus implantation vessel site, and then causing a change in the&#xD;
      catheter tip location. It was diagnosed by patients clinical symptoms, hospital admissions&#xD;
      schedules, hospital discharge schedules, and during medical interrogation at follow up&#xD;
      visits, and was confirmed by radiographic biplane projections assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRT-d effect on clinical outcomes CRT-d responders rate was evaluated by periodic clinical&#xD;
      examination, and echocardiography assessment. Interventions for LV lead re-positioning were&#xD;
      defined as interventions done after the first CRT-d implant, and were evaluated by hospital&#xD;
      admissions schedules, hospital discharge schedules, and medical interrogation at follow up&#xD;
      visits. These interventions were done in case of LV catheter dislodgments. Hospitalization&#xD;
      rate was reported during telephonic interviews, by hospital admissions schedules, hospital&#xD;
      discharge schedules, and during medical interrogation at follow up visits. Cardiac deaths,&#xD;
      all cause of deaths, and stroke events were evaluated during office follow up visits 10 days&#xD;
      after clinical discharge, and after 6th and 12th months by the treating physician, by&#xD;
      telephonic interview, hospital admission, and discharge schedules. At each clinical&#xD;
      follow-up, right atrial, right ventricular, and left ventricular leads functionality, atrial,&#xD;
      and ventricular arrhythmias, ICD shocks, and biventricular pacing percentage, were evaluated&#xD;
      and reported for each patient. NYHA classification was re-assessed, and patients graded their&#xD;
      overall condition as unchanged or slightly, moderately, or markedly worsened, or improved&#xD;
      since randomization by global self-assessment. All patients were instructed to report about&#xD;
      devices alarms, loss of lead capture, phrenic nerve stimulation, and arrhythmias. All&#xD;
      patients were instructed regularly to assess body weight, occurrence of dyspnea, and any&#xD;
      clinical symptom. At each visit patients were asked whether medical events or symptoms&#xD;
      suggestive of cardiac arrhythmias occurred, and an ECG, and an ECG Holter monitoring, were&#xD;
      both performed to detect the presence of asymptomatic arrhythmias. Clinical evaluations&#xD;
      included physical examination, vital signs, and review of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints As primary endpoints we monitored CRT-d effect in multipolar CRT-d patients&#xD;
      v/s bipolar CRT-d patients in terms of PNS, LV leads dislodgments, interventions to&#xD;
      re-position LV leads, hospitalization rate for HF worsening, cardiac deaths, and all cause&#xD;
      deaths. As secondary endpoints we monitored CRT-d responders rate, arrhythmic events, and&#xD;
      strokes in both groups (multipolar CRT-d v/s bipolar CRT-d patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods A qualified statistician analyzed all collected data. The patients were&#xD;
      divided before in multipolar CRT-d group v/s bipolar CRT-d group, and during follow up&#xD;
      visits, and controls in CRT-d responders v/s CRT-d non-responders. Continuous variables were&#xD;
      expressed as means and standard deviations, and were tested by two-tailed Student t test for&#xD;
      paired or unpaired data, as appropriate, or by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for more&#xD;
      than two independent groups of data. The categorical variables were compared by chi-square or&#xD;
      Fisher exact test where appropriate. Survival analysis was performed with the use of the&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier method. Predictors of the study endpoints were evaluated by using Cox regression&#xD;
      models in which covariates for the adjustment were selected if associated with a p value&#xD;
      ≤0.25 at univariate analysis. A stepwise method with backward elimination was used and hazard&#xD;
      ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived. We considered a two-sided p&#xD;
      value of less than 0.05 as statistically significant. The statistical analysis was performed&#xD;
      using the SPSS software package for Windows 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago Illinois).&#xD;
