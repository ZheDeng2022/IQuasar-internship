  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive and functional impairment are debilitating problems for survivors of major surgery.&#xD;
      Efforts to modify medical treatments to prevent such impairment are ongoing and may yet yield&#xD;
      significant benefits. An area in need of study is whether building patients' cognitive and&#xD;
      physical reserve through a prescribed program of cognitive and physical exercise before the&#xD;
      physiological insult (a prehabilitation effort) can improve long-term outcomes.&#xD;
      Prehabilitation efforts before surgery thus far have focused on preemptive physical therapy&#xD;
      to improve post-surgical functional outcomes. No work, however, has been done to attenuate&#xD;
      the cognitive decline commonly seen after surgical illness by exercising the brain before the&#xD;
      surgical insult. Cognitive prehabilitation is a novel therapeutic approach that applies&#xD;
      well-understood techniques derived from brain plasticity research. Our approach is bolstered&#xD;
      by data that demonstrate that cognitive training programs are effective and have a very high&#xD;
      likelihood of fostering improvement in patient outcomes across a range of populations. It is&#xD;
      not yet known if these programs can improve cognitive reserve, allowing patients' minds to&#xD;
      better manage the acute stress of surgery and hospitalization. The primary aim of this pilot&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the feasibility of cognitive and physical prehabilitation training in&#xD;
      adult patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery who are at risk for postoperative&#xD;
      cognitive and functional decline. The secondary aim is to study the effects of cognitive and&#xD;
      physical prehabilitation training on cognitive abilities, functional status, and quality of&#xD;
      life after surgery.&#xD;
