  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is a disfiguring and disabling disease that profoundly impairs the&#xD;
      quality of life of affected patients. High dose intravenous (iv) glucocorticoids (GC) (ivGC)&#xD;
      is a well established, widely used treatment for active GO. The use of systemic&#xD;
      glucocorticoids takes advantage from their immune suppressive and antiinflammatory actions,&#xD;
      resulting in an overall beneficial effect ranging from ~35 to ~60% of patients in various&#xD;
      studies. The intravenous route of administration has been shown to be superior to the oral&#xD;
      route, both in terms of GO outcome and side effect profile. The combination of ivGC and&#xD;
      orbital radiotherapy (OR) is used routinely in patients with moderate-severe, active GO, as a&#xD;
      second-line treatment, as also recommended in the recent Guidelines published by the European&#xD;
      Thyroid Association/European Group on Graves' Orbitopathy. Thus, the majority of studies have&#xD;
      shown that OR increases the response rate to GC. Those studies were performed using oral GC,&#xD;
      whereas it is not known whether OR potentiate also the effects of ivGC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is aimed at determining whether OR potentiate the effects of ivGC in the&#xD;
      treatment of moderately severe and active GO, in terms of GO outcome and quality of life. A&#xD;
      possible extension of the study can be foreseen, aimed at investigating the very long time GO&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
