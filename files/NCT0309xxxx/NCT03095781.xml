  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of Hsp90 inhibitor XL888 when&#xD;
      given together with pembrolizumab in treating patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer&#xD;
      that has spread to other places in the body. XL888 may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Giving&#xD;
      XL888 with pembrolizumab may work better in treating patients with gastrointestinal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the recommended phase II dose for the combination of XL888 and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Define the toxicity profile of the combination of XL888 and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the activity of the combination of XL888 and pembrolizumab in previously treated&#xD;
      patients with gastrointestinal tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the effect of the combination on the immune profile in the serum and in tumor&#xD;
      biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of Hsp90 inhibitor XL888.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and XL888 orally&#xD;
      (PO) on day 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, and 18. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and periodically&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
