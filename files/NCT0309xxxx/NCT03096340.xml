  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IT141 is a novel nanoparticle formulation of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, and&#xD;
      is intended to deliver more drug to the tumor with reduced toxicity on normal tissues. The&#xD;
      study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IT-141, and to investigate&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and possible pharmacodynamics (PD) relationships. Patients&#xD;
      will also be monitored for any response to therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive subjects on combination anti-retroviral therapy due to the&#xD;
             potential for PK interactions with the study agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of ischemia or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, or any&#xD;
             significant abnormality on ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A QTc interval outside of normal. (Normal: &lt; 450 msec for males and &lt; 460 msec for&#xD;
