  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study in which the the safety and feasibility of secukinumab in HS patients&#xD;
      as well as information about the effect size will be determined in order to inform a future&#xD;
      larger randomized control trial with an active comparator.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secukinumab is an antibody that inhibits Interleukin-17A, and IL-17 promotes neutrophil&#xD;
      activities. Neutrophils are found in large numbers in HS. The expression of the inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines IL-17, IL-1β, and TNF-α were enhanced in lesional skin of HS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior studies have demonstrated improvement in HS with biologic medications such as the tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor inhibitors adalimumab and infliximab. Studies have shown conflicting data&#xD;
      regarding the efficacy of etanercept for HS and success with anakinra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an initial pilot study of secukinumab for the purpose of studying how it may alter HS&#xD;
      disease symptoms. This study is not intended to alter indications for drug use but may inform&#xD;
      the design of an efficacy study that may alter FDA labeling changes in the future. There are&#xD;
      limitations of this study that arise from it being a single-arm clinical trial with a small&#xD;
      number of subjects. These limitations include the limited generalizability knowledge of this&#xD;
      study due to the lack of an active comparator. However, the data obtained from this study&#xD;
      will potentially be used to support the design of larger future randomized placebo controlled&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
