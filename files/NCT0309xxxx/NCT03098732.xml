      The objective of the MEDIS study is to determine if subjects experiencing an Acute Ischaemic&#xD;
      Stroke due to large vessel occlusion, treated with IV tPA combined with the MED procedure&#xD;
      have a greater likelihood of recanalisation 30-90 minutes after the completion of tPA&#xD;
      infusion than subjects treated with IV tPA (plus sham device). Safety of the MED System&#xD;
      Procedure will be evaluated by the incidence of symptomatic PH-2 haemorrhagic transformation&#xD;
      within 24 hours following the procedure. Lastly, a health economics study will be conducted&#xD;
      to estimate health care costs for each treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a global, multicentre prospective, randomised, single blind, blinded endpoint&#xD;
      study comparing rates of early recanalisation (defined by mAOL) in Acute Ischaemic Stroke&#xD;
      (AIS) subjects with visible occlusion who are treated with either IV tPA plus sham device or&#xD;
      IV tPA in combination with the MED System procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be randomised 1:1 into two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Sham Control Group (SCG) and an&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental Treatment Group (ETG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ETG will receive IV tPA and the complete MED System procedure consisting of MED&#xD;
      MicroBeads and the MED Workstation magnet procedure. The SCG will not receive MED MicroBeads&#xD;
      while the MED Workstation will be activated as a Sham control. Subjects will be blinded to&#xD;
      treatment arm. Stratification will be performed based upon baseline age and location of the&#xD;
      occlusion (Middle Cerebral Artery segments M1, M2, or Carotid Terminus).&#xD;
