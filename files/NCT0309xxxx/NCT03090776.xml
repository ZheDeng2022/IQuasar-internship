      Aim 1: To determine the effectiveness of perioperatively administered ketamine to decrease&#xD;
      acute and persistent postmastectomy pain (PPMP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.1: Patients undergoing partial or total mastectomy treated with a bolus and&#xD;
      perioperative infusion of the NMDA-receptor antagonist ketamine will have decreased&#xD;
      postoperative pain and opioid utilization compared to those receiving saline control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.2: Patients undergoing partial or total mastectomy treated with a bolus and&#xD;
      perioperative infusion of the NMDA-receptor antagonist ketamine will have decreased&#xD;
      persistent postoperative pain measured at one year after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine whether there is increased power to detect therapeutic effectiveness in&#xD;
      an interventional preventive trial, by enrichment with patients at high risk of PPMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.1: Ketamine will have a greater analgesic and opioid sparing effect on pain&#xD;
      scores in high-risk patients than non-high risk patients, compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.2: Ketamine will have a greater preventive effect on pain burden scores at one&#xD;
      year after surgery in high-risk patients than non-high risk patients, compared to placebo.&#xD;

      V. STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Preoperative evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Psychosocial Assessment: After the patient gives informed consent, preoperative&#xD;
           demographic, medical, psychosocial and pain questionnaires will be completed by the&#xD;
           patient during their preoperative office visit. Questionnaires assessing psychosocial&#xD;
           factors have been chosen based upon previous retrospective association with PPMP, and&#xD;
           preliminary evidence from our prospective study in the same population, strong&#xD;
           psychometric validation characteristics, and brevity. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale&#xD;
           (PCS), which has been validated in pain patients and controls, will be used to measure&#xD;
           catastrophic thinking associated with pain. Depressive symptoms, anxiety and sleep&#xD;
           disturbance will be assessed using short-form instruments from the NIH roadmap&#xD;
           initiative, Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS). The PROMIS&#xD;
           instruments have been extensively validated in studies comparing results with&#xD;
           established scales, and have been calibrated on over 20,000 persons.The Brief Symptom&#xD;
           Index 18-Somatization Scale, also previously validated in chronic pain patients, will be&#xD;
           used to measure somatization. The Positive Affect/Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) measures&#xD;
           affective stance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pain assessment: The primary pain outcome measure will be Pain Burden Index as measured&#xD;
           by the Breast Cancer Pain Questionnaire (BCPQ), which was originally developed by&#xD;
           Gartner et al and used in over 600 patients in our previous studies. The BCPQ includes&#xD;
           assessment of average pain, pain frequency (how many days/week), and specific assessment&#xD;
           of pain at 4 body areas (breast, arm, side, axilla), from which a Pain Burden Index&#xD;
           (PBI) can be calculated. A later iteration of the BCPQ also includes questions about&#xD;
           other body pain, seeking medical help for pain, painkiller use, neuropathic/sensory&#xD;
           symptoms, and functional impairment due to pain, and has been successfully employed in&#xD;
           our current prospective observational study. We will also use the Brief Pain Inventory,&#xD;
           a well-validated general measure of pain and disability worst pain, least pain, and&#xD;
           interference. We will supplement this with a standard VAS assessing pain with and&#xD;
           without arm movement and deep inspiration. The Pain Coping Questionnaire will be&#xD;
           administered to prospectively assay for effective coping strategies used by patients and&#xD;
           we will use a 2 item version of this questionnaire to assess the use of these&#xD;
           strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Quantitative sensory testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Pressure pain testing methods: Pressure pain threshold and tolerance will be&#xD;
                assessed in a similar manner to our previous studies using a digital pressure&#xD;
                algometer (Wagner FDX, Greenwich, CT, USA) with a flat round transducer, probe area&#xD;
                0.785 cm2. Testing sites will be bilateral on the dorsal aspect of the proximal&#xD;
                forearm (extremity site) and over the trapezius muscle at the upper back (truncal&#xD;
                site). For pressure threshold determination, pressure is increased at a steady rate&#xD;
                of approximately 1 lb/second until subject indicates that the pressure is first&#xD;
                perceived as painful. Pressure Pain Tolerance will be determined by instructing&#xD;
                patients to indicate the pressure at which the pain was no longer tolerable. Two&#xD;
                trials will be performed at each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Temporal Summation testing methods: Mechanical pinprick pain will be assessed in a&#xD;
                similar manner to our previous studies using standardized weighted pinprick&#xD;
                applicators similar to those described by Rolke et al using a range of forces (128&#xD;
                mN, 256mN and 512mN) which result in a painful sensation in most subjects. First, a&#xD;
                single stimulation of the lower force pinprick will be applied to the dorsal aspect&#xD;
                of the index finger between the first and second interphalangeal joints of the each&#xD;
                hand while resting palm down on the armrest, and then rated by the subject on a&#xD;
                scale of 0-10. Next, after a break of at least 10 seconds, a train of 10 stimuli&#xD;
                will be applied at the same premarked spot, at a rate of 1 stimulation/second. The&#xD;
                subject will rate pain on a scale of 0-10 after the first, fifth and tenth&#xD;
                stimulus, then rate any ongoing pain 15 seconds after cessation of the last&#xD;
                stimulus. The same procedure will be repeated on the third finger of the each hand.&#xD;
                Subjects will undergo two trials at each force, with a break of at least one minute&#xD;
                between trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2. Perioperative intervention Patients will receive a 0.5 mg/kg dose of IV ketamine (max&#xD;
           dose 50 mg) or the same volume of saline 15 minutes after induction of general&#xD;
           anesthesia. Thereafter, a continuous infusion of 0.15 mg/kg/hr ketamine with a maximum&#xD;
           dose of 15 mg/hr or saline will be administered until the end of surgery (when the&#xD;
           surgical closure has begun, approximately 30-60 minutes prior to emergence from general&#xD;
           anesthesia). The investigational drug service will prepare blinded solutions (2 mg/mL&#xD;
           ketamine or saline) and deliver to OR pharmacy before the beginning of each case to&#xD;
           hands-on providers. Cost of ketamine is $12 per 200 mg vial, and will be covered by the&#xD;
           NIH K23 budget. General anesthesia will be provided by the hands-on anesthetist, who&#xD;
           will be free to use at their discretion the following anesthetic drugs, which are&#xD;
           typically used in this population, and are all compatible in solution with ketamine:&#xD;
           Midazolam 2 mg, Fentanyl &lt;500 mcg, Dilaudid &lt;5 mg total, Propofol 1-2 mg/kg, Lidocaine&#xD;
           50-100 mg, Vecuronium, Rocuronium, succinylcholine or Cisatracurium as needed, Zofran 4&#xD;
           mg, Decadron 4 mg, Cefazolin, Glycopyrrolate and Neostigmine as needed for reversal, as&#xD;
           well as inhalational agents other than nitrous oxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject and investigator blinding of screening and treatment: As part of informed consent,&#xD;
      subjects will be appraised of the fact that the study investigates risk of short- and&#xD;
      long-term pain and whether people in different risk groups respond to a treatment, but will&#xD;
      not be told whether they are considered high- or low- risk, or whether they received ketamine&#xD;
      or placebo. Effectiveness of blinding will be assessed by querying patients about which group&#xD;
      they think they are in on POD1. Investigator and hands-on provider will be blind to treatment&#xD;
      (ketamine vs placebo). Nursing staff in PACU will be appraised of the fact that patients are&#xD;
      in a study, but also blinded to the treatment. Effectiveness of blinding of study staff who&#xD;
      is asking patient to rate perioperative pain will be achieved by having this study staff&#xD;
      record their impression of group on a single item questionnaire in the Redcap system.&#xD;
      Responses of patient and study staff as to their impression of group will be compared to&#xD;
      actual group at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Perioperative data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Surgical, Anesthetic, and analgesic data collection: Using the Weiner preoperative&#xD;
           evaluation center email alert system, the hands-on anesthetist and/or anesthesiologist&#xD;
           will be contacted to inform them on the patient's participation in the study, and given&#xD;
           instructions about the volume of bolus and rate of infusion. The total time and volume&#xD;
           of infusion will be recorded will be recorded in the anesthetic record, so that a total&#xD;
           dose of ketamine can be calculated. In order to adjust for potential impact of other&#xD;
           anesthetic techniques or pharmacological agents on PPMP, the following data will be&#xD;
           extracted from the electronic anesthesia record: Primary anesthetic method (volatile vs.&#xD;
           IV propanol vs. regional/paravertebral vs. combined PVB/GA), amount and type of local&#xD;
           anesthetic administered, and opioid analgesic used (the latter expressed as morphine&#xD;
           equivalent units/hr). In addition, information about other relevant analgesic&#xD;
           preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative medications such as Oxycontin,&#xD;
           gabapentin, pregabalin, and dexmedetomidine will be gathered from the electronic record.&#xD;
           Other potentially confounding intraoperative factors such as vasopressor use/amount,&#xD;
           fluids or blood administered, total anesthesia time, and airway management (LMA, ETT, or&#xD;
           native) will be recorded. Among this group of breast surgeons, there is relative&#xD;
           homogeneity in anatomical technique and tissue disturbance, although there is some&#xD;
           variation in dissection technique. Detailed assessment of surgical technique will&#xD;
           include primary surgeon, duration of surgery, presence of bilateral surgery, type of&#xD;
           surgery (total mastectomy, segmental mastectomy), performance of nodal dissection&#xD;
           (axillary or sentinel node), and presence and type of concurrent reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acute postoperative pain assessment: Initial pain score upon arrival will be assessed by&#xD;
           PACU nursing staff and/or anesthetist. One hour and 24 hours after PACU arrival, patient&#xD;
           will be assessed by research study personnel, being asked to rate pain at rest, with arm&#xD;
           movement, and with maximal deep inspiration using the pain verbal rating scale (VRS).&#xD;
           Presence of nausea and treatment with supplemental antiemetics in recovery area will be&#xD;
           recorded. In addition, opioid consumption and adjuvant analgesic use will be ascertained&#xD;
           from the patient's medication administration record. Upon discharge, which is typically&#xD;
           on POD1 or 2 for mastectomy patients, total postoperative opioid use/hours of&#xD;
           postoperative time as inpatient will be calculated and expressed in morphine equivalent&#xD;
           units/hr. On postoperative day 1, mastectomy patients will undergo brief bedside QST (as&#xD;
           at preoperative evaluation, described above).&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Persistent pain, long term psychosocial and psychophysical assessment: Follow up&#xD;
           assessments of persistent pain using the BCPQ, BPI, VAS, and pain coping questionnaires&#xD;
           will be made at 2 weeks, 3 mo, 6 mo, 12, and 24 mo, with follow-up either via secure&#xD;
           link to the REDcap electronic data capture system. Patients are seen at visits with the&#xD;
           surgical team, or oncologists at these times. The brief QST and psychosocial&#xD;
           questionnaires will be re-administered at 2 weeks and 1 year postoperatively during one&#xD;
           of the patient's follow-up visits.&#xD;
