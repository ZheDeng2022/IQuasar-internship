  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute cannabis administration is reported to alleviate HIV neuropathic pain (HIV-NP), but&#xD;
      there is limited knowledge about the effects of cannabis constituents (delta-9&#xD;
      tetrahydrocannabinol/THC and cannabidiol/CBD), the consequences of long-term cannabis use,&#xD;
      and the impact of cannabis on endocannabinoid (EC) function in people living with HIV- NP.&#xD;
      Our objective is to address these three fundamental gaps in our knowledge by: 1) examining&#xD;
      the acute effects of various CBD/THC products on HIV-NP, 2) utilizing a mHealth text&#xD;
      messaging protocol, Individual Monitoring of Pain and Cannabis Taken (IMPACT) to monitor&#xD;
      daily real-world cannabis use and changes in pain; and 3) studying the relationship between&#xD;
      cannabinoids, EC biomarkers, and chronic neuropathic pain&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our objective is to assess 120 community-dwelling people living with HIV who have neuropathic&#xD;
      pain and are currently using cannabis. These participants will be enrolled in a study that&#xD;
      consists of two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1) This will involve a cross over study involving three different doses of vaporized&#xD;
      cannabis that contain THC and varying concentrations of CBD:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low CBD session: 8 puffs of 1.6% THC + 0.09 CBD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medium CBD sessions: 4 puffs of 1.6% THC + 0.09 CBD plus 4 puffs of 1.73% THC + 5.4% CBD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High CBD sessions: 8 puffs of 1.73% THC + 5.4% CBD&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase will examine the acute effects of cannabis on pain intensity, blood&#xD;
      endocannabinoid levels, and the relationship of pain with heart rate variability (HRV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2) This phase will involve the association between dispensary-obtained cannabis and&#xD;
      changes in pain reported via IMPACT, a mHealth text messaging program that will serve as a&#xD;
      useful tool to monitor the relationship between pain and cannabis use. Text messaging is an&#xD;
      effective method to modify health behaviors, monitor substance use, and track pain. Our group&#xD;
      has recently demonstrated the feasibility of using short message service (SMS) texting to&#xD;
      promote anti-retroviral therapy adherence and monitor daily methamphetamine (METH) use in&#xD;
      persons living with HIV neuropathy with bipolar disorder or METH dependence.&#xD;
