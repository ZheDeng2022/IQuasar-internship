      This is a prospective, multicenter, non-blinded, non-randomized study of the RelayPro&#xD;
      Thoracic Stent-Graft in subjects with traumatic injury of the DTA in subjects who are&#xD;
      candidates for endovascular repair.The primary objective of the study is all-cause mortality&#xD;
      at 30 days post procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the trial will include descriptive analyses of procedural and&#xD;
      post-procedural observations through 5 years of follow-up.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have a traumatic injury of the descending thoracic aorta that occurred no&#xD;
             more than 30 days prior to the planned stent implant procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Proximal and distal landing zones with diameter between 19 mm and 42 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have a proximal attachment zone distal to the left common carotid and a&#xD;
             distal attachment zone proximal to the origin of the celiac artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The length of the attachment zones will depend on the intended stent graft diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. The proximal attachment zone should be: i. 15 mm for 22 - 28 mm grafts with bare&#xD;
                  stent (20 mm for RelayPro grafts with non-bare stent). ii. 20 mm for 30 - 46 mm&#xD;
                  grafts with bare stent (25 mm for RelayPro grafts with non-bare stent).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. The distal attachment zone should be 20 mm for all Relay Pro grafts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Coverage of the left subclavian artery is permitted. Revascularization of the left&#xD;
             subclavian artery may be considered in all cases by the treating physician and,&#xD;
             especially, in anatomies where revascularization is determined to be clinically&#xD;
             necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Proximal and distal attachment zones containing a straight segment (non-tapered,&#xD;
             non-reverse tapered, defined by &lt;10% diameter change) with lengths equal to or greater&#xD;
             than the required attachment length for the intended device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate iliac or femoral artery access for introduction of the RelayPro delivery&#xD;
             system. Alternative methods to gain proper access may be utilized (e.g., iliac&#xD;
             conduit).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject willing to comply with the follow-up evaluation schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject (or Legally Authorized Representative, LAR) agrees to sign an Informed Consent&#xD;
             Form prior to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant stenosis, calcification, thrombus, or tortuosity of intended fixation&#xD;
             sites that would compromise fixation or seal of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;

             compromise circulation to the carotid, vertebral, or innominate arteries after device&#xD;
             placement, and are not amenable to subclavian revascularization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior endovascular or surgical repair in the DTA. The device may not be placed within&#xD;
             any prior endovascular or surgical graft.&#xD;

             less than 6 months prior to the planned stent implant procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Untreatable allergy or sensitivity to contrast media or device components.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected connective tissue disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood coagulation disorder or bleeding diathesis for which the treatment cannot be&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Coronary artery disease with unstable angina.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class IV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stroke and/or Myocardial Infarction within 3 months of the planned treatment date.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary disease requiring the routine (daily or nightly) need for oxygen therapy&#xD;
             outside the hospital setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute renal failure or chronic renal insufficiency, and not receiving dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemodynamically unstable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active systemic infection and/or mycotic aneurysms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Morbid obesity or other condition that may compromise or prevent the necessary imaging&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Injury Severity Score of 75.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Less than two-year life expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or planned participation in an investigational drug or device study that has&#xD;
             not completed primary endpoint evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the course of the study.&#xD;
