      An immunotherapy study combining ipilimumab and evofosfamide for the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with confirmed metastatic or locally advanced prostate cancer, metastatic pancreatic cancer,&#xD;
      melanoma or human papillomavirus (HPV) negative squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck that&#xD;
      have failed to respond to standard therapy, progressed despite standard therapy, for which&#xD;
      standard therapy does not offer the potential for increased survival.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tumor hypoxia can lead to poor effector T cell penetration and immunosuppressive signaling&#xD;
      via myeloid-derived suppressor, myofibroblast and regulatory T cells. Disruption of these&#xD;
      hypoxic regions within the tumor microenvironment by the hypoxia-directed cytotoxic agent&#xD;
      evofosfamide may enhance the ability of the CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab to reject&#xD;
      otherwise resistant solid tumors. Additionally, induction of immunogenic cell death of tumor&#xD;
      cells by evofosfamide may enhance dendritic cell presentation of tumor antigens to&#xD;
      lymphocytes in draining lymph nodes, leading to clonal expansion of tumor-specific T cells,&#xD;
      especially in combination with ipilimumab.&#xD;
