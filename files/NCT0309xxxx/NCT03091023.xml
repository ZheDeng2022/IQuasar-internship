      This project aims to study the endometrial transcriptome at the single cell level in both&#xD;
      endometrial native tissue (biopsies) and endometrial fluid. Basically, the goals are: 1) To&#xD;
      use the resolution provided by single-cell RNA-seq to deconvolute real time dynamics in&#xD;
      endometrium transcriptome throughout the menstrual cycle from artifacts produced by known&#xD;
      population heterogeneity, and 2) To use endometrium fluid to replace endometrium biopsies as&#xD;
      signal source to develop a new diagnostic platform to determine the endometrium receptive&#xD;
      state which is high resolution and minimally invasive. This study will provide an&#xD;
      unprecedented high-resolution characterization of the endometrium cellular hierarchy via&#xD;
      whole transcriptome analysis throughout the menstrual stages. These results will lead to a&#xD;
      robust definition of stage-defining gene expression signatures and resolve the long-standing&#xD;
      inconsistencies originating from bulk tissue studies. The dataset will be further explored&#xD;
      via informatics tools to provide biological insights into the dynamics of endometrium and&#xD;
      initiate new anchor points for functional studies.&#xD;

      Successful embryo implantations for in vitro fertilization require both healthy embryos and a&#xD;
      receptive endometrium. The window of implantation (WOI), during which endometrium reaches&#xD;
      receptive state, varies among individuals. Displacements of WOI have been reported to be a&#xD;
      major cause of repeated implantation failures. However, a reliable diagnostic metric to&#xD;
      evaluate endometrial receptive status is lacking. The propose of this study is to use&#xD;
      single-cell RNA seq and bioinformatics tools to develop a high-resolution platform to&#xD;
      characterize endometrium activities and to measure endometrial receptive state in a&#xD;
      non-invasive manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First objective is to develop an experimental pipeline to generate high quality single-cell&#xD;
      RNA-seq data from endometrial biopsies and endometrial fluid from healthy patients throughout&#xD;
      the menstrual cycle at each of these stages: early proliferative (EP; days 0-8), late&#xD;
      proliferative (LP; days 9-14), early secretory (ES; days 15-18), mid-secretory or receptive&#xD;
      (MS; days 19-23), and late secretory (LS; days 24-30). These tissues will be dissociated&#xD;
      mechanically and enzymatically and subjected to microfluidic sorting, single cell&#xD;
      transcriptome amplification and analysis. These data will provide the first&#xD;
      transcriptome-wide single cell data various cell types of the human endometrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, this study look at establish algorithmic models to distinguish epithelial and&#xD;
      stroma populations informatically, without the need to first purify populations of interest.&#xD;
      This will enable transcriptome analysis from mixed populations of cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally evaluate the use of endometrial fluid as an alternative source for receptivity&#xD;
      diagnosis analyzing the transcriptome profile of single cells from Endometrial fluid&#xD;
      collected from human patients at different menstrual stages. These signatures will also be&#xD;
      compared and correlated with signatures obtained from biopsies, which will help us better&#xD;
      understand the biological events that lead to the occurrence of these cells in the&#xD;
      endometrial fluid and evaluate the potential of extending their use for diagnosis of other&#xD;
      endometrium conditions.&#xD;
