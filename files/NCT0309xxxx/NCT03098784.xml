      The goal of this study is to assess the respiratory health of the Air France company's&#xD;
      employees working in the Marseilles and Paris airports (flight line and administrative&#xD;
      employees). This study was promoted by the Montpellier CHRU, Regional University Hospital&#xD;
      Centre (ANSM identification number 2011-A00646-35). It allowes voluntary employees to be&#xD;
      involved. They answer a lifestyle survey and perform a spirometry, an exhaled CO measurement&#xD;
      and a sampling of exhaled air condensate (EAC). A metrological study of particles emitted by&#xD;
      aircraft engines and found in the airport environment will be conducted and the elementary&#xD;
      chemical composition analysis, as well a sieve analysis of particles present in the EAC will&#xD;
      be conducted.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Air traffic is increasing, raising concern about local pollution and its adverse health&#xD;
      effects on the people living in the vicinity of large airports. However, the highest risk is&#xD;
      probably occupational exposure due to proximity. Jet exhaust is one of the main concerns at&#xD;
      an airport and may have a health impact, particularly on the respiratory tract. Current&#xD;
      studies are neither numerous enough nor strong enough to prove this kind of association. Yet,&#xD;
      more and more people work in airports, and occupational exposure to jet exhaust is a fact. In&#xD;
      1999, the effect of occupational exposure to aircraft fuel and jet exhaust on pulmonary&#xD;
      function and respiratory symptoms in Birmingham International Airport (Birmingham, UK)&#xD;
      workers was reported. This work suggested that there was a link between high occupational&#xD;
      exposure to aviation fuel or jet exhaust and excess respiratory tract symptoms, consistent&#xD;
      with the presence of a respiratory irritant. It was a cross-sectional survey using a&#xD;
      questionnaire filled out by the participants themselves. Respiratory and immunological&#xD;
      function assessments and an exhaled carbon monoxide measurement were conducted with male&#xD;
      full-time airport workers classified into three groups according to their exposure level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be presented to the volunteering subjects during an occupational medical&#xD;
      appointment concerning their company. The information letter will be provided as well as the&#xD;
      informed consent form to be filled for the study. Once the subjects have agreed to&#xD;
      participate, self-surveys on their lifestyle habits will be filled and EACand urine samplings&#xD;
      will be taken during one same consultation, in addition to exhaled CO and No measurements.&#xD;
      This consultation will also include a spirometry test. The employees' workstation data will&#xD;
      be collected. Therefore, the volunteers' participation is limited to one single visit&#xD;
      including non-invasive examinations and self-surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method details:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survey: The survey breaks down into 2 parts, with a total of 94 items. The first part&#xD;
           bears on the employees' respiratory health condition, essentially grounded on the&#xD;
           validated EGEA survey. The rest focuses on employees' lifestyle habits, both&#xD;
           professionally (outdoor and indoor working time, trade, type of exposure, etc.) and&#xD;
           personally (geographical situation of the home, type of town or community, heating&#xD;
           system, usual mode of cooking, etc.). The survey is anonymised and the answers are&#xD;
           automatically read by datascan process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spirometry: This method allows a non-invasive, simple and repeatable assessment of the&#xD;
           respiratory function. It is indispensable to clearly explain the process to the patient.&#xD;
           The patient sits with his or her back straight during the process. Once the subject and&#xD;
           the device are ready, the subject deeply breathes in to fill the lungs then fully&#xD;
           expires into the spirometer. Then the subject breathes in fully and forcedly in order to&#xD;
           obtain the inspiratory curve. The spirometry results are compared with theoretical or&#xD;
           predicted values determined based on patient's age, gender, size and ethnic group.&#xD;
           Consequently, according to the subject's breathing speed and force intensity,&#xD;
           measurements of vital capacity (VC) or forced vital capacity (FVC) are obtained. The&#xD;
           curves will allow the other variables to be deduced, such as maximum expiratory volume&#xD;
           per second (MEVS) or peak expiratory flow (PEF), or mean expiratory flows (MEF 25-75).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exhaled CO measurement (confounding factors of the respiratory function, in order to&#xD;
           reflect the smoking status):the employee blows into the device's single-use cardboard&#xD;
           mouthpiece after a deep inspiration followed by a fifteen-second apnea computed by the&#xD;
           device. The measurement in part per million (ppm) is immediately displayed on the device&#xD;
           to quantify the severity of CO intoxication. This measurement is simple and repeatable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exhaled air condensate:for EAC acquisition. In fact, the RTube device is well adapted to&#xD;
           non-invasion collection on the companies' sites. It will be used according to the&#xD;
           recommendations from the American Thoracic Society and the EuropeanRespiratory Society.&#xD;
           The R tube will be pre-treated as in the first study (intensive washing in order to&#xD;
           abate background noise) and &quot;white&quot; R tubeswill be collected all through the study to&#xD;
           check the method's detection limit. Briefly, the collection with nose blocked lasts for&#xD;
           15 minutes during which the subject breathes normally through the device. The mouth is&#xD;
           rinsed with water before collection and the subject is asked to refrain from drinking or&#xD;
           eating during the previous hour. This will allow ca. 1.4 ml to be collected (mean&#xD;
           EACvolume collected during the first study over a 15-minute breathing time).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metrology:as this is a recent subject, there is no consensus so far on the most&#xD;
           representative unit of measurement for employee exposure. Similarly, no current device&#xD;
           allows all parameters to be obtained:quantitative data (particle content/cm3, sieve&#xD;
           distribution, developed surface area of the alveolar fraction likely to be exposed in&#xD;
           the breathing apparatus) and qualitative data (morphology, aggregation/agglomeration&#xD;
           status, listof constitutive chemical elements). These experts' surveys require the&#xD;
           implementation of different equipment. The method is based on personal metrology, use of&#xD;
           portable and individual systems, as well as fixed installation metrology, organised into&#xD;
           a single sampling by means of a cane to which the various measuring instruments are&#xD;
           connected (Condensation ParticleCounter, ElectrostaticLow Pressure Impactor, Scanning&#xD;
           MobilityParticleSizer, FastMobilityParticleSizer, Nanometer Surface Area Monitor,&#xD;
           Alveolar Sensor, Alveolar Inhalable Thoracic sensor).An independent counter&#xD;
           (Condensation ParticleCounter) allows background evolution to be monitored. Membrane&#xD;
           sensors (such as the Giliansampling pump with membrane support) will also complement the&#xD;
           process. They will be used as portable systems, on the employees involved in the study.&#xD;
           Finally, the samples will be analysed by means of a SEM (Scanning Electron&#xD;
           Microscope),model 5500 from Hitachi, associated with an energy-dispersive EDX system (X&#xD;
           analysis system - Noranmodel from the Thermocompany).&#xD;
