    <textblock>
      This is a study in adult patients with different types of cancer. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to find a safe dose of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Xentuzumab in combination with abemaciclib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Xentuzumab in combination with abemaciclib and hormonal therapies The study also tests&#xD;
           whether these medicines make tumours shrink in participants with lung and breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can stay in the study as long as they benefit from and can tolerate treatment.&#xD;
      All participants get xentuzumab infusions and abemaciclib tablets. Participants who have&#xD;
      breast cancer get different types of hormonal therapies in addition to xentuzumab and&#xD;
      abemaciclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all participants, the size of the tumour is measured regularly. Doctors also regularly&#xD;
      check the general health of the participants.&quot;&#xD;
