  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Substance abuse and dependence is highly prevalent among people living with HIV and&#xD;
      significantly exacerbates morbidity and mortality and accelerates HIV disease progression.&#xD;
      Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been the single most important treatment for slowing disease&#xD;
      progression. ART adherence and HIV primary care are affected by a complex array of factors in&#xD;
      the context of lives impacted by socioeconomic, psychological, and health challenges. Drugs&#xD;
      and alcohol play a major role in non-adherence, engagement in care, and poor health outcomes&#xD;
      among HIV-infected persons. While evidence is unequivocal that substance use treatment&#xD;
      improves health outcomes, systems of care for the detection and treatment of substance abuse&#xD;
      and dependence remain fragmented. Integrated approaches are key to the delivery of optimal&#xD;
      care. Pragmatic or effectiveness trials can provide the best evidence about clinical practice&#xD;
      to inform practitioners and policy makes about the most clinically and cost effective&#xD;
      treatment to inform dissemination on a wider scale at the organizational and public health&#xD;
      levels. The goal of this trial is to develop and test a comprehensive, integrated program to&#xD;
      detect and reduce substance abuse and in turn, to improve ART adherence and HIV, substance&#xD;
      use and associated health outcomes among HIV-infected patients. This trial will test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention using a stepped wedge trial design to sequentially&#xD;
      implement a screening tool and training of patient health navigators at HIV clinics in NYC.&#xD;

      The goal of this research study is to develop an organizational-level intervention to enhance&#xD;
      the adoption of screening for and treatment of substance use disorders among HIV-positive&#xD;
      patients receiving care at the Institute for Advanced Medicine HIV primary care clinics. The&#xD;
      primary research question is: What is the impact of a brief substance abuse screener and&#xD;
      treatment referral process on substance use and HIV-related health outcomes among&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients attending HIV care clinics?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will achieve four specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Develop an intervention to integrate substance abuse treatment with HIV care in a&#xD;
      consortium of HIV clinics in New York City. The principal investigator will conduct formative&#xD;
      research and utilize the study team's findings about existing systems and approaches utilized&#xD;
      at the Mount Sinai Health System to: 1) incorporate a brief screening tool to identify&#xD;
      patients in need of further assessment or treatment for substance abuse; and 2) train patient&#xD;
      health navigators (PHNs) in motivational interviewing (MI) to engage patients for substance&#xD;
      abuse treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Test the effectiveness of the intervention using a stepped wedge trial design to&#xD;
      sequentially implement a screening tool and training of PHNs at the IAM HIV clinics. The&#xD;
      primary goal is to test the effectiveness of intervention components versus treatment as&#xD;
      usual (TAU) in identifying HIV infected persons with a substance use disorder and in linking&#xD;
      them to substance abuse treatment. Secondary goals include examining the intersection among&#xD;
      problematic substance use, HIV medication adherence, and HIV-related and other comorbid&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Develop optimized technologies within the electronic health record (EHR) system used&#xD;
      at the HIV clinics and integrate these with existing substance-use treatment mobile&#xD;
      applications to retain patients in recovery and relapse prevention. This will specifically&#xD;
      entail use of a MyChart mobile patient portal in an Office of the National Coordinator for&#xD;
      Health Information Technology (ONC) certified EHRs (Epic, Epic Systems Corporation, Verona,&#xD;
      WI). The Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and&#xD;
      Clinical Health (HITECH) Act place strong emphasis on the widespread adoption and&#xD;
      implementation of EHR systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing this organizational-level intervention.&#xD;
      In order to enhance the likelihood of widespread implementation, the study team will conduct&#xD;
      analyses to assess the cost-effectiveness of implementing the intervention components versus&#xD;
      TAU alone.&#xD;
