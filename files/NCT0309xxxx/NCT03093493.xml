  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are planning to collected blood and saliva for DNA extraction to use for genetic testing&#xD;
      of children and adults with EDS and their relatives. Medical records from other institutions&#xD;
      and clinical notes for visits in Dr. Holick's clinic will be reviewed to obtain the following&#xD;
      information: previous diagnosis at other institutions, age, clinical signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      EDS, Joints Hypermobility Syndrome (JHS), , and other metabolic or genetic disorders and&#xD;
      laboratory results, radiology reports and images, and genetic testing that supports these&#xD;
      diagnoses. Subjects' peripheral vein blood and saliva will be taken. No clinical&#xD;
      intervention/randomizations will be performed. No patients' identifiers will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study genomic DNA will be extracted and will be used for genotyping as&#xD;
      sequencing in 30 EDS patients and their 30 relatives with or without EDS to compare genetic&#xD;
      variations between them. After validation by Sanger sequencing for these variations, we plan&#xD;
      to prepare a genetic panel for EDS. After all validation testing, we plan to evaluate the&#xD;
      saliva DNA in a similar manner and compare the results with those obtained from the DNA from&#xD;
      the blood sample. The purpose is that if they are comparable, we will be able to use saliva&#xD;
      in place of blood as it easier method for accessing a person's DNA. This will be especially&#xD;
      helpful for evaluating infants or those patients who prefer not to have a blood sample drawn.&#xD;
      NOTE: Results of this study will not be disclosed to subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a genetic disease that affects collagen synthesis and&#xD;
      structure resulting in multisystem connective tissue involvement with twelve different&#xD;
      subtypes. The clinical manifestations of EDS include skin hyperextensibility, skin fragility,&#xD;
      joint hypermobility, muscle hypotonia, easy bruising, and mast cell hypersensitivity. We&#xD;
      recently reported a cases series of EDS patients with different signs and symptoms. Most were&#xD;
      evaluated along with their parents for evidence of acquired or inherited bone diseases. What&#xD;
      is remarkable is that 93% of our cases at least one parent had clinically documented evidence&#xD;
      for EDS a genetic disorder that compromises the structural integrity of the collagen/elastin&#xD;
      matrix. Most of the parents were unaware they had this genetic disorder and the diagnosis was&#xD;
      made for the first time in our clinic. Our previous study for reviewing patient's medical&#xD;
      records was approved by the Boston University Medical Center's IRB. We have access to EDS&#xD;
      patients from referrals and from Dr Holick's clinic. We plan to collect the blood and saliva&#xD;
      samples from EDS patients and their relatives for this genetic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic evaluation in limited number of our patients showed some causative variations. For&#xD;
      example, one of our cases the patient was evaluated at an outside hospital for a causative&#xD;
      variant in the COL5A1, COL5A2, FKBP14, and TNXB genes, which were negative, but she was found&#xD;
      later to have a causative variant in serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade F, member 1 (SERPINF1)&#xD;
      gene. A causative variation in SERPINF1 gene has been associated with osteogenesis imperfecta&#xD;
      (OI) /EDS overlap syndrome and the mutation in this gene causes type VI OI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The highly variable clinical presentation of patients with the hypermobility and clinical&#xD;
      signs for EDS prompted an effort to classify patients with EDS into more homogeneous groups&#xD;
      that can aid in diagnosis and management. This resulted in the establishment of 14 types&#xD;
      (include 6 major types and 8 minor types). This classification acknowledges the presence of&#xD;
      &quot;others&quot; including &quot;unspecified&quot; forms making it clear that the clinical and genetic&#xD;
      heterogeneity of EDS could not be fully captured by that classification. Indeed, there have&#xD;
      been numerous reports of patients with hereditary disorders of connective tissue, which have&#xD;
      overlapping clinical manifestations of EDS, but do not meet the diagnostic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For decades, the genetic basis of heritable disorders of connective tissue had remained&#xD;
      largely unknown. The rise of molecular genetics and its advances in next-generation&#xD;
      sequencing has unlocked doors that continues to lead to major advances in understanding the&#xD;
      causative genes for many genetic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of subjects with these conditions often includes molecular testing which has&#xD;
      important counseling, therapeutic and sometimes legal implications. An accurate molecular&#xD;
      diagnosis can provide the basis for counseling regarding prognosis and reproductive options.&#xD;
      Accurate genetic diagnosis has been shown to provide psychological benefits to patients and&#xD;
      their families. In order to facilitate sequencing of multiple genes causing some of the&#xD;
      common forms of these heritable conditions, we have designed this genetic study to obtain&#xD;
      data for the genetic variations of EDS by next generation sequencing. The next generation&#xD;
      sequencing panel may be of value in guiding future clinical pathways for genetic diagnosis in&#xD;
      EDS. We plan to recruit EDS patients and their relatives for genetic testing. We also plan to&#xD;
      submit a NIH grant for this purpose and provide required preliminary data through this pilot&#xD;
      grant about genetic variation of EDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare genetic variations in EDS patients with their relatives.&#xD;
      We expect to find some genetic variations that may explain clinical signs and symptoms in EDS&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective is to provide a novel testing panel on a single diagnostic platform for&#xD;
      EDS. After performing next generation sequencing, we plan to design a genetic panel for EDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third objective will be to determine if saliva can be as good and reliable source of DNA&#xD;
      for genetic testing as DNA obtained from blood.&#xD;
