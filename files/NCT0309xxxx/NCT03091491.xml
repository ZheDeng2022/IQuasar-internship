  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Nivolumab in combination with Ipilimumab is&#xD;
      associated with superior response rate compared to Nivolumab alone in patients with advanced&#xD;
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer who have&#xD;
      failed one line of standard EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor and not more than one line of&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen. This study also aims to determine predictive biomarkers of&#xD;
      response/benefit in patients with EGFR mutation positive NSCLC.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the outcome of nivolumab single agent versus nivolumab-ipilimumab&#xD;
      combination in patients with advanced EGFR+ NSCLC who have failed one line of standard EGFR&#xD;
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) and not more than one line of chemotherapy regimen. The use&#xD;
      of 3rd generation EGFR TKI for patients with acquired mutation that substitute a threonine&#xD;
      (T) with a methionine (M) at position 790 of exon 20 (T790M) is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with either nivolumab monotherapy&#xD;
      (Arm A) or nivolumab/ipilimumab combination therapy (Arm B) and will be stratified according&#xD;
      to the following factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PDL1) status: &lt;1% vs â‰¥1%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of brain metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Institution: National Cancer Centre Singapore, National University Cancer Institute, and&#xD;
           Johns Hopkins Singapore-Tan Tock Seng Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both arms will continue with treatment regimen till disease progression or discontinuation of&#xD;
      treatment due to adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A patients are allowed to cross over to Arm B in the event of clear-cut disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On-study tumor assessments will be conducted every 6 weeks for 24 weeks and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks till clear-cut disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiologist will be blinded to the treatment arm that the patient is randomised to ensure&#xD;
      an objective response evaluation.&#xD;

             days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last&#xD;
             dose of investigational drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the&#xD;
             start of nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must not be breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a&#xD;
             failure rate of less than 1% per year Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually&#xD;
             active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7&#xD;
             months after the last dose of investigational product Women who are not of&#xD;
             childbearing potential (ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as&#xD;
             azoospermic men do not require contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone&#xD;
             surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not&#xD;
             postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman&#xD;
             over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, women&#xD;
             under the age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&#xD;
             level less than 40 milli-international units per millilitre (mIU/mL).&#xD;

             WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the&#xD;
             last dose of investigational product. These durations have been calculated using the&#xD;
             upper limit of the half-life for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol&#xD;
             requirement that WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 30 days and men who are&#xD;
             sexually active with WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 90 days.&#xD;

        documented at that site since radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        viii. Patients with a history of treated asymptomatic central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;

&#xD;
        x. Willing to undergo 2 biopsies and contribute research bloods for the study. Archived&#xD;
        tissue that is less than 6 months old is acceptable as an alternative to biopsy at&#xD;
        screening if a biopsy is not feasible; patients from arm A must be willing to undergo&#xD;
        biopsy as baseline upon clear-cut disease progression and on-treatment repeat biopsy before&#xD;
        they are allowed to cross over to receive ipilimumab in addition to nivolumab.&#xD;

        to initiation of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        xiii. Available for follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;

        with interventional radiologist. Waivers are allowed for not more than 70 patients for this&#xD;
        study in order to allow sufficient number of quality tumour biopsies for biomarker analysis&#xD;
        in this study. Waivers would have to be approved by the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        iv. Unwilling to undergo 2 biopsies and contribute research bloods for the study&#xD;

          2. Patients with history of allergic reaction to IV contrast requiring steroid&#xD;
             pre-treatment should have baseline and subsequent tumor assessments done by MRI.&#xD;
