      Postoperative ileus is a frequently occurring surgical complication. It is defined as&#xD;
      temporary inhibition of propulsive bowel activity and is manifested by abdominal distention,&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting and diet intolerance. It may lead to a prolonged hospital stay,&#xD;
      hospital-acquired infections or complications that may require additional treatments (e.g.&#xD;
      analgesia, fluids, electrolyte replacement, nasogastric tube decompression), and as a result&#xD;
      increase medical costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies showed that postoperative coffee consumption shortens the time to first&#xD;
      bowel movement after colorectal resections. However, none could explain the mechanism by&#xD;
      which coffee stimulates intestinal motility and the determinant agent for this action is&#xD;
      still up for discussion (either caffeine or another coffee component).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coffee has a negligible caloric content; It has a pH that varies from 5 to 6 (less acidity&#xD;
      than other beverages that have no similar effect on bowel motility) and it is hypotonic.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is highly unlikely that bowel motility is due to the physical properties of the&#xD;
      coffee. Much more likely, that one (or more) of the numerous phytochemicals of the coffee&#xD;
      bean are responsible for this effect, when the most obvious candidate seems to be caffeine.&#xD;
      However, as mentioned above, very little evidence exists that caffeine was responsible for&#xD;
      the observed effect on colonic function in previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this single-centered, prospective, single blinded, randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      is to evaluate whether the use of caffeine in the post-operative period significantly reduces&#xD;
      the duration of postoperative ileus, and therefore, improves recovery and shorten the&#xD;
      hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that post-operative use of caffeine will reduce time to recovery of&#xD;
      GI function (post-operative ileus) by at least 15 hours and thus reduce hospital length of&#xD;
      stay by at least 15 hours in patients undergoing elective colorectal operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 patients due to undergo large bowel resection via laparotomy or laparoscopy will be&#xD;
      enrolled and randomized (1:1) to those who will receive caffeine (100 mg 3 times per day) and&#xD;
      those who will receive placebo (tap water) starting on the morning of postoperative day 1&#xD;
      after surgery until flatus will occur for the first time or to a maximal period time of 7&#xD;
      days, whichever comes earlier.&#xD;

      Background Postoperative ileus is a frequently occurring surgical complication. It is defined&#xD;
      as temporary inhibition of propulsive bowel activity and is manifested by abdominal&#xD;
      distention, nausea and vomiting and diet intolerance. It may lead to a prolonged hospital&#xD;
      stay, hospital-acquired infections or complications that may require additional treatments&#xD;
      (analgesia, intravenous fluid administration, electrolyte replacement, nasogastric tube&#xD;
      decompression etc.) and as a result increase medical costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgeons are continually trying to find ways to shorten postoperative ileus. The means are&#xD;
      diverse and include advancing diet as tolerated, avoiding the use of nasogastric tubes, early&#xD;
      ambulation, occasional use of gastrograffin or alvimopan (a selective μ-receptor opioid&#xD;
      antagonist) and the use of minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopic colectomy) rather than&#xD;
      laparotomy. Asao et al showed that chewing gum after laparoscopic colectomy leads to an&#xD;
      earlier return of bowel function and shorten the hospital stay, probably via the&#xD;
      cephalic-vagal reflex which increase the production of gastrointestinal hormones associated&#xD;
      with bowel motility. However, up until now, there has been no strategy or drug that has been&#xD;
      consistently effective in accelerating bowel recovery from abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coffee is a popular beverage with known influences on the central nervous system and the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system. Although coffee can stimulate intestinal function in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers, the mechanism by which coffee stimulates intestinal motility is still unknown.&#xD;
      The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAIP) has been proposed as a key mechanism by&#xD;
      which the brain, through the vagus nerve, modulates the immune system in the spleen. Vagal&#xD;
      stimulation by nicotine was shown to reduce intestinal inflammation and improve postoperative&#xD;
      ileus. It is known that caffeine stimulates vagal activity. An average cup of caffeinated&#xD;
      coffee contains 50-150 milligrams of caffeine, depending on the type, concentration and&#xD;
      amount of coffee consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gastrointestinal system can be stimulated by a substantial caloric intake, acidity,&#xD;
      osmolality, or volume load. The caloric content of coffee is negligible (approximately 1&#xD;
      kcal/ 100 mL). It has a pH which varies from 5 to 6 (less acidic than other beverages that&#xD;
      have no similar effect on the bowel motility). Brewed and filtered coffee is hypotonic (as is&#xD;
      water which serves as the control drink in previous studies). Therefore, it seems that the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal effect of coffee is most probably not attributed to its physicochemical&#xD;
      properties but to the biochemical activity of one or several of the many active compounds in&#xD;
      coffee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study that was conducted in 1990, 29% of healthy volunteers claimed that coffee induced&#xD;
      a desire to defecate. The effect of caffeinated coffee on recto-sigmoid motor activity was&#xD;
      investigated with a manometry. The activity was accelerated four minutes after the intake of&#xD;
      either regular or decaffeinated coffee. However, water had no comparable effect on the&#xD;
      recto-sigmoid motility. Caffeine, when in the stomach, can act upon gastric myenteric and&#xD;
      submucous nerves to induce gastric emptying. The influx of digestive metabolites into the&#xD;
      small intestines may stimulate the gastrocolic reflex and be a possible mechanism behind&#xD;
      caffeine causing the need to defecate shortly after consumption. The ultimate result of this&#xD;
      reflex mediated by caffeine is an increased anal sphincter contraction power and less neural&#xD;
      input required to induce contraction (decreased sensory threshold). Rao et al. performed an&#xD;
      ambulatory manometry with inserting a catheter through the rectum up to the mid transverse&#xD;
      colon. They investigated the effects of 240 mL regular coffee, 240 mL decaffeinated coffee,&#xD;
      240 mL water and a 1000 kcal meal on colonic activity. Regular coffee, decaffeinated coffee&#xD;
      and the calorie-rich meal induced more colonic contractions than water. Moreover, regular&#xD;
      coffee induced colonic contractions at greater intensity compared to a caloric-rich meal, 60%&#xD;
      stronger than water and 23% stronger than decaffeinated coffee. A randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      performed in 2012 at the University of Heidelberg among patients after laparoscopic&#xD;
      colectomy, studied the effect of coffee on the duration of postoperative ileus. The study&#xD;
      showed that the time to first bowel movement was significantly shorter in the group (40&#xD;
      patients) which received 3 caffeinated coffee cups per day compared to group (40 patients)&#xD;
      receiving water only. No significant side effects were observed at the active treatment&#xD;
      group. Dulskas.A et al. conducted a randomized controlled study in 2015 to evaluate whether&#xD;
      consumption of 100 mL coffee is effective in reducing postoperative ileus. The study showed&#xD;
      that coffee consumption after colectomy is safe and that decaffeinated coffee was associated&#xD;
      with a shorter time to bowel movement and tolerance of solid food but not time to ﬁrst ﬂatus;&#xD;
      caffeinated coffee did not impact the duration of postoperative ileus. In all the studies&#xD;
      carried out so far, none could explain the mechanism by which coffee stimulates intestinal&#xD;
      motility and the determinant agent for this action is still up for discussion: either&#xD;
      caffeine or another component of the coffee, such as chlorogenic acids or melanoidins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the use of caffeine in the&#xD;
      post-operative period significantly reduces the duration of postoperative ileus, and&#xD;
      therefore, improves recovery and shorten the hospital stay. The study hypothesis is that&#xD;
      post-operative use of caffeine will reduce time to recovery of GI function (i.e. reduce&#xD;
      post-operative ileus) by at least 15 hours and thus reduce hospital length of stay by at&#xD;
      least 15 hours in patients undergoing elective colorectal operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This will be a single-centered, prospective, randomized controlled, double blinded&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 patients due to undergo large bowel resection via laparotomy or laparoscopy will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to those who will receive caffeine (study group)&#xD;
      and those who will receive placebo (control group). Randomization will occur via an online&#xD;
      program (www.randomizer.org) which assigns participants to experimental conditions. Patients&#xD;
      in the study group will be given 100 milligrams caffeine citrate orally diluted in 50&#xD;
      milliliters of apple flavored water while patients in the control group will be given 50&#xD;
      milliliters of apple flavored water only. Administration of caffeine or placebo will occur&#xD;
      three times per day starting on the morning of postoperative day 1 after surgery until&#xD;
      passage of flatus per rectum will occur for the first time or to a maximal period of time of&#xD;
      7 days, whichever comes earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated as 50 patients (25 pts in each group) which are required in order&#xD;
      to have 1-sided α level of 0.05 and a power of 0.80 to detect a difference of 15 hours in the&#xD;
      duration of postoperative ileus (standard deviation 21 hours), which is supported by prior&#xD;
      studies. Any difference of 15 hours or more between the groups will be statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caffeine or water will be supplied to the surgical floor per participating patient by the&#xD;
      pharmacy in coordination with one of the co-investigators who will be un-blinded. At the&#xD;
      floor the caffeine or water will be diluted with apple flavored water which will be supplied&#xD;
      by the pharmacy, prior to each dose. The investigators (aside from the single un-blinded&#xD;
      co-investigator) and primary team of doctors and nurses will be blinded to the patient's&#xD;
      assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative care will be the same for all patients other than the administration of&#xD;
      caffeine or placebo. Patients will be instructed to avoid consuming products that contain&#xD;
      caffeine (e.g. coffee, tea, chocolate, cola etc.) until the first passage of flatus. No other&#xD;
      restrictions on food or beverages consumption will be imposed other than usually are for&#xD;
      patients undergoing the same kind of surgery. The patients will be hospitalized under&#xD;
      surveillance and monitoring of the primary team during the study period. They will be&#xD;
      instructed to keep in mind or to note the endpoints (time to first flatus, time to first&#xD;
      bowel movement, time to tolerate solid diet) and to report them to the primary team and study&#xD;
      investigators during the routine rounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria for hospital discharge include stable vital signs with no febrile morbidity for&#xD;
      ≥24 hours, passage of stool, toleration of a regular diet and the absence of other&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any adverse events deemed possibly, probably or definitely related to treatment with&#xD;
           caffeine: arrhythmia, muscle crumps/tremor, restlessness, irritability, headache,&#xD;
           dizziness, tachycardia, allergic reactions (rare) or any other severe manifestation that&#xD;
           can be attributed to caffeine side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any major adverse event resulting from the surgery that might interfere with caffeine or&#xD;
           might lead to meaningless endpoint data: organ failure, anastomotic leakage,&#xD;
           intraabdominal abscess or invasive re-intervention (Clavien-Dindo classification of&#xD;
           surgical complications &gt; 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Patients who are scheduled for laparoscopy or open elective colon resection (right&#xD;
      or left hemicolectomy, sigmoid resection, anterior resection, segmental colectomy), for an&#xD;
      oncologic or inflammatory indication, that are willing to participate in the study will be&#xD;
      informed verbally by a member of the study team of the aims, the risks, alternative&#xD;
      therapies, their rights and the course of the trial. The investigator will emphasize that&#xD;
      study participation is voluntary and the patient can withdraw at any time during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included if they fulfill all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria listed below within the protocol and after written informed consent was obtained.&#xD;
      Enrolment period to the study will be 18 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Pearson r correlation coefficient will be used to examine the&#xD;
      relationship between two Quantitative variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T test will be used to compare Quantitative variable between two categories of Qualitative&#xD;
      variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANOVA test will be used to compare Quantitative variable between three or more categories of&#xD;
      Qualitative variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi- square test will be used to examine the relationship between two Qualitative variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables which will be found significantly related to the dependent variable in the&#xD;
      monothetic analysis (one-factor-at-a-time method) will be inserted to a multivariate analysis&#xD;
      of ANCOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and risk management Most of the population consumes high doses of caffeine (an average&#xD;
      coffee consumption of 9-11 kg per person per year) without even noticing. The side effects&#xD;
      listed above were previously described after consuming dosages much higher than 3 X 100&#xD;
      mg/day. The safety of caffeine consumption after elective colorectal surgery has been&#xD;
      demonstrated through numerous clinical studies as detailed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, any patient suffering from a medical condition or requiring treatment with a&#xD;
      drug which might interfere with caffeine will be excluded. Therefore, consumption of caffeine&#xD;
      in a cumulative dose of 300 mg/day should not cause any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this, patients will be hospitalized under supervision and monitored by the primary&#xD;
      team and study investigators. Documentation of vital signs, physical examination, medical&#xD;
      consultants support and assessment of serious adverse events will be conducted. Any&#xD;
      unexpected adverse event will be treated efficiently and quickly without extra cost for the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
