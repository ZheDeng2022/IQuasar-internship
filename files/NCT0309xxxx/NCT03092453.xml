  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate a method of using dendritic cells (a kind of&#xD;
      white blood cell) as a vaccine to stimulate your own immune system to react to your melanoma&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm open label trial that will assess the safety and tolerability of mature&#xD;
      dendritic cell (mDC3/8) vaccine (primer and booster) in subjects with stage III and stage IV&#xD;
      melanoma, followed by treatment with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients that provide written informed consent will undergo apheresis to collect&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cells for vaccine production approximately 1 week prior to vaccine&#xD;
      infusion. Each study subject will receive cyclophosphamide 300mg/m^2 intravenously or by&#xD;
      mouth 3 to 4 days prior to the vaccine dose, to deplete regulatory T cells. For each vaccine&#xD;
      dose, all subjects will receive autologous dendritic cells pulsed with melanoma&#xD;
      tumor-specific peptides. On Day 1, the subject will receive the primer vaccine dose; this&#xD;
      will be followed by two booster vaccine doses at 6 weeks apart. Peripheral blood will be&#xD;
      taken weekly to monitor the immune response to each peptide by tetramer assay. Re-staging&#xD;
      will occur after the 3rd vaccine dose, along with tumor biopsy and second apheresis. Anti&#xD;
      PD-1 therapy (standard of care) will commence 7-8 weeks after the subject's last dendritic&#xD;
      cell vaccine.&#xD;
