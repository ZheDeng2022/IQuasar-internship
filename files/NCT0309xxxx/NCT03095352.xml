    <textblock>
      This is a phase II multicenter study including breast cancer patients with chest wall disease&#xD;
      that is hormone resistant (estrogen receptor (ER) positive/progesterone receptor (PR)&#xD;
      positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer with&#xD;
      progressive disease on 2 prior lines of hormonal therapy) or triple negative (ER negative/PR&#xD;
      negative/HER2 negative, TNBC). Eighty-four patients will be enrolled at Translational Breast&#xD;
      Cancer Research Consortium (TBCRC) sites and will be randomized 2:1 to receive treatment with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and carboplatin (n=56, Arm A) or carboplatin alone (n=28, Arm B) until&#xD;
      documented disease progression. Patients randomized to Arm B may cross-over following&#xD;
      progression to pembrolizumab with or without carboplatin at investigator's discretion (Arm&#xD;
      Bx). Patients may have received any number of prior lines of chemotherapy. Patients in Arm A&#xD;
      will be treated with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV and carboplatin area under curve (AUC) 5 IV&#xD;
      every 3 weeks for at least 6 cycles followed by maintenance pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3&#xD;
      weeks if stable or responding disease. Patients in Arm B will be treated with carboplatin AUC&#xD;
      5 IV every 3 weeks until progression, whereupon they may cross-over to pembrolizumab 200 mg&#xD;
      IV every 3 weeks with or without carboplatin at investigator's discretion (Arm Bx). An&#xD;
      interim analysis for futility will be performed after 18 patients are enrolled into Arm B to&#xD;
      allow early stopping of that trial arm for lack of efficacy. The primary endpoint is to&#xD;
      compare disease control rates at 18 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      progression free survival, toxicity, and overall response rate.&#xD;

      There will be a companion translational study operating concurrently with the study described&#xD;
      above. In this study, biomarker research to be performed on tumor biopsies and peripheral&#xD;
      blood samples will be performed to explore the immunologic and genomic mechanism of action&#xD;
      underlying treatment with pembrolizumab and carboplatin versus carboplatin alone. This&#xD;
      protocol includes tissue and blood correlative exploratory endpoints including changes in&#xD;
      tumor PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1) gene expression, tumor and peripheral blood immune&#xD;
      composition and cytokine expression, plasma tumor DNA, circulating tumor cells, and tumor&#xD;
      myelocytomatosis (MYC) oncogene expression using tumor biopsy and peripheral blood testing&#xD;
      before and after treatment; correlations with these markers and disease control rate will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
