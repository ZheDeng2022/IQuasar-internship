    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase II study of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
      with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMD). Patients may have received any number of prior&#xD;
      therapies for their respective solid tumors, but must not have received prior anti-PD-1&#xD;
      therapy and developed progressive disease. Approximately 18 subjects in this study will&#xD;
      receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200mg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 4 doses.&#xD;
      In patients who derive clinical benefit from therapy, pembrolizumab may be continued until&#xD;
      documented disease progression, unacceptable adverse event(s), intercurrent illness that&#xD;
      prevents further administration of treatment, investigator's decision to withdraw the&#xD;
      subject, subject withdrawal of consent, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure&#xD;
      requirements, or for administrative reasons.&#xD;

             commencement of study therapy if the lesion that has been radiated is not the sole&#xD;
             measurable lesion, or the patient is eligible based on positive CSF cytology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients may continue therapy with a targeted agent if CNS disease developed while&#xD;

             adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 4.8.2 Contraception, for the&#xD;
             course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;

             contraception for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Male subjects of childbearing potential (Section 4.8.2) must agree to use an adequate&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
