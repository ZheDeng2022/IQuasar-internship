  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled, investigator-started clinical trial was&#xD;
      carried out. Patients with primary hypothyroidism were randomly assigned to the study&#xD;
      (VSL#3®+ LT4) and the control group (LT4). A two months treatment phase was followed by two&#xD;
      months of follow-up. Clinical examination, blood tests for thyroid function and for&#xD;
      peripheral tissue markers of thyroid hormones effect were performed monthly for 4 months. LT4&#xD;
      dose adjustments were performed during the study when necessary.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients on LT4 replacement therapy attending the Endocrinology Unit of Modena&#xD;
      (Italy) were screened. According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, eighty participants&#xD;
      were enrolled and randomized in study or control group. The random allocation sequence was&#xD;
      generated using 'Statistical Package for the Social Sciences' software for Macintosh (SPSS)&#xD;
      considering a 1:1 ratio by the statistician of the Unit. Clinicians evaluating and enrolling&#xD;
      patients were blinded to the randomization list. The study design provided a monthly visit&#xD;
      for a 4 months overall time-frame. Patients assigned to the study group took the probiotic&#xD;
      supplement VSL#3® for two months, followed by a two months period of follow-up. Study group&#xD;
      patients were taught to assume the probiotic supplement at least two hours after LT4&#xD;
      administration, to dissolve it in a cold beverage and to store it in a refrigerator (2°-8°C)&#xD;
      in order to preserve bacteria load. The study design was single-blind since only the&#xD;
      clinician was aware of the allocation. The VSL#3® administration was provided by nurses.&#xD;
      Participants were invited to return all used and unused sachets to count the number of opened&#xD;
      sachets per the number of treatment days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent five visits (baseline, visit 1, 2, 3 and 4) in which anthropometrical&#xD;
      evaluation (weight and height) and hormonal function assessment were performed. A blood&#xD;
      sample was taken in the morning at each visit, on empty stomach and before LT4 ingestion. In&#xD;
      occurrence of hormonal alteration, LT4 daily dose was adjusted according to clinical&#xD;
      guidelines. At baseline, visit 2 and visit 4, patients underwent clinical examination with&#xD;
      heart rate and blood pressure evaluation. During each visit, the following data were&#xD;
      collected: probiotic assumption, sex, age, hypothyroidism aetiology, LT4 formulation dose and&#xD;
      brand, body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA), systolic blood pressure, diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure, heart rate, TSH, fT4, fT3 and any possible LT4 posology adjustment. All the&#xD;
      clinical data have been further databased.&#xD;
