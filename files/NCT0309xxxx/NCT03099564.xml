  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label multi-center trial designed to evaluate the efficacy as well as the&#xD;
      safety of combining pembrolizumab with Yttrium-90 (Y90) radioembolization in subjects with&#xD;
      poor prognosis (high risk) HCC not eligible for liver transplant or surgical resection with&#xD;
      well compensated liver function. Treatment will consist of pembrolizumab 200mg IV every 3&#xD;
      weeks in conjunction with Y90 radioembolization performed one week after the first dose of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. If bilobar disease is present, a second Y90 radioembolization will be&#xD;
      performed no later than 4 weeks after the first procedure to the contralateral hepatic lobe.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If a second Y90 radioembolization treatment is required for bilobar disease, this should&#xD;
      occur within 4 weeks of the initial procedure (between Cycles 2 and 3 of pembrolizumab). The&#xD;
      next dose of pembrolizumab should be separated from the Y90 radioembolization by at least one&#xD;
      week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging will be obtained every 9 weeks (after every 3 pembrolizumab treatment) to assess for&#xD;
      tumor response and to evaluate for progression. Subjects will remain on treatment until&#xD;
      documented tumor progression, unacceptable toxicity, study withdrawal or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Angiography (shunt study):&#xD;
&#xD;
      During screening, subjects will undergo angiography using technetium-99-labeled&#xD;
      macroaggregated albumin to detect any uptake outside the liver via measurement of&#xD;
      hepatopulmonary shunting. Prior to the angiography, a local anesthetic (to numb the area&#xD;
      prior to catheter insertion) and sedation will be administered to the subject, as per&#xD;
      institutional standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This procedure is standard of care for subjects prior to Y90 radioembolization, and will be&#xD;
      performed per institutional site standards. Hepatopulmonary shunting must be &lt; 20% for&#xD;
      subject to meet eligibility criteria. Subjects will undergo a mandatory tumor biopsy on the&#xD;
      same day as the screening angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to administration of the first dose of pembrolizumab (i.e., Day 1 of Cycle 1), repeat&#xD;
      laboratory tests will be obtained to ensure subject still meets eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab 200mg IV (IV over 30 minutes) every 3 weeks Day 1 per 21 day cycle (3 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to administration of subsequent pembrolizumab doses, the following criteria must be&#xD;
      met:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALT and AST:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Among subjects with baseline (screening) ALT/AST &lt;2×ULN: ALT/AST &lt; 5×ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Among subjects with baseline (screening) ALT/AST ≥2×ULN: ALT/AST &lt; 3× the baseline level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ALT/AST ≤ 500 U/L regardless of baseline level&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total bilirubin:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Among subjects with baseline levels &lt; 1.5 mg/dL: a value of &lt; 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Among subjects with baseline levels that are ≥ 1.5 mg/dL: a value &lt; 2× the baseline&#xD;
           level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL regardless of baseline level&#xD;
&#xD;
      Y90 radioembolization will be performed as standard of care via institutional standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be eligible for Y90 radioembolization, the following criteria must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALT and AST:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Among subjects with baseline (screening) ALT/AST &lt; 2×ULN: ALT/AST &lt; 5×ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Among subjects with baseline (screening) ALT/AST ≥ 2×ULN: ALT/AST &lt; 3× the baseline&#xD;
           level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ALT/AST ≤ 500 U/L regardless of baseline level&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total bilirubin:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Among subjects with baseline levels &lt; 1.5 mg/dL: a value of &lt; 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Among subjects with baseline levels that are ≥ 1.5 mg/dL: a value &lt; 2× the baseline&#xD;
           level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL regardless of baseline level&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, any non-hepatic toxicities from the prior dose(s) of pembrolizumab must have&#xD;
      resolved to Grade ≤ 2.&#xD;
