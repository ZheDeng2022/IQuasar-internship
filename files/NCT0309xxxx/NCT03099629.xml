      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of inspiratory muscle training&#xD;
      (IMT) on respiratory performance in patients with esophageal cancer during combined modality&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

      Background and Purpose: Incidence rates of esophageal cancer remain high in Eastern Asia. In&#xD;
      2012, esophageal cancer was the 9th leading cause of cancer deaths in Taiwan. Whether&#xD;
      surgical resection is possible, combined modality therapy is usually required for the&#xD;
      treatment of esophageal cancer. In clinical observation, patients underwent combined modality&#xD;
      therapy usually demonstrated respiratory muscle dysfunction which might further impair&#xD;
      physical activity and quality of life. The purpose of this study is to investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on respiratory performance in patients&#xD;
      with esophageal cancer during combined modality therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a prospective interventional study design. A total of 45 patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed esophageal cancer will be recruited from the Mackay Memorial Hospital. All tests&#xD;
      will be performed at baseline (prior to cancer treatment), weekly during treatment, prior to&#xD;
      surgery, and one month after surgery. Tests will include demographic data collection,&#xD;
      respiratory muscle performance (maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure tests combined&#xD;
      with diaphragmatic surface electromyography, and pulmonary functional test), dyspnea, and the&#xD;
      functional exercise test (6-min walk test). IMT will start with an intensity of 30% of&#xD;
      maximal inspiratory pressure, 15 times/set, 3 sets/day, 7 days/week and training will&#xD;
      continue until surgery is scheduled or 2 weeks after the completion of treatment if surgery&#xD;
      is not suitable. Repeated measure ANOVA will be used for analyzing difference of parameters&#xD;
      among various time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical relevance: The results of this study will help to better understand the clinical&#xD;
      beneficial effects (e.g., better functional capacity) of an added inspiratory muscle training&#xD;
      during combined modality therapy in patients with esophageal cancer.&#xD;
