    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trametinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dabrafenib&#xD;

      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining&#xD;
      this study drug in this disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the combination of drugs is&#xD;
      being studied. It also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not&#xD;
      approved the drugs for your type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved Trametinib or Dabrafenib for your specific disease but they have&#xD;
      been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some cancers have changes (mutations) in a gene called BRAF or other genes, called KRAS or&#xD;
      NRAS. These three genes tell the body to make a protein called BRAF, KRAS, or NRAS,&#xD;
      respectively, which are all involved in sending signals in cells that can lead to cell&#xD;
      growth. Certain mutations in these three genes cause a change in these proteins that can&#xD;
      increase the growth and spread of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dabrafenib and trametinib work to prevent these altered proteins from working and sending&#xD;
      signals in cancer cells, and thereby may block the growth and spread of cancer cells in&#xD;
      people with cancers with BRAF, KRAS, or NRAS gene mutations. Dabrafenib and trametinib have&#xD;
      been used in the treatment for other cancers in other research studies, and information from&#xD;
      those research studies suggest that these agents may help to kill multiple myeloma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dabrafenib and trametinib, which are investigated in this research study may or may not kill&#xD;
      myeloma cells effectively. We would like to see if these drugs given alone or in combination&#xD;
      safely and effectively kill these cancer cells.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female participants pregnant or breast-feeding. Pregnant women are excluded from this&#xD;
             study because dabrafenib, and trametinib may have teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the study drugs, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with the study drugs. Dabrafenib was&#xD;
             teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats at doses three times greater than the human&#xD;
             exposure at the recommended clinical dose.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
             dabrafenib and trametinib. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of&#xD;
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs&#xD;
             chemically related to the study treatments, their excipients, and/or dimethyl&#xD;
             sulfoxide (DMSO).&#xD;
