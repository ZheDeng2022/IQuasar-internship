  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical studies of CD19 CAR-T cells in the treatment of blood and lymphatic system tumors&#xD;
      have achieved unprecedented successes. Because of the heterogeneity of the tumor, patients&#xD;
      often carry CD19-negative tumor cell clones that express alternative target antigens (such as&#xD;
      CD22, CD20 and CD123). In order to effectively eradicate all tumor clones and prevent&#xD;
      recurrence, alternative tumor antigens besides CD19 are considered for CAR-T cell targeting.&#xD;
      In this tudy, autologous T cells are genetically modified with 4th generation anti-CD19 and&#xD;
      anti-CD22 CARs (4SCAR19/22) using lentiviral vectors. For safety consideration, the 4SCAR is&#xD;
      engineered with an inducible caspase 9 self-withdrawal genetic design that allows for rapid&#xD;
      elimination of the infused CAR-T cells. Interleukin-2 has been shown to boost immune response&#xD;
      against leukemia cells. The serum interleukin-6 level will be monitored and when it returns&#xD;
      to normal range by day 28 after CAR-T cell infusion, patients will receive subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection of interleukin-2, and evaluated for 24 months for safety, efficacy and persistence&#xD;
      of CAR T cells.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Evaluate the frequency and severity of adverse events, including, but not limited&#xD;
                to, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) [ Time Frame: From date of dosing ( day 1 ) up&#xD;
                to 50 weeks ]&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Evaluate grade 3 and higher toxicity rate of patients (toxicity possibly attributed&#xD;
                to 4SCAR19/22 T cells)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Evaluate the safety and effect of administration of 4SCAR19/22 T cells followed by&#xD;
                interleukin-2 in treating pediatric patients with relapsed and refractory B cell&#xD;
                malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Evaluate Overall Complete Remission Rate (ORR).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Evaluate overall response rate including complete remission (CR) and complete&#xD;
                remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) .&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Evaluate duration of remission (DOR).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. To evaluate the incidence and the treatment effect of cytokine release syndrome&#xD;
                (CRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. To determine the expansion and functional persistence of 4SCAR19/22 T cells in the&#xD;
                peripheral blood of patients and the correlation with antitumor effects;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In this single-center, open-label, nonrandomized, no control, prospective clinical&#xD;
           trial, a total of 30 patients with resistant or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic&#xD;
           leukemia (ALL) or non-hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) will be enrolled. Patients with ALL will&#xD;
           be diagnosed according to bone marrow morphology, immunophenotype, cytogenetic and&#xD;
           molecular examination. Patients with NHL will be diagnosed according to bone marrow&#xD;
           morphology, biopsy pathology and imaging examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be obtained by apheresis, and T cells&#xD;
           will be activated and modified to express the 4SCAR-CD19/22 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. On Day -2 to -7, PBMC will be activated and enriched for T cells, which will be followed&#xD;
           by 4SCAR-CD19/22 lentiviral transduction. The total culture time is approximately 5-7&#xD;
           days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy composed of cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
           fludarabine prior to cell infusion,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Participants will receive the CAR-T cells at a total dose of 0.5-5x10^6/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Participants will receive regular subcutaneous injection of interleukin-2 of&#xD;
           250,000iu/m^2 every other day for 2 weeks and then rest for 2 weeks for up to 6 months&#xD;
           after their serum interleukin-6 levels returned to normal range from day 28 after CAR-T&#xD;
           cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patients will be monitored for toxicity including cytokine release syndrome, hematologic&#xD;
           toxicities and B-cell aplasia, for response of their underlying malignancy and for CAR-T&#xD;
           cell persistence in the blood, marrow and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).&#xD;
