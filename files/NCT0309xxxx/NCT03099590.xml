      Participants will enroll in a 14-week study (2 weeks of baseline, 8 weeks of treatment, and 4&#xD;
      weeks of follow-up) investigating the impact that Alkontrol-herbal (Isoflavone; Kudzu) has on&#xD;
      alcohol intake in a population seeking treatment for an alcohol use disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past 15 years, the Behavioral Psychopharmacology Research Lab at McLean Hospital has&#xD;
      extensively studied kudzu extract and demonstrated its safety and efficacy in healthy control&#xD;
      subjects as well as in heavy binge drinkers. The relative success of our recent outpatient&#xD;
      trial of kudzu extract demonstrated a modest decrease in drinking, reduction in the number of&#xD;
      heavy drinking days, and significant increase in the number of days abstinent. This suggests&#xD;
      that Alkontrol-herbal, kudzu extract, may be a useful adjunct in treating alcohol use&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will enroll in a 14-week study (2 weeks of baseline, 8 weeks of treatment, and 4&#xD;
      weeks of follow-up) investigating the impact that Alkontrol-herbal has on alcohol intake in a&#xD;
      population (age 21-60 years) seeking treatment for an alcohol use disorder. Participants will&#xD;
      take 500 mg of a crude kudzu extract (NPI-031, Alkontrol-herbal; Natural Pharmacia&#xD;
      International, Burlington, MA) t.i.d.; matched sugar beet placebo capsules will serve as&#xD;
      placebo. Subjects will come to the lab three times a week to provide urine samples that can&#xD;
      be tested for medication compliance through a biochemical marker, acetazolamide, included in&#xD;
      the medication capsules. Participants will record their alcohol intake through daily diaries&#xD;
      and a wrist actigraphy device, which will also monitor their sleep/wake activity.&#xD;
