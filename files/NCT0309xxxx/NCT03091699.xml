      Adult smokers will participate in a two stage testing trial, where the first stage will&#xD;
      utilize a within-subject counterbalance design and individuals will participate in both&#xD;
      conditions. The second stage will utilize a two-arm randomized control trail. The two&#xD;
      conditions are (a) moderate intensity exercise and (b) nicotine inhalation. The primary&#xD;
      measure of assessment will be reaction time and accuracy on the N-back task.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The burden of smoking tobacco on the Canadian public is well-documented. Typically, two&#xD;
      thirds of Canadian smokers will consider a quit attempt over the next six months. When an&#xD;
      individual who is addicted to nicotine stops administering the psycho-stimulate cognitive&#xD;
      deficits and tobacco cravings arise and are at the forefront of an unsuccessful quit attempt.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that smoking or nicotine administration enhances alerting and orienting&#xD;
      attention, short-term episodic memory, and working memory in smokers who were deprived or&#xD;
      minimally deprived of nicotine. Moderate intensity exercise has been shown to increase many&#xD;
      cognitive functions of the brain in non-smokers. Moderate intensity exercise also has been&#xD;
      shown to increase cognition more than nicotine in a non-smoking population. Research&#xD;
      regarding the effects of moderate exercise on cognition of non- deprived, as well as&#xD;
      nicotine- deprived smokers is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will begin in April of 2017. The main purpose of this project is to examine if&#xD;
      exercise could be a pragmatic alternative to smoking in cognitive deficits that arise during&#xD;
      a quit attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirsty four adult smokers will follow the protocol listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I will utilize a within subjects counter-balanced design. Previous to arrival for phase&#xD;
      I participants will be asked to keep consumption of coffee to half a cup the day of testing,&#xD;
      abstain from alcohol and drugs for at least 18 hours prior to testing, and smoke a cigarette&#xD;
      of choice 30 minutes prior to arrival (for standardization). Participants will be urged to&#xD;
      arrive at the same time for each visit. Upon arrival to the Exercise and Health Psychology&#xD;
      lab (located in room 408 of the Arthur and Sonia Labatt Health Science Building at Western&#xD;
      University) participants will be verified as smokers (based on the reading from the piCO+&#xD;
      Smokerlyzer being greater than 10 P.P.M.), given the letter of information and sign the&#xD;
      informed consent form. Participants will also be asked to complete a demographic survey,&#xD;
      smoking history questionnaire, PAR-Q readiness for exercise, Godin Leisure-Time Exercise&#xD;
      Questionnaire, Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, and pre nicotine or pre exercise&#xD;
      questionnaire. Vitals (heart rate and blood pressure) will be assessed following the&#xD;
      completion of the questionnaires as well as post intervention in the seated position. Prior&#xD;
      to evaluation on the N-back task (cognitive memory task described below) a practice stage&#xD;
      with be conducted until the participant can consistently score 75% or higher on three&#xD;
      consecutive trials to eliminate a learning effect. After establishing familiarity a baseline&#xD;
      cognition score will be conducted. The subject will then be given a 5 minute break (i.e., to&#xD;
      use the lavatory). Following the break the participants will be randomized into either the&#xD;
      exercise or nicotine inhalation group. The interventions are as followed; Moderate Intensity&#xD;
      Exercise will persist of a 20-minute bout of moderate intensity aerobic exercise. Exercise&#xD;
      consisted of a 2-minute warm-up, followed by 15 min of walking at a rate, which will allow&#xD;
      you to reach 2/3 of your max heart rate, and then a 3-minute cool down on a treadmill&#xD;
      equaling 20 minutes. The Nicotine inhalation group will smoke a cigarette to completion of&#xD;
      their choice, in the 20 minute time period allocated. During this time the participant will&#xD;
      refrain from conversation. The post intervention assessment will begin within two minutes of&#xD;
      the completion of either intervention. The second visit of phase I will take place the&#xD;
      following day at the same time (if possible). During the second visit the participant's will&#xD;
      complete the pre nicotine or pre exercise questionnaire and vitals will be monitored pre and&#xD;
      post intervention. The participants will participate in the intervention that they have not&#xD;
      received on the first visit (for example, if the participant received nicotine inhalation on&#xD;
      the first visit the participant will receive moderate intensity aerobic exercise on the&#xD;
      second visit). Within two minutes of completion the post treatment N-back task assessment&#xD;
      will begin. Previous to arrival for stage II participants will be asked to keep consumption&#xD;
      of coffee to half a cup the day of testing, abstain from alcohol and drugs for at least 18&#xD;
      hours prior to testing, and to abstain from smoking for at least 12 hours (overnight&#xD;
      abstinence). Stage II will utilize the same participants as phase I but they will be examined&#xD;
      in a nicotine-deprived state (12 hours) for baseline N-back scores and then randomized into&#xD;
      nicotine inhalation group or exercise treatment group where post intervention N-back scores&#xD;
      will be obtained. Pre nicotine or pre exercise questionnaire will be completed and vitals&#xD;
      (heart rate and blood pressure) will be assessed pre and post intervention. Smoking&#xD;
      abstinence will be validated with the piCO+ Smokerlyzer reading being less than 10 P.P.M.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will (a) provide information about the cognition of non-deprived smokers and&#xD;
      nicotine deprived smokers (b) demonstrate if moderate intensity exercise would be a pragmatic&#xD;
      alternative to nicotine for replenishing working memory deficits in these populations (c) add&#xD;
      to the literature on moderate intensity exercise being a valid aid for smokers attempting a&#xD;
      real quit attempt (d) assist in the development of new cessation programs involving exercise.&#xD;
