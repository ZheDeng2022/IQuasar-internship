    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to identify significant clinical and laboratory risk factors in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This is defined as&#xD;
      bleeding that necessitates an upper endoscopic evaluation to either diagnose or treat upper&#xD;
      GI bleeding during their hospital admission. If a predictive/risk stratification relationship&#xD;
      exists, these data could permit a more effective triaging and intervention scheme in&#xD;
      pediatric patients presenting with complaints of gastrointestinal bleeding. In addition we&#xD;
      want to get a better understanding of the re-bleeding rate after endoscopic therapy for upper&#xD;
      GI bleeding and if there are any identifiable risk factors for re-bleeding. Lastly we want to&#xD;
      understand best practice management for upper GI bleeding.&#xD;

      A. Specific Aims/Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to identify significant clinical and laboratory risk factors in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This is defined as&#xD;
      bleeding that necessitates an upper endoscopic evaluation to either diagnose or treat upper&#xD;
      GI bleeding during their hospital admission. If a predictive/risk stratification relationship&#xD;
      exists, these data could permit a more effective triaging and intervention scheme in&#xD;
      pediatric patients presenting with complaints of gastrointestinal bleeding. In addition we&#xD;
      want to get a better understanding of the re-bleeding rate after endoscopic therapy for upper&#xD;
      GI bleeding and if there are any identifiable risk factors for re-bleeding. Lastly we want to&#xD;
      understand best practice management for upper GI bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is a potentially life-threatening presentation that the&#xD;
      pediatric gastroenterologist must recognize, and manage appropriately. Classification is&#xD;
      generally divided between upper or lower GI bleeding, based on the origin of bleeding&#xD;
      relative to hemorrhages the Ligament of Treitz. The incidence of GI bleeding in children is&#xD;
      not well established in the pediatric population. For upper GI bleeds most large, prospective&#xD;
      studies have assessed incidence in pediatric critical care settings. In one prospective study&#xD;
      of 984 patients, upper GI bleeds occurred in 6.4% of admissions receiving on prophylactic&#xD;
      therapy. Other studies have shown upper GI bleeding in as many as 25% of pediatric intensive&#xD;
      care admissions without prophylaxis. There is no data on the incidence of pediatric GI bleeds&#xD;
      that requires endoscopic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric studies are lacking with respect to risk stratification and decisional algorithms&#xD;
      in managing pediatric acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Adult literature supports&#xD;
      accurate stratification of risk based on clinical history, physical examination, and&#xD;
      laboratory measures. Additionally, endoscopic interventions not only allow for therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions but also prognosticate based on visual findings. Similar pediatric literature&#xD;
      is not available thus giving rise to large amounts of variability both center to center as&#xD;
      well as within centers regarding management decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prospective, observational analysis of inpatient and ambulatory records of pediatric&#xD;
           patients at Boston Children's Hospital beginning upon IRB approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will identify pediatric patients &lt;/= 21 years old presenting acutely to the emergency&#xD;
           room, ambulatory clinic or as current inpatients who require endoscopic evaluation for&#xD;
           acute upper gastrointestinal bleed and potential treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collected will include clinical signs and symptoms and physical exam features,&#xD;
           laboratory studies and endoscopic findings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identified patients will then be followed prospectively for outcomes data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical history of bleeding onset, acuity, amount, frequency and prior history of&#xD;
                gastrointestinal bleed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medication history&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical examination data including vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, and&#xD;
                oxygen saturation)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Laboratory data including&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complete blood count&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Liver panel&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complete Metabolic Panel&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urinanalysis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Endoscopic findings as well as data from interventions (cautery, clips, injections)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical management decisions (acid suppression therapy, oral intake, frequency of&#xD;
                laboratory measurement)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Outcome data including re-bleeding rates (with respect to endoscopic intervention),&#xD;
                laboratory measures, and length of stay.&#xD;
