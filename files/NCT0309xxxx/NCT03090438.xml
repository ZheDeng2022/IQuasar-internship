  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility has been estimated to affect from 6-18% of couples trying to conceive. In 20-30%&#xD;
      of cases, the problem is with the male. Varicocele is a common cause of male factor&#xD;
      infertility (MFI) being responsible for 30-35 % of primary and 69-81 % of secondary MFI.&#xD;
      Varicocele repair has been shown to improve sperm parameters and increase natural pregnancy&#xD;
      rates and the results of assisted reproductive techniques (ART).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two possible treatment pathways for varicocele associated male factor infertility.&#xD;
      1) standard IVF/ICSI 2) varicocele repair followed by IVF/ICSI if there is no spontaneous&#xD;
      pregnancy. There is however no consensus as to which pathway is preferable and no randomized&#xD;
      comparative studies have been carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVF/ICSI is a standard treatment for infertility but frequently requires repeated treatments&#xD;
      to achieve a live birth. The purpose of this study is to determine if the improved sperm&#xD;
      parameters caused by prior treatment of the varicocele will result in improvements both in&#xD;
      overall pregnancy/birth rates and in IVF/ICSI results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A varicocele is an abnormal dilation of the pampiniform plexus caused by incompetence of the&#xD;
      valves in the internal spermatic vein. Varicocele has a prevalence of 10-15 % in the general&#xD;
      population and is a common cause of male infertility, being present in 30-35% of men with&#xD;
      primary, and 69-81% of men with secondary infertility. There is more than one approach to the&#xD;
      treatment of varicocele associated MFI One common approach is to treat by assisted&#xD;
      reproductive techniques (ART). Patients with a total motile sperm count of &lt;10 million sperm&#xD;
      are usually treated by IVF with or without ICSI. Fertilization of oocytes may be accomplished&#xD;
      by isolating even a single adequate spermatozoa in the laboratory bypassing the majority of&#xD;
      semen quality inadequacies in male factor infertility. The results of this treatment using&#xD;
      fresh embryos with a maternal age of&lt;35 are 46% pregnancies and 40% live births per cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatively, varicocele associated MFI can be treated by repairing the varicocele to&#xD;
      improve sperm quality. Occlusion of the spermatic veins by surgical and radiological methods&#xD;
      is commonly performed in these circumstances to improve fertility. A large body of literature&#xD;
      exists demonstrating post-treatment improvements in semen parameters and sperm DNA quality as&#xD;
      well as improved spontaneous pregnancy rates compared to no treatment. There are also studies&#xD;
      demonstrating improved results of ART after varicocele repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both approaches have their advocates. ART often provide a relatively quick result and have a&#xD;
      known excellent track record for both pregnancy and live birth rates. Unfortunately, these&#xD;
      techniques are not without risks such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and procedural&#xD;
      complications. Multiple pregnancies are common with increased risk of premature labour and&#xD;
      low birth weight. In addition the treatments are expensive and multiple treatments increase&#xD;
      the financial burden on the health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Varicocele occlusion is a minor procedure. If performed radiologically, there is often&#xD;
      immediate return to normal activity. The complication rate is very low, mostly due to&#xD;
      radiological contrast medium allergy. Modern equipment and careful technique enable the&#xD;
      procedure to be completed with very low radiation doses that are well below the level proven&#xD;
      to have any adverse biological effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If varicocele repair can be demonstrated to improve pregnancy outcomes in varicocele related&#xD;
      MFI by spontaneous pregnancies or by improving pregnancy and live birth rates per ART&#xD;
      implantation, then there are compelling health care and economic reasons for incorporating it&#xD;
      as an initial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present there have been no well constructed randomized trials to compare the outcomes of&#xD;
      these two approaches.&#xD;
