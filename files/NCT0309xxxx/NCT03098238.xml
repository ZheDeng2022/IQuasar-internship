  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibody-mediated rejection is the leading cause of long-term renal graft loss. It's due to&#xD;
      the production by the recipient of antibodies directed against antigens (belonging or not to&#xD;
      the HLA system) present on the surface of the donor specific endothelial cells (DSA), leading&#xD;
      to graft failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main difficulty to manage the humoral rejection is the delay of the diagnosis and the&#xD;
      treatment to slow the evolution towards fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positivity of anti-HLA antibodies is the main risk factor for the rejection but the only way&#xD;
      to make the diagnosis of humoral rejection is to perform a graft biopsy, an invasive process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial microparticles (MPE) are small membrane vesicles generated by endothelial cell&#xD;
      activation and / or apoptosis processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We test the hypothesis that endothelial microparticles are an early diagnostic biomarker of&#xD;
      humoral rejection in renal transplantation allowing to detect it at the &quot;subclinical&quot; stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to estimate the performance of MPE plasma concentration&#xD;
      for the diagnosis of humoral rejection in renal transplant patients with DSA. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to investigate by mass spectrometry the MPEs specific to the endothelium of the&#xD;
      graft and to evaluate their diagnostic performance in relation to non-specific MEPs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a cross-sectional evaluation of a diagnostic method from a collection of&#xD;
      biological samples. The gold standard for the diagnosis of humoral rejection is the&#xD;
      histological diagnosis on graft biopsy. The new test under study will be the flow cytometric&#xD;
      assay of the MPE concentration carried out on plasma taken on the day of the graft biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the active list of renal transplant patients attending the Montpellier University&#xD;
      Hospital, we estimate that we can include the number of subjects required (N = 250) over 18&#xD;
      months. This work will be carried out in a laboratory with all the tools and techniques used,&#xD;
      in particular flow cytometry and mass spectrometry, perfectly mastered and realized on&#xD;
      dedicated technical platforms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits / Outlook:&#xD;
&#xD;
      find a non-invasive early diagnostic biomarker to detect humoral rejection from the&#xD;
      &quot;subclinical&quot; stage in order to set up an adapted treatment as quickly as possible.&#xD;

      Context and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibody-mediated rejection is the leading cause of long-term renal graft loss. It's due to&#xD;
      the production by the recipient of antibodies directed against antigens (belonging or not to&#xD;
      the HLA system) present on the surface of the donor specific endothelial cells (DSA), the&#xD;
      binding of which can activate the renal endothelium and be responsible for inflammation&#xD;
      leading to fibrosis and graft destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main obstacle in the management of the humoral rejection is the delay of the diagnosis&#xD;
      and the treatment to slow the evolution towards fibrosis. At the beginning of the process&#xD;
      there is no &quot;apparent&quot; dysfunction of the graft (elevation of serum creatinine and / or&#xD;
      proteinuria) but only inflammation of the renal parenchyma: this is referred to as&#xD;
      &quot;subclinical&quot; humoral rejection. Graft dysfunction occurs only when the inflammation is&#xD;
      serious and responsible for irreversible lesions of fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New sensitive detection techniques for anti-HLA antibodies allow to detect DSA well before&#xD;
      the onset of humoral rejection but the only way to make the diagnosis of humoral rejection is&#xD;
      to perform a graft biopsy, an invasive process with a hemorrhagic risk which can not be&#xD;
      repeated too frequently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial microparticles (MPE) are small membrane vesicles generated by endothelial cell&#xD;
      activation and / or apoptosis processes. An increasing level in circulating blood appears&#xD;
      today as a endothelial dysfunction in many pathologies. Their role in humoral rejection, a&#xD;
      model of endothelial dysfunction, has never been explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We wish to test the hypothesis that endothelial microparticles are an early diagnostic&#xD;
      biomarker of humoral rejection in renal transplantation allowing to detect it at the&#xD;
      &quot;subclinical&quot; stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to estimate the performance of MPE plasma concentration&#xD;
      for the diagnosis of humoral rejection in renal transplant patients with DSA. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to investigate by mass spectrometry the MPEs specific to the endothelium of the&#xD;
      graft and to evaluate their diagnostic performance in relation to non-specific MEPs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a cross-sectional evaluation of a diagnostic method from a collection of&#xD;
      biological samples. The gold standard for the diagnosis of humoral rejection is the&#xD;
      histological diagnosis on graft biopsy. The new test under study will be the flow cytometric&#xD;
      assay of the MPE concentration carried out on plasma taken on the day of the graft biopsy.&#xD;

      months. This work will be carried out in a laboratory with all the tools and techniques used,&#xD;
      in particular flow cytometry and mass spectrometry, perfectly mastered and realized on&#xD;
      dedicated technical platforms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits / Outlook:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a time when the shortage of organs is growing and becomes a real public health problem, it&#xD;
      becomes essential to better control the management of humoral rejection, the main cause of&#xD;
      long-term renal graft loss. One of the key steps in this step is to find a non-invasive early&#xD;
      diagnostic biomarker to detect humoral rejection from the &quot;subclinical&quot; stage in order to set&#xD;
      up an adapted treatment as quickly as possible.&#xD;
