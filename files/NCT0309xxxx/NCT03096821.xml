      Patients with relapsed/ refractory acute leukemia and relapsed/ refractory aggressive&#xD;
      lymphoma harboring an activating genetic alteration (gene mutation, gene fusion) or drug-able&#xD;
      biomarker / activated signal transduction pathway and resistant to any approved treatment&#xD;
      modality will be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to combine DNA sequencing-based molecular profiling with an ex vivo&#xD;
      high-throughput drug screening strategy. For the latter method, viable cells are obtained&#xD;
      from the individual patient's lymphoma or leukemia in order to determine i)the expression of&#xD;
      relevant therapeutic target molecules and ii)the ex vivo response of the patient's cancer&#xD;
      cells to a panel of agents with anticancer activity. In addition, analysis of tumor stroma&#xD;
      cells will provide information about the differential target expression and cellular&#xD;
      sensitivity aiming at the evaluation of a therapeutic safety window. Thereby, biological&#xD;
      material will have to be accessed within 4 weeks before onset of individualized treatment&#xD;
      (real-time biopsy). Bioinformatic data-management based on a Bayesian statistical approach&#xD;
      will support individualized treatment decisions in this controlled clinical approach.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background and rationale for the trial Etiological concepts on cancer development, malignant&#xD;
      growth and tumor propagation have led to the discovery of various molecular driver&#xD;
      mechanisms. Based on these advances, medical oncology has started to enter an era of&#xD;
      individualized medicine where treatment selection is becoming tailored to drug-able molecular&#xD;
      pathways. This individualized treatment concept is mainly based on molecular and genetic&#xD;
      characterization of the tumors including biomarker technology, which allow us to align the&#xD;
      most appropriate treatment according to the patient's disease. Although there is a general&#xD;
      acceptance towards such individualized approach thereby stratifying and subgrouping patients&#xD;
      to improve the quality of clinical care in oncology, molecular profiling has just started to&#xD;
      assist prediction of the drug's clinical benefit by identifying the most responsive patient&#xD;
      subgroup. Recently, excellent demonstrations of the utility of prognostic and/or predictive&#xD;
      biomarkers have emerged. Von Hoff and co-workers have recently demonstrated that molecular&#xD;
      profiling of patients' tumors is an efficient approach to identify potential targets and&#xD;
      select treatments for their treatment-refractory cancers(Von Hoff, Stephenson et al. 2010).&#xD;
      Such a tailored treatment strategy revealed to be an effective approach to increase&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS), when compared to the patients' most recent standard&#xD;
      treatment regimen. Another example for individualized treatment of patients is given by the&#xD;
      recently published BATTLE trial (Biomarker-integrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy for Lung&#xD;
      Cancer Elimination), a prospective biomarker and biopsy driven trial in pretreated non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (Kim, Herbst et al. 2011). By this Bayesian approach, the&#xD;
      authors demonstrated that targeting individually analyzed molecules of the patient's tumor&#xD;
      might represent an efficient therapeutic approach in the treatment of an incurable disease.&#xD;
      While these examples suggest a benefit for individual tumor characterization for selection of&#xD;
      a tailored treatment concept, currently novel targeted agents in the treatment of cancer are&#xD;
      rather approved for a certain subtype of cancer, but not for patients based on the expression&#xD;
      or activity of respective target lesions. Therefore, the need of an extension of clinical&#xD;
      protocols focusing on molecular profile-based treatment decisions, rather than on anatomic&#xD;
      cancer-subtypes is mandatory. Based on this concept the current protocol was designed. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that molecular profiling of a patient's tumor might not only&#xD;
      predict treatment response, but also leads to an individualized treatment protocol resulting&#xD;
      in clinical benefit for the individual patient. Therefore, this project aims to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of an individualized treatment concept for pre-defined patient's benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, methodology, statistical considerations and organization The Medical University of&#xD;
      Vienna will be clinical sponsor and clinical center of this investigator-initiated open-label&#xD;
      single center single-arm, exploratory phase II study. The individualized treatment concept is&#xD;
      determined to be biopsy-mandated and biomarker-based. Bio-data analysis will be supported by&#xD;
      a software, which is generated by the Center of Medical Statistics, Informatics and&#xD;
      Intelligent Systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and methodology Patients with relapsed/ refractory acute leukemia and relapsed/&#xD;
      refractory aggressive lymphoma harboring an activating genetic alteration (gene mutation,&#xD;
      gene fusion) or drug-able biomarker / activated signal transduction pathway and resistant to&#xD;
      any approved treatment modality will be eligible for this study.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Number of patients. A sample size of 49 patients achieves ≥ 80% power to detect a difference&#xD;
      of 15% between the null hypothesis proportion P0 (PFS ratio ≥ 1.3) = 10% and the alternative&#xD;
      proportion P1(PFS ratio ≥ 1.3) = 25% using a one-sided exact binomial test at a significance&#xD;
      level of 0.0250. The null hypothesis can be rejected, if at least 10 out of 50 patients&#xD;
      treated show a PFS ratio ≥ 1.3. The investigators therefore aim to enroll 49 leukemia&#xD;
      patients and 49 lymphoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population. Patients with relapsed/ refractory acute leukemia and relapsed/ refractory&#xD;
      aggressive lymphoma after standard treatment. Standard treatment is defined according to&#xD;
      actual National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)&#xD;
      (http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp) and/or local guidelines.&#xD;
      49 acute leukemia subjects and 49 lymphoma subjects will be screened for enrolment in the&#xD;
      trial. Deviations from inclusion criteria are not allowed because they can potentially&#xD;
      jeopardize the scientific integrity of the study, regulatory acceptability or subject safety.&#xD;
      Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is essential. Inclusion&#xD;
      criteria as well as exclusion criteria must be respected.&#xD;

    <description>To compare progression-free survival using a treatment regimen selected by molecular profiling with progression-free survival for the most recent regimen the patient has progressed on. The treatment concept is deemed for clinical benefit for the individual patient who has a PSF ratio (PSF on molecular profiling-based therapy/PSF on prior therapy) of ≥ 1.3. For this purpose we will reject the null hypothesis, which is defined as follows: ≤ 15% of patients would have a PFS ratio of ≥ 1.3. Thus, the individual patient is his own control. For tumor types with high numbers of patients per cohort, the overall response rate (ORR) will be evaluated.</description>
