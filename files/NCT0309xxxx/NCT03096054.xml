    <textblock>
      This clinical study is looking at a drug called LY3143921 hydrate (a Cdc7 inhibitor) in adult&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumours. The main aims are to find out the maximum dose of&#xD;
      LY3143921 hydrate that can be given safely to patients, more about the potential side effects&#xD;
      and how they can be treated&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This clinical study is looking at a drug called LY3143921 hydrate (a Cdc7 inhibitor). Cdc7&#xD;
      helps our cells replicate correctly. In normal cells, Cdc7 is usually found at a low level,&#xD;
      but can reach higher levels in cancer cells. This is often the case in certain types of solid&#xD;
      tumour cancers, which we will focus on in this study. It is thought that giving LY3143921&#xD;
      hydrate will block the function of Cdc7 and will affect cancer cells by stopping their&#xD;
      replication and causing them to die. LY3143921 hydrate looks promising in laboratory studies&#xD;
      and studies in animals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study has two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 - a 'dose escalation' phase where groups of patients will receive increasing doses of&#xD;
      LY3143921 hydrate to find a safe dose and a dose that best targets the cancer cells. This&#xD;
      part of the trial is now closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 - an 'expansion' phase where a larger group of patients will receive the highest dose&#xD;
      of LY3143921 hydrate considered to be safe from Part 1, to find out more about how the drug&#xD;
      is working.&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Presence of a ventricular arrhythmia requiring treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Past history of corneal ulceration, dry eye syndrome, glaucoma. Contact lenses should&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a&#xD;
             good candidate for the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Is a participant or plans to participate in another interventional clinical trial,&#xD;
             whilst taking part in this Phase I study of LY3143921 hydrate. Participation in an&#xD;
             observational trial or interventional clinical trial which does not involve&#xD;
             administration of an IMP and which would not place an unacceptable burden on the&#xD;
             patient in the opinion of the Investigator and Medical Advisor would be acceptable.&#xD;
