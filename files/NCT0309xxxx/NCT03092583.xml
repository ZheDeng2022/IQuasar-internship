    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to quantify global DNA methylation in patients with Ankylosing&#xD;
      Spondylitis or Axial Spondyloarthritis as compared with control subjects.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spondyloarthritis covers a group of diseases with common clinical, genetic and radiographic&#xD;
      characteristics. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is the most common of these, and is usually&#xD;
      diagnosed in the presence of bilateral sacroiliitis by conventional x-ray, according to the&#xD;
      modified New York criteria. Axial spondyloarthritis (Ax-SpA) mainly affects the axial&#xD;
      skeleton and progresses towards the formation of bone or bony structures around the&#xD;
      sacro-iliac joint and spine, leading to the gradual formation of a bony bridge from the&#xD;
      sacro-iliac joint and ligamentous ossifications to the spine. Early forms of the disease do&#xD;
      not present such modifications to the sacro-iliac joint and therefore, show no visible&#xD;
      sacroiliitis on conventional x-ray. Thus, it is possible to classify a patient aged &lt;45 years&#xD;
      with inflammatory lower back pain as having Ax-SpA, irrespective of the presence of&#xD;
      sacroiliitis by x-ray. Indeed, inflammation of the sacro-iliac joint and spine occurs before&#xD;
      the process of ossification and inflammation, and can be detected by MRI. This led the&#xD;
      Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) group to propose candidate&#xD;
      classification criteria for Ax-SpA, notably adapted to early forms of the disease.&#xD;
      Accordingly, patients with Ax-SpA without radiographic sacroiliitis are considered to have&#xD;
      non-radiographic Ax-SpA. Classification criteria for peripheral SpA are also available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The determinants of AS and SpA are complex, and involve both genetic and environmental&#xD;
      factors. In addition to these factors, several studies in recent years have also highlighted&#xD;
      the emerging role of epigenetics in the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term epigenetics refers to heritable and reversible modifications in gene expression&#xD;
      without any change in the coding DNA sequence. This process may be involved in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of different diseases and their clinical expression. Several different&#xD;
      epigenetic mechanisms may concur to modify gene functioning. Changes to the chromatin and to&#xD;
      DNA (without modification of the encoding sequence itself) have been shown to be important&#xD;
      for the control of gene expression through suppressive or permissive factors. Thus, DNA&#xD;
      methylation could play a role in auto-immune or inflammatory diseases by regulating gene&#xD;
      expression, particularly those coding for pro-inflammatory mediators such as certain&#xD;
      cytokines, thereby contributing to dysregulation of the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA methylation is regulated by the activity of DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMT). In&#xD;
      multicellular eukaryotic organisms, DNA methylation is associated with chromatin repression,&#xD;
      and thereby, inhibition of gene expression. DNA methylation can be evaluated across the whole&#xD;
      genome, but also at the level of a specific candidate gene, such as the gene encoding a&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of DNA methylation has been evaluated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in systemic&#xD;
      lupus erythematosus (SLE), and a &quot;methylated-DNA&quot; signature has been observed in these&#xD;
      auto-immune diseases. Currently, there is no available data regarding DNA methylation in AS&#xD;
      or SpA in general. In this study, the investigators aim to analyse the global DNA methylation&#xD;
      in patients with AS or Ax-SpA.&#xD;
