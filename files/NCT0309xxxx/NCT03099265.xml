  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment for patients with pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. Patients with BRPC have tumors in close contact with the vasculature but not to the&#xD;
      extent that resection is prohibited. Nonetheless, retrospective studies have shown that&#xD;
      immediate resection in these patients is associated with an increased risk of positive&#xD;
      margins, and a margin positive resection does not improve survival over that of patients with&#xD;
      unresectable disease. Moreover, even in those patients where a successful resection is&#xD;
      achieved, there is a high rate of early metastatic progression suggesting that&#xD;
      micrometastatic disease is often present at diagnosis. Therefore neoadjuvant therapy is&#xD;
      likely to improve outcomes in patients with BRPC to increase the likelihood of achieving a&#xD;
      margin negative resection, provide early control of occult micrometastatic disease, and&#xD;
      select those patients without systemic progression who would benefit from surgical resection.&#xD;

      Given the superior outcomes with FOLFIRINOX and the potential for improved local response&#xD;
      with SBRT, the investigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of pre-operative modified&#xD;
      FOLFIRINOX followed by SBRT in patients with borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that pre-operative modified FOLFIRINOX followed by SBRT will&#xD;
      improve the rate of R0 resections compared to historical controls treated with standard&#xD;
      gemcitabine-based chemotherapy and fractionated radiation prior to surgery.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome of this study is the R0 resection rate in patients with BRPC treated with neoadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX and SBRT. R0 resection indicates a microscopically margin-negative resection, in which no gross or microscopic tumor remains in the primary tumor bed.</description>
