  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ONC201 is a small molecule which selectively targets the G protein-coupled receptor DRD2.&#xD;
      Downstream of target engagement, ONC201 activates the integrated stress response (ISR) in&#xD;
      tumor cell leading to inactivation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)&#xD;
      signaling as well as induction of the TRAIL pathway. ONC201 also inhibits dopamine receptor 2&#xD;
      (DRD2), resulting in anti-tumor responses in preclinical models. Single agent ONC201 has been&#xD;
      examined in open-label Phase I studies in patients with advanced, treatment refractory solid&#xD;
      malignancies. Due to its differential anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic response in tumor&#xD;
      cells, treatment was overall well tolerated, and the recommended phase II dose of ONC201 was&#xD;
      set at 625mg every three weeks. An additional dose-escalation phase I study (NCT02609230) is&#xD;
      further evaluating weekly versus three week dosing in patients with advanced solid tumors and&#xD;
      multiple myeloma. Preliminary data from these phase I studies suggests a possible clinical&#xD;
      benefit in patients with advanced, chemo-refractory endometrial cancers, with at least one&#xD;
      mixed response noted in a patient with clear cell histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Single agent ONC201 will demonstrate clinical benefit in women with recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic endometrial cancers, especially in those women with alterations in the&#xD;
      Phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.&#xD;

    <description>ONC201 will be administered at a dose of 625 mg by mouth weekly until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or if the patient discontinues for any other reason. Radiologic tumor assessment would be performed at baseline, Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 5 Day 1, and at the end of every 3 cycles beyond cycle 5. All patients including those removed from the study due to unacceptable toxicity, will undergo radiologic tumor assessment at the time of discontinuation (End of treatment).</description>
