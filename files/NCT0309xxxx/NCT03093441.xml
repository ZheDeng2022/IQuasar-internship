  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, it has been demonstrated that multimodal high-intensity interval training (MM-HIIT)&#xD;
      (utilizing resistance-based and functional movements) can produce similar aerobic adaptations&#xD;
      compared to high-intensity interval training (HIIT) using rowing but with greater muscle&#xD;
      performance in females. In addition, HIIT has been shown to be more enjoyable than continuous&#xD;
      training, and this may lead to enhanced self-efficacy and increased physical activity. To the&#xD;
      investigators' knowledge, however, the cardiometabolic effects (blood pressure,&#xD;
      abdominal/visceral fat, blood sugar, blood lipids/fats) of MM-HIIT have not been reported.&#xD;
      The investigators aim to compare MM-HIIT with HIIT using a traditional aerobic fitness&#xD;
      exercise (rowing) for the degree of cardiometabolic, physical performance (strength,&#xD;
      endurance, power), and psychosocial (self-efficacy and enjoyment) adaptations. They will also&#xD;
      determined sustained effects of the intervention by completing a 9-month follow-up.&#xD;

      The PI will verify age with a drivers license or other form of identification to ensure that&#xD;
      the study participants are at least 18 years of age to participate. After obtaining consent,&#xD;
      the PI will then administer a pre-exercise screening tool, the Physical Activity Readiness&#xD;
      Questionnaire for Everyone, to the participant for them to complete in order to aid in&#xD;
      determining study eligibility. If the participant is deemed eligible, 3 other questionnaires&#xD;
      will be emailed to participants for completion: Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale, Exercise&#xD;
      Self-efficacy Scale, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form.&#xD;
      Given that the participants will be instructed to not change any physical activity habits&#xD;
      outside of the study, the IPAQ will be used to control for this pre- and post-intervention&#xD;
      and weekly throughout the duration of the intervention. All forms must be completed and&#xD;
      submitted to the PI prior to further data collection. Data collection will consist of a (1)&#xD;
      blood collection visit, (2) exercise testing and abdominal/visceral fat measurement session,&#xD;
      (3) three exercise/movement familiarization sessions (only conducted pre-intervention), (4)&#xD;
      three strength, muscular endurance, and muscular power testing sessions before and after the&#xD;
      intervention, and 12 weeks of training three times per week as described below. Excluding the&#xD;
      consent obtaining meeting, participants will attend 8 sessions prior to beginning the&#xD;
      intervention as detailed below. During the intervention, participants will be wearing heart&#xD;
      rate monitors in order to monitor their training intensity. The PI will lead all data&#xD;
      collection procedures with the assistance of School of Health Science students and Dr. Myung&#xD;
      Choi except for the blood collection and analysis which will be supervised by Dr. Kristen&#xD;
      Landis-Piwowar. All measures will be assessed pre- and post-intervention. Blind copy emails&#xD;
      will be sent to remind the participants about upcoming data collection sessions and to&#xD;
      schedule a data collection appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1: Prevention Research Center (blood collection visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following 12-hr fast, assessments include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  weight, height, waist circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  resting heart rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  venipuncture (blood sugar and fat)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2: Prevention Research Center (exercise testing and visceral fat visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dual-x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to measure visceral adipose tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bicycle VO2max test with standard warm-up and clinical monitoring to assess aerobic&#xD;
           endurance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale and Exercise Self-efficacy Scale (post-intervention)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 3-5: Oakland University (OU) Recreation Center (familiarization visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Familiarization sessions include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  teaching movements used in subsequent testing and training&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assessment of musculoskeletal limitations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intervention leader and assistants will attend sessions as part of training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 6-8: OU Recreation Center (performance testing visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 6: one repetition maximum (1 RM) testing for back squat (muscular strength); 70% 1RM&#xD;
           back squat for max effort repetitions unbroken (muscular endurance)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 7: 1 RM overhead press (muscular strength)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 8: 1 RM deadlift (muscular strength) and max broad jump (muscular power)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  standardized warm-up prior to cool-down following each session&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  at least 48 hours of rest between each session&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre- and post-intervention health measurements: Prevention Research Center Anthropometrics&#xD;
      and vital sign measures such as height (using a stadiometer), weight (using an eye-level beam&#xD;
      scale), heart rate and blood pressure (sitting with a sphygmomanometer) will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre- and post-intervention endurance measurements: Prevention Research Center Aerobic fitness&#xD;
      will be directly assessed by a VO2max bicycle test. Each participant will be allowed to&#xD;
      warm-up on the bicycle for 5 minutes at a low intensity. The VO2max bicycle test will include&#xD;
      3 minute stages with increasing intensity each stage of 30 - 60 watts. The required cadence&#xD;
      will be maintained at 60 revolutions per minute (RPM) for each stage. The test will be&#xD;
      terminated at volitional fatigue defined as the participant no longer able to maintain 60&#xD;
      RPMs for 20 seconds after encouragement from the testers. For most people, the test will take&#xD;
      approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre- and post-intervention strength measurements: OU Recreation Center Prior to strength&#xD;
      testing, three familiarization sessions will be conducted whereby participants will be taught&#xD;
      and given a chance to practice the movements to be used for testing and training. During&#xD;
      these sessions, participants will be assessed for any musculoskeletal limitations such as a&#xD;
      lack of hip and ankle mobility that may require movement/exercise modifications to ensure&#xD;
      safe technique. Following the familiarization sessions, each participant will complete three&#xD;
      further days of testing, with at least 48 hours between testing days. These testing sessions&#xD;
      will occur at OU Recreation Center. Each of these test sessions will be preceded by a&#xD;
      standardized warmup and instruction regarding the upcoming session. On separate days, muscle&#xD;
      strength will be assessed using 1-repetition maximum (1RM) testing for back squat, press, and&#xD;
      deadlift using standardized protocols. The back squat will be performed to below parallel&#xD;
      (hip crease below the apex of the patella), the press will be initiated with the bar on the&#xD;
      clavicles, and the deadlift will performed in the conventional stance. All testing days will&#xD;
      be repeated following training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre- and post-intervention muscle endurance and muscle power: OU Recreation Center Muscle&#xD;
      endurance will be assessed by repetitive back squats to voluntary exhaustion. The load will&#xD;
      be set at 70% of the pre-training&#xD;
&#xD;
      1RM back squat for both pre- and post-training tests. This test will be conducted immediately&#xD;
      after the 1 RM testing for back squat. Movement standards will be the same as those for the&#xD;
      1RM test, and the total number of successful repetitions achieved without a rest will be&#xD;
      recorded. Muscle power will be assessed using a static broad jump. The best horizontal&#xD;
      distance achieved out of 3 trials will be recorded. This test will be conducted immediately&#xD;
      after the 1 RM testing for the deadlift.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre- and post-intervention biochemistry measurements: Prevention Research Center Following a&#xD;
      12-hour fast, participants will complete venipuncture collection procedures. Two invasive&#xD;
      needle sticks will be performed during this investigation (one needle stick pre-intervention&#xD;
      and another needle stick post-intervention). Four milliliters (mL) of blood will be collected&#xD;
      both pre- and post-intervention for measurement of: total cholesterol, high-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase,&#xD;
      glucose, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This total amount of blood (8mL) collected&#xD;
      during this trial will equate to 1.6 teaspoons of blood (5mL = 1 teaspoon). The risks of&#xD;
      blood draw may include: infection, delayed healing, bruising and/or inflammation at the site&#xD;
      of vein puncture, physical discomfort, mental discomfort, fainting and feeling faint and&#xD;
      injury to a nerve or vessel. These risks will be minimized by the use of a trained&#xD;
      professional (Dr. Kristen Landis-Piwowar) experienced with performing the blood draws,&#xD;
      sterile technique and single use, disposable, materials who will be supervising the blood&#xD;
      draw and analysis. Study participants may refuse to participate at any time and withdraw from&#xD;
      the study without penalty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre- and post-intervention visceral fat measurement using dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)&#xD;
      scan: Prevention Research Center For this measurement of visceral fat, each participant will&#xD;
      be asked to lie flat on a special table below the DXA scan. A trained technician (Elise&#xD;
      Brown, Ryan Tyler, Myung Choi, or Samantha Orr) will position each participant's body under&#xD;
      the scan and then perform the scan, which will only take &lt; 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre- and post-intervention psychosocial questionnaires The purpose of including these&#xD;
      psychosocial assessments in the proposed study is to assess changes in physical activity&#xD;
      enjoyment and exercise self-efficacy. High-intensity interval training has been shown to be&#xD;
      more enjoyable than continuous training, and this may lead to enhanced self-efficacy. These&#xD;
      questionnaires will be emailed to participants for completion: Physical Activity Enjoyment&#xD;
      Scale and Exercise Self-efficacy Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nine months following the intervention, participants will complete all assessments again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be led by students (one leader and at least 2 assistants) who will be&#xD;
      trained by the PI, and exercise protocols are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MM-HIIT Group: This group will train using multimodal exercises for 5 sets of 60 seconds of&#xD;
      all out work, followed by 3 minutes of rest (a total of 20 minutes each session). Each&#xD;
      session will have the same exercises within each set, but every session will be different&#xD;
      than the others for movements utilized. There will be three movements used in each set. The&#xD;
      first movement will be a strength movement (such as overhead press, squat, deadlift) for 4-6&#xD;
      repetitions. The second movement follows the first immediately and is a faster body weight or&#xD;
      light implement power movement such as lunges, body weight squats, or push ups for 6-8&#xD;
      repetitions. The third movement follows the second immediately and is a very fast,&#xD;
      sprint-like movement such as box jumps, ball slams, or jump rope for the remainder of the 60&#xD;
      seconds. The intent of each set is to be completed with as much effort as possible across the&#xD;
      full 60 seconds. The intervention leader will record weight used for each exercise and will&#xD;
      instruct participants to increase intensity (up to 110% of previous intensity used) at&#xD;
      subsequent session once maximum prescribed repetitions have been.&#xD;
&#xD;
      R-HIIT Group: This group will train using a rowing ergometer for 5 sets of 60 seconds of all&#xD;
      out work, followed by 3 minutes of rest (a total of 20 minutes each session). Each training&#xD;
      session will be the same across the 12 weeks. The intent of each set is to be completed with&#xD;
      as much effort as possible across the full 60 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: This group will be instructed to continue with any activity they were involved&#xD;
      in prior to the study and to not begin any new exercise programs during the course of the&#xD;
      study. To incentive participation in this group, the control group will be offered the&#xD;
      MM-HIIT intervention the following semester at no cost.&#xD;
