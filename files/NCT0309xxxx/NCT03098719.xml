  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GISMO combines spatial information with findings on the health effects of sustainable, active&#xD;
      forms of mobility in the work environment in order to derive evidence-based decision-making&#xD;
      bases for a health-promoting, operational mobility management. Existing approaches - with&#xD;
      regard to spatial information systems, decision-support systems and health effects of active&#xD;
      mobility - are considered and supplemented by our developments and investigations. Achieved&#xD;
      non-personal results are provided through standardized web interfaces, ensuring integration&#xD;
      into existing and prospective tools of an innovative and health-promoting mobility&#xD;
      management.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization recommends a minimum of 150 minutes per week of moderate&#xD;
      activity as a minimum for a healthy daily routine. The average employee in Austria works on 5&#xD;
      days a week and covers the distance from his place of residence to his place of work twice.&#xD;
      This distance can be actively traveled (e.g., bicycle) or passively (e.g., car).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to a moderate physical activity (intensity 4-6 METs, corresponding to 4-6 times resting&#xD;
      energy conversion) of 15 minutes in one direction, only the active minimum requirement for&#xD;
      everyday activity would be achieved by active mobility to and from the workplace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2: 1 randomized controlled trial (intervention group: control group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motivation of the employees by health care professionals of a sample company (Salzburger&#xD;
      Landeskrankenanstalten AG, SALK) to use the public transport as well as the bicycle or&#xD;
      footpath on the way from and to the workplace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention A: Change from car to bicycle for at least 50% of the routes, n = 20-25&#xD;
      Employees who have previously traveled exclusively by car and are living within a radius of&#xD;
      â‰¤10 kilometers from the workplace are motivated by the GVPs to switch to a bicycle. In the&#xD;
      case of appropriate proximity, employees can travel the entire path without motorized&#xD;
      mobility. The greatest health benefit is to be expected by largely dispensing with motorized&#xD;
      mobility at work. In the case of bad weather, cold or similar obstacles, a public transport&#xD;
      or car can be used occasionally and exceptionally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention B: Exit from public transport one or more stations earlier or enter one or more&#xD;
      station later, n = 20-25 By extending the path to and from a stop, which is to be actively&#xD;
      pursued, a health effect is expected. In the context of this intervention, the availability&#xD;
      of time tickets will provide incentives for switching from car to public transport. In&#xD;
      addition, the employees are motivated to use the next stop in order to extend the active&#xD;
      distance. Access routes can also be covered on foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: Maintaining the mobility as before n = 20-25&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after the intervention phase of 1 year (to take into account seasonal effects or&#xD;
      fluctuations), parameters relevant to health are collected. Finally, the results of the&#xD;
      initial examination are compared with those of the final examination in order to examine the&#xD;
      effects of healthy mobility on the workplace on cardiovascular risk profile, everyday&#xD;
      activity, physical performance, quality of life, mobility behavior, body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to generate data on the health effects of a healthy mobility.&#xD;
