  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to characterise the plasma and urine pharmacokinetic profile of&#xD;
      Etamicastat (BIA 5-453) and its metabolites after three multiple rising dose regimens of&#xD;
      Etamicastat (BIA 5-453).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of three dosage regimens of&#xD;
      Etamicastat (BIA 5-453) in 3 groups of 8 hypertensive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each group, the study consisted of a 10-day multiple-dose period. Progression to the next&#xD;
      dose level only occurred if the previous dose level was considered to be safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated. An appropriate interval separated the investigation of doses to permit a timely&#xD;
      review and evaluation of safety data prior to proceeding to a higher dose level.&#xD;
