      Patient sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with histologically proven marginal zone lymphoma (splenic, nodal and extra-nodal&#xD;
      subtypes included).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other important requirements for recruitment into the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior treatment with one or more lines rituximab or rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy&#xD;
           with failure to achieve at least a partial response (PR) or documented disease&#xD;
           progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age ≥ 21 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 1 measurable disease site on computed tomography (CT) scan that is at least&#xD;
           1.5cm in the longest dimension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient must have an indication for treatment e.g., symptoms from disease, bulky disease&#xD;
           (&gt;5cm), threatened end-organ function, or cytopenias requiring transfusion or growth&#xD;
           factor support&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage and Dose Regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      560mg of Ibrutinib is administered orally once daily. Patients with mild liver impairment&#xD;
      (Child's-Pugh A), ibrutinib 140mg (1 x 140mg capsule) will be administered instead. The&#xD;
      patient will continue on treatment until one of the following occurs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient has disease progression (as assessed by the investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient has an intercurrent illness or adverse events that prevents further ibrutinib&#xD;
           administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient decides to withdraw from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigator considers withdrawal to be in the best interest of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient requires continuous therapy on a prohibited concomitant medication and no&#xD;
           alternative medications or therapies are available as a replacement to the prohibited&#xD;
           medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient is lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient is non-compliant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient becomes pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study termination by the Sponsor or regulatory authority.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completed 3 years of ibrutinib treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT Neck to pelvis or FDG-PET/CT skull base to mid-thigh to be performed repeated after every&#xD;
      12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of ibrutinib in Asian&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory MZL. We will consider an ORR of 50% to be desirable.&#xD;
      Simon's 2-stage minimax design will be used to test the null hypothesis that the overall&#xD;
      response rate will be less than or equal to 20% (response rate that is considered not&#xD;
      clinically compelling). Twelve subjects will be included in the first stage, and if there are&#xD;
      at least 3 responders, a total of 21 subjects will be enrolled. The treatment will be&#xD;
      declared ineffective if there are less than 8 responders in total. This design has 90% power&#xD;
      to detect an overall response rate of 50% at a 5% significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Overall response rates (complete remission [CR] + partial remission [PR])&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Survival parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Progression-free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Frequency and severity of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Frequency of AE requiring discontinuation of study drug or dose reductions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned sample size is 21 patients enrolled at multiple centres in Singapore and South&#xD;
      Korea&#xD;
