  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying the safety and tolerability of an investigational combination&#xD;
      of drugs, radium-223 plus pembrolizumab as a possible treatment for castration-resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radium-223&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved radium-223 by itself as a&#xD;
      treatment option for the participant's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved pembrolizumab for the participant's specific disease, but it has&#xD;
      been approved for other uses, such as a type of skin cancer called melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating the immune response, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the combination of pembrolizumab (a type of immunotherapy drug) plus&#xD;
      radium-223. Pembrolizumab works to block the PD-1 pathway, which plays an important role in&#xD;
      lessening the activity of one's immune system to fight cancer. Pembrolizumab is therefore&#xD;
      referred to as a PD-1 inhibitor, and acts by stimulating the patient's T cells, which are&#xD;
      important immune cells, to attack tumors and treat cancer. Radium-223 targets cancer that&#xD;
      exists in the bone directly. Radium-223 binds to minerals in the bone to deliver radiation&#xD;
      directly to the cancer that has spread to the bones while limiting damage to the surrounding&#xD;
      body tissues. Part of this study is to look at whether the investigators may more effectively&#xD;
      control the participant's prostate cancer by combining these drugs. Radium-223 may kill&#xD;
      cancer cells and release proteins specific to the tumor. The participant's immune system can&#xD;
      then use those proteins to teach the T cells what the cancer looks like, and identify it for&#xD;
      attack. Pembrolizumab can increase the number and activity of these immune cells, building a&#xD;
      T cell &quot;army&quot; specialized to recognize and attack the cancer. The way these two drugs work on&#xD;
      the cancer and the immune system may result in better control of the tumor than just&#xD;
      radium-223 alone but needs to be investigated.&#xD;

             have possible endocrine effects on prostate cancer that have been started within the&#xD;
             past 8 weeks, as they may affect PSA levels or response. These are allowed if the&#xD;
             patient has been on a stable dose for at least 8 weeks prior to C1D1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving other investigational agents&#xD;

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment and is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis. A history&#xD;

             HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;

             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;

             including transient ischemic attacks) or clinically significant ventricular&#xD;
             arrhythmias within 6 months prior to randomization; or significant vascular disease&#xD;
