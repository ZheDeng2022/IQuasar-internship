  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm in need of an endovascular or open operative&#xD;
      restructuring will be asked to participate in this study. After obtaining written consent a&#xD;
      central venous catheter and a liquor drainage will be routinely placed during surgery. The&#xD;
      catheter and the drainage will stay in the patients for at least 72 hours postoperatively. In&#xD;
      total, nine measurements of the liquor and serum will be performed within a week in order to&#xD;
      determine the following parameters: neuropeptide P, neuropeptide Y, neurofilament triplet&#xD;
      protein (NFL), S100B, glial fibrillary protein (GFAp), lactate, glucose, or oxygen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with complex aortic diseases receiving an operative treatment are under risk of&#xD;
      spinal cord damage due to insufficient blood circulation of the spinal cord during surgery.&#xD;
      The risk depends on comorbidities, extent of surgery, and the perioperative management.&#xD;
      Despite an adequate preoperative imaging, assessment of the blood circulation of the spinal&#xD;
      cord during endovascular or open operative restructuring is struggling. Beside the monitoring&#xD;
      possibilities of the spinal cord functions during surgery, insufficient approaches regarding&#xD;
      early detection of spinal ischemia by using laboratory parameters exist. Several biomarker,&#xD;
      e.g. neuropeptide P, neuropeptide Y, neurofilament triplet protein (NFL), S100B, glial&#xD;
      fibrillary protein (GFAp), lactate, glucose, or oxygen, will be evaluated singularly or as a&#xD;
      bundle of markers in small patient groups. Surgeries of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms are&#xD;
      associated with high risks despite already existing high standardized procedures (Cowan et&#xD;
      al. 2003). The major complications are cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal&#xD;
      complications, and ischemias of the spinal cord. Especially, the ischemia of the spinal cord&#xD;
      is a feared complication caused by the irreversibility and the small time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study samples of liquor and tissues (serum, urine) will be drawn pre-, peri- and&#xD;
      postoperatively. Patients will receive a routinely placed liquor drainage due to the temporal&#xD;
      duration in surgery. The liquor drainage stays in the patient also in the early postoperative&#xD;
      phase. Hence, the patient will not be bothered with additional examinations. Additionally,&#xD;
      biomaterial (blood) will be drawn routinely and used for the biomarker measurement as well as&#xD;
      biobanking.&#xD;
