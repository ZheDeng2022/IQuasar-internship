      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the leading cause of chest infections (pneumonia and&#xD;
      bronchiolitis) in young children, and is a major cause of admission to hospital and childhood&#xD;
      death worldwide. One possible way to protect the mother and young infant from RSV infection&#xD;
      is a vaccine given to women during pregnancy (maternal vaccination), which would pass&#xD;
      protection to their unborn child. This may help to prevent RSV in the child's first few&#xD;
      months of life when they are most vulnerable to infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two main aims to this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To pre-emptively gauge the knowledge of RSV and potential acceptability of such vaccines&#xD;
           amongst pregnant women and healthcare staff working in midwifery and obstetrics, as well&#xD;
           as their attitudes (facilitators and barriers) to being involved in hypothetical future&#xD;
           research trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We also wish to gauge the attitudes to routinely recommended vaccines in pregnancy&#xD;
           (pertussis and influenza)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to undertake a questionnaire-based study of randomly selected&#xD;
      pregnant women and healthcare staff (over 16 years of age) at English teaching hospitals and&#xD;
      GP practices. Pregnant women attending for ward reviews or antenatal clinics will approached&#xD;
      and asked to complete an anonymous paper questionnaire lasting around 10 minutes. Healthcare&#xD;
      staff will be approached in person, or via email, and asked to complete a slightly different&#xD;
      questionnaire lasting around 5-10 minutes. No follow up will take place. Using statistical&#xD;
      software, the investigators hope to identify factors that might affect patients'&#xD;
      understanding of RSV and attitudes to being involved in hypothetical future trials and&#xD;
      receiving routine vaccination&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a very common virus that causes infection of the airways&#xD;
      and lungs. It is the leading cause of chest infections (pneumonia and bronchiolitis) in young&#xD;
      children, and is a major cause of admission to hospital and childhood death worldwide. Lots&#xD;
      of research trials are being done into ways of preventing and treating RSV, however there is&#xD;
      still no RSV vaccine approved for routine use. One possible way to protect the mother and&#xD;
      young infant from RSV infection is a vaccine given to women during pregnancy, which would&#xD;
      pass protection to their unborn child. This may help to prevent RSV in the child's first few&#xD;
      months of life when they are most vulnerable to infection. There are two vaccines that are&#xD;
      currently being tested in pregnant women around the world, including the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two main aims to this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To pre-emptively gauge the knowledge of RSV and potential acceptability of such vaccines&#xD;
           amongst pregnant women and healthcare staff working in midwifery and obstetrics, as well&#xD;
           as their attitudes (facilitators and barriers) to being involved in hypothetical future&#xD;
           research trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We also wish to gauge the attitudes to routinely recommended vaccines in pregnancy&#xD;
           (pertussis and influenza)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to undertake a questionnaire-based study of randomly selected&#xD;
      pregnant women and healthcare staff (over 16 years of age) at four English teaching&#xD;
      hospitals. Pregnant women attending for ward reviews or antenatal clinics will approached and&#xD;
      asked to complete an anonymous paper questionnaire lasting around 10 minutes. Healthcare&#xD;
      staff will be approached in person, or via email, and asked to complete a slightly different&#xD;
      questionnaire lasting around 5-10 minutes. No follow up will take place. Using statistical&#xD;
      software, the investigators hope to identify factors that might affect patients'&#xD;
      understanding of RSV and attitudes to being involved in hypothetical future trials and&#xD;
      receiving routine vaccination&#xD;
