  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there are no studies that address the optimum dosage of lidocaine for surgical&#xD;
      procedures. Lidocaine is a local anesthetic that is injected to induce anesthesia. Improper&#xD;
      or inefficient pain treatment can lead to longer hospital stay, and adverse side effects such&#xD;
      as nausea and vomiting. Opioids are the primary drug to treat moderate to severe pain, but&#xD;
      are also responsible for nausea and other side effects. Lidocaine has shown to have opioid&#xD;
      sparing effects; meaning less opioid use is necessary for pain relief. In this study, we will&#xD;
      conduct a clinical trial to assess the difference between different lidocaine dosage&#xD;
      schedules to determine the optimum dosage that brings maximum pain relief while minimizing&#xD;
      adverse side effects and patient stay. A large benefit in using lidocaine is its documented&#xD;
      opioid sparing which allows for minimal drug treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lidocaine was first discovered from systematic investigations at the Institute of Chemistry&#xD;
      at Stockholm. In the early 1940s, Nils Lofgren discovered lidocaine as a potent anesthetic,&#xD;
      initially labelled LL30. It was first clinically tested in 1994, and stood up to appraisal as&#xD;
      a reliable and highly efficient local anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One systematic review found that, depending on the duration of the infusion of lidocaine,&#xD;
      significantly different pain ratings resulted. Similarly, a review found low to moderate&#xD;
      evidence for an effect of intravenous lidocaine on pain at rest as one of the major&#xD;
      predefined outcomes. Interestingly, this was true for a large variation between the bolus&#xD;
      doses (1 to 3mg/kg) and continuous infusion regimes (1.5 to 5 mg/kg/h). The variation of&#xD;
      doses impacted pain; early and intermediate, postoperative ileus, time to first flatus, and&#xD;
      time to first bowel movements/sounds. One study based all medications in the protocol on the&#xD;
      dosing body weight [ideal body weight (IBW) + 0.4 x (actual body weight-IBW). Besides an&#xD;
      important improvement in overall quality of recovery, subjects had an improvement in the&#xD;
      physical comfort, pain, and physical independence subcomponents of the quality of recovery&#xD;
      score. Additionally, there was an opioid sparing effect observed in patients undergoing&#xD;
      laparoscopic bariatric surgery, making it especially critical due to the limited respiratory&#xD;
      reserve of the bariatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study assigned subjects in the experimental group to an IV infusion of 2mg/kg per&#xD;
      hour of lidocaine, maintained 15 to 30 minutes before skin closure. The study found similar&#xD;
      positive effects, improving postoperative analgesia, reducing postoperative opioid&#xD;
      requirements, and accelerating the return of the first flatus. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigation found results similar to previous investigations with longer infusion times&#xD;
      across a variety of surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above, there is a call for further research evaluating the optimum dosage of&#xD;
      lidocaine infusion in bariatric populations undergoing major surgery. Not only are there a&#xD;
      wide variety of positive effects of lidocaine that need to be investigated, but there is a&#xD;
      need for precision and sensitivity of dose regimes in a bariatric population susceptible to&#xD;
      adverse effects. It is therefore of interest to find an optimal dosage schedule in order to&#xD;
      provide anesthesiologists with a standard which maximizes opioid sparing effects, whilst&#xD;
      minimizing patient pain, hospital stay, as well as nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the complexity of this proposed randomized-controlled trial, as well as time and&#xD;
      financial limitations, a pilot study was deemed necessary to find out the feasibility and&#xD;
      safety of comparing different dosing schedules, rate of patient recruitment, funding&#xD;
      necessities, and needs of additional personnel.&#xD;
