  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a condition characterized by chronic and excessive&#xD;
      worry and anxiety. Over the past 15 years, the investigators have developed a&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioural treatment that leads to the remission of GAD in approximately 60% to&#xD;
      75% of affected individuals. Although these numbers are encouraging, there remain a&#xD;
      considerable proportion of patients who do not fully benefit from treatment. With the goal of&#xD;
      improving treatment efficacy, the investigators have recently carried out a series of related&#xD;
      studies on the way individuals with GAD and high worriers process uncertain or ambiguous&#xD;
      information from their environment. The findings show that these individuals display biases&#xD;
      in attention for, and appraisal of, uncertain or ambiguous information. Specifically,&#xD;
      individuals with GAD and high worriers preferentially allocate their attention to&#xD;
      uncertainty-related stimuli and appraise ambiguous information in a threatening manner. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators examine the impact of these information processing biases,&#xD;
      measured at intake, on the efficacy of cognitive-behavioural treatment for GAD. The&#xD;
      investigators also examine the impact of residual information processing biases, measured at&#xD;
      posttreatment, on the maintenance of treatment gains over 18 months following treatment. The&#xD;
      main hypotheses are (1) that high levels of pretreatment biases will predict poorer outcomes&#xD;
      immediately following therapy, and (2) that high levels of posttreatment biases will predict&#xD;
      relapse during the 18 months following therapy. If, as expected, information processing&#xD;
      biases predict poor short- and long-term treatment outcomes for individuals with GAD, the&#xD;
      investigators will expand the treatment to integrate strategies that directly target these&#xD;
      biases in order to increase its efficacy.&#xD;

      Background: The investigators have developed a cognitive model of generalized anxiety&#xD;
      disorder (GAD) that has intolerance of uncertainty as its central component. Based on this&#xD;
      model, they have devised a cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT) for GAD that helps affected&#xD;
      individuals recognize, accept, and deal with the uncertainty of everyday life. Although the&#xD;
      treatment leads to positive outcomes in most patients, a significant minority of treated&#xD;
      individuals do not attain full remission. One potential avenue for improving the treatment of&#xD;
      GAD is to identify disorder-specific modes of cognitive processing (or information&#xD;
      processing) and to directly target these modes of processing in therapy. Accordingly, the&#xD;
      investigators have carried out a series of related studies examining the relationship between&#xD;
      cognitive processing and GAD. The findings from these studies show that individuals who have&#xD;
      clinical or subclinical GAD (1) preferentially allocate their attention to&#xD;
      uncertainty-related stimuli, and (2) make threatening appraisals of ambiguous information.&#xD;
      Further, the data show that the tendency to make threatening appraisals of ambiguous&#xD;
      information mediates the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and the symptoms of&#xD;
      GAD. This latter finding is consistent with cognitive theory, which asserts that information&#xD;
      processing mediates the influence of cognitive vulnerability on the expression of symptoms of&#xD;
      emotional disorders. This study aims to extend this line of research by investigating the&#xD;
      impact of these cognitive processing biases on treatment outcome for patients with GAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals and hypotheses: The main goal of the study is to examine the impact of biases in&#xD;
      cognitive processing on short- and long-term outcomes of cognitive-behavioural therapy for&#xD;
      individuals with GAD. The study's main hypotheses are that: (1) preferential allocation of&#xD;
      attention to uncertainty-related stimuli, assessed at pretreatment, will predict poorer&#xD;
      response to treatment; (2) the tendency to appraise ambiguous information in a threatening&#xD;
      manner, assessed at pretreatment, will predict poorer response to treatment; (3) preferential&#xD;
      allocation of attention to uncertainty-related stimuli, assessed at posttreatment, will&#xD;
      predict relapse during follow-up; and (4) the tendency to appraise ambiguous information in a&#xD;
      threatening manner, assessed at posttreatment, will predict relapse during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The final sample consists of 80 adult patients with a principal diagnosis of GAD,&#xD;
      recruited from the Anxiety Disorders Clinic of Sacré-Cœur Hospital of Montreal. Participants&#xD;
      are assessed at 9 measurement times: pretreatment, midtreatment, posttreatment, and 3-, 6-,&#xD;
      9-, 12-, 15- and 18-month follow-up. Assessments include the Anxiety Disorders Interview&#xD;
      Schedule for DSM-IV, a cognitive processing task (Ambiguous/Unambiguous Situations Diary),&#xD;
      and a battery of standardized self-report measures. Treatment consists of an empirically&#xD;
      supported CBT protocol for GAD, which is administered over 16 weekly sessions using a&#xD;
      session-by-session treatment manual developed in earlier studies. Growth curve analysis with&#xD;
      multilevel modeling will be the main analytic strategy used to determine the relationships&#xD;
      between cognitive processing and change in a range of outcome variables while controlling for&#xD;
      relevant clinical and sociodemographic variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications: The study has important theoretical and clinical implications. In terms of&#xD;
      theory, it begins to bridge the gap between the considerable knowledge of the role of&#xD;
      cognitive processing in anxiety and the lack of knowledge of the impact of cognitive&#xD;
      processing on treatment outcomes. Surprisingly, although the role of cognitive processing in&#xD;
      anxiety has been intensely studied, the impact of cognitive processing on GAD psychotherapy&#xD;
      outcomes has never been examined. The proposed study also informs clinical practice as to the&#xD;
      importance of (1) systematically assessing cognitive processing, and (2) integrating&#xD;
      treatment interventions that specifically target biased cognitive processing into current GAD&#xD;
      treatment protocols.&#xD;
