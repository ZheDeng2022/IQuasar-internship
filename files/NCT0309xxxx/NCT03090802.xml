    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention designed to reduce STI/HIV&#xD;
      incidence by increasing the number of adolescent mothers who re-enroll and remain in school.&#xD;
      The objective of the intervention is to have older mentor mothers, who themselves were&#xD;
      pregnant adolescents, to mentor younger adolescent mothers. Mentor mothers will provide&#xD;
      ongoing psychosocial support, help navigate re-admission to school, and help facilitate&#xD;
      access to an existing State-sponsored cash transfer, the child support grant (CSG), in the&#xD;
      early postpartum period. Our combination social protection program will enhance resilience of&#xD;
      young adolescent mothers to facilitate their return to school and thereby reduce HIV risk.&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the efficacy of the intervention using a pre-test post-test&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial design. Participants in the intervention will receive the&#xD;
      Mentoring Adolescent Mothers At School (MAMAS) intervention and standard postpartum care.&#xD;
      Those in the control arm will receive standard postpartum care. Additionally, for those&#xD;
      participants randomized to the intervention arm, mentor mothers will use participatory visual&#xD;
      methods (e.g., photovoice, cell-films, drawings) as part of the intervention itself. Last,&#xD;
      among those participants randomized to the intervention arm and who return for their 9-month&#xD;
      assessment, the investigators will conduct 20 in-depth interviews to understand the process&#xD;
      of resilience development from their perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      School outcomes (initial outcomes) HYP 1.1: Program participation will increase school&#xD;
      enrollment HYP 1.2: Program participation will increase school engagement&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV risk outcomes (intermediate outcomes) HYP 2.1: Program participation will reduce number&#xD;
      of sexual partners HYP 2.2: Program participation will reduce inconsistent condom use HYP&#xD;
      2.3: Program participation will reduce intimate partner violence HYP 2.4: Program&#xD;
      participation will decrease HIV/STI infection HYP 2.5 (for HIV+): Program participation will&#xD;
      increase retention in care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYP 5: Program participation will increase peer support HYP 6: Program participation will&#xD;
      increase familial support HYP 7: Program participation will increase school re-admission HYP&#xD;
      8: Program participation will increase application to the child support grant HYP 9: Program&#xD;
      participation will increase receipt of the child support grant&#xD;

      All study activities will take place in Umlazi township in eThekwini district. The township&#xD;
      is served by one regional hospital, Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital, which is the referral&#xD;
      hospital for 17 primary health care clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be involved in the study from delivery to 9 months postpartum. The&#xD;
      intervention study will be delivered in two cohorts (n=240 per cohort). The first cohort will&#xD;
      be enrolled beginning in May 2017. The investigators anticipate that 4 adolescent mothers&#xD;
      will be enrolled per day based on the monthly number of adolescent deliveries at Prince&#xD;
      Mshiyieni hospital and our own capacity. Therefore, investigators will be finished enrolling&#xD;
      the first cohort by July 2017. The first cohort will complete the end line assessment between&#xD;
      December 2017-February 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will begin enrolling the second cohort in September 2017 and will complete&#xD;
      enrollment by November 2017. The second cohort will complete the end line assessment between&#xD;
      June-August, 2018. Primary outcome analysis will be complete by October, 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAMAS Intervention The investigators will roll out the program with two cohorts of adolescent&#xD;
      mothers (n=240 per cohort); each mentor mother will work with 10 adolescent mothers per&#xD;
      cohort. Within each cohort, there will be an intervention arm and control arm (N=240 per arm&#xD;
      for the both cohorts). The participants of the program arm will have 15 group sessions with&#xD;
      mentor and up to 2 home visits from 3 weeks-6 months postpartum. Investigators will use&#xD;
      participatory visual methods (e.g., photovoice, journaling, and drawing) throughout program&#xD;
      implementation with adolescent mothers to understand and further facilitate their process of&#xD;
      resilience development. As one example, as part of the mentoring process, adolescent mothers&#xD;
      may be asked to engage in reflexive journaling. Mentor mothers will ask adolescent mothers&#xD;
      who are comfortable doing so to share excerpts from their journals in a particular group&#xD;
      session. Through the group session, the adolescent mothers themselves will identify common&#xD;
      barriers they are facing and will work together to overcome them. Mentor mothers will keep&#xD;
      weekly logs documenting what was covered in the sessions; these will be abstracted as part of&#xD;
      ongoing monitoring and evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 480 participants will complete a baseline behavioral and biological assessment (HIV and&#xD;
      HSV-2 testing) at 2 weeks postpartum and an additional baseline biological assessment&#xD;
      (Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis testing) at 6 weeks&#xD;
      postpartum. Further, all participants will receive regular postpartum and well-baby visits at&#xD;
      6 weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks and 6 months with an adolescent-friendly study nurse. During the&#xD;
      visits, participants will complete routine assessments. At 9-months postpartum, participants&#xD;
      will complete end line behavioral and biological assessment (HIV, HSV-2 Trichomonas&#xD;
      vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provision to Privacy All participants will receive adolescent-friendly clinical services with&#xD;
      our study nurse during the postnatal period. The study nurse will provide standard of care&#xD;
      clinical services, and will have gone through training to ensure she is providing&#xD;
      youth-friendly care. In addition, a trained research assistant will administer all behavioral&#xD;
      assessments and be available for any queries that participants have as they complete the&#xD;
      survey. The research assistant will complete training on multicultural sensitivity,&#xD;
      gender-based violence, and ethical guidelines as recommended by the WHO Violence Against&#xD;
      Women (VAW) study to engage with participants in a supportive and non-judgmental manner, deal&#xD;
      with sensitive issues, and respond to distressed participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the following systems are in place to maintain cohort retention and follow up&#xD;
      while protecting the privacy interests of subjects: At enrollment, study participants will be&#xD;
      asked if they are willing to share their telephone number, their physical home address and a&#xD;
      postal address. Women will be told that providing this information is entirely voluntary, and&#xD;
      will only be used to follow up with the women to remind them of their appointments. Study&#xD;
      participants in the intervention trial will be contacted by text message prior to a study&#xD;
      visit to remind them of their visit. Study participants who miss their scheduled appointment&#xD;
      are contacted within 24 hours. The first line of contact is an SMS. The second is a reminder&#xD;
      telephone call to the participant directly or to a close contact that is identified by the&#xD;
      client, while maintaining confidentiality. If the study staff cannot reach the participant,&#xD;
      she will call once per day over the next three days. If the tracer still cannot reach the&#xD;
      participant by the end of the third day, the tracer will do a home visit if home location was&#xD;
      provided by the participant. Home visits are done by tracers familiar with the residential&#xD;
      areas. For the proposed study, the investigators will employ two full-time tracers. If the&#xD;
      participant has changed her address maximum information is gathered (while maintaining&#xD;
      confidentiality of the participant) from neighbors and relatives that form the basis of&#xD;
      further contact. A participant will be considered lost to follow-up after 3 unsuccessful&#xD;
      attempts of phone contact and 2 unsuccessful home visits. A SMS and phone script that will be&#xD;
      used to contact women and remind them of their appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A similar system for tracing study participants was used in the previous clinical trials&#xD;
      implemented and has resulted in retention rates of higher than 75%, with no adverse events&#xD;
      associated with tracing reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Analysis Data will be primarily managed on-site by a data entry and&#xD;
      management team. All risks will be minimized through staff ethics training, layered data&#xD;
      security and by restricting access of sensitive information to staff members who have a&#xD;
      specific need for the information. Furthermore, as part of the training that investigators&#xD;
      conduct for all staff members, investigators will include a training module on the&#xD;
      confidential nature of the data. Investigators have conducted similar training modules for&#xD;
      research staff in other studies. Following the training, all staff will sign an Oath of&#xD;
      Confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Security for all Data All participants will be assigned a participant identifier (PID)&#xD;
      after randomization. Thereafter, all biological and non-biological samples/data will only be&#xD;
      identifiable vis-a-vis the PID. Participant's names will never appear on the samples/data.&#xD;
      Further, consent forms and any other forms with personal identifiers will be kept separate&#xD;
      from data files in key-locked filing cabinets. A computerized follow-up system which links&#xD;
      identification numbers and personal information will be kept on a computer with password&#xD;
      protection. Only the site PI, Dr. Daya Moodley and authorized study staff who have completed&#xD;
      all required ethics training will have access to the computer. Protection against loss of&#xD;
      data is provided through scheduled backup of data files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-biological Data Data will be collected using Samsung Galaxy or equivalent Tablets running&#xD;
      customized version of Android operating system. The investigators have multiple levels of&#xD;
      security measures to ensure the safety of data on the tablets. With the customized version of&#xD;
      operating system, the interviewers are allowed access to only certain apps and settings on&#xD;
      the tablets. A password is required to activate the tablet and a second password must be&#xD;
      entered to access the data capture software. There are also separate levels of access for&#xD;
      interviewers, field supervisors, and system administrators. Only users with administrator&#xD;
      level access will can delete data that had been previously captured. Further, the data&#xD;
      captured on the device will be in a machine-readable (xml) format and is not easy to&#xD;
      interpret without using a computer program. To add another layer of security, once the data&#xD;
      has been transferred to the project server, it will be removed from the device. As an&#xD;
      additional security measure, lost or stolen tablets can be tracked and have their data erased&#xD;
      remotely by the data team when the lost or stolen tablet is connected to a Wi-Fi or cellular&#xD;
      network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data captured by the tablets will be transmitted to the project server using HTTPS, which&#xD;
      is a widely-used communications protocol for secure communication over a computer network.&#xD;
      HTTPS provides authentication of the web app and associated web server that one is&#xD;
      communicating with, which protects against malicious attacks. Additionally, it provides&#xD;
      bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and server, which protects&#xD;
      against eavesdropping and tampering with and/or forging the contents of the communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the data is on project server, it allows real time monitoring of progress in the field,&#xD;
      reported via automated Benchmark reporting tables on a password protected website, and&#xD;
      facilitates monitoring of the status of data collection, and helps make rapid corrections to&#xD;
      assure timely adherence to the timeline. In addition, the data will be processed to create&#xD;
      incremental Stata datasets every week and will be sent through email in an encrypted format&#xD;
      to Project coordinator, who in turn will run weekly QC activities and return any queries to&#xD;
      field staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection, Storage and Sharing for Biological Data Biological specimens will be stored&#xD;
      at the CAPRISA repository in -70 refrigerators. The samples will be stored in temperature&#xD;
      controlled and monitored environment. Specimens will be stored until all assays are complete&#xD;
      which is dependent on the receipt of funds for the relevant assays proposed. Repository staff&#xD;
      who maintain the samples daily will have access to the samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The investigators will use appropriate bivariate and multivariate&#xD;
      analysis to test whether adolescent mothers who received the intervention have lower levels&#xD;
      of STIs and HIV risk than those in the control arm. Multivariate analysis will be used to&#xD;
      measure the association between treatment arm and school reenrollment. For HIV-positive&#xD;
      participants, investigators will assess whether receiving the intervention increases&#xD;
      retention in care. Analyses will be completed using SAS statistical programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Analysis Investigators used data from a previous trial in the same setting to help&#xD;
      estimate the appropriate sample size for our RCT [1]. Specifically, in the previous study,&#xD;
      investigators had a 26.5% prevalence of consistent condom use and a 21.6% prevalence of any&#xD;
      STI in the control group at the postpartum assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome 1: STI. Investigators estimate that the total sample size needed at follow-up to&#xD;
      detect a standardized effect (d) of .20 (OR=.69) of our intervention on STI with 80% power&#xD;
      (2-sided, alpha=.05) is 350 (total across both arms). The investigators inflated this sample&#xD;
      size assuming an attrition rate from baseline to follow-up of 25% (350/.70=467).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome 2: Inconsistent condom use. The investigators estimate that the total sample size&#xD;
      needed at follow-up to detect a standardized effect (d) of .20 (OR=.69) of our intervention&#xD;
      on inconsistent condom use with 80% power (2-sided, alpha=.05) is 314 (total across both&#xD;
      arms). Investigators inflated this sample size assuming an attrition rate from baseline to&#xD;
      follow-up of 25% (314/.70=419).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While investigators estimated that 467 participants would provide sufficient power to detect&#xD;
      an effect on STI outcomes, investigators increased our sample size to 480 participants so&#xD;
      that each of the 12 mentor mothers would be delivering the intervention to an equal number of&#xD;
      participants (n=10) in each cohort.&#xD;
