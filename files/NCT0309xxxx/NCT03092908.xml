      Kidney stones are one of the most common disorders of the urinary tract and cause a great&#xD;
      deal of morbidity and economic loss. Because of the high recurrence rate, researchers are&#xD;
      interested in finding medicinal therapies to prevent kidney stone recurrence. Vinegar is&#xD;
      consumed worldwide as a food condiment and preservative. The mature vinegar, also called&#xD;
      black vinegar, is an inky-black vinegar aged for a malty, woody, and smoky flavor. It is&#xD;
      popular in the north of China as a dipping sauce, particularly for dumplings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies promote vinegar for its medicinal properties, as a tonic which may lower blood&#xD;
      pressure and cholesterol level. Our national epidemiological data in China showed that&#xD;
      consumed more mature vinegar was associated with decreased risk of kidney stones formations.&#xD;
      Furthermore, our previous in vivo study found that mature vinegar could inhibit renal calcium&#xD;
      oxalate crystals formation in rat model. These findings inspire us to clarify the&#xD;
      nephrolithiasis prevention effect of mature vinegar in a clinical trial. In this study,&#xD;
      investigators would like to examine the efficacy of mature vinegar prophylaxis for preventing&#xD;
      recurrent calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis.&#xD;

      Background: Kidney stones are one of the most common disorders of the urinary tract and cause&#xD;
      a great deal of morbidity and economic loss. Because of the high recurrence rate, researchers&#xD;
      are interested in finding medicinal therapies to prevent kidney stone recurrence. Vinegar is&#xD;
      consumed worldwide as a food condiment and preservative. The mature vinegar, also called&#xD;
      black vinegar, is an inky-black vinegar aged for a malty, woody, and smoky flavor. It is&#xD;
      popular in the north of China as a dipping sauce, particularly for dumplings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies promote vinegar for its medicinal properties, as a tonic which may lower blood&#xD;
      pressure and cholesterol level. Our national epidemiological data in China showed that&#xD;
      consumed more mature vinegar was associated with decreased risk of kidney stones formations.&#xD;
      Furthermore, our previous in vivo study found that mature vinegar could inhibit renal calcium&#xD;
      oxalate crystals formation in rat model (unpublished). These findings inspire us to clarify&#xD;
      the nephrolithiasis prevention effect of mature vinegar in a clinical trial. In this study,&#xD;
      investigators would like to examine the efficacy of mature vinegar prophylaxis for preventing&#xD;
      recurrent calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A prospective randomized, controlled, single-center clinical trial will be performed&#xD;
      at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University from March 2017 to March&#xD;
      2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: 80 subjects are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive mature vinegar or&#xD;
      placebo. The sequence of randomization is computer generated and are performed by the&#xD;
      hospital's pharmacy service, whoever administer 5 ml mature vinegar (Brand: Ninghuafu) three&#xD;
      times a day and placebo as liquid of the same type in identical bottles. The subjects, the&#xD;
      attending urologist, and the investigators are not aware of study arm assignments until the&#xD;
      final assessment of outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the beginning of invention, participants will be scheduled to receive a brief (&lt; 10 min)&#xD;
      individual telephone contact once per month and weekly text messages. The telephone contacts&#xD;
      are conducted by intervention staff and followed a standard script. Text message are provided&#xD;
      once per week and are used to remind participants in invention group of drinking mature&#xD;
      vinegar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation: According to non-continuous sample size calculation formula, , where&#xD;
      P1 is 3-year stone recurrence rate in normal group , P2 is 3-year recurrence rate in mature&#xD;
      vinegar group, P is (P1 + P2)/2. According to our preliminary clinical data, the 3-year stone&#xD;
      recurrence rate in normal group between 30% and 50%. Assume P1 =40%. The vinegar invention&#xD;
      would reduce the risk of recurrence by about three fourth. The 3-year stone recurrence rate&#xD;
      after mature vinegar is 10% (P2). Using 95% confidence interval, an α error of 5%, and a&#xD;
      power of 80%, the minimum sample size was estimated to be 32 subjects for each of the study&#xD;
      groups. To account for subjects lost to follow-up and study withdrawals, this number is&#xD;
      increased to 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and follow-up: Each subject's medical history is taken, a physical&#xD;
      examination is performed, and the subject's weight, height, body mass index, blood pressure,&#xD;
      education, income, employment status, smoking status, and alcohol consumption are measured&#xD;
      and recorded. Assessment staff are masked to prior data at each assessment to minimize&#xD;
      potential bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24-h urine and serum specimens are obtained at baseline (with values documented as the&#xD;
      average of the two sets of measurements performed before randomization), 3 months after&#xD;
      rafter randomization, half a year after randomization, and at yearly intervals during the 3&#xD;
      years of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure is the time to the first recurrence of a&#xD;
      symptomatic renal stone or the presence of asymptomatic renal stone or the presence of a&#xD;
      radiographically identified stone. In the event of a recurrence, the treatment is considered&#xD;
      to have failed, and the patient will be withdrawn from the trial. If there are no&#xD;
      recurrences, patients will be followed until the third annual visit (month 36). Patients who&#xD;
      required treatment with thiazides or allopurinol for conditions such as hypertension or gout&#xD;
      will be withdrawn from the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrences are considered to be either silent or symptomatic. Silent recurrences are&#xD;
      diagnosed on the basis of renal ultrasound performed at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 year, 3&#xD;
      year after randomization. If renal stones are detected, CT will also be performed. The&#xD;
      imaging studies will be performed by a central radiologic service, and the radiologist have&#xD;
      no knowledge of the trial or the group assignment. A recurrence is classified as silent if a&#xD;
      previously unreported stone was detected in the absence of symptom. A symptomatic recurrence&#xD;
      is defined as typical renal colic, an episode hematuria, or the expulsion or removal of a&#xD;
      previously undiscovered stone. If a symptomatic recurrence is documented on the basis of&#xD;
      renal colic or hematuria, the recurrence will to be confirmed radiographically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures include change in 24-h urine compositions (calcium excretion,&#xD;
      oxalate excretion, etc.), serum calcium, phosphate, creatinine, and uric acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: The analysis is based on the intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
      Investigators use Kaplan-Meier analyses to determine the cumulative incidence of recurrent&#xD;
      stones, and investigators use Cox proportional-hazards regression to determine the crude and&#xD;
      adjust relative risks of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis of the urinary indexes, investigators compare the two groups with respect to&#xD;
      the absolute change from the base-line value at each time point. These comparisons are&#xD;
      carried out with use of the Mann-Whitney test. Base-line continuous variables are compared&#xD;
      with use of the Mann-Whitney test and Student's t-test whenever appropriate; categorical&#xD;
      variables are compared with use of Fisher's exact test. A P value of less than 0.05 is&#xD;
      considered to indicate statistical significance. All reported P values are two-side.&#xD;
