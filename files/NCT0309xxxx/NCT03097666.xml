  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the safety and efficacy of the C2 CryoBalloon™ Swipe&#xD;
      Ablation System (&quot;CryoBalloon Swipe&quot;) used at increasing doses.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The procedure will be performed on an outpatient basis, and the CryoBalloon Swipe will be&#xD;
      used for all ablations following the instructions for use provided with the product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be assigned to one of the treatment groups&#xD;
      and doses, depending on the order of their enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase I, the first 6 patients will be treated with Dose 1 (lowest).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have to undergo 8 week (±1 week) follow-up EGD to evaluate efficacy of the&#xD;
      dose before the study continues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the follow-up endoscopies show that Dose 1 eradicates ≥80% of the treated BE (by median&#xD;
      percentage) and no SAE's are reported, this dose is defined as the therapeutic dose and&#xD;
      enrollment will proceed to phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If Dose 1 eradicates &lt;80% of the treated BE, enrollment in Phase I will continue at the next&#xD;
      highest dose. Treatment doses will be escalated in this manner until the earlier of a&#xD;
      dose-related Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or determination of the therapeutic dose based on&#xD;
      endoscopic exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the therapeutic dose is determined, the study will proceed to Phase II to generate&#xD;
      additional safety and efficacy data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II will confirm the safety and efficacy of the therapeutic dose found in Phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ---------------------------------------------------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-related SAEs include pain in the treatment area greater than 6 (on VAS) on 24 hours and&#xD;
      seven (7) days post-treatment; symptomatic stricture requiring an additional EGD with&#xD;
      endoscopic dilation before the first follow-up EGD; symptomatic stricture at follow-up EGD;&#xD;
      or any stricture (symptomatic or asymptomatic) preventing passage of the diagnostic endoscope&#xD;
      at follow-up EGD. Any other serious adverse events within 30 days after treatment will also&#xD;
      be evaluated by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for relationship to the dose and&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a Dose-related serious adverse event occurs, the Holding Rule will be invoked and&#xD;
      enrollment at that dose will be held until the DSMB has evaluated the event.&#xD;
