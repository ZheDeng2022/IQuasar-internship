  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, two-arm, open-label Phase II multicenter study designed to examine the&#xD;
      effects of adding bevacizumab to ixabepilone for the treatment of patients who have recurrent&#xD;
      or persistent platinum-resistant/refractory epithelial (non-mucinous) ovarian, fallopian&#xD;
      tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Its primary objective is to assess whether adding&#xD;
      bevacizumab to ixabepilone improves progression-free survival in its target population. Study&#xD;
      participants will be stratified by (a) study site and (b) previous receipt of bevacizumab&#xD;
      prior to randomization.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the activity of ixabepilone with bevacizumab compared to ixabepilone alone in&#xD;
           patients with recurrent or persistent platinum-resistant/refractory epithelial&#xD;
           (non-mucinous) ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. We will assess&#xD;
           this by comparing the ixabepilone +bevacizumab (experimental) arm to the&#xD;
           ixabepilone-alone (control) arm for an improvement in median progression free survival&#xD;
           (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the experimental arm to the control arm for increases in objective response&#xD;
           rate (ORR) and durable disease control rate (DDCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the experimental arm to the control arm for an increase in overall survival&#xD;
           (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety profile of ixabepilone in combination with bevacizumab in ovarian,&#xD;
           fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether prior treatment with bevacizumab impacts future response to&#xD;
           bevacizumab in combination with ixabepilone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the primary and secondary objectives of this study, there are additional&#xD;
      exploratory/correlative objectives. The exploratory/correlative objectives of this study are&#xD;
      as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize number, length and composition (e.g., class III β-tubulin expression) of&#xD;
           microtentacles (McTNs) isolated from circulating tumor cells isolated from whole blood&#xD;
           of patients undergoing treatment with ixabepilone with or without bevacizumab, and&#xD;
           correlate with best response, PFS, and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe McTNs on circulating tumor cells in blood using a novel polyelectrolyte&#xD;
           multi-layer (PEM) tethering technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate ex vivo response of McTNs to drug treatment with clinical response in order&#xD;
           to develop a real-time assay to predict response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore use of circulating tumor (ct) DNA as a biomarker for disease response and&#xD;
           compare its performance to CA-125.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine whether clinical response to ixabepilone with or without bevacizumab differs&#xD;
           between high and low expressors of class III β-tubulin.&#xD;
