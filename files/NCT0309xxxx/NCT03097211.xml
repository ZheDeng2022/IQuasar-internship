  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether the administration of BIA 6-512 (25 mg, 50&#xD;
      mg, 75 mg and 100 mg) at steady-state affects the pharmacokinetics of levodopa when&#xD;
      administered in combination with a single-dose of immediate release levodopa/benserazide&#xD;
      200/50 mg or with a single-dose of immediate release levodopa/benserazide 200/50 mg plus a&#xD;
      single-dose of nebicapone 150 mg.&#xD;

      Single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, rising multiple dose study in&#xD;
      four sequential groups of healthy male and female subjects. Eligible subjects were admitted&#xD;
      to the Human Pharmacology Unit (UFH)on the day prior to receiving the first study medication.&#xD;
      Starting in the morning of Day 1 (first dose), subjects received BIA 6-512/Placebo thrice&#xD;
      daily until the morning of Day 5 (last dose). Concomitantly with the morning dose of BIA&#xD;
      6-512/Placebo on Day 4, a levodopa/benserazide 200/50 mg (Madopar® 250) single-dose was&#xD;
      administered. On Day 5, a Madopar® 250 single-dose and a nebicapone 150 mg single-dose were&#xD;
      administered concomitantly with the morning dose of BIA 6-512/Placebo. In the morning of Day&#xD;
      4 and Day 5, products were administered in fasting conditions of at least 8 hours and&#xD;
      subjects remained fasted until 2 h post-dose. Subjects were resident in the UFH from&#xD;
      admission (Day 0) until at least 24 h post last dose (Day 6); then, they were discharged and&#xD;
      returned for the follow-up visit.&#xD;
