      Multi-center, open-label, single-dose study to assess the PK of a single oral dose of 3 mg&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-center, open-label, single-dose study to assess the PK of a single oral&#xD;
      dose of 3 mg CC-122 in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment as compared&#xD;
      to sex, age (± 15 years), and weight (± 20%) matched control subjects with normal renal&#xD;
      function. Estimated renal function for the purpose of group assignment will be determined at&#xD;
      screening. Matched control subjects will have normal renal function, defined using the&#xD;
      Cockcroft-Gault (C G) equation, as an estimated creatinine clearance (CLcr) of ≥ 90 mL/min.&#xD;
      Subjects with impaired renal function will be classified by stage of renal impairment (mild,&#xD;
      moderate, or severe) using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated by the&#xD;
      Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. Each group will enroll at least 2&#xD;
      subjects of each sex&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study, each subject will participate in a Screening period (Days -&#xD;
      21 to -2), Treatment Period (including baseline visit), and a follow-up telephone call&#xD;
      between Days 11 to 18. Subjects will be screened for eligibility. Eligible subjects will&#xD;
      return to the clinical site on Day 1 for baseline assessments, and will be domiciled at the&#xD;
      clinical site from Day 1 to Day 4. PK samples will be collected through 72 hours post dose.&#xD;
      Safety will be monitored throughout study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council on Harmonisation&#xD;
      (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has any condition or circumstance that prevents the subject from understanding&#xD;
             and signing the Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has any condition that places the subject at an unacceptable risk from&#xD;
             participating in the study or would confound the ability to interpret data from the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has any surgical or medical condition(s) possibly affecting drug absorption,&#xD;
             distribution, metabolism, excretion, eg, bariatric procedure. Subjects with&#xD;
             cholecystectomy and appendectomy may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is a female of childbearing potential, pregnant, or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject donated blood or plasma within 8 weeks before dose administration to a blood&#xD;
             bank or blood donation center.&#xD;

             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual [DSM]) within 6 months before the first dose&#xD;
             administration, or positive alcohol screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a history of drug abuse (as defined by the current version of the DSM)&#xD;
             within 6 months before the first dose administration, or positive drug screen that is&#xD;
             not consistent with the patient's prescribed medication and or/medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is known to have serum hepatitis or known to be a carrier of the hepatitis B&#xD;
             surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C antibody (HCV Ab) or have a positive result to&#xD;
             the test for Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies at screening. If a positive&#xD;
             result for HCV AB is reported, the Investigator may assess the suitability of the&#xD;
             subject based upon normal liver function test results and either no history of&#xD;
             Hepatitis C, or documented sustained viral response (ie, undetectable HCV viral load&#xD;
             during and 12 weeks after completion of accepted HCV treatment). If the subject meets&#xD;
             both criteria, and the Investigator determines this as acceptable, the subject can be&#xD;

             University &quot;Cytochrome P450 Drug Interaction Table&quot; should be utilized to determine&#xD;
             inhibitors and/or inducers of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4/5.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with renal impairment should be excluded from study if laboratory values are&#xD;
             outside the following ranges and, in the opinion of the Investigator, are considered&#xD;
