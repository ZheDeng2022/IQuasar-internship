      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a comprehensive treatment programme for&#xD;
      self-management of mixed and urgency urinary incontinence via a mobile app is effective.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence affects one fourth of adult women (1). It may reduce quality of life and&#xD;
      costs for society are high. The most common type in women is stress urinary incontinence&#xD;
      (SUI), i.e. leakage when coughing, sneezing or jumping. Urgency urinary incontinence (UUI)&#xD;
      and mixed urinary incontinence (MUI), a combination of both stress and urgency UI, together&#xD;
      adds up to nearly half of the cases of UI in women (1). Many women do not seek care,&#xD;
      sometimes due to embarrassment (2). The recommended first line treatment for all three types&#xD;
      of UI in women are pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and life style advices, leading to&#xD;
      improvement or cure in two thirds of patients (3,4) . In addition, bladder training might be&#xD;
      effective for UUI and MUI (3,4). Bladder training in combination with PFMT led to improvement&#xD;
      or cure in one sixth of women with MUI (3). Previous research also suggest that psychological&#xD;
      treatment could have a value for some women with UUI and MUI (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously demonstrated the efficacy of the mobile app Tät® for&#xD;
      treatment of SUI (6). Apps have the potential to improve symptoms in many chronic conditions&#xD;
      through self-management interventions (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed the mobile app Tät®II for women with UUI or MUI and the aim&#xD;
      is to determine if this mobile app is effective for self-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women are consecutively recruited via the website www.tät.nu (www.econtinence.se). The women&#xD;
      answer an online screening questionnaire with automated response for initial screening of&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. Informed consent and bladder diary are sent by ordinary post to the&#xD;
      administrator of the study. After that, the women answer a web questionnaire including&#xD;
      scoring instruments and finally a telephone interview is conducted by a urotherapist or a&#xD;
      doctor. The purpose of this telephone interview is to confirm the clinical diagnosis of UUI&#xD;
      or MUI, to ascertain that there are no alarm symptoms motivating examination in ordinary&#xD;
      health care and to make sure that the woman is well informed about the study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the telephone interview it is decided whether the woman is eligible for participation&#xD;
      or not. If eligible, the interviewer send an e-mail to the study coordinator marked&#xD;
      &quot;Randomization&quot;. The order in which these e-mails arrive at the incoming mail box&#xD;
      tat2.am@umu.se decide the order of randomization. An independent administrator has generated&#xD;
      the allocation sequence and prepared 130 numbered opaque sealed envelopes (with assignment&#xD;
      equally distributed between the two study groups). The study coordinator consecutively opens&#xD;
      one envelope for each participant (in the order they arrived in the mailbox) and mark the&#xD;
      number of the envelope on the coordinator list for the participant. The coordinator assigns&#xD;
      an e-mail to the participant, with instructions for downloading the apps. If assigned to the&#xD;
      treatment app group, a unique code is activated for each participant, which enables the&#xD;
      participant to activate the complete app Tät®II including individual advices regarding&#xD;
      self-care and recommended exercises based on the results from the questionnaire and the&#xD;
      bladder diary. Two weeks after randomization, the activation status of the app is controlled&#xD;
      and if it is not activated, the participants receive an e-mail asking whether they have&#xD;
      experienced any technical problems with the app. In case of technical problems, they get&#xD;
      instructions by e-mail or by telephone. After another week, a new review of the activation&#xD;
      status is done and if the app still is not activated - participants are contacted via&#xD;
      telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events All participants are encouraged to report any adverse events that may occur&#xD;
      during the study either by e-mail or by telephone. This information is included in the e-mail&#xD;
      they get after allocation to treatment app or information app group. Questions about adverse&#xD;
      events are also included in the follow-up questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      14 weeks after randomization, the study coordinator will send both groups a web-based&#xD;
      questionnaire with follow-up questions and scoring instruments and a bladder diary. The&#xD;
      bladder diary is sent back by post. Non-responders will be reminded twice by e-mail (at 2 and&#xD;
      4 weeks) and once by telephone (at 6 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the information app group will receive an unique activating code to get&#xD;
      access to the complete app with individual advices after this follow-up. The participants in&#xD;
      the original information app group will be followed-up after another 14 weeks with the same&#xD;
      follow-up questionnaire and a bladder diary and the same time frames for reminders. The&#xD;
      results from this second follow-up in the original information app group will be compared&#xD;
      with results from the first follow-up and serve as quality control for the original study.&#xD;
      This design allows us to study long-term follow up results later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance plan The study will be monitored according to Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
      principles by study research nurse Agneta Lindberg at the local Clinical Research Centre of&#xD;
      Region Jämtland Härjedalen to ascertain a proper procedure of conduction, recording and&#xD;
      reporting data. The monitor will review study records, observe protocol procedures and the&#xD;
      randomization process, and ensure that written informed consent has been correctly obtained.&#xD;
      The first five participants-and after that one in ten randomly selected by the monitor- will&#xD;
      be 100 % monitored as stated in the monitor plan. All study participants will be reviewed for&#xD;
      informed consent procedure. According to the Medical Devices Directives (Meddevs 2.7/3)&#xD;
      reporting and monitoring of adverse events and serious adverse events are not necessary when&#xD;
      a CE-marked (Conformité Européenne) device is used in a study within its intended use covered&#xD;
      by the CE-marking. The app Tät®II is used within its intended use covered by the CE-marking&#xD;
      (Medical Product Agency, Sweden. Dnr:6.6.1-2016-97327, PID (Product identify number) 149104).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Dictionary, see primary and secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for missing data The questionnaires will be web-based and every question will, if&#xD;
      technically possible, be mandatory. However, should there for some reason be missing values,&#xD;
      these will be replaced with the value corresponding to &quot;no change&quot;, i.e. a missing value at&#xD;
      follow-up will be replaced with the participant´s baseline value and a missing value at&#xD;
      baseline will be replaced with the follow-up value. A missing answer in the PGI-I at&#xD;
      follow-up will be assumed as &quot;unchanged&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be checked for out-of-range results, these will be treated as missing values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation Based on results from the previous smartphone study and the findings&#xD;
      of Albers-Heitner et al, improvements in the ICIQ UI SF of 2.5 points in the treatment app&#xD;
      group and 0.9 points in the information app group are assumed. To detect this difference with&#xD;
      80% power, 2-side test and significance 0.05, a sample size of 49 is needed in each group.&#xD;
      With an expected drop-out rate of 20%, approximately 60 participants are needed in each&#xD;
      group. The investigators therefore aim to recruit 120 women aged 18 and older via the website&#xD;
      www.tät.nu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical plan Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed on all outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline The two groups will be compared at baseline using Student´s t-test for continuous&#xD;
      variables, Pearson Chi-Square test for categorical variables, and the Mann-Whitney U-test for&#xD;
      ordinal variables. Baseline data will be compared for age, BMI, educational level, medication&#xD;
      and for all primary and secondary outcomes that are measured at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome The primary outcome is the difference between the groups in mean ICIQ UI SF&#xD;
      score at follow-up and a linear mixed model analysis incorporating baseline data will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison between groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For evaluating the difference between the groups in mean ICIQ LUTS qol score at follow-up, a&#xD;
      linear mixed models analysis incorporating baseline data will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For evaluating the difference between the groups regarding change of the median Incontinence&#xD;
      Episode Frequency from baseline to follow-up, the Mann-Whitney U-test will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the difference between the groups in mean ICIQ-OAB score at follow-up, a linear&#xD;
      mixed models analysis will be used incorporating baseline data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the difference between the groups in the mean score of the non-validated&#xD;
      Incontinence Catastrophizing Scale (ICS) at follow-up, a linear mixed models analysis will be&#xD;
      used incorporating baseline data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For evaluating the difference between groups regarding change in usage of incontinence aids&#xD;
      from baseline to follow-up, the Mann-Whitney U-test will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference between the groups regarding PGI-I, a question on improvement only used at&#xD;
      follow-up, will be analysed using the Mann-Whitney U-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction. The proportion of participants that intend to seek more help after this&#xD;
      first-line treatment will be analysed, this item will only be analysed in the treatment app&#xD;
      group and no comparisons will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison within groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For comparison within the groups regarding the score on ICIQ LUTS qol, a paired t-test will&#xD;
      be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For comparison within the groups regarding the IEF, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For comparison within the groups regarding the score on ICS, a paired t-test will be used For&#xD;
      comparison within the groups regarding the score on ICIQ-OAB, a paired t-test will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For comparison within the groups regarding the incontinence aid usage, a Wilcoxon signed-rank&#xD;
      test will be used.&#xD;
