  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medicines called opioids are used to treat pain. The body also produces opioids. These are&#xD;
      called endorphins. Researchers want to learn more about how these natural opioids work. This&#xD;
      might lead to new therapies for conditions like depression, anxiety, and chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine how opioids affect how pleasant or unpleasant it feels when the skin is touched,&#xD;
      compressed, or heated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy right-handed adults ages 18-50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under another protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2 study visits with the same procedures, at least 1 day apart. Each&#xD;
      visit will last 3-4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear shorts or change into scrubs so researchers can test on their legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will answer questions and have urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The scanner is a metal&#xD;
      cylinder in a strong magnetic field. Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out&#xD;
      of the cylinder. A device called a coil will be placed over the head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During MRI, participants will have sensory testing. They will get several types of touch to&#xD;
      the calf of the leg. These include gentle brushing of the skin, gentle compression of the&#xD;
      calf with an inflation sleeve, and heat stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an intravenous line placed each day. They will get naloxone 1 day and&#xD;
      saline the other day. Participants will not be told which they get. Naloxone is a drug that&#xD;
      blocks opioid receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI and sensory testing will then be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each stimuli block, participants will rate the sensations as well as their mood and&#xD;
      calmness/anxiety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective: Our recent pilot study found evidence suggesting that blocking endogenous opioid&#xD;
      release increases the pleasantness associated with having the skin stroked. Deep pressure&#xD;
      touch (observed in hugs and massage) also typically conveys a sense of pleasantness. This&#xD;
      increased pleasantness contrasts with evidence that blocking endogenous opioid release&#xD;
      increases pain. The current study will examine the role of endogenous opioids in the&#xD;
      pleasantness of light skin stroking and deep pressure touch, and contrast it with their role&#xD;
      in the unpleasantness of a painful heat stimulus. Further, it will examine the neural basis&#xD;
      of observed perceptual changes, using fMRI. This study constitutes the first study of the K99&#xD;
      phase of a K99/R00 grant application recently submitted to National Center for Complementary&#xD;
      and Integrative Health (NCCIH) by Dr. Laura Case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: 30 healthy participants will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Participants will receive intravenous saline or intravenous naloxone on separate days&#xD;
      to investigate the effect of mu-opioid antagonism on the intensity and pleasantness of&#xD;
      superficial and deep affective touch and the intensity and unpleasantness of cutaneous heat&#xD;
      pain. Using a double-blind cross-over design, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)&#xD;
      will be conducted during sensory testing before and after the infusion of each drug to&#xD;
      examine the neural mediation of opioid effects on touch perception. Ratings of mood, anxiety,&#xD;
      pain intensity, pleasantness/unpleasantness, wanting and liking will also be collected&#xD;
      throughout the study session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: We will compare subjective ratings (mood, calmness, anxiety, pleasantness,&#xD;
      wanting, liking, pain intensity and unpleasantness) during naloxone and saline to: 1)&#xD;
      Determine whether naloxone increases the pleasantness and/or intensity of affective touch&#xD;
      (light brush and deep compression); 2) Determine whether naloxone increases the&#xD;
      unpleasantness and/or intensity of cutaneous heat pain; 3) Determine the role of mood or&#xD;
      anxiety changes in mediating the effect of endogenous opioids on these perceptual measures;&#xD;
      3) Determine changes in the brain activation related to these effects.&#xD;
