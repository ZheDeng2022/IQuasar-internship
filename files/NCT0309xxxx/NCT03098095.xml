  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity delays all-cause mortality in the general population and reduces the risk&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, type-2 diabetes and some types of cancer (Garber et&#xD;
      al., 2011). These diseases are associated with chronic inflammation, which is characterized&#xD;
      by activation of inflammatory signalling pathways with abnormal production of cytokines and&#xD;
      other mediators (Hotamisligil, 2006). Observational studies of large population cohorts have&#xD;
      consistently shown an association between physical inactivity and low-grade systemic&#xD;
      inflammation and interventional studies a reduction of inflammatory markers following&#xD;
      exercise (Beavers et al., 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic inflammation is also a predominant feature of treated human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
      (HIV) infection (Lederman et al., 2013; Deeks et al., 2013). Compared to age-matched&#xD;
      HIV-negative subjects, persons with chronic HIV infection are at higher risk to develop&#xD;
      non-acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) related chronic diseases (Guaraldi et al.,&#xD;
      2011), and several studies have shown an association between chronic inflammation and higher&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk and overall mortality (Kuller et al., 2008, Duprez et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the investigators performed a pilot study of moderate physical activity that&#xD;
      enrolled sedentary HIV infected subjects treated with combination antiretroviral treatment&#xD;
      (cART), consisting of brisk walking, with or without strength exercise. Overall, after 12&#xD;
      weeks of training cholesterol profile and soluble and cell inflammatory markers improved&#xD;
      significantly. However, because of the considerable individual variability in exercise&#xD;
      responses, a program of physical activity needs be adjusted on an individual basis to be most&#xD;
      effective. During recent years, the use of mobile technologies has been implemented for&#xD;
      health monitoring interventions, including exercise. We hypothesized that the use of a mobile&#xD;
      application will favour engagement to exercise by providing motivational inputs, and&#xD;
      therefore adherence, and, as a consequence, an improvement of physical fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that the use of a mobile application will favour engagement to&#xD;
      exercise by providing motivational inputs, and therefore adherence, and, as a consequence, an&#xD;
      improvement of physical fitness. Therefore, the aim of this project is to improve health and&#xD;
      quality of life of patients living with HIV through self-empowerment by use of an innovative&#xD;
      mobile application, in order to assist and monitor individualized program of physical&#xD;
      activity and diet recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary To compare the improvement of physical fitness between the EG and CG groups after 16&#xD;
      weeks of training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the improvement of the following characteristics between the EG and CG groups&#xD;
      after 16 weeks of training:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. anthropometry,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood lipids,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Inflammatory markers,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quality of Life,&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Mood State.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS Primary The primary objective will be assessed by the proportion of subjects with&#xD;
      an improvement from baseline of 15% of maximal oxygen consumption (O2max) through 16 weeks of&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints will be assessed by the 16-week changes in the following measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. BMI and %Fat Mass,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood Total-, LDL-, HDL-Cholesterol,&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN Multicentre, randomized, open-label, pilot study enrolling HIV-infected&#xD;
      subjects, of age ≥18 years, with or without cART, either sedentary or already practicing&#xD;
      mild/moderate physical activity.+&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 to one of the&#xD;
      following arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) experimental group (EG), where participants will be trained with an exercise program for&#xD;
      16 weeks with the use of a smartphone application; ii) control group (CG), where participants&#xD;
      will be trained with an exercise program for 16 weeks without smartphone application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be screened for eligibility by an infectious diseases specialist and a sport&#xD;
      medicine specialist through collection of clinical and treatment history, physical&#xD;
      examination, routine blood screen, ECG at rest and during submaximal cycle ergometer test.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will sign a written informed consent and will be followed-up at screening,&#xD;
      baseline (start of the training program) and after 16 weeks of training, except for profile&#xD;
      of mood states that will be assessed weekly&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study visit will include: the evaluation of CDC stage, anthropometric assessment&#xD;
      (height, weight), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, smoking status, assessment of the&#xD;
      antiretroviral and concomitant therapies and routine laboratory tests. Additional 30 mL of&#xD;
      peripheral blood will be withdrawn at baseline and at the end of the study (week 16) and&#xD;
      stored in a biobank for further investigations for patients recruited from San Raffaele&#xD;
      Hospital. The demographic, clinical, physical fitness, quality of life information will be&#xD;
      accurately recorded at the study visits in an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Randomization list will be computer-generated (block sizes of ten) and will be&#xD;
      incorporated within the electronic clinical report form (eCRF) of the study. Study&#xD;
      participants, study nurses and study physicians will be aware of the allocation group but&#xD;
      allocation will be concealed from laboratory staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation from the study You may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be&#xD;
      dropped from the study at discretion of the investigator if he/she violates the study plan or&#xD;
      for administrative or other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be discontinued from the study if you will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  withdraw consent or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  miss the exercise sessions for ≥ 2 consecutive weeks (corresponding to 6 sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any female patient who becomes pregnant during the course of the study will be also&#xD;
      immediately withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise program The exercise prescription will be scheduled according to the American&#xD;
      College of Sport Medicine guidelines (Garber et al., 2011). You will perform 3 outdoor&#xD;
      training sessions a week for 16 weeks, consisting of brisk walking or running for one hour.&#xD;
      In both groups, participants will be assigned the same volume and intensity of exercise.&#xD;
      After baseline O2max examination, participants will receive and individual training program&#xD;
      written by exercise scientists (MB, GP, ALT), which will be designed according to the&#xD;
      performance at O2max examination. The exercise program will be divided into two periods. In&#xD;
      the first period (weeks 1-4) subjects will train at 60-70% of maximal heart rate to improve&#xD;
      the aerobic metabolism capacity. Moreover, participants will be familiarized to both physical&#xD;
      activity (both EG and CG) and the use of mobile application (the EG only) through direct&#xD;
      coach supervision. In the second period (weeks 5-16), participants will train without direct&#xD;
      coach supervision, but following the individualized program on a designed timeline. The EG&#xD;
      participants will receive automatic real-time feedback though the application and both EG and&#xD;
      CG participants weekly feed-back from trainers. During this period exercise intensity, will&#xD;
      be increased to 70-80% of maximal heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training adherence Adherence to the program will be defined as the proportion of sessions&#xD;
      attended during the 16-week training period and it will be calculated only among the&#xD;
      participants who will complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric Assessment The anthropometric assessment will be performed before and at the&#xD;
      end of the program by the same operator following the standardized techniques described by&#xD;
      Lohman (1981). Anthropometric variables will include body mass, stature, and skinfold&#xD;
      thickness on the dominant side. Stature and body mass will be measured with a portable&#xD;
      stadiometer and scaled to the nearest 0.5 cm and 0.1 kg, respectively. Skinfolds will be&#xD;
      taken three times in each anatomic site using a calliper (Holtain Ltd, Crymych Uk) to the&#xD;
      nearest 0.2 mm. The average value obtained among the three measures will be computed. Body&#xD;
      density (d) will be calculated using the Jackson &amp; Pollock equation (1985) from three&#xD;
      skinfolds (Female: triceps, suprailiac and thigh; Male: pectoral, abdominal and thigh). The&#xD;
      percentage of fat mass will be finally derived as: fat mass (%) = 495/ d - 450 (Siri et al.,&#xD;
      1961).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Fitness Evaluation You will be instructed to arrive at the laboratory in a rested&#xD;
      and fully hydrated state and to avoid strenuous exercise in the 24 h preceding the testing&#xD;
      session. In addition, they will avoid alcohol intake in the 48 h before the exercise test.&#xD;
      All tests will be carried out in a well-ventilated laboratory at a temperature of 20-22°C on&#xD;
      an electromagnetically-braked cycle ergometer (Monarc, Ergometric 893, Finland). The protocol&#xD;
      will begin with subjects cycling at 50 W for 6 minutes; then the load will increase by 15 W&#xD;
      each minute until volitional exhaustion. The peak values of the main cardiovascular,&#xD;
      respiratory, and metabolic parameters will be taken as the highest 30-s mean value attained&#xD;
      before the subject's volitional exhaustion. Oxygen consumption (), carbon dioxide production&#xD;
      (), respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and pulmonary ventilation () will be measured on a&#xD;
      breath-by-breath basis by telemetric metabolimeter (Quarkb2, Cosmed, Rome, Italy). O2max will&#xD;
      be assessed according to the criterion described by Taylor et al. Heart rate (HR) will be&#xD;
      recorded during the whole test by a HR monitor (Polar S810, © Polar Electro 2011, Kempele,&#xD;
      Finland). The VT will be assessed according to the gas exchange method (V-Slope).24 Briefly,&#xD;
      the break point in the vs relationship will be detected and considered as the VT. Then the VT&#xD;
      will be expressed in percentage of the max.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rating of Perceived Exertion The Borg 6-20 scale is selected to rate the perceived intensity&#xD;
      of exertion (Borg, 1982). A verbal-anchored scale will be shown to participants before,&#xD;
      immediately and after 30-min completing the training session. Each subject will be&#xD;
      familiarized on the use of Borg 6-20 scale, including anchoring procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Quality Recovery scale (TQR) Psychophysiological recovery process status will be&#xD;
      checked using the Total Quality Recovery scale (TQR) (Kenttä et al., 1998). Participants will&#xD;
      provide a rating of perceived quality of recovery using a scaling from 6 (worst) to 20&#xD;
      (best). A verbal-anchored scale will be shown to the subjects, the morning after the training&#xD;
      session. Each subject will be familiarized on the use TQR scale, including anchoring&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Profile of Mood State (POMS) The POMS questionnaire contains 32 items reflecting an&#xD;
      individual's mood on five primary dimensions (i.e. depression, fatigue, vigour, tension and&#xD;
      anger). Subjects will complete POMS individually once a week. The POMS data will be analysed&#xD;
      for each specific dimension and &quot;energy index&quot; was calculated as &quot;vigour-fatigue&quot; and used to&#xD;
      monitor changes in energy balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life The SF-12 questionnaire is derived from Short-Form Health Survey (36-item).&#xD;
      It is a patient-reported survey of patient health (Brazier et al., 1992). This questionnaire&#xD;
      was used to evaluate the participant's perception of QOL in the domains of physical&#xD;
      functioning, role limitations due to physical health, emotional well-being, social&#xD;
      functioning and general health with higher scores indicating greater QOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrition The use of a daily food diary will be adopted to assess the nutritional habits of&#xD;
      participants; the diary will be fulfilled at least 3 days a week (during 2 working days and 1&#xD;
      day during week-end) and the patient will be requested to indicate the name, the amount and&#xD;
      the cooking method of consumed foods and seasonings; beverages will also be included in the&#xD;
      report. Diet quality and diet variety indexes will be evaluated starting from the food diary&#xD;
      provided by the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant medications The use of concomitant medications/therapies (already ongoing or that&#xD;
      might need to be prescribed during the study) are allowed and recorded. No specific&#xD;
      restrictions are foreseen during the course of the study with regard to concomitant therapy&#xD;
      or vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analysis Blood examination will include complete blood count; standard biochemical&#xD;
      exams with fasting total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)&#xD;
      cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c); cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 4 (CD4+) and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8+) T-cell counts, HIV-1-RNA&#xD;
      plasma level (Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay). The Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA)-I and the&#xD;
      Veterans Aging Cohort Study Risk (VACS) indexes will also be calculated [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory markers Soluble biomarkers will be measured in cryopreserved plasma samples,&#xD;
      drawn at BL and at the end of the program, by commercially available enzyme-linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assays according to manufacturers' recommendation. These will include&#xD;
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP, Catalog Number DCRP00), interleukin-6 (IL-6,&#xD;
      Catalog Number D6050), D-dimer (Asserachrom, Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres-Sur-Seine, France),&#xD;
      interleukin-18 (IL-18) (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan), myostatin&#xD;
      (Cusabio, China).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flow cytometry for cell-activation markers will be measured on cryopreserved peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells isolated by Ficoll-Paque gradient from EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood.&#xD;
      After thawing and PBS-washing, 3 x 105 cells will be stained using phycoerythrin&#xD;
      (PE)-conjugated anti-HLA-DR, PE-cyanin red 5.1-conjugated anti-CD38, Alexa Fluor&#xD;
      647-conjugated anti-CD3, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD4 or anti-CD8&#xD;
      (BD-Biosciences, San Diego, CA). CD38+ and HLA-DR+ cells will be gated from the CD3+/CD4+ or&#xD;
      CD3+/CD8+ cells on a 2-dimensional dot plot. Analyses will be performed by FACSCalibur with&#xD;
      CellQuest software (BD-Biosciences) and results reported as percentages of CD3+/CD4+ and&#xD;
      CD3+/CD8+ T-cells expressing both HLA-DR and CD38.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both soluble and inflammatory markers, samples will be analysed in batch at the end of&#xD;
      the study and blindly with respect to group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size We estimated that a sample size of 48 patients per group, or a total of 96&#xD;
      subjects would be required in order to detect a 30% increase in the proportion of subjects&#xD;
      with an improvement of VO2max through 16 weeks of training, from 40% (hypothesized for the&#xD;
      control arm, i.e. no use of the smartphone application) to 70% (hypothesized for the&#xD;
      experimental arm, i.e. use of the smartphone application arm), with 80% power at an α of&#xD;
      0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the improvement of VO2max is directly correlated to the adherence to training sessions, we&#xD;
      expect that the proportion in the experimental arm (using the smartphone application as&#xD;
      supervision) might be similar to that observed in a previous paper (Bonato et al., 2016),&#xD;
      reporting that the adherence to exercise program with the supervision of professional coaches&#xD;
      was found to be 67%. On the contrary, in absence of training supervision (control group) we&#xD;
      expect a lower adherence, i.e. 40%. As the accrual of such a number of subjects is not&#xD;
      feasible, we plan to enrol 60 patients.&#xD;
