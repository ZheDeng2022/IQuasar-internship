  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Examination of the molecular phenotype and composition of endocrine cells in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract correlated to analyses of blood for hormones/analytes before and after&#xD;
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in morbidly obese individuals both with and without type 2&#xD;
      diabetes&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enteroscopy was conducted during sedation with Propofol®. The pre-surgical sampling included&#xD;
      biopsies retrieved from the stomach and at the expected site of anastomosis. During RYGB&#xD;
      surgery, a ~1 cm gut tissue sample was removed at the site of anastomosis. The post-surgical&#xD;
      enteroscopy ~3 months after RYGB surgery included biopsies taken from the gastric pouch, the&#xD;
      alimentary limb, the biliopancreatic limb and common channel. One sample from each location&#xD;
      was immersion-fixated in formalin for subsequent histological analyses and one sample was&#xD;
      placed in a tube with RNA-preserving media for mRNA expression analysis. Remaining samples&#xD;
      were snap-frozen and stored at -80°C until further processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enteroendocrine cells were identified and isolated from biopsies obtained at several sites in&#xD;
      the small intestine by using immunohistochemistry and laser capture technology. Isolated&#xD;
      individual enteroendocrine cells were extensively characterised by next generation sequencing&#xD;
      (Illumina NGS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants also went through four mixed meal tests with blood sampling performed:&#xD;
      before an 8 % diet-induced weight loss was initiated and one week before/one week after/3&#xD;
      months after RYGB surgery. Blood was sampled at several specific time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plasma, serum and urine collected from study participants before and after RYGB surgery&#xD;
      will be analysed for biomarkers/analytes and correlated with clinical data (weight, BMI,&#xD;
      waist/hip ratio, blood pressure) and molecular phenotype found in gut samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study changes in gut bacteria (microbiota) composition stool samples were collected during&#xD;
      the study and will be analysed for microbiota composition by means of bacterial DNA&#xD;
      sequencing.&#xD;
