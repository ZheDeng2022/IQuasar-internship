    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective study of the implementation of a real-time assessment and&#xD;
      intervention of a text messaging tool in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients&#xD;
      post-discharge from the emergency department.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children,&#xD;
      resulting in an estimated 173,000 emergency department (ED) visits and 14,000&#xD;
      hospitalizations each year in the US. The estimated rate of TBI visits increased 57% from&#xD;
      2001-2009, and in 2010 there were more than 2.5 million TBI-related ED visits. Most patients&#xD;
      are discharged from the ED and diagnosed with a closed head injury, minor head injury,&#xD;
      concussion, or other unspecified head injury. After discharge, patients, family members, and&#xD;
      other care partners may report certain mTBI symptoms that may lead to unnecessary utilization&#xD;
      of healthcare services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel, effective, and cost-effective solutions for mTBI symptom management post ED discharge&#xD;
      are needed to improve the patient's understanding about their symptoms after discharge. Use&#xD;
      of mobile technology to interact with mTBI patients may: 1) extend the reach of clinicians,&#xD;
      2) offer patients diagnosed with a mTBI a form of ongoing tailored clinical support, and 3)&#xD;
      contribute to improved health outcomes and optimization of health care utilization. Previous&#xD;
      research shows high compliance with text-message based interventions, measurable change in&#xD;
      behavior, and prolonged adherence to clinical guidance. A recent randomized trial of mTBI&#xD;
      patients showed high-compliance with text-message assessments following ED discharge, and a&#xD;
      trend towards fewer and less severe post-mTBI symptoms in the intervention group. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to develop and pilot a novel mobile phone text-messaging platform to&#xD;
      perform real-time assessment and intervention of mTBI patients discharged from the ED. This&#xD;
      intervention will empower patients to actively participate in the management of their&#xD;
      condition. Use of this technology with the mTBI patient population is feasible and&#xD;
      cost-effective. Over 90% of Americans own a cell phone or smartphone, and 80% send and&#xD;
      receive text-messages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective of this research study is to develop and pilot the novel use of an&#xD;
      existing technology, mobile phone text-messaging, to perform real-time assessment and&#xD;
      feedback regarding symptoms of mTBI patients post-discharge from the ED. A second objective&#xD;
      is to assess the effect of a brief, real-time, tailored intervention designed to impact&#xD;
      patient and caregiver understanding of their mTBI related symptoms. The overarching goal of&#xD;
      this proposal is to build on the work of Dr. Hirsch, et al. who found that: 1) mTBI patients&#xD;
      report a poor understanding of concussion; 2) mTBI patients reported insufficient&#xD;
      communication with clinicians regarding their symptoms following ED discharge (e.g., balance&#xD;
      and sleep); and 3) mTBI patients reported poor care coordination, poor follow-up, and limited&#xD;
      access to specialist physicians post-discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Based on prior work, implementation of a text-based tool for assessment and&#xD;
      intervention of mTBI patients post-discharge from the CMC-Main &amp; LCH EDs will improve patient&#xD;
      engagement related to mTBI. It is anticipated that 50% of potential study subjects will elect&#xD;
      to receive text messages and that the differences in characteristics of enrolled participants&#xD;
      versus non-participants will not be statistically significant. It is anticipated that &gt; 75%&#xD;
      of participants will respond/comply with the symptom assessment messages.&#xD;
