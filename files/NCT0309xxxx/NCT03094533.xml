  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sevoflurane-only&#xD;
      Volatile induction and maintenance anesthesia (VIMA) and total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA)&#xD;
      using only propofol in adult patients scheduled for elective lobectomy surgery. We would like&#xD;
      to know if there is a difference in blood glucose levels during surgery and whether the cause&#xD;
      is due to the difference in secretion of insulin and cortisol. In addition, we aim to&#xD;
      contribute to the improvement of the prognosis of the patients by helping the selection of&#xD;
      general anesthesia more effective in maintaining homeostasis in the surgical patients by&#xD;
      general anesthesia and further controlling the blood glucose level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before surgery, glycopyrrolate (0.2 mg) was administered intramuscularly. Immediately after&#xD;
      arrival in the operating room, blood pressure, electrocardiogram and oxygen saturation are&#xD;
      measured and monitored, and a bispectral index (BIS) is attached to the patient's forehead to&#xD;
      determine the appropriate anesthetic depth during surgery. A 22G angiocatheter is inserted&#xD;
      into the radial artery after local anesthesia with lidocaine to monitor the blood pressure in&#xD;
      real time and to collect blood for arterial blood gas analysis during one side of pulmonary&#xD;
      ventilation. General anesthesia induces loss of consciousness by using a randomly assigned&#xD;
      systemic anesthetic (sevoflurane inhalation or propofol infusion). In the VIMA group, when 8%&#xD;
      sevoflurane is inhaled with 100% oxygen at 6 L / min and the consciousness is lost, the&#xD;
      concentration of sevoflurane is reduced to 2-3% and then the mask is ventilated. In the TIVA&#xD;
      group, target controlled infusion (TCI) was performed with propofol 4 mcg / ml, and the&#xD;
      patient was ventilated after disappearance of consciousness. When the consciousness of the&#xD;
      subject is lost, remifentanil is administered as TCI with a target concentration of 1 ng / ml&#xD;
      as an analgesic agent, and rocuronium 0.5 mg / kg is administered intravenously for&#xD;
      intubation in both groups. If the patient's anesthesia depth is between BIS 40-60 and the&#xD;
      respiratory muscles are fully relaxed, tracheal intubation is performed using the double&#xD;
      lumen endobronchial tube (DLT). After confirming the DLT reaches the proper position with a&#xD;
      flexible bronchoscope, mechanical ventilation is started by administering 50% oxygen. The&#xD;
      central venous catheter is inserted into the operative subclavian vein and the central venous&#xD;
      pressure is continuously monitored during the operation. During surgery, rocuronium is&#xD;
      administered continuously so that the train-of-four (TOF) remains below two responses. In&#xD;
      addition, warm blanket and warm air are supplied to the rest of the body except for the&#xD;
      surgical site so that the patient can maintain normothermia during the operation. In all&#xD;
      patients, surgery should start between 8:30 am and 9:00 am in order to prevent volatility of&#xD;
      blood cortisol levels by activity cycle. During surgery, general anesthesia should be&#xD;
      adjusted to maintain BIS 40-60, and remifentanil TCI should be maintained at 1 ng / ml for&#xD;
      pain during surgery. The mean blood pressure during surgery is aimed at maintaining a 30%&#xD;
      range on baseline so that hypotension or hypertension does not last more than 5 minutes.&#xD;
      Hypotension and hypertension are controlled by intravenous injection of phenylephrine (50 μg&#xD;
      / ml) and nicardipine (500 μg / ml), respectively. At the end of the operation and after the&#xD;
      paravertebral block to control the postoperative pain, the administration of the general&#xD;
      anesthetic and remifentanil is stopped and the spontaneous breathing is tried to be&#xD;
      recovered. When patients begin spontaneous breathing, the effect of the remaining&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockers is reversed using pyridostigmine (0.2 mg / kg) and glycopyrrolate&#xD;
      (0.008 mg / kg). All patients are fully conscious and have a spontaneous respiration when&#xD;
      they are exhaled and transferred to the postanesthetic care unit (PACU). PACU administers&#xD;
      oxygen through a facial mask and monitors blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation.&#xD;
      Patients should be given 1 ug / kg of fentanyl when the visual analog scale (VAS) scores&#xD;
      exceed 4 points&#xD;
