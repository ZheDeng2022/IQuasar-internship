  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Targeted Muscle Reinnervation increases the control signals available for commercial arm&#xD;
      systems. A new type of control, pattern recognition, has been developed into a form that&#xD;
      allows use with commercially available arm system. The goal of this project is a home trial,&#xD;
      in which people who have had TMR will try the new controls and the new arm to find out if&#xD;
      they are better than what is currently available. Home trials will also allow us to see what&#xD;
      needs to be done to make our inventions work even better.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who participate return to RIC several times (approximately 6-8 times) to undergo any&#xD;
      necessary training and testing. Each visit will last from 2-5 days. The study will include&#xD;
      use of up to three different prosthesis control systems at home for approximately 6 weeks&#xD;
      each. The order of the systems will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first visit will allow us to cast the subject's residual limb for a socket and measure&#xD;
      for a gel liner to be made with embedded electrode contacts prior to the next return. The&#xD;
      socket interface will be fit for optimal comfort and a suspension sleeve and/or other straps,&#xD;
      fasters, etc to best hold the prosthesis securely on the residual limb for the activities&#xD;
      required. Unless changes are needed due to changes in limb volume, the same socket can be&#xD;
      used for all phases of the study. During the initial and subsequent visits, subjects may&#xD;
      practice the various control methods using a virtual reality system. EMG data and virtual&#xD;
      &quot;games&quot; will be used to practice the control and will provide quantitative data that can be&#xD;
      used to assess the various control methods mathematically, without the prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each phase of the study (up to 4 phases), will include preliminary training and testing at&#xD;
      RIC lasting for 1-5 days, followed by approximately 6 weeks of at-home use of the system.&#xD;
      After this time subjects will return to the RIC for 2-3 days of testing. They will then be&#xD;
      trained and pre-tested in use of the next control during the same visit or at a later date.&#xD;
      These systems include a commercially available myoelectric prosthesis with standard control,&#xD;
      a commercially available device with advanced control (called pattern recognition), a&#xD;
      commercially available device with pattern recognition and a new electrode configuration.&#xD;
      Photographs or video recordings will be made during participation in this research study.&#xD;
      These pictures and video recordings are essential for proper data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the at-home use periods subjects will go about their daily business using the test&#xD;
      prosthesis and will be asked document the experience with the prosthesis via weekly phone&#xD;
      communication with study staff. Dates/times will be coordinated during normal business hours&#xD;
      At the end of the at-home use period subjects will return to RIC for 3-5 days, where they&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a questionnaire about how the prosthesis worked, and will undergo&#xD;
      some non-invasive testing to see how well they can control and use the prosthesis.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A upper limb amputation at the transhumeral or shoulder-disarticulation level&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Successful TMR surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous success at operating a myoelectric prosthesis using surface EMG signals from&#xD;
             reinnervated muscles (not necessarily current prosthesis usage, although current&#xD;
             prosthesis users may be more likely to use their trial prostheses).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant new injury that would prevent use of a prosthesis: The ability to&#xD;
             consistently wear a prosthesis and perform activities of daily living and specific&#xD;
             performance tasks is necessary to evaluate the relative benefits of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive impairment sufficient to adversely affect understanding of or compliance&#xD;
             with study requirements, ability to communicate experiences, or ability to give&#xD;
             informed consent: The ability to understand and comply with requirements of the study&#xD;
             is essential in order for the study to generate useable, reliable data. The ability to&#xD;
             obtain relevant user feedback through questionnaires and informal discussion adds&#xD;
             significant value to this study. Of note, all TMR patients to date have normal&#xD;
             cognitive function and we are not aware of any new brain injuries that would preclude&#xD;
             participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant other co morbidity: Any other medical issues or injuries that would&#xD;
             preclude completion of the study, use of the prostheses, or that would otherwise&#xD;
             prevent acquisition of useable data by researchers.&#xD;
