             is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Healthy as determined by the investigator on the basis of medical history, physical&#xD;
             examination, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs and digital 12-lead&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Non-smoker or smoker of &lt;10 cigarettes per day as determined by history. Must be able&#xD;
             to abstain from smoking during the inpatient stay.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Males older than 65 years, inclusive. Specific inclusion criteria procedure:&#xD;
             genotyping Since acetylation is an important BIA 5-453 metabolic pathway, NAT1 and&#xD;
             NAT2 genotyping was required for inclusion for distinguishing between poor and faster&#xD;
             acetylators (both could however be enrolled in the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects (young and elderly):&#xD;
&#xD;
        General&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who had participated in a clinical trial with an investigational drug within&#xD;
             the 90 days prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects who were likely to be noncompliant with the protocol, or who were felt to be&#xD;
             unsuitable by the Investigator for any other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Positive serologic findings for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies,&#xD;

             soda) in excess of 6 cups per day (or equivalent), of grapefruit,&#xD;
             grapefruit-containing products, or alcoholic beverages within 24 hours before study&#xD;
             day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Use of any over-the-counter drugs including herbal supplements (except for the&#xD;
             occasional use of acetaminophen [paracetamol], aspirin and vitamins ≤100% recommended&#xD;
             daily allowance) within 7 days before BIA 5-453 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
