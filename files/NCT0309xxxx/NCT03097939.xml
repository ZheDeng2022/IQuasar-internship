  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that a combined Immuno-Oncology (IO)&#xD;
      strategy would see efficacy in a virally driven cancer like Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC).&#xD;
      Hence, this is a combination study of nivolumab and ipilimumab in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)&#xD;
      driven nasopharyngeal carcinoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is endemic in Southern China and South-east Asia. Due to the&#xD;
      peculiar chemosensitive nature of this disease and the low investment in drug development in&#xD;
      Asia, there has been a paucity of new therapies for this disease. While response rates to&#xD;
      repeated lines of chemotherapy average around 30%, the duration of disease control remains&#xD;
      dismal and hence there is an unmet need to develop new therapies for this disease. These&#xD;
      response rates are fairly similar to current monotherapy use of anti-PD1 agents in this&#xD;
      group. Of specific interest, combined IO strategies have appear to add significantly to&#xD;
      response rates in selected tumors such as melanoma, small cell lung cancer, and now Epidermal&#xD;
      Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutant lung cancers. It is hypothesized that a combined IO&#xD;
      strategy would have similar if not better responses in a virally driven cancer like NPC.&#xD;
      Hence this is a single arm study exploring the activity of a combination of nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab in EBV driven nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The primary endpoint is best overall&#xD;
      response rate. Secondary endpoints will examine clinical benefit rate at 18 weeks, toxicities&#xD;
      of the combination, and immunological correlates.&#xD;

             immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone&#xD;
             equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;

             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ipilimumab has the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             nivolumab or ipilimumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;

             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to&#xD;
             recur in the absence of an external trigger&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with&#xD;
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or&#xD;
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents&#xD;
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As there is potential for hepatic toxicity with nivolumab or nivolumab/ipilimumab&#xD;
             combinations, drugs with predisposition to hepatoxicity should be used with caution in&#xD;
             patients treated with nivolumab-containing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient should be excluded if they have history or active interstitial lung disease&#xD;

             non-melanomatous skin cancers, in situ cervical cancers, localized prostate cancer or&#xD;
             in situ breast cancer) are excluded unless a complete remission was achieved at least&#xD;
             3 years prior to study entry and no additional therapy is required or anticipated to&#xD;
             be required&#xD;
