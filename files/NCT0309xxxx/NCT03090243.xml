      Our trial examined the intraocular pressure measurements differences, before and after&#xD;
      virtual colonoscopy examination.&#xD;

      Glaucoma is a complicated disease in which damage to the optic nerve leads to progressive,&#xD;
      irreversible vision loss. Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness and associated&#xD;
      with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) as a major risk factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IOP is influenced by many factors, including ethnicity, heredity, various chemical substances&#xD;
      (existing body and external body like drugs), physical changes (postures, neural and vascular&#xD;
      autoregulation) and more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual colonoscopy is a common screening test for the early detection and diagnosis of colon&#xD;
      cancer. The test is performed by computed tomography (CT) after inflating the colon with&#xD;
      carbon dioxide (CO2) gas. The procedure is performed by inserting a Foley catheter through&#xD;
      the anus. As a result of gas inflating of the bowel, consequently, there is an increase in&#xD;
      the abdominal pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raising intra-abdominal pressure may cause a rise in intraocular pressure. The aim of this&#xD;
      research is to examine the changes in IOP before and after the virtual colonoscopy, with the&#xD;
      aim to improve the understanding of the relationship between intra-abdominal pressure and&#xD;
      IOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 100 patients, men and women, that are scheduled for virtual&#xD;
      colonoscopy test both in a hospital and in ambulatory.&#xD;
