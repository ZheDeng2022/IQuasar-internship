      This is an open label, Phase 1/2 study of oral miransertib (MK-7075) administered to&#xD;
      participants at least 2 years of age with PIK3CA-related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS) and&#xD;
      Proteus Syndrome (PS) (MOSAIC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two parts: Part A and Part B. Part A was closed to enrollment under&#xD;
      Amendment 6. As of Amendment 7, the endpoints for Part A and Part B have been combined to&#xD;
      assess the safety and tolerability of miransertib in participants with PROS and PS. Previous&#xD;
      efficacy and pharmacokinetic (PK) objectives and endpoints have been removed.&#xD;

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in a participant, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product and does not imply any judgment about causality.</description>
