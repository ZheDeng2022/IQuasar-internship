  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved the health of more than 18 million people infected&#xD;
      with HIV by controlling viral replication, AIDS and non-AIDS events, and by reducing the risk&#xD;
      of transmission. However, the existence of latent viral reservoirs in long-lived memory CD4 T&#xD;
      cells remains a hurdle to curing HIV infection; consequently patients must remain on ART for&#xD;
      the rest of their lives. Recently, a more realistic approach under limelight is to identify&#xD;
      strategies leading to a functional cure, which is defined as the natural control of viral&#xD;
      reservoir by the host. Use of recombinant human growth hormone has been shown to improve&#xD;
      immune function by several mechanisms. This study hypothesizes that treatment with&#xD;
      recombinant human growth hormone will decrease the size of the replication competent HIV&#xD;
      reservoir in HIV-infected immune-reconstituted individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific study objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of recombinant human growth hormone administration for 48 weeks&#xD;
           on the size of the replication competent HIV reservoir&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of recombinant human growth hormone&#xD;
           administration for 48 weeks in HIV-infected individuals on suppressive ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, the investigators will add recombinant human growth hormone treatment for&#xD;
      the patients receiving stable ART. Approximately 22 participants will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      study at the Chronic Viral Illness Service of the McGill University Health Centre (Montreal,&#xD;
      Canada), which will last about 52 weeks. Participants will be treated with recombinant human&#xD;
      growth hormone for a total of 48 weeks. The initial recombinant human growth hormone dose&#xD;
      will be 3 mg/day (30-40 µg/kg/d) for 24 weeks administered by subcutaneous injection on an&#xD;
      outpatient basis, followed by dose reduction to 1.5 mg/day for the final 24 weeks of the&#xD;
      treatment period, also conducted on an outpatient basis. The study inclusion criteria include&#xD;
      male and female participants, ≥18 and &lt;40 years of age, with an undetectable viral load (the&#xD;
      quantity of the HIV virus in the blood must be less than 50 copies/ml) during last 24 months&#xD;
      and with a CD4 T-cell count ≥350 cells/mm3 obtained within 30 days prior to study entry. The&#xD;
      findings from this study will contribute to the development of novel strategies to eradicate&#xD;
      HIV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically reduced the death rate from AIDS and improved&#xD;
      the quality of life of many HIV-infected individuals. However, ART does not eradicate HIV as&#xD;
      demonstrated by the rapid return of viremia whenever treatment is interrupted. The possible&#xD;
      long-term toxicity associated with ART, viral resistance, stigma and cost all contribute to&#xD;
      the necessity of finding a cure. A sterilizing cure, in which the virus is completely&#xD;
      eradicated, would require the elimination of all replication-competent viruses throughout the&#xD;
      body. An alternative approach, probably more realistic, would be to aim for a kind of &quot;cancer&#xD;
      model&quot; of cure, where an individual would enjoy long-term health in the absence of ART, or a&#xD;
      disease &quot;remission&quot;, which might be achieved after reducing the amount of residual HIV during&#xD;
      ART (the &quot;reservoir&quot;) to levels which the immune system can effectively control. This is&#xD;
      commonly referred to as a functional cure in which the viral reservoir is naturally&#xD;
      controlled by the host. Both forms of cure (sterilizing and functional) would require&#xD;
      eliminating, or at least reducing, the reservoirs of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different types of cells carry persistent HIV in virally suppressed individuals. Although&#xD;
      myeloid cells may also contribute to HIV persistence, it is well established that the&#xD;
      majority of replication competent viral genomes persist in memory CD4 T cells during ART. In&#xD;
      contrast, naïve CD4 T cells are rarely infected in virally suppressed individuals. As a&#xD;
      result of their low infection rate, the frequency of naïve cells negatively correlates with&#xD;
      the size of the viral reservoir. Therefore, increasing the frequency of naïve cells may&#xD;
      actively reduce the size of the latent HIV reservoir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thymic activity gradually decreases with age. The production of recent thymic emigrants&#xD;
      (RTEs) is drastically reduced in the elderly, resulting in a decrease in the proportion of&#xD;
      new naïve cells in the CD4 compartment, which is compensated by the proliferation of naïve&#xD;
      cells in the periphery. Thus, the stability of the naïve cell pool is ensured by different&#xD;
      mechanisms in young and elderly, with a major contribution of the thymus in young people. The&#xD;
      study investigators preliminary data indicate that the size of the reservoir as measured by&#xD;
      integrated DNA strongly correlates with the age of virally suppressed individuals, with&#xD;
      younger individuals displaying a smaller reservoir). Although the mechanism underlying this&#xD;
      remarkable association is unknown and likely to be multi-factorial, continued generation of&#xD;
      naïve CD4 T cells during ART could lead over time to replenishment of infected memory cells&#xD;
      with new uninfected memory cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) administered to ART-treated HIV infected individuals&#xD;
      has been found to reverse thymic involution, increase total and naïve CD4 T cell counts and&#xD;
      reduce the expression of activation and apoptosis markers. Reconstitution of the thymus in&#xD;
      immunosuppressed adults through rhGH hormone treatment restores both HIV-specific cellular&#xD;
      and antibody responses. Altogether, these observations suggest that the administration of&#xD;
      rhGH may reduce the size of the latent HIV reservoir by 1) increasing the frequency of naïve&#xD;
      cells 2) reducing the levels of immune activation and 3) restoring HIV specific immune&#xD;
      responses, three parameters that are associated with the size of the latent HIV reservoir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical trials conducted to date using pharmacologic doses of GH, the most common adverse&#xD;
      effects have been arthralgia and edema, both occurring in approximately 35% of patients; and&#xD;
      myalgia, which was observed in about 30% of patients on GH. Other less common effects that&#xD;
      are believed to be related to GH treatment include increased blood pressure, headaches,&#xD;
      hyperglycemia and diabetes, enlargement of male breast tissue, carpal tunnel syndrome, and&#xD;
      pancreatitis. Other, extremely rare, potential side effects that may be related to GH are&#xD;
      allergic reactions to GH, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, hypothyroidism, and leukemia.&#xD;
      There is conflicting evidence about whether GH increases the occurrence of lymphoma or other&#xD;
      cancers in patients infected with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While participant enrolled in this trial might not benefit directly from the strategy, it is&#xD;
      expected that the trial will provide useful information that relates directly to the status&#xD;
      of the study participants (HIV infection HIV reservoirs, immunotherapeutic approaches etc.).&#xD;
      In addition, study participants enrolled in the trial will receive compensation, clinical&#xD;
      monitoring, laboratory monitoring and continued adherence counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' primary hypothesis is that treatment with recombinant human growth hormone&#xD;
      will result in a decrease in the size of the replication competent HIV reservoir in&#xD;
      HIV-infected immune-reconstituted individuals. A reduction in the size of the HIV reservoir&#xD;
      is unlikely to have any direct clinical benefits for the participants. However, this may&#xD;
      contribute, in association with other therapies, to the development of novel strategies to&#xD;
      eradicate HIV in the future.&#xD;
