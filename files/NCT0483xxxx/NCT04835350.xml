&#xD;
        6. Application of DANA RS Diabcare insulin pump and CGM Dexcom G6 to the patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Optimization of basal dose and bolus calculator settings using Pancreas4ALL advisor&#xD;

&#xD;
        8. Education about the necessary inputs (data entered by the patient) into the Pancreas4ALL&#xD;
           application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Activation of the Pancreas4ALL application - open loop. Preprandial bolus calculated by&#xD;
           the patient using a bolus calculator, part of the Pancreas4ALL application.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Completion of the Quality of Life (QoL) Questionnaire PedsQl&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defined Pancreas4ALL settings for all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Target glycemia 5.5 mmol / mol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active insulin time 6 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Setting automatic functions: In case of hypoglycemia (glycemia below 3.9 mmol / l), a&#xD;
           temporary blood glucose target of 8 mmol / l is automatically set for 30 minutes after&#xD;
           the hypoglycemia has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of physical activity, it is recommended that the patient temporarily increase&#xD;
           the target glycemia to 8 mmol / l, switch to a temporary profile of 70-80% depending on&#xD;
           the intensity of physical activity (automatic recalculation of basal dose, insulin&#xD;
           sensitivity, insulin carbohydrate ratio to 70-80%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of illness accompanied by an increase in glycaemia, the patient is recommended&#xD;
           to switch to a temporary profile of 120-150% (automatic recalculation of the basal dose,&#xD;
           insulin sensitivity, insulin carbohydrate ratio at the set 120-150%)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Initiation - activation of the &quot;closed loop&quot; Pancreas4All in the hybrid closed loop mode&#xD;
      (2.7.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The patient will enter the number of carbohydrates eaten into the application, using the&#xD;
           bolus calculator to calculate the preprandial bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Meal blood glucose will be corrected using the Pancreas4All automated system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In case of glycemia above 13 mmol / l 30 min after a meal, the correction bolus will be&#xD;
           calculated using a bolus calculator. Hyperglycemia management see appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In case of hypoglycaemia (glycaemia &lt;3.9 mmol /), the subject will be given dextrose in&#xD;
           the form of tablets or a sweet drink (the amount of dextrose will be calculated&#xD;
           according to the patient's weight, current level and glycemic trend) See Appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Randomization to group A and group B&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomization will be performed using an IT application according to age, gender, weight&#xD;
           and input glycated hemoglobin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Group A: Activation of Pancreas4ALL in closed loop mode in &quot;meal announcement&quot;&#xD;
                (version 2.7.2). The patient will only enter a notification in the application that&#xD;
                he is going to eat.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Group B: Activation of the Pancreas4ALL application in mode full closed loop mode&#xD;
                (version 2.7.3). The subject will not enter any notification or notification into&#xD;
                the application that it is going to eat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Other settings + glycemic control remain as in the previous phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 7 - Cross-over - change of settings for groups A and B:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The basic settings remain unchanged&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Change the setting mode in groups A and B&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood glucose control see above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 10 - Visit 2 - End of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Download data from pump to DexCom clarity and Diasend / Tidepool, check data storage&#xD;
           from IP and sensor&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluation of glycemic control for the last week&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Completion of the PedsQl Quality of Life (QoL) Questionnaire + System Satisfaction&#xD;
           Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Termination of the study - return to the standard treatment modality of the patients&#xD;
