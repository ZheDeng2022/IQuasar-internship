  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II pilot study to determine the efficacy of three fixed dose (1 x 108/kg)&#xD;
      infusions of ex-vivo expanded human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical donor natural&#xD;
      killer (NK) cells (haploNK) in children and young adults with high risk acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML) undergoing HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant (haploHCT) with a&#xD;
      busulfan and cyclophosphamide-based myeloablative conditioning regimen and post-transplant&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide (PTCy) for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. The investigators&#xD;
      will also demonstrate the feasibility of performing this trial in a multi-center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the infusion of haploNK in this setting will facilitate&#xD;
      immune reconstitution and decrease relapse rates and infectious complications without&#xD;
      increasing GVHD, resulting in improved survival as compared to recent historical cohorts of&#xD;
      haploHCT without NK cell infusion.&#xD;

The definition of platelet engraftment is sustained platelet count &gt; 20,000/mm3 with no platelet transfusions in the preceding seven days.

HaploNK cells will be manufactured from the PB of the donor after co-culture with irradiated feeder cells (IFC) as described in Section 2.4. The recipients will receive three NK cell infusions on Day-1, Day+7 (± 1 day) and Day+42 (up to Day+90) from day of transplant (Day 0).</description>
