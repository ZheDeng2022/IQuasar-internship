  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the value of including dynamic vision testing into&#xD;
      California State University, Northridge (CSUN) Athletics' established concussion protocol.&#xD;
      The study's hypotheses are 1) dynamic vision testing will reveal vision impairments right&#xD;
      after a person sustains a concussion, 2) these impairments may still be present upon&#xD;
      clearance to return to play.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects of interest are CSUN student-athletes who give consent to participate in the&#xD;
      study. Dynamic vision will be assessed through the administration of the Dynamic Visual&#xD;
      Acuity (DVA) test and the Gaze Stabilization Test (GST). Additionally, the 6-condition&#xD;
      Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), which is currently a component of CSUN's established&#xD;
      concussion protocol, will be administered to assess balance impairments. This cluster of&#xD;
      tests will be administered three times per athlete: (1) during preseason to establish&#xD;
      baseline measures, (2) acutely post-concussion once the athlete subject has been cleared by&#xD;
      the team physician for return to exercise, and (3) when cleared to return to sport. The&#xD;
      results will be used to evaluate whether or not dynamic vision results have returned to&#xD;
      baseline by the time that CSUN Athletics clears the athlete to &quot;Return to Play.&quot;&#xD;

        Due to COVID-19 and the uncertainty of which teams will be competing during the academic&#xD;
        year, our subject pool will potentially come from any athlete who provides consent from an&#xD;
        equal number of men's and women's teams who are competing that semester.&#xD;
