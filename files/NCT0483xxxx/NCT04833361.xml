      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uveal coloboma is a congenital eye malformation. It is thought to be a genetic condition. But&#xD;
      it might have environmental causes as well. Researchers want to study the mothers of children&#xD;
      with coloboma. They will use parts of the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS)&#xD;
      Mother Questionnaire. NBDPS was a large study of birth defects. It collected data from 1997&#xD;
      to 2011. Researchers will use NBDPS and NIH data as well as the new survey to produce data&#xD;
      that can serve as a basis for further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore maternal factors and exposures during the first trimester of pregnancy as&#xD;
      potential causes of uveal coloboma and to correlate exposure data to clinical data from&#xD;
      affected children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers of probands with coloboma who have taken part in NIH study 06-EI-0230, 04-EI-0039, or&#xD;
      13-EI-0049.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a hybrid study. It will use existing data from NBDPS and NIH studies. It will also&#xD;
      use NBDPS for a new survey of mothers of children with coloboma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take the survey by phone. Their pregnancy records may be reviewed. They&#xD;
      will be asked about:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Important dates&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health and medicines&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tobacco, alcohol, and substance use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents occupations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family demographics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will take 1 hour or less to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some data were obtained in past NIH studies. These data are largely from children. Some&#xD;
      family data may be used as well. For example, eye exam data, gene test results, and family&#xD;
      history of coloboma may be used. If a participant did not consent to the future use of their&#xD;
      data, then their data will not be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be stored in a secure NIH database.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uveal coloboma is a rare, potentially-blinding congenital eye malformation due to failure of&#xD;
      the optic fissure to close during the 5th week of human gestation. Although coloboma is&#xD;
      thought to have a significant genetic component, the yield of systematic screening of known&#xD;
      causative genes remains low. Environmental causes for coloboma have been suggested, yet few&#xD;
      to none have been proven and most studies have not been undertaken in the United States6-8.&#xD;
      Potential environmental causes include maternal nutritional deficiencies, drug exposure&#xD;
      (including alcohol), and endocrine abnormalities8. Some reports are conflicting (e.g.,&#xD;
      maternal diabetes) and some associations have been suggested by animal models, but not&#xD;
      explored in humans . Most human studies are level III and IV evidence by the Agency for&#xD;
      Healthcare Research and Quality grading scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uveal coloboma is often grouped together with anophthalmia ( no eyes ) and microphthalmia (&#xD;
      small eyes ), designated by the acronym MAC . Detailed, population-based studies of the&#xD;
      epidemiology of microphthalmia and anophthalmia have been conducted as part of birth defect&#xD;
      surveillance programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed pilot evaluation of potential environmental causes of coloboma is being&#xD;
      undertaken to explore the experiences in a large cohort of probands and their families. It&#xD;
      will utilize portions of the validated National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) Mother&#xD;
      Questionnaire. The NBDPS was a large population-based multicenter case-control study of many&#xD;
      major birth defects that collected data from October 1997 through December 2011. Interview&#xD;
      pregnancy information was obtained in 32,187 cases and 11,814 controls. The findings are&#xD;
      intended to produce descriptive statistics and serve as a basis for further epidemiologic&#xD;
      (and possibly laboratory) study.&#xD;
