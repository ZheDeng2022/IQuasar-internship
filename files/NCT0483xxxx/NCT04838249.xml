      Current study aims to characterize five highly interconnected physiological systems in&#xD;
      patients undergoing cross-sex hormone therapy - namely glucose and lipid metabolism, energy&#xD;
      balance, eating behavior, functional brain networks involved in the regulation of eating&#xD;
      behavior and the cardiovascular system - to gain novel insights into the effects of sex&#xD;
      hormones on the human body. Gathered information will help to identify pathophysiological&#xD;
      mechanisms for the development of overeating/obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current study is an observational study. The decision if the patient's request for cross-sex&#xD;
      hormone therapy can complied with (i.e., if cross-sex hormone therapy is medically indicated)&#xD;
      is made prior to the first contact with the study center and with the outpatients clinic for&#xD;
      Endocrinology at the University Hospital in Leipzig. Decision ifor treatment is made&#xD;
      according to national and international guidelines. Treatment of study participants with&#xD;
      testosterone and estradiol/antiandrogens is not affected by the study. During the course of&#xD;
      the study no invasive interventions are being performed.&#xD;

      1. Introduction 1.1. Transsexualism Transsexualism is a condition in which an individual's&#xD;
           gender identity is incongruent with the assigned sex at birth. Many transsexuals suffer&#xD;
           from severe psychological problems caused by this this incongruence, referred to as&#xD;
           gender dysphoria. Supporting transsexuals in living in the sex with which they identify&#xD;
           leads to amelioration of psychological problems and medical problems. In sex&#xD;
           reassignment therapy, cross-sex hormone therapy is an essential element.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Cross-sex hormone therapy in transsexual patients In many patients, cross sex&#xD;
           hormone therapy is used to conduct sex change. In transmen (biological women with&#xD;
           perceived male sex), testosterone is used for gender reassignment. In transwomen&#xD;
           (biological men with perceived female sex), the most commonly used medication is&#xD;
           estrogen. Successful therapy leads to the development of typical secondary sex&#xD;
           characteristics. Data and knowledge regarding the effects of cross-sex hormone therapy&#xD;
           on the human body, additionally to the desired sex affirming changes, is scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3. Investigation of the effects of estrogen and testosterone on the human body&#xD;
           Investigating the effects of cross-sex hormone therapy provides further information on&#xD;
           the effects of testosterone and estradiol on the human body. One of the most recognized&#xD;
           differences between men and women regarding health is the increased cardiovascular risk&#xD;
           of men as compared to women. In transmen, testosterone therapy leads to an increased&#xD;
           risk for myocardial infarction. Data from the diabetes prevention program suggest that&#xD;
           in males the probability of developing diabetes mellitus type 2, a major risk factor for&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease is positively correlated with serum concentrations of estradiol&#xD;
           and negatively correlated with concentrations of testosterone. Furthermore, previous&#xD;
           studies pointed to differences in the regulation of eating behavior of men and women&#xD;
           potentially contributing to the development of obesity and type-2-diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The above mentioned findings are just examples of plentiful dissimilarities in health&#xD;
           and disease of the two sexes with unknown causes. To date studies assessing e.g. markers&#xD;
           of cardiometabolic disease in cross-sex hormone therapy remain inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4. Purpose of this study To gain novel insights into the effects of sex hormones on&#xD;
           the human body, current study aims to characterize four highly interconnected&#xD;
           physiological systems in patients undergoing cross-sex hormone therapy: glucose and&#xD;
           lipid metabolism, energy balance, eating behavior, and the cardiovascular system.&#xD;
           Gathered knowledge will help to identify pathophysiological mechanisms for the&#xD;
           development of overeating/obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aims The study is designed to investigate the effects of testosterone and&#xD;
           estradiol/cyproteron acetate in patients with gender dysphoria/transsexualism undergoing&#xD;
           cross-sex hormone therapy in comparison to a control group without hormone therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Effects of cross-sex hormone therapy on:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Part A Glucose and lipid metabolism Part B Body composition and energy balance control&#xD;
           Part C Psychobehavioral traits with a focus on eating behavior Part D (Cardio-) Vascular&#xD;
           system&#xD;
&#xD;
           To best possibly attribute observed effects to the applied sex hormones, baseline&#xD;
           measurements before starting cross-sex hormone treatment will be performed (V0).&#xD;
           Measurements will be repeated at five time points during ongoing cross sex hormone&#xD;
           treatment (V1-5):&#xD;
&#xD;
           V0 Baseline assessment before start of cross-sex hormone therapy V1 Three months after&#xD;
           start of cross-sex hormone therapy V2 Six months after start of cross-sex hormone&#xD;
           therapy V3 Twelve months after start of cross-sex hormone therapy V4 Two years after&#xD;
           start of cross-sex hormone therapy V5 Five years after start of cross-sex hormone&#xD;
           therapy To be able to exclude unspecific order effects of the measurements and to be&#xD;
           able to compare obtained results with non-transsexual persons, controls not undergoing&#xD;
           cross-sex hormone therapy matched for age, body mass index, health status (morbidity)&#xD;
           and education will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Research Design and Methods 3.1. Participants and recruitment This is a five year&#xD;
           observational, non-invasive study to evaluate the effect of cross-sex hormone therapy on&#xD;
           metabolism, eating behavior, body composition, energy expenditure and the cardiovascular&#xD;
           system. Results will be compared longitudinally on an intra-individual level, as well as&#xD;
           on an inter-individual level by comparing transmen with transwomen and both groups with&#xD;
           non-treated controls. Transsexual patients will be recruited at the outpatient clinic&#xD;
           for Endocrinology at the University Hospital Leipzig. Patients seeking cross-sex hormone&#xD;
           therapy will be asked before starting cross-sex hormone therapy for their willingness to&#xD;
           participate in the study. Patients willing to participate will be screened for study&#xD;
           eligibility. Eligible subjects will be informed about the study procedures and possible&#xD;
           risks. Upon receiving written informed consent, the patient will be included into the&#xD;
           study. Willingness to participate in the study will not influence the medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control group of men and women matched for age, body mass index, health status (morbidity)&#xD;
      and education who are nor undergoing cross-sex hormone therapy will be recruited via online&#xD;
      advertisements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Study procedures Seven days prior to baseline assessment, accelerometers will be handed&#xD;
      to participants to measure physical activity. Four days prior to baseline, participants will&#xD;
      be asked to complete a 96h activity log to objectify physical activity. Food intake will be&#xD;
      self-assessed four days prior to baseline assessment via questionnaire as instructed by a&#xD;
      trained dietitian. Dietary restraints will be assessed (e.g., lactose intolerance, etc.) to&#xD;
      adjust procedures of ad libitum food intake measurement to individual needs. A tour of our&#xD;
      metabolic unit and the MRI facilities will be given to participants and procedures explained.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to fill out behavioral questionnaires at home, within one hour of&#xD;
      completing their breakfast, to decrease variability of answers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of baseline assessment, prior to initiation of cross-sex hormone therapy/no&#xD;
      therapy, current medical history including current medication, a physical exam including&#xD;
      measurement of weight, waist and hip circumferences, blood pressure and heart rate will be&#xD;
      performed. In the fasted state, blood will be drawn to measure fasting glucose, HbA1c%, serum&#xD;
      insulin, triglycerides, total-, low- and high-density-lipoprotein concentrations. Insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and HOMA-IR will be calculated. The fasting blood draw will further include&#xD;
      measurement of 17β-estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, sex-hormone binding globulin&#xD;
      (SHBG), blood cell count, creatinine, ALAT, ASAT, GGT, TSH, and FGF21. In control women and&#xD;
      transmen we will record whether menstrual cycle still persists. From each blood draw, serum&#xD;
      will be stored at -80°C for future analyses. In order of procedures performed during baseline&#xD;
      assessment, subjects will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of body composition: Fat mass and fat-free mass will be assessed using body&#xD;
           impedance analysis (BIA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of resting energy expenditure: Baseline indirect calorimetry using a&#xD;
           ventilated hood method will be performed in the fasted state resting energy expenditure&#xD;
           (REE) prior to hormone substitution therapy/no therapy. The measurement will take 30&#xD;
           min. In brief, a clear plastic hood will be placed over the participants head with a&#xD;
           soft collar around the neck to prevent any air leaks. The hood will be securely&#xD;
           ventilated with room air and over 30 min. constant fractions of gases flowing out of the&#xD;
           hood will be analyzed for carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations. Via measurement of&#xD;
           the respiratory quotient, calorimetric measurements will be performed during 5 min.&#xD;
           intervals and over a period of 30 min. the subject's mean REE will be estimated. Using&#xD;
           the ventilated hood method, adverse events are scarce and may include claustrophobia.&#xD;
           Thus, subjects suffering from claustrophobia will be exempt from this measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound of vessels and microperfusion: Ultrasound will be conducted to evaluate&#xD;
           arterial stiffening (abdominal aorta and carotid artery; regional aortic strain and&#xD;
           aortic impedance characteristics via LVOT doppler and aortic tonometry, GE Healthcare,&#xD;
           Vivid E9 system). Peripheral near-infrared spectroscopy combined with a vascular&#xD;
           occlusion test will be used to evaluate microperfusion (near-infrared spectroscopy,&#xD;
           Diaspective Vision, Tivita tissue).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ad libitum food intake: For breakfast, subjects will undergo an ad libitum food intake&#xD;
           situation in which they will be exposed to a buffet and asked to eat as much as they&#xD;
           want. The buffet addresses individual dietary retrains (e.g., vegan diet). Caloric and&#xD;
           macronutrient intake will be measured. Prior to and immediately after the buffet,&#xD;
           participants will rate their mood, hunger, and desire to eat on a 10 cm visual analogue&#xD;
           scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Snack Food Taste Test: For assessment of taste preferences and as an additional measure&#xD;
           of ad libitum food intake a snack food taste test will be performed. This test will be&#xD;
           administered within 30 min. after lunch. This will be a taste test where participants&#xD;
           will be asked to rate four types of food that will be placed in front of them in large&#xD;
           bowls: potato chips (70 g), peanuts (100 g), Oreo cookies (100 g), and M&amp;M's (100 g).&#xD;
           Participants will be asked to provide mood and appetite ratings. They will then be&#xD;
           instructed to consume as much or as little as they wish and to judge the taste of the&#xD;
           food products using the provided rating scales. The experimenter will then leave the&#xD;
           room and return 10 min. later, remove the bowls of food and administer a final rating&#xD;
           scale of mood and appetite. The bowls of food will be weighed before and after the taste&#xD;
           test as a measure of food and calorie intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Response to thermic stimuli: Via an electrode positioned below the base of the index&#xD;
           finger (C6) of the participant's non-dominant hand, thermic stimuli (cold versus warm)&#xD;
           will be administered and subjects will be asked to indicate cold/warmth perception.&#xD;
           Perception of cold will be measured four times in a row, followed by warmth perception.&#xD;
           Then thermal discomfort will be triggered via administration of one cold versus one warm&#xD;
           stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of taste perception and smell: Administration of standardized gustatory and&#xD;
           olfactory stimuli will enable the assessment of (non)specific taste perception and the&#xD;
           subject's ability to perceive certain scents. Taste perception will be assessed one at a&#xD;
           time by placing paper slip on the participant's tongue that had been coated with one&#xD;
           specific, known flavor. Similarly, the participant's ability to perceive certain scents&#xD;
           will be tested. In this case, specific, known scents will be placed in front of the nose&#xD;
           of the participant who will be asked to determine the scent and then asked to rate it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sex hormone deposition in hair: Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry,&#xD;
           deposition of sex hormones in hair will be measured (time points V2-V4). For this&#xD;
           purpose, a small amount of hair will be removed from the occipital region of the&#xD;
           subject's head and then analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit to our clinical outpatient unit (transgender subjects only): Based on our&#xD;
           unit-specific standards of care, subjects will receive a prescription for hormones&#xD;
           intended to induce transformation to the other sex (cyproterone acetate +&#xD;
           testosterone/estradiol) and advised to begin administration of their first dose of&#xD;
           medication on day 1 of our study. Patients will be advised to continue with treatment&#xD;
           according to our unit-specific standards of care for subjects with gender dysphoria&#xD;
           undergoing hormone substitution therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon baseline assessment, cross-sex hormone treatment versus no treatment will commence.&#xD;
      Study procedures for V2 through V5 are the same as the above mentioned.&#xD;
