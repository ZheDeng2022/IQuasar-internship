  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of Patient's Therapeutic&#xD;
      Education (PTE) in Adapted Physical Activity (APA) ans dietetic on the reduction of&#xD;
      interventions number on rectal volume (laxative or probe).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the contribution of Patient's Therapeutic Education&#xD;
      (PTE) between the 2 arms on repositionnind during the radiotherapy session, the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal toxicity, the need to use laxative or transit regulating treatment or&#xD;
      techniques, the quality of life, the undernutrition and food intake, the evolution in&#xD;
      eating/hydratation and physical habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the experimetal arm, the satisfaction and the compliance with PTE program will be&#xD;
      evaluated, as well as the need of additionnal use of dietary and APA consultations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the 3rd cause of cancer mortality in patient aged over 50 years.&#xD;
      Radiotherapy treatment plans require specific conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reproductibility of patient's positioning (requiring management of bladder and rectal&#xD;
           fillings at each session).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An image-guided treatment consisting in acquiring an image before each session. This&#xD;
           pre-treatment Imaging allows the optimal adjustment of the target volume and organs at&#xD;
           risk (bladder and rectum).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To allow reproductibility of target volume positioning at each radiotherapy session, it's&#xD;
      recommended to have an empty rectum at the time of the radiotherapy preparation scan, and to&#xD;
      check repletion before each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's recommended that the patient has a comfortably full bladder to limit the volume of&#xD;
      irradiated bladder mucosa. The radiotherapy teams don't have any recommendations concerning&#xD;
      the rectum and manage this problem session by session, according to the repositioning Imaging&#xD;
      of the current day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a pilot study carried out in 2017 in the radiotherapy department of the Léon&#xD;
      Bérard center, an intervention for a dilated rectum (probe or laxative) was necessary for an&#xD;
      average of 25% of session per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These rectal problems can be partly explained by the age (60-80 years) and sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle of patients with prostate cancer. Physical activities, adapted hydratation and&#xD;
      changes in eating habits are an integral part of the constipation and flatulence prevention.&#xD;
