  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-center randomized trail focused on tracheostomized patients with severe acquired brain&#xD;
      injury , comparing two different decannulation protocols:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. an assessment of readiness for decannulation that was based on suctioning frequency&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. an assessment that was based on tracheostomy capping&#xD;
