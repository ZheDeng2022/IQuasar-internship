  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to provide additional data regarding B and T-cell mediated&#xD;
      responses to COVID-19 vaccines in MS patients treated with OCR and to determine which&#xD;
      clinical and paraclinical variables correlating with vaccine immunogenicity. B-cell mediated&#xD;
      humoral responses and adaptive T-cell mediated cellular responses were measured in patients&#xD;
      treated with OCR who received any of the available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, 3-4 weeks after&#xD;
      completion of vaccination.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if patients on ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) produce a humoral&#xD;
      and T-cell response to the coronavirus vaccine. Ocrelizumab depletes B-lymphocytes and has&#xD;
      the potential to reduce the effectiveness of vaccines. The impact of ocrelizumab treatment on&#xD;
      coronavirus vaccines is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natalizumab (Tysabri) likely has a minimal impact the efficacy of vaccines. In this study the&#xD;
      investigators will take blood samples in patients being treated with either ocrelizumab or&#xD;
      natalizumab before and after vaccination with an FDA-authorized coronavirus (COVID-19)&#xD;
      vaccine and compare the antibody response in both groups.&#xD;
