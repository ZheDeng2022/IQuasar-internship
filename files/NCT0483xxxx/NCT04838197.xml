  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caregiver burden is the response to the emotional, financial, physical, psychological, and&#xD;
      social stressors associated with having to care for another family member. Previous studies&#xD;
      have looked at the impact of caregiver burden in caregivers caring for loved ones dealing&#xD;
      with long-term disease, such as dementia. The research has found that one in three caregivers&#xD;
      suffer from depression, and experience high levels of stress and anxiety. However, these&#xD;
      findings may not be relatable to the outpatient surgical setting. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to find out how various factors such as the physical, emotional, social, and financial&#xD;
      burden impact caregivers who are responsible for providing care to patients who are&#xD;
      undergoing same-day surgical procedures that are traditionally performed as inpatient&#xD;
      surgery. By understanding this potential burden on the caregiver, we hope that future&#xD;
      healthcare improvements can be made to minimize this impact on the patients and their&#xD;
      caregiver.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The extent of caregiver burden in the acute postoperative outpatient settings, immediately&#xD;
      following major orthopedic surgery that has traditionally been performed in an inpatient&#xD;
      setting, remains unknown. Care giving places a tremendous amount of physical and mental&#xD;
      stress onto the caregiver, which may result in the &quot;hidden patient&quot; in the caregiver. It is&#xD;
      expected that by 2026, 51% of TJA will be performed as outpatient procedures. Building on the&#xD;
      successes of the country's first outpatient TKA program at Women's College Hospital, and with&#xD;
      the expansion to include outpatient THA procedures, it is now important to understand whether&#xD;
      or not our innovative ambulatory model is simply transferring the burden of postoperative&#xD;
      care and recovery from nurses, doctors, and other hospital staff to family members, friends,&#xD;
      or privately-employed caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current state of literature, there is inadequate data examining caregiver burden when&#xD;
      traditional surgical procedures are shifted to an outpatient setting, therefore, a&#xD;
      comprehensive study is required to understand the various dimensions of caregiver burden.&#xD;
      Therefore, our research question is &quot;what are the most important factors that contribute to&#xD;
      the burden of care for caregivers of patients undergoing outpatient surgical procedures&#xD;
      traditionally performed as inpatients?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective cohort study examines how the various dimensions of caregiver burden impact&#xD;
      caregivers at different time points throughout the care giving experience. These dimensions&#xD;
      include factors such as the intensity of dependence on the caregiver, duration of care,&#xD;
      caregiver specific factors (e.g., the health literacy of the caregiver), and care giving&#xD;
      dimensions (e.g., physical, emotional, social and financial burdens). Through gaining an&#xD;
      understanding of how the various dimensions of caregiver burden impact caregivers in the&#xD;
      outpatient settings, meaningful improvements can be made in the future and ultimately improve&#xD;
      the quality of life of the caregiver during the time of care.&#xD;

    <description>To further measure anxiety and depression, caregivers will complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). HADS was designed to be a reliable, valid, and simple to use tool to identify and quantify anxiety and depression. Though the term 'hospital' in the title suggests it only valid in the hospital setting, many studies have confirmed the tools valid use in primary care medical and community settings. HADS is comprised of 14 items, 7 assessing anxiety and 7 assessing depression.</description>

    <description>This section will ask caregivers questions regarding the impact of caregiving on their emotional well-being. Caregivers will be asked if preparing for/caring for the patient has disrupted their emotional well-being (e.g., anxious, depressed, irritable, angry, etc.).Each item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 meaning no not at all, to 3 meaning yes definitely. The total score for each sub scale ranges from 0-21, where 0-7 indicates non-cases, 8-10 indicates mild cases, 11-14 indicates moderate cases, and 15-21 indicates cases of anxiety or depression.</description>

    <description>This section will ask caregivers questions regarding the impact of caregiving on their financial health. Caregivers will be asked if preparing for/caring for the patient has caused financial strain. Caregivers will be asked to identify how many days they expect to take off work to care for the patient, and how many days they actually took off work to care for the patient. Likewise, caregivers will be asked how much out of pocket they expect to spend on the patient during the caregiving experience, and then on post-operative 1 month they will be asked how much they actually spent on the patient during the caregiving experience.</description>

Caregivers will be asked: &quot;If you were given $1,000 to spend immediately to help ease the caregiving experience, how would you allocate your spending on the following factors?&quot; Caregivers will be able to allocate the money among the seven factors previously mentioned, with hopes that caregivers will be allocating the money to different factors that are contributing significantly to the caregiver burden at various time points.</description>
