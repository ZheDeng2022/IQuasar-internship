      To determine patient preference and treatment outcomes with an intracanalicular dexamethasone&#xD;
      (0.4mg) insert compared to a standard steroid drop regimen in the contralateral eye for the&#xD;
      treatment of ocular rosacea.&#xD;

      Prospective Open-label Interventional Study Randomized, self-controlled design in which one&#xD;
      eye receives Dextenza (Group A) intracanalicular insert and the contralateral eye receives&#xD;
      topical fluorometholone 0.1% BID (Group B) for 2 weeks then once daily for 2 weeks for the&#xD;
      treatment of ocular rosacea. All patients will be placed on oral doxycycline 100mg BID for&#xD;
      one month and tapered to a maintenance dose of 100mg once daily for the remainder of the&#xD;
      study. Patient evaluations will be performed at Screening/Baseline, Insertion Day, Month 1&#xD;
      and Month 2.&#xD;
