  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot randomized controlled trail aims to test the effects of AR enhanced pictorial&#xD;
      effects in harms of smoking and benefit of smoking cessation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conventional health warnings on smoking harms mostly include pictures showing smoking&#xD;
      consequences such as lung diseases, peripheral vascular diseases, aging, skin lesions, and&#xD;
      benefit of quitting such as improved cardiopulmonary functions, skin conditions and risk of&#xD;
      diseases, etc. The effects of the information are limited by the generic messages,&#xD;
      unattractive images, and lack of interaction. This proposal aims to enhance the &quot;Warn&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;Advice&quot; materials using mobile phone-based augmented reality (AR) technologies to provide&#xD;
      personalized, interactive, and attractive images to encourage smokers to quit smoking.&#xD;
