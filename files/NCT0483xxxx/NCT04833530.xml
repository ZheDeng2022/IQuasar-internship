  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary aspiration is one of the most serious risks of general anesthesia and has been&#xD;
      reported to occur in as many as 1 in 4000 cases of general anesthesia. Gastric ultrasound is&#xD;
      an emerging point-of-care tool that provides bedside information on gastric content and&#xD;
      volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been a few factors which are thought to increase gastric size. Delayed gastric&#xD;
      emptying such as caused by gastroparesis in Diabetes Mellitus is an example. Certain&#xD;
      surgeries also cause gastroparesis. Other preoperative factors including pain, preoperative&#xD;
      anxiety, and blood levels of estradiol or progesterone are less well studied.&#xD;

      Women will be recruited before undergoing the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon signed informed consent, women will be asked to rank their anxiety level on a scale of&#xD;
      0-10 (Verbal Numeric Anxiety Score). This scale has been used for previous studies to assess&#xD;
      anxiety (Orbach-Zinger, Danon)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room, a gastric ultrasound will be performed in the supine position and the&#xD;
      antral cross sectional area will be measured. This study is purely observational, the gastric&#xD;
      ultrasound assessment is non-invasive and will not cause any adverse effects or discomfort to&#xD;
      the patient. Participation in the study will not affect clinical management in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each one of the ultrasound assessments will be performed by one of the study's'&#xD;
      investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be induced in standard procedure and positive pressure will be instituted&#xD;
      according to the standard protocol accepted in our hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the procedure, the gastric ultrasound circumference will be measured again.&#xD;
