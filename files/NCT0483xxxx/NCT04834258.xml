    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomised and controlled study is to investigate the effects of walking&#xD;
      training combined with respiratory muscle training on pulmonary function, respiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength, and functional exercise capacity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although respiratory dysfunction has been recognized as a cause of morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), most of the patients were not aware of their&#xD;
      respiratory problems due to restriction in their activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory dysfunction in patients with PD has not been well characterized. However, there&#xD;
      are many studies showing restrictive or obstructive type respiratory disorders and decreased&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength in the literature. Ineffective cough due to decreased respiratory&#xD;
      muscle strength may cause to secretion retention and secondary infections in PD patients who&#xD;
      have severe symptoms. Therefore, the assessment and rehabilitation of these respiratory&#xD;
      problems is important in PD patients treatment. There are studies in the literature showing&#xD;
      that respiratory muscle training is effective in PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Walking difficulty is seen as a common problem in PD. Typically, walking is slow despite&#xD;
      adequate Levodopa therapy. It is known that exercise capacity may be affected by respiratory&#xD;
      impairment, walking difficulties and personal exercise habits in patients with PD.&#xD;
      Respiratory and walking problems lead to limitation of physical activity in PD, which leads&#xD;
      to a decrease in exercise capacity. In a recently published article reported that walking is&#xD;
      a good example of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although walking training is important for PD patients, there is no studies what happens to&#xD;
      pulmonary function and functional exercise capacity when walking training is combined with&#xD;
      respiratory muscle training in patients with Parkinson's disease. Therefore, this study&#xD;
      planned to investigate the effects of walking and respiratory muscle training on pulmonary&#xD;
      function and functional exercise capacity in PD.&#xD;

    <measure>Maximal Inspiratory mouth pressure (PImax) and Maximal Expiratory mouth pressure (PEmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline maximal inspiratory mouth pressure and maximal expiratory pressure at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum inspiratory pressure (PImax) is the classic volitional test for inspiratory muscle strength. It is measured as the highest mouth pressure (cmH2O) sustained for 1 s during a maximum inspiratory effort against a quasi occlusion. Assessment is carried out according to the Black and Hyatt technique.&#xD;
Maximum expiratory pressure (PEmax) is the classic volitional test for expiratory muscle strength. It is measured as the highest mouth pressure (cmH2O) sustained for 1 s during a maximum expiratory effort against a quasi occlusion. Assessment is carried out according to the Black and Hyatt technique.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline functional exercise capacity at week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Functional exercise capacity was measured with the 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. The 6 minutes walking distance (6MWD) was recorded in meters.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale - motor examination (UPDRS- III) of the scale assesses the motor signs of Parkinson's disease.All items must have an integer rating (no half points, no missing ratings). Specific instructions are provided for the testing of each item. The motor UPDRS consists of five-category ordinal items scored 0-4.The total motor UPDRS exam score ranges from 0 to 108. A higher scores indicating greater disability.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) measurement is a volitional noninvasive assessment of inspiratory muscle strength. A maximum of 10 sniffs is generally used. It is a simple procedure consisting of measuring peak nasal pressure (cmH2O) as a result of maximal sniff performance through from the end of expiration with the open nostril while the the other one is closed.</description>

    <description>Walking and respiratory muscle training group (W+ RMT) received walking training in addition to respiratory muscle training for a period of 8 weeks.&#xD;
Walking training was performed at least 5 days a week, twice a day, for 15 min. Walking distance was calculated according to patients' 6 minute walking distance.&#xD;
Respiratory muscle training was performed using the threshold loading method as inspiratory and expiratory muscle training. This training was applied at least 5 days per week, twice a day, 15 minutes each session. (15 minutes inspiratory muscle training + 15 minutes expiratory muscle training). A Threshold Inspiratory Muscle Trainer (IMT) and threshold positive expiratory pressure (Threshold PEP) were used for the training.&#xD;
Patients were called for the hospital once a week to asses mouth pressure and 6 minute walking test (6 MWT) and their training intensity was arranged.</description>
