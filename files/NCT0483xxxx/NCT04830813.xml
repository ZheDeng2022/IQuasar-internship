      Chiauranib , which simultaneously targets against VEGFR/Aurora B/CSF-1R, several key kinases&#xD;
      involved in tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell mitosis, and chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      microenvironment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chiauranib is a novel orally active multi-target inhibitor that simultaneously inhibits the&#xD;
      angiogenesis-related kinases (VEGFR2, VEGFR1, VEGFR3, PDGFRa and c-Kit), mitosis-related&#xD;
      kinase Aurora B and chronic inflammationrelated kinase CSF-1R in a high potency manner with&#xD;
      the IC50 at a single-digit nanomolar range. In particular, Chiauranib showed very high&#xD;
      selectivity in the kinase inhibition profile with little activity on off-target non-receptor&#xD;
      kinases, proteins, GPCR and ion channels, indicative of a better drug safety profile in terms&#xD;
      of clinical relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In July 2017, the sponsor initiated a phase Ib/II trial (CAR105). As of October 9, 2020, a&#xD;
      total of 42 subjects entered the safety analysis and 41 subjects entered the efficacy&#xD;
      analysis. The results of the phased trial analysis show the preliminary efficacy of this&#xD;
      product in the treatment of SCLC at ≥3 lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is studying the efficacy and safety of chiauranib works in treating&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer, in the meantime, exploreing the&#xD;
      latent biomarkers accompany with chiauranib, as well as the relevancy of which and clinical&#xD;
      benefit.&#xD;
