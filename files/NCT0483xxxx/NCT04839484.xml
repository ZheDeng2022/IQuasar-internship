    <textblock>
      The study will be a prospective, randomized, split-face, double blind, controlled, clinical&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Lumina™ for the treatment of Nasolabial&#xD;
      Folds (NLFs). Subjects will be randomized to receive treatment (Lumina™) in one NLF and&#xD;
      control (Restylane® Defyne) in the contra-lateral NLF. 118 subjects will be treated.&#xD;

             therapy such as Thermage, chemical re-surfacing, dermabrasion, Botox injections,&#xD;
             aesthetic facial surgery, other facial treatments in the NLFs.&#xD;
