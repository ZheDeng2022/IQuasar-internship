      In this study, the investigators examined the efficacy of heart rate variability biofeedback&#xD;
      on physical and mental health problems in childbirth women. The following validated&#xD;
      self-report measures were administered before and at five days after the intervention,&#xD;
      Perceived stress scale-10, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.&#xD;
