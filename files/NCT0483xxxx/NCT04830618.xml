  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective cohort study to investigate whether aberrant DNA methylation can&#xD;
      be useful for the prediction of metachronous recurrence after endoscopic resection of gastric&#xD;
      neoplasms (dysplasia or cancer). From 2012 to 2017, 300 patients were prospectively enrolled&#xD;
      after endoscopic resection (ER) of gastric dysplasia or early gastric cancer. All lesions&#xD;
      were assessed by endoscopy and biopsy before ER. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or&#xD;
      endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was performed for gastric dysplasia and early gastric&#xD;
      cancers which met the absolute indication (differentiated adenocarcinoma, intramucosal&#xD;
      cancer, lesions &lt; 20 mm, and no endoscopic evidence of ulceration). All lesions were&#xD;
      curatively resected; if non-curatively resected, the patients were not enrolled from the&#xD;
      study. All subjects, who provided informed consent, were asked to complete a questionnaire&#xD;
      under the supervision of a well-trained interviewer. The questionnaire included questions&#xD;
      regarding demographic data (age, sex), socioeconomic data (smoking, alcohol, and education),&#xD;
      their family history of GC in first-degree relatives, and history of H. pylori eradication&#xD;
      therapy. Also, MOS methylation level at baseline was measured from noncancerous gastric&#xD;
      mucosae at corpus. When H. pylori was positive by CLOtest or histology at baseline or during&#xD;
      the follow-up, eradication therapy was done. To evaluate whether H. pylori was eradicated,&#xD;
      13C-urea breath testing was performed at least 4 weeks after completion of the eradication&#xD;
      therapy. All study subjects were closely followed up since recurrent tumors at previous&#xD;
      endoscopic resection sites can be easily detected on endoscopy with biopsy and treated during&#xD;
      follow-up. Patients with local recurrence underwent further treatments, including repeated&#xD;
      ESD, APC, and gastrectomy based on pathology, and patients who refused treatment received&#xD;
      supportive care. All patients underwent endoscopy with biopsy within 6 months, then at 12&#xD;
      months after ESD to check for metachronous lesions or local recurrences. After 12 months,&#xD;
      endoscopy with biopsy was performed annually. In case of EGCs, abdominal CT scan was&#xD;
      performed in the first year and biennially thereafter to detect lymph node or distant&#xD;
      metastases. The definition of the completion of the study protocol was 1) endoscopic and/or&#xD;
      radiologic follow-up for more than 3 years, or 2) development of metachronous gastric&#xD;
      neoplasm (primary outcome: gastric dysplasia or cancer) during the follow-up. Metachronous&#xD;
      recurrence was defined as secondary dysplasia or cancers detected &gt; 1 year after initial&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
