      A multicentre, open-label, non-randomized, phase Ib neoadjuvant study of intravenous NG-641,&#xD;
      as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab, in patients with surgically resectable&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A (NG-641 monotherapy): Up to 18 patients will be dosed with intravenous NG-641.&#xD;
      Patients will then proceed to planned surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B (NG-641 and pembrolizumab): Up to 30 patients will be dosed with intravenous NG-641&#xD;
      before receiving a single dose of pembrolizumab. Patients will then proceed to planned&#xD;
      surgical resection.&#xD;

             penetrating tumour infiltration of major blood vessels, or other hollow organs&#xD;
             potentially at risk of perforation)&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
             or the Medical Monitor, may increase the risk associated with study participation or&#xD;
             study treatment administration, impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol&#xD;
             therapy or interfere with the interpretation of study results&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Previous treatment with any other enadenotucirev-based therapy, or fibroblast&#xD;
             activation protein (FAP) targeting agent&#xD;

             monoclonal antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Any other medical or psychological condition that would affect the patient's ability&#xD;
             to comply with all visits and assessments, or compromise ability to give informed&#xD;
             consent&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Related to or a dependent of the site staff, or a member of the site staff&#xD;
