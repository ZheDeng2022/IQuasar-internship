  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to study the efficacy of IV OsrHSA or positive control HSA (10 g and 20&#xD;
      g IV everyday) for 14 days. After a screening period of up to 14 days, the eligible subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to OsrHSA and positive control HSA, respectively, in each&#xD;
      cohort. Each enrolled subject will receive multiple assigned doses of OsrHSA. The&#xD;
      Investigator and subjects will be blind to treatment assignment (OsrHSA or positive control&#xD;
      HSA) in each cohort. During the study, subjects will be evaluated for efficacy, safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and immunogenicity. In each cohort, subjects will be stratified by baseline&#xD;
      serum albumin level. If serum albumin reaches 35 g/L or more, the study drug or control drug&#xD;
      administration may be terminated early. Subjects will have 3 follow-up visits in 2 weeks.&#xD;
