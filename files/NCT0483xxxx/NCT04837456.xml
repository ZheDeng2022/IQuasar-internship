      The aim is to determine the outcomes of calorie-restricted diet and exercise intervention;&#xD;
      libitum diet and waiting list control; early arthroscopic partial meniscectomy(APM) or&#xD;
      delayed APM effect on MetS patients with Degenerate menisucus lesions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators recruited 180 patients with Metabolic Syndrome and knee symptoms with&#xD;
      degenerate meniscus lesions by MRI from orthopaedics department from June 2017 to March 2020&#xD;
      at First Affiliated Hospital of Jinzhou Medical University. Participants were diagnosed with&#xD;
      MetS and degenerate meniscus tear with a mild or no osteoarthritis KL&lt;2 verified by X ray.&#xD;
      Participants were randomly dividied into calorie-restricted diet and exercise intervention&#xD;
      group; libitum diet and waiting list control group; early APM (syndrome within 3-6 months)&#xD;
      group or a delayed APM(syndrome more than 6 months) group as a computer sequenced number. The&#xD;
      primary outcome was the change in metabolic syndrome components and knee function score of&#xD;
      WOMAC, KOOS,WOMET,IKDC were determined by two fixed orthopadic surgeons who were blinded to&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Knee KOOS4</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) holds five subscales: (1) Pain (9 items); (2) other Symptoms (7 items); (3) Activities of Daily Living (ADL, 17 items); (4) Sport and Recreation function (Sport/Rec, 5 items); and (5) knee-related Quality of Life (QoL, 4 items). Each subscale is scored separately from zero (extreme knee problems) to 100 (no knee problems) life (KOOs 4 ) were assessed.One of the most frequently-used knee-specific PROMs is the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) which was developed for adults who have knee OA or knee injuries.KOOS holds five subscales: (1) Pain (9 items); (2) other Symptoms (7 items); (3) Activities of Daily Living (ADL, 17 items); (4) Sport and Recreation function (Sport/Rec, 5 items); and (5) knee-related Quality of Life (QoL, 4 items). Each subscale is scored separately from zero (extreme knee problems) to 100 (no knee problems)</description>

    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>the WOMAC score is a disease-specific self-report multidimensional questionnare assesing pain, siffness, and physical functional disability.WOMAC scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating worse physical function.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation Form (IKDC).</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The IKDC is a questionnaire that has high reliability and validity for patients with a meniscal tear. The questionnaire contains 18 items scored in 1 of 3 ways: 11-point Likert scale, 5-point Likert scale, or dichotomous yes or no. After the participant completes the questionnaire, the scores are summed, and the total score is transformed to a value on a scale of 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest knee function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The WOMET score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMET is a meniscus-specific health-related quality-of-life instrument, validated especially for patients with a degenerative meniscal tear.The Western Ontario Meniscal Evaluation Tool (WOMET) contains 16 items addressing three domains: 9 items ad-dressing physical symptoms; 4 items addressing disabilities with regard to sports, recreation, work, and lifestyle; and 3 items addressing emotions. The score indicates the percentage of a normal score; therefore, 100 is the best possi- ble score, and 0 is the worst possible score.</description>

Participants were guided by a dietitian for adjustments of their caloric intake weekly for six months.Participants performed 1 or 2 sets at a resistance of approximately 65% of their one-repetition maximum, with 8 to 12 repetitions of each exercise; they gradually increased the intensity to 2 to 3 sets at a resistance of approximately 80% of their one-repetition maximum, with 6 to 8 repetitions of each exercise.</description>
