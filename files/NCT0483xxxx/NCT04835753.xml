  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind randomized controlled study was carried out on 34 children (19 boys and 15&#xD;
      girls) in the age ranged from 7 to 9 years old with spastic hemiplegia were randomly&#xD;
      allocated to one of two groups: control or study group. The two groups received traditional&#xD;
      therapeutic exercises for 12 weeks. Additionally, study group received rESW (one&#xD;
      session/week) on gastrocnemius and soleus muscles (1500 shots/muscle, frequency of 4Hz,&#xD;
      energy of 0.030 mJ/mm2). All children were evaluated at baseline, and after 12 weeks by&#xD;
      Modified Ashworth Scale, Biodex system 4 isokinetic dynamometer, Gross Motor Function Measure&#xD;
      (GMFM-88), dimensions &quot;D&quot; standing and &quot;E&quot; walking, Trost Selective Motor Control Test, and&#xD;
      Single Leg Standing Test.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both groups underwent conventional physical therapy program which included muscle stretching,&#xD;
      strengthening exercises, neurodevelopmental techniques, proprioceptive training, and balance&#xD;
      and gait training for three months (3 days/week ,1 hour/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group Subjects in this group received the traditional physical therapy treatment plus&#xD;
      true radial ESWT.A rESW pneumatic device (SHOCK MED, Italy) was used to provide one session&#xD;
      per week (for a total of 12-week) of shock wave intervention. The pressure pulses were&#xD;
      focused on the muscle belly of the planter flexor hypertonic muscles. Standard ultrasonic gel&#xD;
      was used as a contact medium. A total of 1500 shots with a pressure of 1.5 bar and an energy&#xD;
      flux density (EFD) of 0.030 mJ/mm2 were applied with the repetition frequency of shock wave&#xD;
      irradiation of 4 pulses per second (Hz). The rESW session lasted about 6 minutes and was&#xD;
      painless; thus, local anesthesia was not required.&#xD;

    <measure>Single Leg Standing Test (SLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SLS is a simple and effective test to assess static balance. It is conducted by measuring the time that a child can maintain balance by lifting the foot according to the signal &quot;Start.&quot; The average of three measures was used.</description>
