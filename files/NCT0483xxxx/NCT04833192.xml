  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in&#xD;
      subclinical hypercortisolism&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the past few years, with the widespread use of chest and abdominal imaging, the prevalence&#xD;
      of adrenal incidentaloma (AIs) has been increasing and now approaches the 8.7% incidence&#xD;
      reported in autopsy series. subclinical hypercortisolism (SH) is noted in up to 30% of&#xD;
      patients with adrenal incidentalomas. Several groups have reported adverse clinical sequelae&#xD;
      in individuals with SH, with recent studies highlighting an increase in cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality compared to the general population. Accurate exclusion or&#xD;
      confirmation of a diagnosis of SH is therefore a key step in the investigation and management&#xD;
      of patients with AIs. Suppressed adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and low&#xD;
      dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels are frequently found in SH patients. Present&#xD;
      study added new evidence for the limitations of ACTH and confirmed the usefulness of DHEAS&#xD;
      for the detection of SH especially with unsuppressed ACTH in AI patients. On one hand, in the&#xD;
      cross-sectional study, biometric measurements and sex hormones (including DHEAS, 24h-UFC,&#xD;
      ACTH and cortisol) are analysed to explore the differences among SH patients, and&#xD;
      nonfunctional adrenal adenoma patients. One the other hand, in the longitudinal study,&#xD;
      changes in DHEAS, ACTH and cortisol in SH with surgical management and SH with conservative&#xD;
      management both at baseline and different follow-up months after their different treatment&#xD;
      management are collected to explore the changes of DHEAS and ACTH of SH patients.&#xD;
