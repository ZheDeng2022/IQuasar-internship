  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 38 adults ages 18-65 with a transtibial amputation with mature residual&#xD;
      limbs who are ambulatory prosthesis users with active skin problems. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to either treatment with low dose volar fibroblast injections (n=19) or to a&#xD;
      vehicle control (n=19). Participants will undergo biopsy to harvest volar skin for fibroblast&#xD;
      expansion and tattooing to identify injection sites on the stump. Fibroblasts will be&#xD;
      processed at the Hopkins Cellular Therapy Core Lab and volar cells primed for injection will&#xD;
      be sent to participating centers for administration. Participants will be treated with low&#xD;
      dose cells with Bellafill to enhance engraftment. Injections will be administered on at least&#xD;
      2 and up to three separate days over the course of one week. Injections will be administered&#xD;
      to the affected area. Participants randomized to the vehicle control group will receive&#xD;
      injection of cryoprotectant. All participants will be followed at 2 weeks, 1, 2 and 3 months&#xD;
      after the last injection. These visits will include a clinical evaluation for complications,&#xD;
      non-invasive assessments of wound size, skin firmness and thickness, wound recurrence and&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes. After the final monitoring visit, individuals randomized to the&#xD;
      control group will have the opportunity to receive the volar fibroblast injections and will&#xD;
      be followed for an additional 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that (1) There will be no difference in the rate of serious&#xD;
      adverse events among patients treated with volar fibroblast injections compared with patients&#xD;
      treated with vehicle control, and (2) The rate of wound healing will be faster in patients&#xD;
      treated with volar fibroblast injections compares with patients tread with vehicle control.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 months from the injection visit</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be evaluated by routinely assessing all complications at each study visit and during readmission to the hospital for treatment of a residual limb issue.&#xD;
Minor and expected complications may include local injection reactions like bruising and erythema, swelling and pain.&#xD;
Minor complications that are not expected include local small hemorrhage (x&lt;1mL), edema, nodules, papules, irritation, dermatitis, pruritus, and cellulitis.&#xD;
Serious Adverse Events are defined as unexpected AND serious AND related or possibly related to the study treatment. These may include but are not limited to osteomyelitis.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of Volar Fibroblast injection on wound healing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 3 months from the injection visit</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy will be determined by wound healing size in cm^2. A photo of the wound with a ruler in view will be taken at baseline (prior to injection), and at 2 weeks, 1-, 2-, and 3-months following injection by trained research staff. Wound healing size will be measured centrally by study team members at Johns Hopkins blinded to study treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Skin firmness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 3 months from the injection visit</time_frame>
    <description>Skin Firmness will be measured using a non-invasive hand-held durometer. The durometer is a non-invasive instrument utilized to assess skin firmness in Durometer Units (DU) as an output of resistance. Measures will be taken by gently placing the durometer on the skin surrounding the treated area. Measures will be taken at baseline (prior to injection), and at 2 weeks, 1, 2, and 3 months following injection by trained research staff.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Skin thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 3 months from the injection visit</time_frame>
    <description>Skin thickness will be measured using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). OCT is a non-invasive means of capturing images of superficial layers of the human skin. Measures will be taken by imaging the skin surrounding the treated areas. Images will be taken at baseline (prior to injection) and at 2 weeks, 1, 2, and 3 months following injection by trained research staff.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Wound recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months from the injection visit</time_frame>
    <description>Wound Recurrence will be assessed at 2 weeks, 1, 2, and 3 months following injection by the treating clinician and defined as the number of new skin problems arising in the area(s) of injection.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Participant reported health care utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months from the injection visit</time_frame>
