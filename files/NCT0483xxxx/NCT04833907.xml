  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Canavan Disease is a congenital white matter disorder caused by mutations to the gene&#xD;
      encoding for aspartoacylase (ASPA). Expression of ASPA is restricted to oligodendrocytes, the&#xD;
      sole white matter producing lineage in the brain. ASPA supports developmental myelination in&#xD;
      the capacity of its sole known function, namely, the catabolism of N-acetylaspartate (NAA).&#xD;
      Inherited mutations that result in loss of ASPA catabolic activity result in a typically&#xD;
      severe phenotype characterized by chronically elevated brain NAA, gross motor abnormalities,&#xD;
      hypomyelination, progressive spongiform degeneration of the brain, epilepsy, blindness and a&#xD;
      short life expectancy. Disease severity is correlated with residual levels of enzyme&#xD;
      activity. Reconstitution of ASPA function in oligodendrocytes of the brains of Canavan&#xD;
      patients is expected to rescue NAA metabolism in its natural cellular compartment and support&#xD;
      myelination/remyelination by resident white matter producing cells. This protocol directly&#xD;
      targets oligodendrocytes in the brain, which are intimately involved with disease initiation&#xD;
      and progression. Targeting oligodendrocytes offers the safest and most direct therapy for&#xD;
      affected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latest generation AAV viral vector (rAAV-Olig001-ASPA) will be administered to patients&#xD;
      using a minimally invasive neurosurgical procedure which involves direct administration of&#xD;
      gene therapy to affected regions of the brain. Outcome measures for the open label clinical&#xD;
      trial include longitudinal clinical assessments and brain imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no effective treatment for Canavan Disease. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to validate a new technology targeted to the cells most affected by Canavan Disease in the&#xD;
      safest way possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators are committed to supporting the Rare Disease &amp; Canavan Disease&#xD;
      Communities. For more information, please contact Jordana Holovach, Head of Communications&#xD;
      and Community at PatientAdvocacy@myrtellegtx.com.&#xD;

      rAAV-Olig001-ASPA is the first gene therapy designed to target the oligodendrocytes, which&#xD;
      are critical for myelination and brain development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Phase 1/2 First-In-Human protocol designed to obtain safety,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics, and efficacy data following neurosurgical administration of a single dose&#xD;
      of rAAV-Olig001-ASPA delivered intracerebroventricularly in up to 24 children with Canavan&#xD;
      Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a diagnosis of typical Canavan Disease who meet all eligibility criteria may be&#xD;
      enrolled in this open-label, sequential cohort study of a single dose of rAAV-Olig001-ASPA.&#xD;
