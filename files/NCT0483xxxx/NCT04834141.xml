  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of balanced posture and postural changes have been evaluated in specific&#xD;
      populations with different factors that can affect body postures and balance, such as age,&#xD;
      musculoskeletal system, and other metabolic diseases. Studies on postural kyphosis and&#xD;
      balance involvement are very few in the literature especially in the health population. Of&#xD;
      the few studies that have evaluated kyphosis and balance, most are limited by small sample&#xD;
      size and the exclusion of men. Many have focused primarily on the geriatric population. The&#xD;
      determination that the effect of thoracic kyphosis posture on trunk biomechanical alignment&#xD;
      may be related to balance may contribute to new treatment recommendations in this area. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to investigate whether the thoracic kyphosis posture has an effect on&#xD;
      static balance.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kyphosis is roughly a slight forward curvature of the spine. A slight kyphosis or posterior&#xD;
      curvature is normal throughout the human body and is present in every individual.&#xD;
      Hyperkyphotic is a kyphotic angle greater than 40° commonly measured on a lateral X-ray&#xD;
      measured by the Cobb method between C7 and T12. Postural stability or balance is the ability&#xD;
      to keep the center of mass within the boundaries of the support base. Moving the center of&#xD;
      mass beyond the boundaries of the support base may cause postural instability and loss of&#xD;
      balance. There are studies showing that kyphotic posture affects the center of gravity and&#xD;
      affects fall in the elderly, but there are limited studies on the effect of balance in young&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Aim of This Study Is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the correlation between the balance and severity of thoracic kyphosis will be&#xD;
      investigated&#xD;

    <description>Kyphosis angle will be measured by felxicurve ruler, normally kyphosis angle below 40 degrees recognized as normal. For participants with kyphosis angle above 40 degrees recognized as hyperkyphotic posture. FlexiCurve ruler method is valid and reliable to the gold standard.</description>

The system compare the values reported for participants assessment then compare them to pre-recorded data base. The values of the test is assessed according to the percentage to the normal (average) values matched with the age group and gender. Above 80% determined as normal, and below this value determine balance disturbance.</description>

        Fourty-six subjects who joined the study were healthy without any disease might affect&#xD;
        balance, body posture, and denied a past history of vestibular disorders, syncope,&#xD;
        seizures, or neurological disorders such as stroke or Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The study take place in Marmara university, Başıbüyük campus, between the period September&#xD;
        2020 to December 2020. Participants were recruited through online poster announcement, they&#xD;
        directly contacted the primary investigator for booking an appointment. An appointment were&#xD;
        made for the participants in the Faculty of Health Sciences, Physiotherapy and&#xD;
        Rehabilitation Department, Biomechanics and Performance Analysis Laboratory, Marmara&#xD;
