  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system&#xD;
      characterized by myelin, oligodendrocyte, and axon damage. MS usually begins with attacks due&#xD;
      to demyelination of axons in the brain, optic nerve, and spinal cord; over time it develops&#xD;
      into a neurodegenerative disease associated with neurotrophic support deficiency and neuronal&#xD;
      loss. In MS, various loss of strength, balance, fatigue, cognitive and gait disturbances&#xD;
      arise in the central nervous system due to sensory and/or motor neuron degeneration. These&#xD;
      disorders affect the quality of life by limiting the individual's activities and&#xD;
      participation in their daily lives. Therefore, it is important to treat these disorders in&#xD;
      the treatment of MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are various pharmacological treatments and invasive procedures for the management of MS&#xD;
      symptoms and one of the most commonly used treatment options is rehabilitation.&#xD;
      Clinically-based exercise and rehabilitation are some of the most beneficial rehabilitation&#xD;
      strategies in people with MS (PwMS). Clinically-based exercise and rehabilitation have been&#xD;
      shown to stabilize or improve many physical symptoms of MS including loss of strength,&#xD;
      balance dysfunction, impaired mobility, and fatigue. These benefits have led many&#xD;
      practitioners to consider physical exercise as a nonpharmaceutical disease-modifying&#xD;
      treatment. However, due to various factors such as mobility disorders, fatigue, and related&#xD;
      problems, geographic location, time constraints, transportation difficulties, health&#xD;
      insurance coverage, and financial burden, clinical-based exercise may be problematic in some&#xD;
      pwMS. To overcome these challenges, approaches to rehabilitation have been developed such as&#xD;
      telerehabilitation. The telerehabilitation system provides benefits such as continuity in&#xD;
      patient education and rehabilitation, showing progress in rehabilitation, making changes in&#xD;
      the treatment program, and saving individuals time and financial expenses. It is also an&#xD;
      innovative and potential alternative to face-to-face interventions for treating&#xD;
      disease-related disorders in pwMS. In literature, there are many studies examining the&#xD;
      effectiveness of telerehabilitation in pwMS. According to these studies, Ä±t has been shown&#xD;
      that telerehabilitation, with its technical facilities, had the potential to make clinical&#xD;
      interventions widely accessible and effective for MS, however, telerehabilitation-based&#xD;
      interventions could not replace traditional interventions but could perfectly complement. It&#xD;
      has been found that telerehabilitation improved balance and postural control in MS patients&#xD;
      and had no side effects. However, it was emphasized that the evidence levels of the studies&#xD;
      were insufficient for methodological reasons. It has been determined additional studies are&#xD;
      needed to investigate examining the effect on walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another clinical-based exercise method is Pilates. Pilates is a &quot;core&quot; stability-based&#xD;
      exercise method that includes endurance, flexibility, movement, posture, and respiratory&#xD;
      control. Studies have shown that Pilates training can improve balance, mobility, and muscle&#xD;
      strength, fatigue in pwMS due to its structure consisting of balance and strengthening&#xD;
      exercises. When the literature is reviewed in terms of Telerehabilitation based on Pilates in&#xD;
      pwMS, it is seen that there are only two studies. In both studies, pwMS were given 20 minutes&#xD;
      of yoga, 20 minutes of Pilates, and 20 minutes of dual-task exercise. However, these studies&#xD;
      were in the project phase and the results are still not reported. On the other hand, in both&#xD;
      studies, Pilates is given as combined training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, telerehabilitation is an alternative method to MS treatment. In addition, while&#xD;
      there are many clinical-based Pilates studies in the literature, telerehabilitation-based&#xD;
      Pilates studies are insufficient. Telerehabilitation-based Pilates training studies are&#xD;
      needed. Therefore, the investigators planned this study to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      telerehabilitation-based pilates training on physical performance and quality of life in&#xD;
      pwMS.&#xD;

      This study is planned as a randomized control trial. Patients will be randomly divided into&#xD;
      two groups as intervention and control. The intervention group will be received&#xD;
      telerehabilitation-based pilates training three times a week for six weeks.&#xD;
      Telerehabilitation-based pilates will be provided via videoconferencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first session will be the introduction session, patients will be informed about basic&#xD;
      principles of Pilates and it will be included teaching inward movement of the lower abdominal&#xD;
      wall and supine exercises of segmental movements involving trunk muscle recruitment to&#xD;
      maintain a neutral posture. Afterward the session, a typical session will be included supine,&#xD;
      side-lying, quadruped exercise, sitting on the exercise ball, and standing exercises.&#xD;
      Exercises will be included thoracic extension, general abdominal strengthening, core&#xD;
      stabilization exercises for the deep abdominal muscles. The difficulty of these exercises&#xD;
      will be gradually increased and focused on keeping neutral positions of the spine in&#xD;
      different gravity orientations. The control group will be a wait-list group without any&#xD;
      additional specific treatment. All assessments will be done before and after the 6-week&#xD;
      intervention program or waiting period. The demographic characteristics of the participants&#xD;
      initially will be taken and the Expanded Disability Status Scale score of those of MS will be&#xD;
      recorded. Primary outcomes are balance, gait, core endurance and power, and muscle strength;&#xD;
      secondary outcomes are physical activity, fatigue, and quality of life&#xD;
