      Enrolled subjects will be randomized to 2 treatment groups: &quot;Right side treated&quot; and &quot;Left&#xD;
      side treated&quot;. All subjects will receive three, single-sided injections of Sculptra&#xD;
      Aesthetic, performed 1 month apart. Treatments will be provided to one side randomly assigned&#xD;
      to either &quot;right side&quot; or &quot;left side&quot;. The non-treatment side will receive bacteriostatic&#xD;
      water, injected in the same manner as Sculptra Aesthetic. Up to four (4) vials of Sculptra&#xD;
      Aesthetic, diluted at 16 mL, will be used per treatment session.&#xD;
