      Feasibility Study Informed consent will be obtained using an IRB-approved form. The first 12&#xD;
      consenting patients will be placed in the planned assessment group for feasibility and will&#xD;
      not be randomized. These participants will undergo visits and blood draw collection at 3&#xD;
      months. They will be informed of their SomaSignal Test results at baseline and 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommendations for any medical management changes will be made based on an understanding of&#xD;
      those results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized Study The succeeding 200 participants will be randomized using permuted mixed&#xD;
      block randomization, in a 2:1 ratio, i.e., 2 participants to Group 1 (informed of their test&#xD;
      results) and 1 participant to Group 2 (uninformed of their test results). At enrollment, and&#xD;
      for 6 months thereafter, clinical information will be obtained from each participant's&#xD;
      medical records, and/or directly from the participant during procedures, treatments,&#xD;
      study-specific visits, and/or follow-up visits. Data collected for the study will have data&#xD;
      linkage at SomaLogic, Inc., where data analysis will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and 6-months (+30 days) post-enrollment, patients will undergo a patient visit&#xD;
      and blood collection. Blood will be collected as a stand-alone sample collection, or when&#xD;
      other ordered lab work is done, or from access lines inserted during a usual or specialized&#xD;
      care. Samples will be sent to the Intermountain Central laboratory for clinical testing. A&#xD;
      sample will also be processed and shipped to SomaLogic, Inc. for analysis at baseline and 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the informed arm, the SomaSignal Test reports will be provided at the time they are&#xD;
      available (2 to 4 weeks after the blood draw). Any recommended changes in medical management&#xD;
      will be recorded in the case report forms and will be verified by the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the uninformed arm, the SomaSignal Test results will not be provided to the study team&#xD;
      until after the 6-month post-test visit. Adjustments, if any, would be made to the&#xD;
      participant's management at that time.&#xD;

Patients will receive a point for each change made. Documentation will be made on whether the change was made because of the SomaSignal results, a side-effect or a request by the patient, or a non-SomaSignal test related reason. The total number of changes at baseline and 6-months will be computed for each patient and will be compared between the arms.</description>

    <description>SomaLogic, Inc. translates patterns from 5000 protein measurements made in thousands of participants in clinical trials into validated models (SomaSignal Tests) that predict important health outcomes or correlate with established health measures. SomaLogic, Inc. has developed these protein-based tests for the detection, subtyping and prognosis of heart disease and related medical, physiological and behavioral conditions. These tests are demonstrated in large retrospective studies to provide information superior to best available alternatives.</description>
