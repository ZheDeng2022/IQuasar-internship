  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to test the efficacy of a systematic intervention for individual&#xD;
      follow-up of caregivers at the intensive care unit during a 12 month randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Caregivers of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) often experience the&#xD;
      situation as traumatic and stressful. Long term consequences such as fatigue, anxiety,&#xD;
      depression and symptoms of post-traumatic stress are reported among 30-50 percent of the&#xD;
      caregivers of critically ill patients. The need for supportive interventions is called for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this project is to improve the support for caregivers of intensive care&#xD;
      patients. A systematic intervention for individual support of caregivers, The Caregiver&#xD;
      Pathway Intervention, has been developed with a multidisciplinary approach, based on existing&#xD;
      evidence, through interviews with former caregivers, workshops with health care personnel and&#xD;
      user input and testing. The intervention consist of mapping of caregivers' prioritized&#xD;
      symptoms, needs and preferences with a digital assessment tool, followed by a meeting with a&#xD;
      nurse to address these issues, a structured conversation at discharge, and an invitation to a&#xD;
      follow-up conversation 4-6 weeks after discharge/patients death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to test the efficacy of The Caregiver Pathway Intervention among&#xD;
      caregivers at the ICU in a randomized controlled trial, using outcome measures such as&#xD;
      symptoms of post-traumatic stress, anxiety/depression, cost-utility measures and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life. The participants will be randomly assigned to The Caregiver&#xD;
      Pathway Intervention or the follow-up as usual group. Both groups will receive outcome&#xD;
      measures at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
