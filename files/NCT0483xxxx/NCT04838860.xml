      Phase 2 study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of administering&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two-stage, Phase 2 study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      efficacy of administering increased siltuximab doses to patients with iMCD who progressed&#xD;
      with elevated and rising serum C reactive protein (CRP) levels after prior treatment with&#xD;
      siltuximab 11 mg/kg every 3 weeks (q3w) without unacceptable toxicity, and is primarily&#xD;
      designed to leverage opportunities for intrapatient dose escalation with available clinical,&#xD;
      nonclinical, and PK justification as a means to restore or enable disease control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolling in Stage 1a and Stage 1b of this study in parallel will be up to 6 patients each&#xD;
      with siltuximab-relapsed or refractory IL-6-driven iMCD and TAFRO-iMCD patients,&#xD;
      respectively, who will undergo intrapatient dose escalation of siltuximab beginning with 22&#xD;
      mg/kg q3w, then possibly dose escalating to 33 mg/kg q3w then 44 mg/kg q3w if clinically&#xD;
      indicated in the absence of DLT. The justifications for escalating siltuximab doses up to 44&#xD;
      mg/kg q3w will be based on intrapatient dose escalation and DLT assessments as described&#xD;
      below.&#xD;
