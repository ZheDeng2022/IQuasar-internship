  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal use and addiction to opioids has resulted in an unprecedented rise in drug&#xD;
      withdrawal complications in newborns known as neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS),&#xD;
      also referred to as neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Between 2004 and 2016, NOWS&#xD;
      admissions increased more than fourfold with an average hospital stay nearly 3.2 times longer&#xD;
      (15.9 hospital days compared with 4.98) than for a non-NOWS patient resulting in a surge in&#xD;
      annual costs to almost $573 million with 83% attributed to state Medicaid programs. While&#xD;
      there is no accepted standard for treating NAS, non-pharmacological bundles are recommended,&#xD;
      as an initial course of treatment moving to pharmacological care when required.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, non-pharmacological care (swaddling, rocking, frequent feedings, and skin&#xD;
      contact) require significant use of human resources. To reduce the increasing burden on&#xD;
      limited resources, the evidence emerges that hospitals are trying to adapt baby products for&#xD;
      consumers that were neither intended nor tested for use in NAS infants as part of their&#xD;
      non-pharmacological bundle. The objective of this application is to establish the safety,&#xD;
      efficacy, and acceptability of our hospital bassinet pad with stochastic vibrotactile&#xD;
      stimulation (SVS) technology as an adjunctive, non-pharmacological treatment to improve the&#xD;
      care of infants with NOWS. To accomplish the objective, the investigators plan to execute the&#xD;
      following specific aims; 1) determine the efficacy of the SVS hospital bassinet pad, 2)&#xD;
      demonstrate the safety of the SVS hospital bassinet pad, and 3) assess acceptability of the&#xD;
      device with clinical staff and parents caring for infants with NOWS. The successful&#xD;
      completion of the project will provide data to support FDA clearance for commercialization of&#xD;
      this low-cost, non-pharmacological device to improve the clinical course of newborns with&#xD;
      NOWS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In preliminary work using a research grade device, the investigators tested stochastic&#xD;
      vibrotactile stimulation (SVS) in infants with NOWS. Twenty six full term infants who were&#xD;
      opioid exposed, as determined by meconium drug screening tests and/or maternal self-report,&#xD;
      were studied. Infants were excluded if any of the following characteristics were present:&#xD;
      congenital abnormality, anatomic brain abnormality, hydrocephalus, intraventricular&#xD;
      hemorrhage &gt; grade 2, seizure disorder not related to withdrawal, significant cardiac shunt,&#xD;
      anemia and/or infection. Using a single session, within-subject design characteristics were&#xD;
      compared during periods on and off SVS. Movement, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature&#xD;
      and oxygen saturation were quantified by continuous physiologic measurement. Infants were&#xD;
      between 38.3 and 44.7 weeks at the time of study. This novel work demonstrated that SVS&#xD;
      reduced prolonged movement activity and improved cardiorespiratory function in the&#xD;
      opioid-exposed neonates with 35% reduction in movement and significant reductions in&#xD;
      tachypnea and tachycardia. There were no noted adverse effects; specifically no alterations&#xD;
      in temperature control or oxygen saturation. Parents and nurses reported that infants seemed&#xD;
      less irritable, calmer, and slept better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: To determine the efficacy of the Prapela SVS device in preventing the need&#xD;
      for pharmacologic treatment in term infants ≥37 weeks gestation with prenatal opioid&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1A. The use of the Prapela SVS device will reduce the need for pharmacologic treatment for&#xD;
      NOWS by 22.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1B. The Prapela SVS device will reduce periods of cries characterized as fussy and pain in&#xD;
      the two study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 1A. Study Intervention and Timing: Parents of infants at risk for NOWS will be approached&#xD;
      for consent within the first 24 hours after birth prior to manifestation of withdrawal&#xD;
      symptoms. After informed written consent is obtained the study procedures will be initiated.&#xD;
      SVS will be delivered with a specially-constructed mattress developed during Phase I of the&#xD;
      SBIR that delivers gentle, random, low-level stimulation (30-60 Hz, 10-12 micrometers RMS) in&#xD;
      continuously. SVS will be added to existing non-pharmacologic care within the first 24 hours&#xD;
      of birth until day 5 or until pharmacologic treatment is initiated. The rationale for the&#xD;
      selection of this experimental window are: 1. Majority of infants do not start manifesting&#xD;
      signs of NOWS prior to 24hours of life. 2. Most infants who require treatment with opioids&#xD;
      for severe withdrawal typically begin treatment on day 3 to 5 of life. 3. To test the&#xD;
      efficacy of the SVS device, we seek to study the infant who has not yet manifested signs of&#xD;
      NOWS and determine if it is safe and effective in preventing the need for pharmacotherapy.&#xD;
      All infants enrolled will remain on the SVS mattress throughout the first 5 days of life or&#xD;
      until pharmacologic treatment is started except for periods of care and feeding. The use of&#xD;
      infant swings or other motion devices will be prohibited once enrolled in the study. Two&#xD;
      thirds (80 infants) will be randomized to receive the SVS mattress and one-third (40 infants)&#xD;
      will receive standard care only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. B Maternal and infant clinical characteristics: Clinical characteristics of the mother and&#xD;
      infant will be abstracted from the medical record by a trained research coordinator using&#xD;
      standardized definitions. Modified Finnegan scores or Eat, Sleep and Console (ESC) score will&#xD;
      be abstracted from the medical record and summed over each 24 hour period. The nursing team&#xD;
      providing clinical care to these infants are trained in using both the scoring tools.&#xD;
      Caregiver's assessment of infant state will be recorded every 6 hours in a bedside diary.&#xD;
      Missing data will be explicitly noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1C. Environmental and physiological measurements: Analyses of Cry Characteristics: To further&#xD;
      characterize the ability of the SVS device to soothe infants with NOWS, we will utilize novel&#xD;
      technology developed and patented by Dr. Ariana Anderson at UCLA called the ChatterBaby. Her&#xD;
      work is based on the known association of abnormal cry with abnormal central nervous system&#xD;
      development or disease. A more recent version of the ChatterBaby cry detection and cry&#xD;
      translation algorithms will be used for this study. These algorithms are trained against&#xD;
      hours of non-cry data, including NICU ambient sound, to robustly identify crying periods by&#xD;
      automation. The cry during three primary states (fussy, hungry, pain) will be quantified and&#xD;
      analyzed between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: Demonstrate the safety of the SVS hospital bassinet for infants with NOWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Hypothesis: The device will meet non-clinical safety standards required for FDA clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, non-clinical studies (including electrical, thermal safety, biocompatibility,&#xD;
      and electromagnetic compatibility) will be completed to verify the device meets or exceeds&#xD;
      safety requirements for FDA clearance. Sampling before and after clinical use, as well as&#xD;
      durability testing will be performed to ensure that the devices deliver the specified&#xD;
      vibration over time. Prapela has prepared a data development plan (DDP) that aligns with the&#xD;
      proposed measures to mitigate the identified risks to health of the Prapela® SVS Hospital&#xD;
      Bassinet Pad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #3: Assess the acceptability of the SVS mattress to infants' mothers and nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The Prapela SVS device will be accepted and valued by both nursing caregivers and&#xD;
      parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A questionnaire will be administered at the end of the experimental period to both the&#xD;
      nursing staff present on the final shift of the period and to the mother, or other care-giver&#xD;
      if mother not able to be present.&#xD;
