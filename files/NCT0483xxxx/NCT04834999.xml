      This study evaluates the cultural and linguistic sensitivity and psychometric properties of a&#xD;
      set of four adapted measurement instruments essential to determining the efficacy of&#xD;
      group-psychoeducation for patients with bipolar disorder in Rwanda, and one screening tool&#xD;
      for bipolar disorder. The four well-known instruments are; The Young Mania Rating Scale&#xD;
      (YMRS), The Medical Adherence Scale (MARS), The Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale-9&#xD;
      (ISMI-9), and the Mood disorder Questionnaire (MDQ). Each instrument will be culturally&#xD;
      adapted and validated using a forward-backward translation, consensus conference, and&#xD;
      cognitive interviews.&#xD;

      In the present study, our aim is to translate, culturally adapt and validate four used scales&#xD;
      for use in patients with bipolar disorder. The four scales are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Medical Adherence Scale (MARS), used to assess beliefs and barriers to medication&#xD;
           adherence. The scale has 10-items, a total scores on the MARS may range between 0 and&#xD;
           10, with a higher score indicating better medication adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Inventory - 9-item Version (ISMI-9) used to assess&#xD;
           self-stigma. The scale consists of nine questions evaluated on a four-point Likert scale&#xD;
           from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree). The resulting score should range from&#xD;
           1 to 4. A score ranging between 1.00-2.50: does not report high internalized stigma vs.&#xD;
           a score ranging between 2.51-4.00: indicating high internalized stigma&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) is a clinical interview scale to assess the severity&#xD;
           of manic states and has 11-items.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The Mood Disorder Questionnaire, is a self-reported screening instrument used for&#xD;
           identifying persons likely to have bipolar disorder. The instrument comprising a list of&#xD;
           13 hypomanic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The translation and adaptation process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One a nonprofessional translator, bilingual and knowledgeable about mental health care. The&#xD;
      second is a translator with no particular knowledge about mental health healthcare. Following&#xD;
      the forward translations, a meeting will be held to generate an agreed version. Next, two&#xD;
      professional, bilingual, native English speakers back-translated the synthesized version to&#xD;
      English. After that, an expert meeting will be held with all translators and five clinicians.&#xD;
      Item by item, all versions, and back translations will be discussed to agree on an optimal&#xD;
      pre-version for semantic and conceptual equivalence between the original English and the&#xD;
      Kinyarwanda version. After that, the tools will be validated among 500 participants.&#xD;
