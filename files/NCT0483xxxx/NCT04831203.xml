  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related chronic diseases including dementia, type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) become more prevalent and of increasing societal concern. Common&#xD;
      denominators of these co-morbidities are insulin-resistance and impaired vascular function.&#xD;
      Animal and short-term human studies now suggest that NWT-03 - an egg-protein hydrolysate -&#xD;
      improves insulin-sensitivity and peripheral vascular function, which are risk markers for the&#xD;
      development of T2DM and CVD. Insulin-resistance is also associated with cognitive decline,&#xD;
      while impaired brain vascular function is an important event preceding the development of&#xD;
      impaired cognitive performance. The investigators have already shown in a shorter-term trial&#xD;
      (12 weeks) beneficial effects of a daily dose of 5.0 g of NWT-03 on cognitive performance.&#xD;
      However, underlying mechanisms have not yet been addressed, while the long-term effects&#xD;
      remain unknown. Thus, the investigators now hypothesize that NWT-03 beneficially affects&#xD;
      cognitive performance and brain vascular function following long-term daily intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this trial are to evaluate in overweight or obese adults (aged&#xD;
      60-75) with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) the effects of a 36-weeks NWT-03 intervention&#xD;
      on (1) cognitive performance using a neurophysiological test battery, and (2) cerebral blood&#xD;
      flow, as quantified by the current non-invasive gold standard magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) perfusion method Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL). Secondary study objectives are to&#xD;
      examine effects on insulin-sensitivity and peripheral vascular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention study will have a randomized, controlled, parallel design. The total study&#xD;
      duration will be 36 weeks. Forty-four older adults (aged 60-75 years) with a Body Mass Index&#xD;
      (BMI) between 25-35 kg/m2 (overweight or obese) and subjective cognitive decline (SCD), as&#xD;
      assessed with the cognitive failure questionnaire, will participate. These study individuals&#xD;
      are known to be at increased risk of cognitive impairment, allowing for improvement by the&#xD;
      intervention. During the study, subjects will receive daily (in the morning) 5.0 g NWT-03 or&#xD;
      placebo powders for 36 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the aging population, the number of people with cognitive impairment will have doubled&#xD;
      by the year 2035. Also, the number of individuals with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) will have increased substantially. Common denominators of these&#xD;
      age-related co-morbidities in humans are insulin-resistance and an impaired vascular&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newtricious (NWT)-03 is a novel dietary egg-protein hydrolysate that has proven benefits on&#xD;
      glucose and insulin metabolism, as the investigators have recently shown in overweight or&#xD;
      obese individuals with T2DM or impaired glucose tolerance. Furthermore, peripheral vascular&#xD;
      function was improved. The potential explanation of these effects may arise from the finding&#xD;
      that NWT-03 blocks the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV (7) - a pharmaceutical target for&#xD;
      the treatment of T2DM and CVD - that beneficially affects insulin metabolism. Compared to the&#xD;
      wealth of knowledge about the impact of insulin-sensitivity and peripheral vascular function&#xD;
      on the risk of T2DM and CVD, emerging evidence also indicates that these risk markers affect&#xD;
      cognitive performance. This is of great interest, since the brain is an insulin sensitive&#xD;
      organ and insulin-resistance is associated with cognitive decline, while impaired brain&#xD;
      vascular function is a key pathophysiological event preceding the development of an impaired&#xD;
      cognitive performance. A study in mice also showed effects of NWT-03 on neuro-inflammation&#xD;
      and oxidative stress in the brain. In fact, a decreased expression of TNF-Î± and improved&#xD;
      expression of enzymes involved in anti-oxidative processes were observed. The investigators&#xD;
      have also shown in a similar - but shorter-term (12 weeks) - trial beneficial effects of&#xD;
      NWT-03 on executive function, as the latency of response was reduced (manuscripts in&#xD;
      preparation). In addition, the hen egg-white hydrolysate (i.e. LumiVida) also improved&#xD;
      reaction time in middle-aged women. Underlying mechanisms of these hydrolysates on cognitive&#xD;
      performance were however not addressed. In our review the investigators summarized the impact&#xD;
      of dietary factors and exercise on brain vascular function in adults and discussed the&#xD;
      relation between these effects with changes in cognitive performance. It was concluded that&#xD;
      studies on the longer-term effects of lifestyle factors, including diet and physical&#xD;
      exercise, can improve brain vascular function, which may contribute to the beneficial effects&#xD;
      observed on cognitive performance. In addition, longer-term effects remain unknown and only a&#xD;
      limited number of parameters related to cognitive performance were studied. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to perform a long-term placebo-controlled double blind intervention&#xD;
      study including functional outcome parameters and study in vivo effects of NWT-03 on brain&#xD;
      vascular function, which is a potential target to prevent or slow-down cognitive impairments,&#xD;
      and improve cognitive performance. Focus will be on older adults (aged 60-75 years) with a&#xD;
      Body Mass Index (BMI) between 25-35 kg/m2 (overweight or obese) and subjective cognitive&#xD;
      decline (SCD), as assessed with the cognitive failure questionnaire. These individuals are&#xD;
      known to be at increased risk of cognitive impairment, allowing for improvement by the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study endpoints are effects on insulin-sensitivity and peripheral vascular&#xD;
      function, which are risk markers that may affect cognitive performance. Finally, the&#xD;
      investigators will focus on other potential mechanisms underlying effects on brain function&#xD;
      (i.e. ambulatory blood pressure, structural brain status, humoral factors, and the more&#xD;
      conventional cardiometabolic risk markers) and other perceivable benefits, including general&#xD;
      well-being (quality of life, sleep characteristics and mood) and physical fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects will be investigated using innovative and emerging non-invasive brain magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI)-perfusion methods, while focusing on whole brain and&#xD;
      cognitive-control brain areas plus cognitive performance tests. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators have reviewed that cerebral blood flow in gray matter is a sensitive and&#xD;
      straightforward marker of brain vascular function, which correlates with cognitive&#xD;
      performance. Of note, lower cerebral blood flow is associated with accelerated cognitive&#xD;
      decline and increased risk of dementia in the general population based on results of the&#xD;
      Rotterdam prospective cohort study. Cerebral blood flow changes will be quantified on a&#xD;
      Siemens 3 Tesla Magnetom Prisma Fit scanner at the Scannexus research facilities by the&#xD;
      non-invasive gold standard approach: the MRI perfusion method pseudo-continuous Arterial Spin&#xD;
      Labeling.Cognitive performance will be assessed using CANTAB (i.e. Cambridge&#xD;
      Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery). These validated assessments for state-of-the-art&#xD;
      cognitive testing focus on the main cognitive domains (i.e. executive function, attention and&#xD;
      memory). Brain vascular function will be investigated using innovative and emerging&#xD;
      non-invasive brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-perfusion methods, while focusing on&#xD;
      whole brain and cognitive-control brain areas plus cognitive performance tests. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the investigators have reviewed that cerebral blood flow in gray matter is a sensitive and&#xD;
      straightforward marker of brain vascular function, which correlates with cognitive&#xD;
      performance. Of note, lower cerebral blood flow is associated with accelerated cognitive&#xD;
      decline and increased risk of dementia in the general population based on results of the&#xD;
      Rotterdam prospective cohort study. Cerebral blood flow changes will be quantified on a&#xD;

      Labeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the background information given in the previous paragraph, the following&#xD;
      research questions are formulated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the effects in older adults with a BMI between 25-35 kg/m2 and SCD of a 36-weeks&#xD;
      NWT-03 intervention on (i) cognitive performance using a neurophysiological test battery, and&#xD;
      (ii) cerebral blood flow, as quantified by the MRI-perfusion method Arterial Spin Labelling?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major null hypotheses, H0:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A 36-weeks NWT-03 intervention does not significantly affect cognitive performance in&#xD;
           older adults with a BMI between 25-35 kg/m2 and SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A 36-weeks NWT-03 intervention does not significantly affect cerebral blood flow, as&#xD;
           assessed by Arterial Spin Labelling, in older adults with a BMI between 25-35 kg/m2 and&#xD;
           SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major alternate hypotheses, Ha:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A 36-weeks NWT-03 intervention significantly affects cognitive performance in older&#xD;
           adults with a BMI between 25-35 kg/m2 and SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A 36-weeks NWT-03 intervention significantly affects cerebral blood flow, as assessed by&#xD;
           Arterial Spin Labelling, in older adults with a BMI between 25-35 kg/m2 and SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the effects in older adults with SCD of a 36-weeks NWT-03 intervention on insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and peripheral vascular function, which are risk markers for T2DM and CVD?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the effects in older adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) of a 36-weeks&#xD;
      NWT-03 intervention on;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mechanisms underlying effects on brain function, including structural brain status,&#xD;
           humoral factors, and the more conventional cardiometabolic risk markers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  perceivable (consumer) benefits, including physical fitness and general well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a parallel design will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before screening, subjects will be informed about the procedures and informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained. Following screening, study participants that fulfill all inclusion criteria and are&#xD;
      willing to participate will be asked to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be informed about their screening results, including anthropometric measures&#xD;
      (weight, length, body mass index), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), serum&#xD;
      total cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrations, and plasma glucose concentrations. When&#xD;
      treatment with drugs or lifestyle interventions is indicated according to the Standards of&#xD;
      the Dutch general practitioners' community (NHG), subjects will be advised to consult their&#xD;
      general practitioner. Study results obtained during the intervention trial (i.e. brain&#xD;
      vascular function) will be reported in a descriptive way at a group level, for example:&#xD;
      &quot;brain vascular function is improved&quot;. because no accepted normal ranges exist for these&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the days before blood sampling, adults are asked not to perform any strenuous physical&#xD;
      exercise or to consume alcoholic beverages. On the morning of blood sampling - after a&#xD;
      12-hour overnight fast (from 8.00 PM) - study subjects are only allowed to drink a glass of&#xD;
      water. Subjects are also asked not to change their habitual diet during the study. Finally,&#xD;
      subjects are asked to come to the Metabolic Research Unit (MRUM) by public transport or car&#xD;
      (and not by foot or bike) to standardize research measurements as much as possible&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and after 18 weeks, anthropometric measurements will be performed, and a fasting&#xD;
      blood sample will be drawn. At baseline and after 36 weeks, subjects have to attend two times&#xD;
      the research facilities to perform the follow-up measurements: once for the &quot;Day A&quot;&#xD;
      measurements and once for the &quot;Day B&quot; measurements. During these tests, study participants&#xD;
      have to stay at the university and are not allowed to eat. These test days will take place&#xD;
      with an interval of three days.&#xD;
