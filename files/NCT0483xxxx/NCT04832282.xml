  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial assessing the feasibility of the Napoleon device for measuring the&#xD;
      gastrojejunal anastomosis (GJA). The study population is Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)&#xD;
      patients with weight regain undergoing an endoscopy at Bellevue Hospital Center or Brigham&#xD;
      and Women's Hospital. investigators aim for a sample size of up to 100 cases. For each case,&#xD;
      endoscopists will first visually estimate the diameter of the GJA by comparing its size to&#xD;
      the upper endoscope. Then, they will measure the GJA with Napoleon. Investigators will&#xD;
      compare the GJA measurements performed using visual estimation and Napoleon. A survey will be&#xD;
      given to all endoscopists to assess the level of ease using Napoleon.&#xD;

    <description>The Micro-Tech Endoscopic Measurement Device named Napoleon is a small catheter with a 30mm ruler calibrated at 1mm intervals with 5mm demarcations. It is classified as a Class 1, 510(k) exempt device by the FDA. The device was originally intended to measure polyps. However, it is used off-label in this study and is considered investigational.</description>
